Lionheart


 CHEAT MODE:

 During play crouch down and pause the game. Now while still crouched
 down press [Ctrl] and the [Help] key until the screen shakes.
 You'll now receive infinite lives and you can jump to any level by
 pressing [F1] to [F10] and [1] to [5]. It also enables these keys:

      [D] - Die.
      [S] - Play sample (use cursor keys).
      [M] - Toggle sound.
   [Ctrl] - Toggle fly mode (control with mouse).
   [Help] - Toggle 1 and 2 button joystick.
 [Return] - Shake ground.


 PLAYING TIPS:

 The best way of killing things, wherever possible, is the battle strike.
 You know, the aerial move where you push the joystick up, press fire,
 then pull the joystick down. Apart from looking rock hard (and thus
 impressing any of your friends who are watching) it also takes more hit
 points off the baddies and kills them quicker.
 There are platforms in the game that you can make swing higher by the
 following method: Move the joystick downward when the platform is moving
 downward. Release it immediately when it goes up. If the platform has a
 very low altitude, use very short joystick strokes to get it moving again.

 Hidden Bonus Areas
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you check out all the following hidden bonuses you should have
 enough lives and energy to complete the game without any problems.
 Because you'll probably be able to find a few of them by yourself,
 only the less obvious and most well-hidden ones are described here:

 Level 1
 ~~~~~~~
 On the first 60 degree slide (the ones so steep that you can't go up
 again) you can get onto a leaf if you jump in time. From there you can
 reach the leaf with the two crystals on it. Jump up even further to the
 highest leaf, jump straight up into the air and wait approximately 10
 seconds. After a while a beetle appears which you can jump on to take
 you up to a massive bonus area which contains loads of energy crystals
 and two extra lives.
 Just in front of the exit of the first level there is a chasm which you
 are supposed to jump over. Let yourself fall down there and steer to the
 right (to the left in Hard mode). Here you'll be able to access another
 bonus area.

 Level 2
 ~~~~~~~
 This isn't hard to get through as long as you're careful.
 The giant insect can be done away with easy enough. Crouch down right
 next to it, and when the spider is launched from its hide take a sweep
 kick at it to finish it off, then immediately jump up and do an overhead
 swipe on the giant insect's head (by pushing the joystick up and keeping
 the fire button pressed). Repeat this move and it should be finished off.
 The spiders on the floor can be dispensed with using crouching side kicks
 or the battle strike, while the ones on the roof need to be finished off
 with jumping upper swipes. Treat the final insect just like the first and
 you'll be sorted.

 Level 3 (Second Swamp Level)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 At the beginning of the level there is a 30 degree slope which leads to a
 60 degree slide. Go back to the clump of thorns, run down the 30 degree
 slope to get as much speed as possible and make a wide jump to the right
 from the edge of the platform at the top of the 60 degree slide.
 You should land on a leaf again. From here you can jump further and reach
 stacks of bonuses to the right, after destroying a few nasties.
 Note that some of the destructible plants are in the floor in this level
 and also in the fifth level. Remove the plants with the downward fighting
 jump (the battle strike) and let yourself fall down into some minor bonus
 caves.

 Level 5 (Third Swamp Level)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Here you are able to get the second sword before you need to.
 At the start you're standing in front of the exit of the second spider
 cave. Go to the left until you appear to have reached the end of this
 platform, and can see only water to the left. Take a run and jump to the
 left now. Before you can fall into the water, a leaf will appear right
 under your feet. Phew! Make another one of these suicide jumps to the
 left. Another leaf appears. From here you can reach a small cave
 containing an extra life and the stronger sword.

 Level 6 (First Ancient City Level)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 There are plenty of one-ups (extra lives) at the first tower that you
 encounter (to the right after the start of the level). Kill the swarm
 of insects. Note the row of steadily hovering insects to the right.
 By using the downward fighting jump several times, you can use the
 insects as jump pads to get to the right. Valdyn can climb up the golden
 roofs of the towers. Try to get on the roofs as often as possible, as
 many of them (surprise, surprise) give access to bonuses.

 Level 7 (Second Ancient City Level)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 After the beginning of this level there's a long 45 degree slope.
 Use it to get up speed and perform a huge leap to the right at the end of
 the slope. Aha! Further to the right you encounter your first swinging
 platform, which is already swinging. Use it to get higher and higher
 until you can reach the tiny platform above. The third sword waits for
 you there. A few screens to the right (after those nasty fire chains)
 there is a tower with a fire chain at the bottom. Get to the right edge
 of the platform and let yourself fall down to the right.
 Surprise! A swimming platform. Get the one-ups and stuff from here and
 you're doing well. Secret Level: The strongest sword can be found here,
 again before you need it. There's a place in this level where you have
 to handle moving spikes with a stone-ball thrower just behind them.
 Instead of climbing up to avoid the danger, try to get past the
 generator and let yourself fall down to the right. Use the hovering ghost
 as a jump-pad just as you did with the insects in level six and get it.
