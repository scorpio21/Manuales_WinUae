Licence To Kill


 CHEAT: 

 Use <F8> as a level skipper.
 
 PLAYING TIPS:

 Level 1
 ~~~~~~~
 Destroy the escaping jeep as soon as possible. To do this stay in line
 with it and point the nose down by accelerating. Remember to stay on the
 road, otherwise Sanchez's men will get you.

 Level 2
 ~~~~~~~
 Stay away from the open door by taking cover close to the walls.
 Running towards the enemy can make them run away, but dosen't get rid of
 them altogether. Shooting the oil drums conserves bullets, but keep well
 back, because they destroy everything in their vicinity.

 Level 3
 ~~~~~~~
 To grab the tail of Sanchez's plane, keep away from the clouds and press
 the fire button to attach the tow cable. Don't do this until Bond is
 close enough, but make sure you fire in advance to allow reaction time.

 Level 4
 ~~~~~~~
 Stay under water when boats and snipers are around. Keep a full tank of
 oxygen and don't surface unless divers appear. Try to get a harpoon gun
 by stabbing one of the divers, and save it for the arrival of the
 seaplane, fire the harpoon at it and climb up the cable.

 Level 5
 ~~~~~~~
 When you're inside the truck, you'll be under attack from other vehicles.
 Trucks can be destroyed by ramming them repeatadly into the roadside.
 After a little of this treatment, the trailer is released. leaving the
 rig to do the damage, and this must be knocked out too.
 Watch out for jeeps, because they carry missiles. Avoid their firepower
 by staying out of line, and destroy them by driving over them.
