 CHEAT MODE:

 Firstly, enter player one and player two's name in as 'BAKTOTHEFISH'.
 This will let you qualify for every race no matter where you finish.

 The following cheats must be entered in as user defined course codes.

 Highlight the single course icon, now enter 'GAMESMAST-00' as a code
 and it will then turn to "GAMESMASTER". This is to play the special
 GamesMaster course as seen on TV.

 Alternatively, entering 'CU AMIGA -00' as a code will load up a sub
 game by the name of POD. Very good it is too.
 As an added bonus, on the title screen of POD type in 'BIGCOUNTRY'
 followed by any level number from 01 to 99. Now when you start the
 game you will skip straight to that level.

 Note, if at some point the screen turns red after entering any of the
 above cheat codes then simply swap disks and hit the fire button.
