HINTS:- If the goalkeeper from the other team holds the ball in the 7-meter-
        area, then do not go to him and try to shot a goal, as you will get
        a red card and will get disqualified from the playfield!
        Do not try to hack the same person 2 times at the same time, some
        pixels away again in his legs, as you maybe get a yellow and some-
        times also a red card!
