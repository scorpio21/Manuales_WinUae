Liberation


 TIPS:

 I'm not exactly sure if any of the following are official cheats
 or just plain bugs. Either way they do work so why not try them.

 This first tip simply allows you to duplicate items.
 Just follow these simple steps:

 1. First you need to find a power point and stand in front of it.
 2. Select any item from your inventory you wish to duplicate.
 3. Drop it onto the floor so that the name of it appears in the
    text window.
 4. Engage the power point so the lightening bolts are touching you.
 5. Use the Look Right, Look Left command to move the view screen so
    that it is at an angle.
 6. Move the cursor about until you see the 'pick up' icon and then
    click as many times as you want. The more you click, the more
    you'll get.
 7. Look back to Normal View.
 8. When you've finished charging, just pick up the doubles!
    This is very useful for making money and guns.


 This tip allows you to jump through the various missions:

 On mission one, just before you rescue the first captive (at 8 Sasgom
 Boulevard, Gamma Zone) save the game. Now as soon as you have rescued
 him and moved onto mission two, reload your saved game and rescue the
 captive again. This time rather than going to mission two, you'll go
 to mission three. If you reload your original saved game and do it
 again, you'll go onto mission four. You can keep this up until you
 get to the mission you actually want to play.

 Also, if you hang onto the Delta Crystal after completing the first
 mission, you can use it to find the other captives on all the other
 missions without having to hunt around for clues.

 Have two credit cards handy and if you find something you can't afford,
 give the man your credit card anyway and he should say something like:
 "That's not enough. You got another?". Give him your other credit card
 and he will give you the item free if you have over 50 credits on the
 second credit card.
