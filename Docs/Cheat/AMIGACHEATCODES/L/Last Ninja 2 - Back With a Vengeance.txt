Last Ninja 2


 WALK-THROUGH:

 Level 1 - The Park
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 You start off in a sort of open air theatre, so go through the curtain
 and punch the flashing yellow box to reveal a trap door on the open air
 theatre. Drop through the trap door and you will be under the theatre
 where you should find a key (in the bottom left corner - take it!).
 You must now find the nunchack's. They are in two parts, both parts are
 in the two women's toilets!. Pick up the hamburger from the hamburger
 stand and use it to top up your energy. There are some shurikens in a
 box between two benches on the screen before the juggler.
 To get past the juggler just keep somersaulting. Climb up the side of
 the walls on the screen after the juggler then go to the right.
 Jump over the gaps and then collect the staff. Remember when climbing
 down the walls to walk backwards towards the wall! Collect the map after
 climbing down the wall (it's on the floor).
 Go to screen with the gate on and open the gate with key you collected
 earlier. On the next screen you appear on their should be a river with
 a boat floating down it. Jump onto the boat then off the boat onto the
 other side of the river. On the next screen should be a swarm of killer
 bees. Avoid these and make your way to the top right hand corner.
 Jump over the little bit of water, this will take you onto a island.
 Use you staff to push the boat - it will now start to make its way down
 the river. Go back to killer bees screen and take the other exit (top
 left). You will now be on the final screen of this level. Jump onto the
 boat that you set in motion, then again jump onto the other side of the
 river. Then go up the path you see to finish this level.

 Level 2 - The Streets
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Make your way to the workman's hut and pick up the manhole key that is
 inside. Warning! when crossing the roads make sure the lights are in
 your favour. If their not you will get run over. When you enter the
 screen with the flashing door, kill the baddie and kick down the door.
 Enter the martial arts shop, beat up the shopkeeper and collect the
 sword from the wall. Make your way To the drunk lying by the roadside
 and take the bottle from him. Take the hotdog from the hotdog stand to
 increase your energy. Exit this level by using the manhole key to open
 the manhole (obvious or what?!). Then drop down the hole and the level
 is finished.

 Level 3 - The Sewers
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Walk through the first three rooms, then take the right hand exit and
 collect the key. Go back into the last room and jump the gap.
 On the next screen, slowly walk forward until you see a spider fall.
 Quickly follow it and exit the screen. On the next screen, use the key
 to open the grate and drop down. Whatever you do, dont go through the
 blue door. When you come to a set of three doors, take the middle one,
 then follow the path until you come to some more doors. This time take
 the farthest from you. On the next screen, don't go through any of the
 doors or you'll die. Instead, jump the rats and exit via the path.
 Keep going until you find some more doors and go through the door
 nearest to you. On the next screen, kill the man then, holding the
 bottle (taken from drunk on level 2), walk into the torch on the wall
 until the top of the bottle turns red. Now kill the alligator by
 throwing the bottle at it and go through the door to finish the level.

 Level 4 - The Basement
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Go through the maze of boxes on the right of the start screen and then
 empty your hands and go to the next screen. Climb up the ladder to the
 catwalk and left. Kill the bloke then collect the credit card.
 Now make your way to the other far end of the catwalk, then go through
 the door. Pick up the food. Once you've collected the food you can go
 back to the ladder and back onto the floor. Now take the right hand exit
 and follow the path until you get to the rail cars. Wait for one to pass
 you and then somersault over the lines. Keep going along this path and
 you should come to some more rail lines.
 Once again jump over the lines. Follow the path round until you reach a
 room filled with bottles. Take the bottom left exit, kill the man on the
 next screen, then on the following screen you should find a flashing
 white object in a box. Hold the food and collect the box - this poisons
 it!. Go back to the bottle room, take the exit on the right and you
 should be face to face with a hungry panther. Hold the food chicken and
 walk forward slowly until it sits up. Take one more step forward and use
 the pick up method to lure the panther towards you. It will then take
 the chicken, eat it then die. Go past the dead panther to the next
 screen and use the credit card on the box near the lift to enter it and
 go up in it.

 Level 5 - The Office
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Leave the first screen and go through the blue door and touch the
 computer in the office. The computer will give you a number.
 Write this number down if you cant remember it. Go back out and follow
 the path down and around to a screen with two pictures on it.
 Go through the top one and walk over to the desk near the desk near the
 pictures. Stand at the bottom and use the pick up movement to touch the
 button on the table, thus opening a secret door. Climb the ladder on the
 next screen to reach the second floor of the offices, then go out through
 the door. Go through to a room with a fan in it, stand close to the wall
 and face backwards. Keep nudging the ninja backwards until you reach the
 back wall then go to the grate and use pick up again to open it.
 Go out onto the ledge. Follow the ledge around and go up the ladder.
 Kill the next man you see then put away all your weapons. When you get
 to the last screen of this level you will see KUNITOKI making his escape
 in a helicopter. Stand at the top right hand corner of the screen and
 when the helicopter leaves, somersault off the building and onto it's
 landing skid. The helicopter will now carry you to the next level.

 Level 6 - The Mansion
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This level starts with you still hanging onto the helicopter, so to get
 off without killing yourself, pull down on the joystick when it flys
 past the turret and you should drop down safely. Somersault forward,
 landing in line with the turret on the left, then somersault again to
 land on it. Now gently nudge left off the turret and walk along the strip
 until you reach the window. Face the window and somersault again to land
 inside the mansion. Walk down the corridor into the next room,go through
 the big door and collect the rope so that you can go down the dumb waiter.
 Turn off the alarm then walk behind the plant where you should find an
 entrance. Punch the switches on the wall to switch on the lights in the
 maze which is on the next screen. Get yourself through the maze and you
 should find a steam engine. Redirect the steam by touching the right
 hand switch on the boiler and you can walk through the door to the last
 part of the game...

 Level 7 - The Final Battle
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Kill the gaurd in the first screen, then walk through to the room with
 the star shape on the floor. Go over to the tapestry on the wall and
 lift it up to reveal a safe. Unlock the safe with the combination from
 the computer in the office and take out the orb. Kunitoki will now enter
 the room and youve got to kill him so that he falls somewhere inside the
 star on the floor. Before he comes back to life, light the candles on
 the points of the star and put the orb back in the safe to finish the
 game.
