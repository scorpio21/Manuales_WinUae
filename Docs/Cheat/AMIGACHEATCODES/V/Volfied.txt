Get a score of exactly 10 points and press 'ESC' or the key right
under 'ESC'.  Now go to the difficulty setting and scroll through the
options.  You will notice a new option (CHEAT).  You can now start on
any level with infinite lives.  Your shields will also last longer and
the little enemies can't kill you when they run into your path.
