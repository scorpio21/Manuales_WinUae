VOODOO NIGHTMARE

Its alway's safer to move around at night, as that's when the creatures
sleep.  When day breaks, hit the pause key.  Night will still fall but
because the game's paused nothing moves.  As soon as the sky darkens unpause
and carry on exploring.

     The game VOODOO NIGHTMARE (Released in December 1990) was dismissed by
game collectors and players as a frustrating and light weight game of little
consequence. Actually the arcade style adventure game is quite complex and
diabolical in construction. The problem is that the player can't explore the
jungle because he becomes immediately trapped in the first of the four
temples, the snake temple. It is a labyrinth of interconnected rooms,
populated by dangerous spiders. The task is to collect all the temple's gems
and escape. But until you do certain tasks within the temple, doors between 
the passages remain sealed and one never gets very far in the game. The other
reason that some dislike the game is that controls are too sensitive in this
isometric view game. Moves are always made diagonally and mistakes cost 
lives. Fortunately there is a game save (only two on a disk but you could
move these to other disks to store more).
     
GAME PLAY:

     Our hero Boots Barker, who was thrown out of a plane, parachuted safely
into the African jungle below. He was knocked unconcious on landing and when
he awoke found to his horror that he was encased in a huge Voodoo Mask that 
extended from waist to head. It wouldn't come off. As he soon found out, an
evil witch doctor who ruled the jungle was responsible. The doctor resides
in an evil fortress which is magically protected so you can't enter. But you
can get to him by collecting eight magical pins and sticking them into a
voodoo doll of the doctor's likeness. Five of the pins are in the temples 
devoted to various animal gods, and the remaining three can be earned by 
completing three tasks; returning the missing lion cub to its mother is the 
first. We don't know the other tasks at this time.
     As you wander around the jungle you will be attacked by hordes of
creepy-crawlies that will sap your strength until you eventually kill them.
This can be done with your pair of boots that you are initially wearing.
The witch doctor also owns a chain of stores scattered throughout the
jungle. They are only open in the daytime (creatures sleep at night). You 
can use your acquired jewels and bananas to buy items like a map 
( sold in 4 parts), machete for hacking through growth, a knife useful for 
killing nasties, extra lives, a first aid kit, scrolls with hints, and 
several other items. Each store carries different items so you need to visit
many stores. You will need to experiment to find the uses of some of your
purchased items.
     Pressing the space bar accesses your inventory screen. You can select 
the item to use with the joystick. While you can jump on nasties to kill
them, it is often less dangerous to switch to a knife to kill them from a
distance. But remember you can jump pits unless you are wearing your boots.
And remember that when you are down to your last life it is best to activate
your extra life before you die. It is also best to save the game at crucial
times. For example, the Eagle temple has several traps like the Indiana Jones
style rolling rock that is tripped when you collect a gem down a long 
passageway. Since several pasageway walls are movable, an escape must be
planned or you will be crushed by the rock. Besides you must be quick.
     Game saves and loads can be tripped by pressing the space bar and 
bringing up a menu. Press F1 to load a previously saved game, or F2 to save
your current game. It asks for a file name. Two saves fit on the game disk,
and I believe you can put in a blank formatted disk into the internal drive
and it will save to it. Remember to replace the game disk since it needs it
for various functions.
     You can earn extra money and health points by visiting the casino (open
only at night). You play the slot machine. Another profitable method is to
visit the banana grove on an island and collect bananas.


SPIDER TEMPLE

     This is the easiest temple. The task is to collect 6 blue gems and 69
red gems. Some of the gems in a room are partially hidden or are difficult
to reach and often require using teleporters to transport to differnt 
sections of the room. A gem symbol at the bottom right of the screen on the
score line indicates whether any gems remain in a room. It vanishes when
there are none. Some of the exits to a room are initially blocked when
entering, but killing a creature, moving a pillar, or collecting all the
gems will open the door. You will hear a beep sound when a door is opened. 
In the harder levels the door opened may not be in the same room.
     The following solution refers to the included map of the Spider Temple.
The rooms are numbered so you should refer to the map often. Our solution is
not set in concrete and the order that we collected all its jewels can be
varied by the reader. In fact, you would probably have more fun by playing
the game only with the map in hand and figuring out how to collect all the
gems by yourself. However, you might want to look at how to exit the last
room or you might never escape the temple. You can't leave the temple until
you find the required number of diamonds. 

     The game begins in Rm #1. Exit right to Rm #2 (Kill spider), exit top
to Rm #3 (use transporters to get gems), exit bottom to Rm #2 exit left
to Rm #1 to Rm #6 to Rm #7 (kill spider), exit right to Rm #8 (kill spider)
exit right to Rm 3 (use transporters, kill spider, get gems; the bottom 
transporter in center of the room eventually takes you to the right side of 
room), exit top to Rm #5 (this room has a white flame), exit bottom to Rm #4
(kill spider). This is another large split room. The gems are on the other 
side. Exit top to Rm #5, exit left to Rm #3 (big transporter room; collect 
gems). Exit left to Rm #8, exit left to Rm #7 (white flame room), exit 
bottom to Rm #6, exit right to Rm #1, exit right to Rm #2, exit right
to Rm #4 ( now at bottom of split room; get gems).
     Now we need to work our way to the left side of the temple. Exit left
to Rm #2, exit left to Rm #1, exit left to Rm #6, exit top to Rm #7, exit
left to Rm #9 (big room; The transporter 4th from top gets you to the gem 
field; kill spider; note there is a transporter hidden in the rocks). Exit
top to Rm #10 (kill spider), exit top to Rm #11, exit top to Rm #12 (kill 
spider), exit top to Rm #13 (big split room, collect one blue diamond), exit
down to Rm #12, exit right to Rm #16 (Large transporter room, teleport 
across, push pillar off hidden transporter, the bottom right transporter
gets you to bottom exit) to Rm #28 (kill spider). This is a gate room. If
you don't get blue diamond, you can't cross over to the right side of the
temple.
     Exit up to Rm #16 (Use transporter to get to top area, collect gems and
use transporter to exit left to Rm #12. At this point you should have 4 blue
diamonds and 38 red rubies. Exit down to Rm #11 then exit right to Rm #28.
You are in the bottom half of the room. Exit bottom rt to Rm #29, then exit
up to Rm #17 which is another split room. (kill spider) Exit up to Rm #15,
(kill spider) then exit left to Rm #14, then left again to Rm #13. You are
now in the top part of this split room (collect gems) then exit right to
Rm #14, right again to Rm #15, exit right to Rm #18 which has blue flame
pots (kill spider). Exit bottom to Rm #20 (kill spider & collect gems). This
room has many pots, some with red flames. Exit right to Rm #21, exit bottom
to Rm #22 (kill spider which opens left door), exit left to Rm #23, left
again to Rm #31 (kill spider) then exit top to Rm #32 (Food Room, kill 
spider). Exit bottom to Rm #31, then down again to Rm #30, exit left to 
Rm #26 (kill spider). The other side of this split room is the gateway to 
the exit. Exit right to Rm #30, then top to Rm #31, right to Rm #23, right
again to Rm #22, exit top to Rm #21, finally exit left to Rm #20. Work way
down through the rock maze to bottom transporter; get gems at top and make
sure you find partially hidden blue diamond. Exit left to Rm #17 (collect
gems in the upper part of the room - note that detailed pillars are movable).
     We are now on the home stretch and the easy part. Exit right to Rm #20,
then exit top to Rm #18, then right to Rm #19 (get red gems in room with many
blue fire pots). Exit left to Rm #18, left again to Rm #15, down to Rm #17,
down again to Rm #29, then left to Rm #28. Exit left to Rm #11, then bottom
to Rm #10, then down to Rm #9 (transporter room). Exit right to Rm #7, exit
top to Rm #24, exit top again to Rm #25, then right to Rm #26 (pick up blue
diamond. You should now have 6 diamonds and 69 rubies, which are all of them.
Exit top of room to Rm #27 which is the final room. Push pillar towards the
bottom left corner and a door opens to let you out of the temple.

JUNGLE

     After exiting the Spider Temple, you are now able to travel freely in
the jungle. Of course you must be careful of the the snakes and other
creatures that could rob you of a life. You need to travel south to the
nearest store that sells a machette and a mysterious potion. (You don't need
to buy the four map parts from different stores since I've included it in 
this package) To reach the store head down through the trees and be careful
not to fall through the holes on the bridge. The store is only open in the
daytime. Use your gems to pay for the items. Leave the store and recross
the bridge. You can access your machete by pressing the space bar and
selecting it wit the joystick. Work your way to the upper right on the screen
and you can use the machette to hack your way through the trees. Watch out
for natives with blowguns.
     There is a casino (open only at night) near the top of the jungle. You 
can gamble inside on the slot machines. You can win extra lives or money. The
store nearby sells a knife, TNT, and extra lives. The store far below the
casino sells a first aid potion. Another way to earn currency used at the
store is to collect 100 bananas in the banana grove. Sometimes it is 
difficult to locate because you may take the wrong path (see map for 
approximate location). It is across a bridge and you'll have to hack your
way into the grove.
     The first quest is to find the lion cub and return him to his mom. The
cub is hidden in the cub tree near the bottom of the jungle. His mom is close
to the Casino near the top. When you succed, she will give you a pin.
     You now need to find the Snake Temple which is located in the upper-left
hand quadrant inside a hollow tree.


SNAKE TEMPLE 

     You begin in Rm #1 entraped by a circle of thorns. Push one of the 
thorns left to exit the trap. The ones that are movable have a thicker black
line at the base. Collect diamonds. You must jump pits to reach several of 
them. Remember to put on your boots or you will fall into the pits. Switch 
to a knife before leaving the room. Exit top to Rm #2, then right to Rm #3
(kill snake). Exit top to Rm #4. Push pillar to get rubies, then push thorns
to make a path to transporters. Careful! You will almost certainly lose a
life because moving the thorns reveals a pit. Use one of your purchased lives
in your inventory by activating it if you are down to your last life. Put
boots on and jump across pit. Exit right to Rm #5 then exit bottom to Rm #6.
Kill snake at bottom. Hop islands to get to pillar. Push pillar (turns gems
from red to more valuable blue). Do not leave room until you collect gems or
they will change back. Collect gems especially ones partially hidden at top
of room.
     Exit right to Rm #10 (kill snake), exit right to Rm #11. This is a big
split room. Kill the glow worm. Push pillar down to reach transporter, then
transport. Pushing a pillar there turns the gems red. Collect them and 
transport back, exit left to room #10, then left agin to Rm #6. You must hop
islands because you wish to exit bottom which leads to Rm #7. Kill snake.
Exit right to Rm #8 (kill snake, push pillar right), exit right to Rm #9
(kill snake, then work maze until get two diamonds). Jump the trap at the
bottom and exit right to Rm #19 (kill snakes, get saphire, kill black cobra).
Exit top to Rm #18 (kill snake) in this split room. Exit right to Rm #17
(kill snake), top to Rm #16 (collect diamond), then exit left to Rm #15. Push
pillar to open bottom door and exit bottom to Rm #18 (collect ruby in top 
half of split room). Exit top to Rm #15, then right to Rm #16 and down to
Rm #17, left to Rm #18 and left again to Rm #11. Push thorn pillar to go
north and exit to Rm #12 (kill the snake across pit with your knife). 
     Exit right to Rm #13 ( a big room; watch out for two cobras). Push 
thorn clump up the passageway in the middle of the screen past the 
transporter. Kill snake with boots. Transport again and kill second snake.
Work your way to bottom, then jump pit to collect gems. Exit bottom to Rm #14
then right to Rm #15, right to Rm #16, exit bottom to Rm #17, left to Rm #18
down to Rm #19, down again to Rm #20 and down once more to Rm #21. With
shoes on, cross pit and collect diamond (careful - kill snake). In case you
are lost, this room has two bubbling pots and bouncing snake eggs. Exit
bottom to Rm #22, then down again to Rm #23. Exit right to Rm #24 (kill snake
and collect diamonds). Exit top to Rm #25 (kill two snakes and collect 5 
gems). Exit top to Rm #26 (killing snake opens top door) then exit top to
Rm #27 (collect diamonds). Exit left to Rm #31, then exit top to Rm #32 (kill
snake which opens door, collect gems). Exit right to Rm #33 where you need
to hop islands to collect gems.
     Now we are on the home stretch and need to make our way towards the
exit in Rm #34. Exit Rm #33 left to Rm #32, then down to Rm #31, down to
Rm #30, down again to Rm #29 and again to Rm #28. Exit left to Rm #21, up
to Rm #20, up to Rm #19 and up one more time to Rm #18. Exit here left to
Rm #11 where you will need to push the shorn thorn clump to get through to
the top exit that will take you to Rm #12. Jump the pit and exit left side
to Rm #34. Use transporter to get inside and collect diamond. This opens the
top door which leads to the exit in Rm #34. Exit temple to jungle once again.

JUNGLE (2nd Time)

     The next jungle quest is to find the ape. The creature is hidden in a 
tree just below the river. You will have to hack your way through the bushes
using your machette. You will need to be careful when you aproach the hollow
tree from the rear since it is right on the edge of the river and you can 
easily fall here. When you find the ape he will automatically take ten 
bananas and give you a pin.
     If you wish you can cross the bridge to Voodoo Island although it won't
accomplish anything because you need additional pins to give to the voodoo
priest. Be careful - there are warriors there.
     There is one additional quest in the jungle to obtain a final pin. It
probably occurs once you sucessfully exit the Eagle Temple. However, it is
unknown at this time.

     NOW THAT I HAVE TAKEN YOU THIS FAR, SEND ME THE SECOND PART OF SOLVE.
