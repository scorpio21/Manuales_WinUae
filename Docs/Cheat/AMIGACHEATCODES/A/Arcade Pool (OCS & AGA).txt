                               ARCADE POOL
                              -------------

I've got rather a naughty little tip for Arcade Pool in two-player mode.
After your opponent fouls in US pool, grab the cue ball and before you take
your shot, push it in between the two other balls that are close together on
the table so that the cue ball touches both of them. This nudges the balls a
bit and if they are in the right place you could set yourself up a treat, or
ruin your mate's plans. The computer players don't mind but your mate will.

Another cheat for Arcade Pool. It works on any of the play modes but it's
only really useful on Speed Pool. To get as low a time as you like, pot all
of the balls apart from one, then line the last one up on the pocket.
Select save, then New to start with one ball left on 0 minutes and 00 sec-
onds.
