 Press 'QAZWSXEDCRFVTGBYHNUJMIKOL' repeatedly and at some point
 you will skip the current level.
 Surely you didn't borrow some of the game code from Full Contact
 did you guys.


Another Cheat:
 
Play to level 3 and turn right from the lift. Don't close any fire doors and
hhead for the Intex console. You should have about 60,000 credits, so buy
what you need and go around the map (which is square). Return to the Intex
console and you will have 3,500,000 credits.


GAME TIPS:

o   Using the codes to help finish the game does`nt always work - some
    things are required from earlier levels. Collect everything 
    (especially money).

o   You don`t need to go through any doors that lead to the first deck
    lift.

o   Conserve your keys. Use them for accessing the landing bays first,
    then go for bonuses behind other locked doors. Blast open the doors
    near the lower bay, and shoot as few aliens as possible.

o   Once you`ve run out of keys, you should have almost all the money
    available on the first level. Go to the computer and buy the following
    items:

1.  A portable map.

2.  Two key packs, or three if your aim is good - on level 10 you`ll need
    all the ammo you can get.

3.  If you have more than 2,000 credits spare, buy some more magazines.

Remember: to buy any object twice, you need to leave the computer network,
then reconnect. Always buy what you need before you enter a level code.

LEVEL 10: The third-to-last level is rather difficult, because you need to
carefully plot your route back to where you started from. Here, you`ll need
all the key packs you bought earlier.

LEVEL 11: Very easy, as long as you have loads of ammo. Use your map often,
and don`t bump into any walls - otherwise the ship-destruct countdown will
begin and you`ll have to reach the deck lift very quickly...

LEVEL 12: The final level. You can`t use your map here, and there are no
computers, so this is a real test of skill. The queen may be reached by
going up through the long corridor with the meshed floor, then by going
down and right. When you have killed her, the deck-lift will be to your
right.
