Aladdin                  

    Pause the game and enter the following sequence with the joystick:

    U,D,L,R,F,D,U,R,L,F,D,R,F,R,D,F,U,U,F,D,U,D,F

    The game should now unpause.  Use the following keys during play:

    'F10'______________Completes level and goes to bonus game.
    '1'-'9'___Skip to the corresponding level (No bonus game).
    'Z'______________Move Aladdin anywhere using the joystick.
    '+'__Speeds up movement when used in conjunction with 'Z'.
    '-'_Slows down movement when used in conjunction with 'Z'.
    '0'__________________________________Another pause mode???

    On the bonus game, pause the game and use the 'TAB' key to cycle
    through the bonuses until you get to the one you want (the free
    guy).  Now press the fire button and continue to hit 'TAB' until
    your lives go up by one.  You can keep doing this until you get nine
    lives or run out of chances.

    Or you could also hold down 'TAB' while the game is paused and enter
    this other sequence:

    U,D,L,R,F,D,U,R,L,F,D,R,F,R,D,F

    Use the same keys as above.  The game won't unpause this time, but
    Aladdin should move once.  The cheats do exactly the same thing and
    only one will need to be activated.
