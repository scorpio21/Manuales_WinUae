                 AQUATIC GAMES - CHEAT + HINTS `N` TIPS
                 ======================================


100M SPLASH
-----------

Run along the top of the water, then jump over the pelican. He will fly
off, then come and carry you over half of the course. If you knock all
three toucans off, two pelicans will carry you in turn.

In one-player mode, don`t start running, just let the penguin kick you
until you fall in the water. This will give you a 10,000 point bonus and
reset your time.

JUGGLING
--------

Rotate joystick madly to juggle all five balls.



SHELL SHOOTING
--------------

Go to the right, then jump on the jelly limpet. You will go through the
roof, where there is a king limpet, bonuses and limpet mines.

BOUNCY CASTLE
-------------

A forward or backward somersault followed by a twist will give you a spring
box. Use this to gain greater height. Do a twist at the top of your jump to
go through the roof for bonuses.

HOP, SKIP & LONG JUMP
---------------------

Make a final jump and keep waggling while in the air for greater distance.
If you get a really long jump, prepare for a surprise...


UNICYCLE
--------

Rotate the joystick slowly and steadily instead of manically.

FEEDING TIME
------------

If butterfly hits fish, you will get a 1,000 point bonus. Time throwing
sweets to the fish so that you trap butterfly between fish for a bonus.

KIPPER WATCHING
---------------

Leave the clock and let it ring for a large bonus - watch the seals though.
