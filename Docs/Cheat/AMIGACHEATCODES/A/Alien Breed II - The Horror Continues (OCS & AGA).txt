Taking sides
------------

Before commencing gameplay you must choose from the four available space
cadets. Two of these are humans, ordinary to you and me, but famously
battle hardened from previous encouters. Their names are Officer Johnson
and Officer Stone. Like us they`re just good all rounders but with no
outstanding attributes, a bit on the boring side really. The remaining
choices are one robot that has amazing destructive capabilities, but
obviously not as quick on the old reflexes as the humans. A small prices to
pay in situations like this. And lastly there`s Ruffertoo, an extremely
intelligent lizard-lifeform who is quick and resourceful. However he is let
down by his stamina in hauling large armaments for a long period of time.
So the best choice in the end would have to be the near invincilble
android.

Clear up
--------

Now that you have chosen your character you may begin. There are three main
buildings that need to be cleared of all alien presence: the main civilian
building, the science laboratories and the military barracks. Sounds a bit
silly I know, but squads of trained soldiers require the help of one
individual. Huh, squaddies eh?

GAMING TACTICS AND RULES TO BE OBSERVED
---------------------------------------

Keys are perhaps the most sought after item throughout the course of your
campaign. Without them you`ll get nowhere in any of the three buildings.
Whenever you find a key or a multiple set, try to hold onto them until you
have seen the full map from the computer consoles. Closely study the map to
find the exits and areas of mission importance. To assist your craving for
these items you should retain a large sum of money to purchase extra keys.
After all, it`s no good if you have millions of weapons and you`re stuck
behind one of the building`s pressure doors, is it?

Money
-----

Money or credits are the next important things. Without these invaluable
sources of collateral you`ll not be able to buy extra weapons that you may
require for certain missions. Like keys, they should be used with extreme
caution. Only purchase something from the Intex 400 console if you
desperately need it.

The Intex 400 computer link-up console is your only form of contact with
the outside world. It`s main function is to supply you with detailed maps
and extra ammunition for your blood thirsty weapons. Also mission briefings
can be sought around these electrical marvels. Without knowing the location
of these computers, your progress will be very difficult indeed, impossible
if anything. So as soon as you start playing, seek out the nearest one to
you and find out what your current mission status is.

Unfortunately for you, all weapons and information require payment. Even to
take a peek at the structural blueprint will cost a couple of creds. So
before you go and blow all of your hard found cash, I`ll take you through
each weapon in turn and tell you their true value and importance.

First on the agenda we have the flame thrower. A basic and crude implement
that has been in existence for many years. To use it, point it down any of
the long narrow corridors and burn the enemies out of their hiding places.
Don`t rush out and buy one just yet because they`re extremely thirsty in
the fuel department.

Next we have the trusty and reliable machine gun. A quick firing rate with
medium damage factor. This will probably be your sole weapon throughout the
course of your game. And as a bonus, the ammo is cheap.

Laser phaser
------------

A new weapon which has recently been developed is the three-way laser.
Rigorously tested on the firing ranges the three-way gun has proven to be
the most effective way of disposing of large groups of any encountered
enemy. However, due to it`s rapid firing rate it is very expensive to run
and should only be considered for missions that have large numbers of
aliens in open spaces to be wiped out. Good fun though!

Guns that repeatedly launch homing in missiles are adept at dealing with
hordes of aliens whilst retreating down long corridors. A character may
withdraw from a heavy conflict and still return fire with these homing in
missiles. They`re not very damaging to the aliens but they do hold them
back until you`re in a safer posistion. You should keep one of these
weapons in reserve at all times if you can.

Grenade launchers are definitely the worst available weapons. A slow rate
of fire that produces a single projectile capable of a mini explosion Their
only use is to reduce large packs of charging aliens before engaging in
close combat with machine guns. Not very effective when solely used by a
singular warrior.

One of the latest discoveries from our team of military scientists is the
amazing rebounding bullet. Taking the concept from ancient cowboy films,
researchers have made an actual bullet that is able to ricochet off walls
and explode on impact when striking a living creature. But at the end of
the day it`s just fancy equipment that you could do without.

ENGAGING COMBAT
---------------

When wading into crowds of blood thirsty aliens it`s handy to know what
weaknesses they possess. Since the first orignal encounter nine years ago
the aliens have learnt how to use guns. This makes the course of battle
much tougher. So when you see normal baby aliens get stuck in, they`re
practically harmless. But when you come across big yellow adults you`ll
need to use long range weapons and keep your distance.

VARIOUS HANDY HINTS FOR THE UNWORTHY
------------------------------------

There are numerous traps and devious puzzles to overcome. Too many for me
to mention. The main rule to live by is to keep going, you can`t afford to
rest for more than a few seconds or you`ll have waves of aliens crashing
down on you. Also keep your shots well aimed and controlled. If you lose
your head in the heat of a small battle you`ll realize that you`ve wasted
valuable ammo on a few baby aliens, then when it comes to the adults you`ll
only have a small fruit knife to defend yourself with. Not good.

Finally and most importantly, wall mounted guns which have been placed
around the buildings as a defence system. These laser turrets have
unfortunately malfunctioned and all they can do is fire at anything that
moves, including you. The only good news is that due to this malfunction
they have become slower than normal. Therefore they now require a larger
amount of time to lock in on a target, giving you time to escape their
wrath.
