 TIPS:

 On the second floor of the Civilian Complex, find the blue pass key
 to the Hospital Head Office (It's located in a room to the North West).
 Now directly next door to this room is what seemingly appears to be an
 empty toilet. However, upon entering the toilet you'll be transported
 to the Team 17 Portaloo. Here you can help yourself to some credits and
 maybe a better weapon! Just read the Intex System Infobase in this room
 for more information.
