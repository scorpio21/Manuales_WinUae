 CHEAT MODE:

 On the title screen type 'HELPMARK' to enter a level select screen.


 PLAYING TIPS:

 On level 1, go through the first door as usual then go to the far right
 at the bottom and jump up to go through a special wall to get a special
 weapon. Then exit. When you reappear, jump on the spring at the bottom
 left and just after you start flying upwards push up so that you hit an
 invisible block with a door on it. Now go right across the floating
 platforms, but instead of going through the normal door, stand on the
 pillar before it and fire your weapon to reveal another secret block.
 Jump on this block then jump up and left and walk left across the top
 of the screen to the first secret block and go through the door.
 Now work your way to the top of the screen using the springs and exit
 through the door and you will now enter a secret warp room with access
 to levels 2, 3, 4 and 5.
 On level 4, get to the first can of pop, jump over the broken piece of
 glass and turn into the clear glass flask. Jump up to reveal a hidden
 door. Walk out of the flask, fall down towards the spikes and onto the
 hidden spring. Jump back up into the top of the flask, enter the door to
 the secret room full of diamonds, extra lives and balloons.
 Alternatively, you can peck away at the last row of block between the
 balloons, walk into the green bottle, fall down, walk out into the clear
 glass and jump to find the hidden door. Enter the warp room and warp to
 levels 6, 7, 8 and 9.
