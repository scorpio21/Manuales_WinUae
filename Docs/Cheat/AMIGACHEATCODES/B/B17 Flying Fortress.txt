                  B17 FLYING FORTRESS - HINTS `N` TIPS
                  ====================================

o   Take some time to observe how the gunners aim for fast-moving fighters.
    Make regular checks on the outside view to see if your engines are all
    right. If your co-pilot has been hit, you will not get a warning
    message.

o   Circling Alconbury, use <Shift> <F8> and external views to line up on
    the field.

o   The (Dennis) Norden bomb sight usually gives you the release cue at
    about four notches of deflection, but there is no substitute for
    practice.

o   Try diving between 350-400mph. This becomes very useful later when one
    fire extinguisher per engine is not enough.

o   Fly over big cities and press <F8> to see the sights.

o   When navigating manually, use the rudder to steer the plane from the
    pilot`s intrumental view.

o   When making navigation checks, use a combination of the navigator`s
    instrument and external views to orientate the map.

o   Keep at least one pilot healthy as the plane can go in a spin if it`s
    in a turn when hit. This gives you time to bail out.

o   When you`re being attacked, use <Z> and <X> to change to a fighter,
    then <Shift> <F1> to see the battle from the pilot`s point of view.

o   If you prefer to manually taxi the aircraft, avoid steering on to the
    grass. Speeds above 30mph will snap the gear. If you make a mess of it,
    use the keys <Alt> <T> to get you into the air and up with the
    formation.

o   Regularly check that the crew are all OK and that the guns aren`t
    jammed. It`s easy to miss the messages in the heat of combat.

o   Using the radio operator to send a Mayday message improves your chances
    of survival when bailing out.

o   Fuel leaks can be critical to the success of a mission. If necessary,
    turn off an engine or two and drop out of the formation to conserve
    fuel.

o   If in doubt, bail out. Landing an engine-less. bullet riddled,
    flame-scorched B-17 after the completion of a mission is risky and
    difficult. Bail out over the Channel to ensure your mission is a
    success.

o   Remember, an engine left to burn is like a bomb waiting to go off.

o   Flying at a very low altitude helps avoid flak, but remember to gain
    height before starting the bombing run.

o   Flying manually to the target on a self-determined course helps you
    avoid enemy fighters and flak. Get the formation to follow your lead,
    but don`t get lost.

o   Let the computer-controlled gunners track the targets and then take
    over for the kill.

o   Before landing, attempt to heal injured crew or they get hospitalised.

o   Having more than one crew member available to perform first aid
    increases the chances of success.
