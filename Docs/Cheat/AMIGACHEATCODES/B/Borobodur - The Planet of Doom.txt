        During play go to the right and flick the switch.  Now got all the
        way to the left and flick that switch.  Jump on to the rising log
        and ride it to the top.  At the top jump to the right and flick
        that switch.  Now kill yourself and go to the left once again and
        ride the log up half way and jump into the opening on the right
        (about half way up).  Kill the monster and go to the right and
        climb the rope.  You will see three platforms, jump on to the
        middle one.  Get as close to the left edge as possible and press
        and hold the JOYSTICK DOWN and press and hold the 'SPACEBAR' until
        a message appears and says {NOW YOU'VE DONE IT}.  This will give
        you invicibility and stops the clock.  Press 'RETURN' to skip
        levels.
