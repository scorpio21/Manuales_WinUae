BARBARIAN (PALACE)
------------------

On the final level when you confront Drax, walk forward and when the
first fireball comes, jump, then do a forward roll into Drax. If you
can't even get that far then the best way to defeat an opponent is to
roll into him until he reaches the side, then kick him, roll in to
him again and kick him, keep repeating this method and you'll soon
finish the game.
