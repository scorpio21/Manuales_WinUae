 TIP/CHEAT:

 Contrary to the game manual, there is a hidden pause control built in
 to the game. When you press the [Spacebar] to access the overhead map,
 if you keep it held down the clock will stop until you release it.

 HINTS:

An easy way to complete a level is to blow up all the bombs on the level
first, and see which squares remain undamaged.  These are squares the player
should aim to finish on.

Study the map carefully before trying to complete each of the levels.

When attempting to detonate a pulsing bomb, pick it up, as it is easier to
the bombs size when it's picked up.

Remember that when you are tleporting a droid, you are impervious to the
effects of the monsters on the levels.

When teleporting from square to square you are invulnerable to the
explosions.

Switches have three phases: Phase 1 = Set
                            Phase 2 = On
                            Phase 3 = Off.
Phase 1 can never be reversed after a switch has been operated.

When teleporting, the explosions occour before you teleport, so if you are
teleporting onto a mine, it will be destroyed before you get there, provided
the square is in the blast radius and is riveted.

The mouse makes the game more difficult and should only be used by
experienced users.

When dealing with more than one nasty, try to kill them off as quickly as
possible; use the dissolving squares and switches to make the squares to
dissapear beneath them.

When using sighted droids you may activate switches, but when the bomb blows
up the droid will die. Also if you try to move the droid away from the bomb
you will move when the bomb and the droid have been destroyed.

A blind droid can not activate switches.
