 CHEAT MODE:

 Pause the game (with the [Esc] key) and press [G] to be transported
 straight to the end of level guardian.

Hints for the first three levels:

LEVEL 1: Get the green armous as soon as possible. If you have
all of the amulet, don't go to the sphere unless you have collected at
least four lots of monster remains, you'll need them to battle the end
of level guardian. He's a bit soft in the head, so time your jumps
carefully, and hit him there.

LEVEL 2: There are four planets to visit, go to everyone if
you want to get maximum points. Again, the green armour is very
useful, so get it as quickly as possible. There's loads of ammo for
the guardian of this level, unfortunetly that means there's loads of
monsters to deal with. The back of the guardians head is the weak
spot.

LEVEL 3: Stand on the slabs and summersault. There are six
planets here, and the transporters are more difficult to so, so you
have to watch moreMANXefully.
