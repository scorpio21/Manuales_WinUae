Bad Company

During play, type "TIGER" now press 'F5' for infinite energy.  
Some of the other function keys do stuff, but nothing that will help you.
Pressing 'TAB' or 'ENTER' (numeric keypad) seems to lock up the game.
If you accidentally hit either of those two keys, hold down the left
mouse button and press 'F1'.  This will end the game and bring you
back to the title screen (at least you won't have to reboot).
