                    BATTLE ISLE LEVEL CODES + TIPS
                    ==============================

LEVEL ACCESS
------------

Here are some codes to allow you access to later levels. Included on the
tables is further information to help you plan your strategy:

Units - the initial number of units under player one and two`s control. Map
means the total number on the map (in depots and factories for example).

Factories/Depots - the initial number of factories and depots at the start
of the game. Map means the total number, including undiscovered ones.

Initial Score - the initial score of both players, based on the defensive
values of the units owned.

General Strategy Tips
---------------------

At the start of the game, always check any depots and factories in your
possession for units, as well as checking your headquarters.

Look to see where the PROVIDER, GIANT or INVADER units closest to your
DEMON infantry are, so that the foot soldiers can travel quickly in
relative safety. Always transport the DEMON units in other vechiles so that
a speedy withdrawal is possible.

When given a choice about your factory or depot to capture, pick the one
with the most energy and useful units. Don`t go for a depot that has BLITZ
or SPHINX units when the enemy has no aircraft!

When building units, build equipment needed, then build as many SCORPION
units as possible. You can surround the enemy with attacking forces.

If you are attacking a building that has DEMON units nearby, then attack
with two DEMONs, avoiding his DEMON unit. Then send one of your own DEMON
units into the building to capture it. The enemy will then recapture it`s
building, at which point you should send your other DEMON unit into the
building. When you look at the contents of your building you will see that
the enemy DEMON is now on your side.

When fighting a submarine on later levels and you don`t know where it is,
switch to a nearby boat with a long range (such as the MARAUDER) and take
it into move mode. You will then see two hexs that aren`t surrounded by
dashed lines. These spaces are taken up by the submarine.

When attacking with a unit that has a range of two or more, always try to
use the weapon from more than one hex away, because the enemy then has no
chance to fire back when they are attacked.

The best place to attack enemy units is when they are on open ground and
your units are on high ground, as your units do more damage.

If you have any aircraft then you can use them to attack or block ground
units. This is especially useful against DEMON, SCORPION, GLADIATOR, ANGEL,
MERLIN, GIANT, AMAZON and BARRACUDA units as they have no defence against
aircraft.

When defending against air raids, it is useful to have a SPHINX unit ready.
The enemy knows how good they are at stopping aircraft, so they are usually
the primary target for attack. A method to counter this is to place the
SPHINX in a corner of a depot or headquarters and place BLITZ units in the
surrounding hexes. The enemy will then never be in hex to hex contact with
the SPHINX. A similar method can be used to protect the ANGEL heavy
artillery from tank attack. The only difference is that you should replace
the BLITZ units with SCORPION or GLADIATOR units.

It does not explain in the rule book to any great extent about using MERLIN
units to make depots. This is done in the action/attack phase. Do the same
as you would to attack if the MERLIN could and, if the geography of the
land is suitable, a target hex will appear from the MERLIN. This will be
the entrance to the depot when completed. It takes two turns to build the
depot, although two MERLIN units can make a depot in one turn. If using one
MERLIN you must remember to order it in the next action/attack phase to
finish the depot as it does not automatically do so.

The experience system is of no great importance, especially in long, drawn
out games, because an experienced unit will always destroy an identical
"rookie" unit. The system is based as follows:

    If in attack or defence a unit destroys one or more of the enemy in the
opposing unit, then they will gain one experience point.

    If a unit destroys the last enemy in a particular unit then they will
receive an extra bonus of another point, making up a total of two points.

    When fighting against units containing only one enemy (even when at
full strength such as a BARRACUDA, PEGASUS, FORTRESS or AMAZON), an
experience point is gained every time a shot hits it, even if the shot did
not destroy it. Two points are gained for the unit that finally destroys
it.

The best land attack formation is to have CRUSADER and GLADIATOR units in
the middle of the front line. On the flanks it is useful to have SCORPION
units placed, as their high speed makes them useful for surrounding the
enemy. Behind the front line, have as many BUSTER units as possible so that
they are two hexes from the enemy and the rocket attacks can be made in
safety. Behind the BUSTER units (or along side them) have SPHINX, ANGEL and
BLITZ units to protect the front line against air attack (the ANGEL units
can also bombard the enemy from a distance). At the rear have DEMON units
on-board PROVIDER units so that they can rush out and storm a building or
retreat in the event of a collapsed line. PROVIDER units carrying DEMON
troops should attack or allow to be attacked, since a troop PROVIDER loses
all of it`s on-board troops when destroyed.

If you have a PEGASUS unit, try to launch the aircraft on-board as soon as
a battle is likely, since all aircraft that are still on a destroyed
carrier will be lost.
