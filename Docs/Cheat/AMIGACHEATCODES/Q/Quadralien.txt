 TIPS:  

 Once in the core, you can't quit.  So choose droids with
 good lasers, Jack and Spud for example.  The Quadralien mother is
 made up of 4 separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by
 Earthling boxes.  The mother can only be destroyed by blowing up
 each box from a different direction.  From the starting point there
 are three exits:  north, east, and west.  Go east and destroy the
 first box, return to the starting point, and go north to destroy
 the second box.  You will now have both droids to blow the
 remaining boxes.  Go west through the one-way force field, and get
 the other.  Don't forget to keep recharging.
