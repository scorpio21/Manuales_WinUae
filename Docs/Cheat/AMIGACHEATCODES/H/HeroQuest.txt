HEROQUEST
---------

1.  Play the maze several times to gain cash fast.
2.  Save up cash to buy the crossbow.
3.  Note that you don't have to be in the same room as the enemy to use the
    crossbow, you just need to have a line of sight to the target.
4.  Don't buy the plate armour, although it gives good protection, it will
    slow you down.  Buy chain mail instead.
5.  Buy the tool kit for when things stand in your way.
6.  A good way to keep your character healthy is to create the Wizard,
    making sure he has the water and earth spells, then when you start the
    quest cast the healing spells on your player and then send the Wizard
    through the stairs.
7.  In 'The Rescue of Sir Ragnar' kill all the creatures on your way in so
    that the path is clear for Sir Ragnar to escape.
8.  In 'Lair of the Orc Warlord', you'll find there is a very useful potion
    in the cupboard to the west.
9.  In Prince Magnus's Gold', kill all the creatures on the way in, as you
    will be too wayed down by all your gold on the return journey.
10. In 'Melar's Maze' there is a magical item on the west side of the
    dungeon.
11. In 'Legacy of the Orc Warlord' your items are in the room to the east.
12. In the 'Stone Hunter', Borin's armour can be find up in the northwest
    area of the map.
13. In 'The Fire Mage' there is a treasure chest to the east.
14. In 'Race against Time' use the Southern door to get riches, or the
    Western door just to get out.
15. In 'Castle of Mystery', don't collect the gold, as it's Fool's Gold -
    and so worthless - and you won't be able to attack while carrying it.
16. Don't buy the shield because one can be found in 'Bastion of Chaos'.
17. Search for the Secret door to find the holder of the Star Of the West.
18. Use the spirit blade when fighting the undead, as it is very powerful
    against them.
19. Kill off the Witchlord's henchmen with the crossbow before you attack
    him with the spirit blade.
20. Th Th Th Thats all folks!
