    HACKER:

        -- These are the sequences of which cities to go to first and what
           to buy and trade when you get there.

           1. Switzerland - Give 5,000 - Buy Both Items.
           2. Eygpt - Give Watch - Buy Both Items.
           3. Rome - Give Tut - Buy Nothing.
           4. India - Give Scarab - Buy Nothing.
           5. New York - Give Swiss Chalet - Buy Bonds.
           6. Tokyo - Give Bonds - Buy Both Items.
           7. China - Give Pearls - Buy Jade.
           8. Cuba - Give Jade - Buy Nothing.
           9. London - Give Camera - Buy Beatles Album.
          10. San Francisco - Give Beatles Album - Leave to Washington.
          11. Washington - Give F.B.I. Agent Document.

           These are the four security checks it will ask for in order.

           1.MAGMA, LTD.
           2.AXD-0310479
           3.HYDRALIC
           4.AUSTRALIA


           Now to start the game. When it asks for logon type.

           LOGON:Australia

           It will then take you right in to the game avoiding clicking
           the mouse on the various items. Next center your time zone so
           you have dayligt on the most populated area. I wil now give you
           a chart of the moves to make to get through the game. NOTE: Be
           very carefull when clicking your moves because the count is
           VERY important one false move and you will not make it to 
           Washington. This game is timed by moves and not by a time limit.
           Take your time but be accurate and carefull.

           When it asks for your name type your name fully because it will
           print a page from the Washington Post with your name in it, so
           be sure to have an Epson compatible printer connected.

           W'ell here goes.  GOOD LUCK!!!!
