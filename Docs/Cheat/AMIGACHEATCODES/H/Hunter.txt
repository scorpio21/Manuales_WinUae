                           HUNTER - SOLUTION
                           =================

A big game and a difficult quest - especially for one person. Follow these
tips and the map included on this disk to beat this multi-vehicled
advenure.

To begin with, collect all the items from the two huts on the starting
island. Board the boat and head west towards the stores. Once there, enter
the stores and click on AUTO. Before leaving the island, enter the house
and collect the money and enemy uniform. Put on the uniform and go back to
the boat.

Read the log book and click on the first man. Go to coordinates X136, Y80
and enter the hangar. Collect the fuel and get into the ambulance. Drive to
the posistion marked FIRST MAN on the map, enter the hut and select `TALK`.
He should then give you the coordinates of the old man (X181, Y197). Enter
these into the log book and head back to the rocket boat by the hangar. Put
some of the fuel in the boat and head for the coordinates the first man
gave you.

You should now be by a light house, so go in and give the old man money
until he won`t take any more. Now select `TALK` and he will give you the
coordinates of the second man (X99, Y61). Put this in the log book and head
to the coordinates in the rocket boat. Go to the church to find the second
man and give him grenades until he refuses any more. He will now tell you
the posistion of the professor.

Head towards posistion X59, Y46 to find the helicopter. Add some fuel and
head towards posistion X146, Y169. Look behind the windmill to find the
master key, then head toward the power station (where the professor is
situated). Enter the station and select `TALK`, at which point the
professor will ask you to retrieve the nuclear device from posistion X28,
Y227. Return to the helicopter, add some fuel and fly to the device. When
you arrive, there will be three small huts surrounded by an electric
barrier. Don`t enter the right-hand hut or touch the barrier! Use timed
explosives to blow up the right hand hut, then enter the middle hut and
collect the nuclear device. Fly back to the professor and give him the
device, then select `TALK` and he will ask you to collect a disk from X100,
Y225.

Go to the third man (coordinates X195, Y119), return to the helicopter and
travel to X224, Y123 to find some fuel. Fill the helicopter and also carry
as much of it as you can. Now fly to the location of the disk and enter the
house. Look behind the washing machine and collect the disk before
returning to the helicopter. Fly to the third man (who will be hiding
behind a rock) and select `TALK`. He will tell you to collect a security
pass from Y90, Y153 and also tell you the location of the computer (X224,
Y199). Collect the security pass from the office and head towards the
computer (which is housed in a fort).

Make sure you are wearing the enemy uniform and you can then enter the
fort. Operate the computer and enter the information that it gives to you
into the log book. Now head towards the prison at X135, Y239 and enter it.
Talk to the prisoner until he tells you to fetch a saw from coordinates
X151, Y121 then head towards this posistion.

Enter the building and collect the hacksaw and antibiotics. Head back to
the prison and give the hacksaw to the prisoner. He will then tell you to
go to the green monk at X85, Y174. Go out and collect an animal of some
sort (for food). If you can`t find one then try the house at X35, Y248. Go
to the green monk, who will tell you to go to an injured soldier at X10,
Y36. Enter the building and `TALK` to the soldier. Give him the antibiotics
and return to X151, Y121 to pick up another antibiotic. Go back to the
hospital and give the soldier more antibiotics until he tells you the
whereabouts of the General (X135, Y239). He will also mention a scroll
which is at X91, Y173.

Collect the scroll on the way to the General, who`s location will turn out
to be the prison you visited earlier. Blow up the prison using grenades, a
bazooka, mines or an ASM from the helicopter. By fiddling with the zoom
control you will see the bunker before blowing up the prison. Enter the
bunker from the south (away from the screen) to find the General. Shoot the
General and collect his head before returning victorious to HQ.
