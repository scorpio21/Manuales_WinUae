                              CHEAT + TIPS



CHEATS
~~~~~~
1: THERE`S A SNEAKY WAY TO GET A GREAT RUNELORE RATING WHILE TRAVELLING
AROUND MIDGARD.  GO TO THE ISLAND MARKED WITH A * ON THE MAP, KILL THE
SORCERER YOU FIND THERE AND THEN NAB THE NEARBY POTION AND DRINK IT (OR TAKE
IT BACK TO YOUR SHIP AND GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE).  WHEN YOU COME BACK TO
THE ISLAND THE POTION WILL HAVE MAGICALLY REAPPEARED.  YOU CAN KEEP RETURNING
AND LEAVING AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT!

2: THERE`S A GREAT WAY TO GET MONEY BY THE SACKFUL.  GO TO THE ISLAND WHERE
YOU HAVE TO PAY A SILVER COIN TO ENTER AND FIND THE SHOP.  GIVE HEIMDALL ALL
THE GOLD AND THE ADAMANTITE AXE.  SELL THE AXE AND CONFIRM THE SALE, THEN
CLICK ON THE SELL ICON AGAIN.  THE SHOP OWNER WILL HAPPILY BUY THE AXE AGAIN!
 KEEP DOING THIS UNTIL THE SHOP IS FULL THEN BUY BACK THE AXE.  YOU SHOULD BE
VERY RICH !!!!!

3: This is not a cheat but try it anyhow.
When you die, go to the Save Options screen. When you are asked to
insert your GameSave disk, click on NO. You can now return to where
you died with all your status restored.


GENERAL TIPS
~~~~~~~ ~~~~
1: YOU`LL NEED A WELL-BALANCED PARTY OF WARRIORS AND WIZARDS TO COMPLETE THE
QUESTS.  THE BEST MIX CONSISTS OF HEIMDALL, A BERSERKER, A WARRIOR, A WIZARD,
A BLACKSMITH AND A NAVIGATOR.

2: EXPLORE EVERYWHERE, OPEN ALL THE CHESTS (EXCEPT WHERE WARNED IN THE GUIDE
LATER) AND TAKE AND EXAMINE ANYTHING.

3: DON`T USE `DISARM TRAPS` SPELLS TO CHECK OUT CHESTS - IT`S A SHAME TO
WASTE A GOOD SPELL WHEN ALL YOU RISK LOSING IS A HANDFUL OF HEALTH POINTS.

4: WHEN YOU UPGRADE TO A BETTER WEAPON GET RID OF THE OLD ONE, BECAUSE IT
JUST TAKES UP VALUABLE STORAGE SPACE.

5: CIRCLETS, CHARMS, GOLD RINGS AND AMETHYST AND RUBY KEYS ARE TOTALLY
USELESS, SO EITHER SELL OR DISCARD THEM.

6: DRINKING THE VARIOUS POTIONS INCREASES THE CHARACTERS` VARIOUS STATISTICS.



COMBAT
~~~~~~
1: THERE`S A HUGE VARIETY OF WEAPONS TO TRY OUT IN HEIMDALL, SOME OF WHICH DO
EXTRA DAMAGE THANKS TO THEIR RUNE - RELATED PROPERTIES.  SEE WEAPON
REFERENCE.

2: TO GET RID OF PESKY DWARVES, SORCERERS, TROLLS AND GIANT RATS USE A
COMBINATION OF DAGGERS, SWORDS AND AXES.

3: DAGGERS AND `ICE` SPELLS ARE BEST FOR BEATING SPIDERS.

4: USE SWORDS AND AXES TO KILL THE MANIC MONKEY MEN.

                                 ~~~~~~~
1: DESTROY THE PIT TRAPS IN THE FIRST ROOM YOU ENTER USING A `DISARM TRAPS`.
 NOW COLLECT THE HEMLOCK AND THE `REMOVE WALL` SPELL FROM THE CHEST. (YOU
NEED TO USE THE SPELL SOMEWHERE LATER ON THIS VERY ISLAND, BUT WE`LL LEAVE
YOU TO DISCOVER EXACTLY WHERE!!) KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THE SECRET DOOR IN THE
ROOM FULL OF MAN-TRAPS.

2: FIND THE `REVELATION` SPELL AND GET THE `DESCENSION` SPELL BY KILLING THE
TROLL.  USE THE `REVELATION` SPELL TO BRIDGE THE CHASM AND WALK ACROSS TO
PICK UP THE POWER RUNE SCROLL ON THE OTHER SIDE (YOU`LL NEED SIX OF THESE
BEFORE YOU CAN FIND THOR`S HAMMER).

3: SEAL OVER THE PITS BY TREADING ON THE PRESSURE PADS IN THE ORDER SHOWN.
(SEE PRESSURE PADS REFERENCE) IN THE THIRD ROOM YOU ENTER, USE A `DISARM
TRAPS` SPELL.  USE THE `DESCENSION` SPELL TO GET THE JEWEL FROM THE TOP OF
THE PEDESTAL.  GIVE THE HEMLOCK TO THE HOODED FIGURE IN THE NEXT ROOM AND IN
RETURN HE`LL GIVE YOU A CHEST AND A WAY OFF THE ISLAND.

4: COUGH UP A SILVER COIN (ASSUMING YOU HAVE ONE) TO ENTER THE VILLAGE.  SELL
THE SAPPHIRE AT THE SHOP (IT`S OF NO OTHER USE TO YOU) AND BUY ANYTHING YOU
NEED.  IN THE ROOM WITH THE FLOATING MAN, WALK TO THE PEDESTAL AND DRINK FROM
THE CHALICE.  THE NOW-UNFLOATING MAN WILL GIVE YOU A PASS.

5: STAND ON THE SWITCH TO DEACTIVATE THE FIRST PIT TRAP.  IN THE NEXT ROOM
USE A `DETECT TRAP` OR A `DISARM TRAP` SPELL.  USE A `DISARM TRAPS`SPELL TO
DEACTIVATE THE SECOND PIT TRAP IN THE FIRST ROOM.  IN THE ROOM WHERE YOU ARE
AMBUSHED BY A SPIDER USE A `DISARM TRAPS` SPELL TO FIND THE POWER RUNE
SCROLL.  USE A `DETECT TRAPS` SPELL IN THE ROOM WITH THE POTION IN IT - THERE
SHOULD BE A SILVER DAGGER IN THE CHEST.

6: PAY THE 50 GP FEE (IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT) TO ENTER THE VILLAGE.  ENTER THE
SECOND HOUSE AND COLLECT THE POWER RUNE SCROLL.  WALK THROUGH THE VILLAGE
UNTIL YOU ARRIVE AT THE CROSSROADS.  CHANGE TO ANY CHARACTER EXCEPT HEIMDALL
AS HE CANNOT PASS THROUGH EITHER PORTAL.  SHOW PASS TO THE TROLL OUTSIDE THE
SHOP.

7: USE A SILVER KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR BEYOND THE SPIDER`S WEB.  THE FIRST
TRAIL LEADS TO A ROOM FULL OF POUCHES OF GOLD AND A CHEST; COLLECT THE POWER
RUNE.  IF YOU NEED A KEY FIGHT THE FIRST TROLL YOU MEET AND FOLLOW THE TRAIL.
 DON`T BOTHER FIGHTING THE SECOND TROLL AS THE CHEST AT THE END OF THE TRAIL
IS EMPTY.

8: HUNT AROUND UNTIL YOU FIND THE DIAMOND.

9: FIGHT THE DWARF TO GET THE POWER RUNE SCROLL.  IN THE ROOM WHERE YOU ARE
AMBUSHED BY A SPIDER THERE ARE TWO CHESTS; COLLECT THE RUNESTONE.  IN THE
ROOM CONTAINING THE TREE WITH THREE BRANCHES USE THE DIAMOND ON THE LEFT
BRANCH, THE RUNESTONE ON THE RIGHT BRANCH AND A SILVER COIN ON THE CENTRE
BRANCH.  TAKE THE `SERPENT KILLER` SPELL.

10: OPEN THE CABINET WITH A GOLD KEY AND TAKE THE RUNESTONE.  IN THE ROOM
WITH THE SWITCHES ON THE FLOOR, STEP ON THE SWITCH NEAREST THE DOOR YOU CAME
IN.  WALK RIGHT AND GO UP THROUGH THE DOORWAY INTO THE NEXT ROOM.  WALK UP,
STEPPING ON THE SWITCH AS YOU PASS IT, THEN WALK LEFT, STEPPING ON THE NEXT
SWITCH.  GO DOWN THROUGH THE DOORWAY INTO THE ROOM YOU JUST LEFT.  WALK
THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AND DEFEAT THE SORCERER TO GET THE POWER RUNE SCROLL.
 WALK ONTO THE DESIGN ON THE FLOOR AND THE RUNESTONE WILL TRANSPORT YOU TO A
SHOP.

11: KILL THE GREY MONKEY TO GET A `SHRINKING SPELL`.

12: USE THE `SERPENT KILLER` SPELL ON THE SEA MONSTER.  GO THROUGH THE
DOORWAY AT THE TOP OF THE FIRST ROOM AND GIVE THE SIX POWER RUNE SCROLLS TO
THE HOODED FIGURE.  COLLECT THE STONE KEY ACROSS THE BRIDGE.  USE A JADE KEY
TO OPEN THE GATE IN THE CENTRE OF THE FIRST ROOM (IF YOU DON`T HAVE ONE, GO
THROUGH THE BOTTOM DOORWAY IN THE FIRST ROOM).  USE THE STONE KEY TO OPEN THE
NEXT GATE.  THE SCROLL IN THE CHEST IS USELESS.  USE THE `SHRINKING` SPELL TO
REDUCE THOR`S HAMMER TO A MORE MANAGEABLE SIZE.

SHOP.

2: BEFORE SETTING OUT, MAKE SURE YOUR EXPLORATION PARTY IS MADE UP OF THE
