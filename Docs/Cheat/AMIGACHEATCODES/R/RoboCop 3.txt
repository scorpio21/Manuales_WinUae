TIPS
~~~~

OCP TOWER MAP
~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~
IN THE OCP TOWER TRY TO GET TO THE BOARDROOM WITH AS HIGH AN EFFICIENCY AS
POSSIBLE.  THERE ARE FOUR TERRORISTS TO TAKE OUT BUT KILL MORE THAN ONE
HOSTAGE AND YOUR MISSION WILL FAIL.



ALLEYWAY MAP
~~~~~~~~ ~~~
WHEN TRYING TO LOCATE LEWIS IN THE ALLEYWAY MAZE, HEAD FOR THE FIRST OF THE
FOUR POSSIBLE HIDING PLACES AND CHECK THE AUDIO BLEEPER TO SEE IF SHE`S THERE
(I.E. THE TONE`S GETTING HIGHER) OR SOMEWHERE ELSE.
SPEED IS ESSENTIAL SO DON`T WASTE TIME SEEKING OUT ALL THE PUNKS.  ONCE YOU
FIND LEWIS BE SHARP TAKING OUT HER CAPTOR, OR HE`LL KILL HER.



POLICE STATION MAP
~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~
IN THE POLICE STATION GO TO THE LOCKER ROOMS AS SOON AS YOU CAN WHILE YOUR
EFFICIENCY IS STILL HIGH.  IN THE LARGER ROOMS THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE
REHABS ALL SHOOTING AT YOU AT ONCE BUT DON`T FIRE BACK TOO WILDLY OR YOU`LL
SHOOT THE COPS AND INNOCENTS STANDING NEARBY.



HOTEL MAP
~~~~~ ~~~
USE THE HOTEL MAP TO FIND THE LIFT, THEN USE THE AUDIO BLEEPER TO PIN DOWN
WHICH OF THE FOUR FLOORS MACDAGGART IS ON.  THERE ARE 175 ROOMS AND ONLY A
LIMITED TIME TO SEARCH THEM, SO DON`T WASTE TIME LOOKING AROUND EMPTY ROOMS.



ON THE STREETS
~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~
1: TRY TO SHOOT WHEN YOU`RE NOT MOVING.  WHILE IT`S FINE TO WALK IN A
STRAIGHT LINE AND PICK OFF THE BADDIES, TURNING AND SHOOTING IS ANOTHER
MATTER ALTOGETHER - IT`S ALL TOO EASY TO KILL A FEW INNOCENTS BY MISTAKE.

2: IT`S BEST TO TAKE CORNERS QUICK AND WIDE, THEN STRAIGHTEN UP AND BE
PRECISE WITH YOUR SHOOTING.  IF YOU SLOWLY EDGE AROUND THE CORNERS YOU MAY BE
SHOT BY A BADDY YOU CAN`T SEE YET.

3: TAKE OUT ANY GRENADES FLYING THROUGH THE AIR AND TRY TO SHOOT BADDIES AS
SOON AS THEY APPEAR, EVEN IF IT ENTAILS SOME SHARP SHOOTING BETWEEN THE ARMS
OF AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER.

4: SMOOTH AND PRECISE MOUSE CONTROL IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY HERE - TRY NOT TO
BE TOO JERKY AND ERRATIC IN YOUR MOVEMENTS.



ON THE ROAD
~~ ~~~ ~~~~
1: FOR FASTER DRIVING AND QUICKER ACCELERATION TRY TO AVOID UNNECESSARY
SWERVING OR TURNING.  WHEN YOU`VE TAKEN A CORNER TRY TO STRAIGHTEN UP AS
QUICKLY AS YOU CAN, THEN ACCELERATE WITHOUT MOVING THE WHEEL.

2: STICK TO THE TARMAC! SHORT-CUTS ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE MAY LOOK QUICKER
BUT THEY USUALLY TURN OUT A LOT SLOWER THAN A ROAD ROUTE.

3: WHEN TRYING TO RAM THE ESCAPING PERPS VAN SMACK INTO IT AS FAST AS
POSSIBLE THEN AFTER IMPACT BRAKE SHARPLY BY HITTING THE SPACE BAR.  THIS WILL
KEEP THE TIME YOU SPEND IN RANGE OF THE VILLAINS` GUNS DOWN TO A MINIMUM,
PROTECTING YOUR VALUABLE EFFICIENCY.

4: IF YOU LOOSE SIGHT OF THE TARGET VEHICLE PRESS F8 (WHICH WILL DISPLAY BOTH
CAR AND TARGET TOGETHER) TO GET SOME IDEA OF WHICH DIRECTION TO TAKE.

5: CONNOISSEURS OF QUALITY DRIVING ENDORSE THE KEYBOARD AS THE BEST WAY OF
ACCURATELY CONTROLLING THE CAR.  FOR A SNEAKY AIDE CHOOSE THE JOYSTICK
CONTROL OPTION BUT CARRY ON USING THE KEYBOARD, THE HANDY AUTOMATIC STEERING
RECENTRE WILL NOW KICK IN WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FINGERS OFF THE KEYS.



IN THE AIR
~~ ~~~ ~~~
1: THE HELICOPTERS ARE THE MOST PRESSING THREAT AS THEY`RE QUICK,
MANOEUVRABLE AND PACK ONE HELL OF A PUNCH, SO CONCENTRATE ON DOWNING THEM
FIRST.  YOU CAN THEN PICK OFF THE GROUND TARGETS AT YOUR LEISURE.

2: TO GET RID OF THE HELICOPTERS, FLY STRAIGHT AND FAST FOR A WHILE.
 LEMMING-LIKE THE HELICOPTERS WILL GIVE CHASE.  IN ONE SWIFT MOVE BRAKE TO A
STAND-STILL AND TURN TO FACE THE ON-COMING `COPTERS.  THEY`LL TRY TO MATCH
YOUR SPEED AND SO JUST SIT THERE IN MID-AIR, ALLOWING YOU TO PICK THEM OFF
ONE AT A TIME AS YOU FALL TO THE GROUND.  REMEMBER TO PULL UP AND AWAY IF THE
GROUND`S GETTING TOO CLOSE! IT`S EASIER TO DO THIS THAN TRYING TO TRACK THE
HELICOPTERS ON THE MOVE BECAUSE THEY`RE JUST TOO FAST.

3: TO TAKE OUT THE GROUND FORCES MAKE SWEEPS OVER THEM, STARTING HIGH AND
SLOW AND DIVING IN AT A ROUGHLY 45 DEGREE ANGLE.  WHEN YOU GET YOUR FIRST
TARGET LOCK ACCELERATE AWAY, TAKING OUT THREE OR FOUR GROUND UNITS.  ONCE
YOU`RE UP HIGH AGAIN TURN AND PREPARE YOUR NEXT SWEEP.

4: FOR THE BEST CONTROL THOSE TOP GEEZERS AT DID RECOMMEND YOU USE THE MOUSE
HERE.



COMBAT
~~~~~~
1: AS SOON AS THE COMBAT STARTS WALK FORWARD TO AVOID OTOMO`S FLYING LICK,
THEN PLAN YOUR ATTACK DEPENDING ON WHAT HE`S DOING.

2: OTOMO HAS THREE SWORDS, AND HE LOSES ONE EVERY TIME YOU HIT HIM WHILE HE`S
GOT IT IN HIS HANDS.  HE THEN REVERTS TO HAND AND FLYING KICK COMBAT.

3: ONLY SHOOT OR GET YOUR GUN OUT WHEN THE MOMENT IS EXACTLY RIGHT (I.E. WHEN
OTOMO`S NOT TOO CLOSE) OR HE`LL KNOCK IT FLYING OUT OF YOUR HAND AND IT`S THE
ONLY ONE YOU`VE GOT.

4: THE BEST TIME TO PUNCH OTOMO IS JUST AFTER HE`S FINISHED HIS FANCY SWORD
MOVES.  APPROACH HIM JUST AS HE`S PERFORMING HIS LAST MOVE (A HIGH KICK),
KNOCK HIM OVER THEN STOP AND WAIT FOR HIM TO REDRAW HIS SWORD.  THIS IS THE
BEST TIME TO SHOOT BUT BE VERY QUICK.  IF YOU MISS RE-HOLSTER YOUR GUN AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

5: GETTING OTOMO TRAPPED IN A CORNER IS WHEN YOU CAN REALLY LAY INTO HIM, BUT
DON`T LET IT HAPPEN TO YOU.

6: REMEMBER THERE`S A TIME LIMIT, SO DON`T PLAY IT TOO DEFENSIVELY.

7: TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU PUNCH YOU HIT HOME MORE OFTEN THAN NOT.
 OVER-EXERTION REDUCES YOUR EFFICIENCY.

8: ONCE AGAIN, THE KEYBOARD GIVES THE BEST RESULT WHEN IN A SCRAP.
