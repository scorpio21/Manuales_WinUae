RoboCop


 CHEAT MODE:

 Pause the game and type 'BEST KEPT SECRET', the action will
 reset and you'll start again with infinite energy.


	Okay, the total solution for Robocop and the way to do it...

	Level One: The Street
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		The most important things to remember is not to rush though
the levels - you only get into all sorts of trouble.  Always crouch down
when criminals run towards you, then hit them.
		If there are gunmen on the pavement, simply crouch down
and fire and they'll be unable to get you.  The men dressed in blue are a
real pain so when they jump towards you, kill them when they're in punching
distance just before they land.  And don't give them a chance to fire at
you.
		At the end of the level is ED-209 - he approaches when the
last man is killed.  Fire as he comes towards you, then jump as he fires
downwards at you, and open fire as he retreats.  Keep doing this
manouver until the machine is drestroyed.

	Level Two: The HideOut
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		The criminals fire from high platforms so try and knock
them out fast.  Watch out for the chainsaw men as they try and jump on
you, and be careful of the door which slams down.
		If you're having trouble with the criminals who fire out
of windows, jump onto crates and avoid their fire, then quickly leap off
and fire back.
		The van is the final obstacle on this level - try and
approach it with at least some three way bullets.  It only takes a couple
of shots to kill all of them men riding on top, then keep firing until the
van blows up with ease.

	PhotoFit
	~~~~~~~~
		This section can get very confusing.  The best tactic is
to concentrate on one side of the face - for example, if you're matching
the ears, just try and match the right ear, rather than looking at the
face as a whole.

	Level Three: The JunkYard
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		The main problem here are the giant magnets and the car
crushers.  To get past them easily, just position Robocopso his gun just
touches the obstacle, and when it rises to just above head height, rush
under it.
		To stand a chance of beating the giant crane you need the
manta gun, so when you get it, be careful not to waste it on standard
villains - punch them to save bullets.  Stand on the left of the screen,
and let rip when the crane approaches.

	Hostage Section
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		The way to succeed here is to aim just to the right of
the villain at about chest height and keep firing.  He eventually walks
into the firing line and drops dead.

	Level Four: Narcotics Factory
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Keep an eye out for falling beams, and stay alert because
the criminals attack from all angles in large groups - be especially careful
they don't come out of the doors in front of you.
		The end of level guardian is another crane.  It's useful if
you can save some mants shots like on the previous level.  If you run out,
just stay to the extreme left and keep jumping and firing.

	Level Five: OCP
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		As well as criminals, you also have gun turrets firing at
you, which should be taken out as quickly as possible.
		The guardian is a green ED-209 - he's tough and you need to
fire and dodge quickly to survive.  Just jump when he shoots back and fire
whenever there's an opportunity to do so.

	Thermograph Photofit
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Like the other photofit, concentrate on one half of the face.

	Level Six: OCP
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		The gun turrets shoot at you from higher levels but they're
a lot easier to take out.
		Look at the force fields before you attempt to cross them,
they come on in predictable patterns and it's easy to rush out when it's
safe to cross.
		The best way to deal with the robot bombers is to kneel
and fire before they start chucking explosives around.  Watch out for


criminals and gun turrets when you're travelling up in the lifts - they
tend to fire at you.  Don't be afraid to whizz back down again if things
aren't so hot.
		Another ED-209 lies in wait at the end of the level.  This
one needs a few accurate hits before it'll explode.

	Final Stage: President Held Hostage
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		As with the other hostage stage, stay just to the right of
Dick Jones and he should walk into your line of fire - although take
care here as he moves left and right faster than the previous villain.  Just
remember to keep following him with your gun sight and you should be able
to hit him.
		Good Luck - and stay out of trouble.
