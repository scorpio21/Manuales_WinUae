                REACH FOR THE SKIES - HINTS `N` TIPS
                ====================================

o   Keep the sun behind you. If you must fly away from the sun, `tack`
    away at 45 degress from the direct course.

o   Keep your eyes out of the cockpit rather than on the instruments.

o   Look for relative movement. At the edge of visibility where a
    stationary aircraft would be visible, the relative motion of an
    aircraft against the backdrop will give it away.

o   Battle of Britain aircraft did not fly as high as modern fighters.
    This means that a pilot can also look for aircraft shadow over the
    ground and sea.

o   Watch out for the messages from your ground controllers and fellow
    aviators. These should help you make your search more profitable.

o   Watch your six (behind you), but don`t rely on the rear view mirror.
    Use the outside view.

o   Once you have spotted the enemy, you should attempt to keep out of
    sight. If you haven`t already done so, move up sun, gain more height,
    and use any cover provided by clouds or high ground.

o   After the attack, get away quickly using all speed. Only go for the
    deck as a last resort. At low altitude, small arms fire from the
    ground can be very dangerous.

o   A pilot is at his most vulnerable when he is attacking another 
    aircraft. He needs to concentrate on the attack and does not have
    much time to look around. So, get away as soon as possible, because
    there could be a bandit on your tail.

o   Your should attack suddenly and aggressively. Be sure of the shot
    before you open fire. Once the shells start to fly, your posistion
    won`t stay secret for very long.

o   In a tail chase where you have an enemy aircraft in front and you are
    not gaining on him, give him a burst of gun fire. This may scare him
    into weaving about, which could be enough to slow him down and let
    you catch up.

o   Once you have made visual contact, don`t let the bandit out of your
    sight. There are two basic problems:

    1) When you start a manoeuvre, the bandit will respond. If you are
    not looking for him, he will not be where you expect him to be when
    you finish the manoeuvre.

    2) The bandit can turn away if your concentration lapses. This could
    make him almost invisible.

o   The best defensive tactic is a hard, fast offensive movement. At the
    very least, this will unsettle the attacker.

o   Don`t run from the aggressor, turn towards him. This may make the
    attacker overshoot.

o   In summary: spot the enemy first. Get into a strong attacking 
    posistion. Attack swiftly, suddenly and aggressively. The get out as
    quickly as possible.

o   As an exercise, try to make a sucessful interception, and attack
    without letting the computer bandit know that you`re there.

o   Fly in pairs. Fly close enough to provide mutual support, but not so
    close that formation flying requires too much attention.
