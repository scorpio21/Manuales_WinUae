 The vulture feeds on carrion:The orb of celestal harmony has been robbed
 by Kaimen who has wasted all the land of Khantum.Your purpose is to
 recover The Celestal Orb through 4 different worlds:
                      -EARTH
                      -WATER
                      -AIR
                      -FIRE
 At the sane time,you'll have to vanquish the EVIL MONKS that are in the
 shrines(understand it as temple".You'll have to set The GOOD MONKS free
 and lead each of them to the way of each temple...
 But BEWARE: Never lead Two Good Monks In one temple ,
 Oder machen sie es auf eigenes Risiko(Or do it At you own risks!!):
 you will have to restart...So be carefull:Only One Good Monk for
 each Free Temple...So Good luck on your quest...

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 OTHER TIPS BY SIYUSOUN (The Don John Master !) :
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The stones sharpen your blade which gets dull when you cut vegetation.
 The hammer break rocks which block your path during game,but take care,
    some rocks are very tough,maybe too much tough for your hammer...
 Try to get magic maps,and all things like this in the chests...
 and save your game when you hold the wished item!

     ~~~~~~
 You'll find two shrines south-east and north-west.
 There is 1 cistern south of the shrine of the N-W and 1 in the town in the
 north.In the east,lives 1 Astrologer.1 island is in the south:you will find
 its entrance in the south,beacause the north is blocked by a wall.
 This island contains the astral door.

 II) WATER:
     ~~~~~~
 It's a world made of water (!!) and small islands.
 You'll find the 2 shrines in the north & south-west.The town is at
 the center of the realm,the cisterns await north-west and north of the
 shrine in the south-west.The Astrologer in on 1 island in the north-east
 and the astral door is north-west.
 NOTE:There are 2 teleportation doors in the town,hidden behind rooms of
 water.

 III) AIR:
      ~~~~
 The 2 shrines are in the south-west and east.The cistern are north-west and
 one between the 2 shrines.The town is north.
 The astrologer is north.The astral door is in the north-west,but stands
 in an empty space,in nothingness!! You will have to turn into a bird
 (Look  § MAGIC) to get there.

 IV) FIRE:
     ~~~~~
 This is your last confrontation! Here,water surrounds you.You are
 in the north-west of the realm.A fortress in in the middle of the realm.
 In the north,you'll find a cistern which teleports you inside the fortress
 You will find the 2 monks in the east in a cistern.
 You have to lead the monks to the fortress: Find the real good way
 to go there,to get to 1 little island,before the monks dies.
 The way is:diagonaly to get to the island,then left:wait here until
 you see the monk.Then some diagonals again and left to reach the entrance
 of the fortress.
 Free the shrines and then you will be given metal gauntlets which
 will allow you to take THE ORB OF CELESTAL HARMONY .Then go to the astral
 door...
