Manchester United - Premier League Champions


 CHEAT:

 When you concede a penalty, push the joystick up and keep the button
 pressed down and your goalie will always save it.

 Also, immediately after you score a goal, keep on tapping the [R] key
 to flick to and from the replay. About 50% of the time it will credit
 you with another goal even though you have only scored one.
 Be warned though - sometimes the opposition gets a goal instead of an
 extra one for yourself.
