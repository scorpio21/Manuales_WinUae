     MERCENARY:  Escape from Targ

        -- Interesting ideas:
            - Go to the kitchen in  Palayar Colony Craft at 08.08, alt:64997.
              after dropping all your items, pick up the kitchen sink.  This
              will allow you to pick up any objects that were already solid,
              such as the skull and crossbones symbols, spacecraft and the
              spiders web.  The spiders web allows you to open any locked
              doors.  Taking the skull and crossbones symbol off the door
              allows you to enter saftely.
            - If you fall out of the Palayar Colony Craft and are carrying
              the cheese, press 'L' to stop falling, drop the cheese and
              board it.  You can now fly arround.
            - Once you have finnished the game, and the congratulatory
              message has been given, keep pressing 'D' to drop all your
              objects and then 'L' to leave the ship.  Wait for the
              elevation to reach zero and press 'Ctrl-Q'.  You will now
              find yourself back on Targ with a new ship, but the message,
              'GAME OVER' is constantly displayed.
            - When first crashing on Targ, don't touch the keyboard for a
              while to see some humourous comments appear from Benson.
            - If you destroy the 'Encounter' sign and try to leave the
              planet, you will be told, 'The author won't let you leave
              untill you fix his advert.'  Either not shoot it, or repair
              it with the anti-time bomb.
            - When being attacked by an enemy ship, fly backwards at a speed
              of -625 so that it follows you.  Then you can shoot it.
            -  Get the spiders web  from complex 09.06 and use it instead of
              the pass to get the Interstellar Ship from complex 03.15
              and then just fly off the planet to compleate the game.
            - While in possession of the kitchen sink, you can pick the
              Palayar Brother In-law's spaceship and put it on another path.
            - Entering the door marked with a skull and crossbones in the
              laboratory, will transport you back to the ground and all
              locations are reversed.
            - Fall off the Colony Craft and press 'L' to stop your falling.
              You can now walk around, drop objects and use ships as though
              you are on the ground.

           Doors:
            - Diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right, |\| are
              transporter exits only.
            - Diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left, |/| are
              transporter entrances only.
            - Cross go both directions.

           Objects:
              Antenna..........Makes the radio in the communications room
                               work.
              Antigrav.........enables you to pick up very heavy objects,
                               such as ships.
              Anti-time Bomb...Reassembles any building previously destroyed.
                               Just fire at the wreckage and it reassembles.
              Photon Emitter...Acts as a torch.
              Sights...........Helps your aim.
              Metal Detector...Changes the colour of the information pannel
                               to who owns the land:
                               RED - No one owns it.
                               GREEN - Palyar.
                               BLUE - Mechanoids.
              Poweramp.........Boosts the speed of the Dominion Dart to that
                               of the cheese while carried.
              Novadrive........Enables the Intergalactic Craft to function.

Mercenary - The Second City
---------------------------

Fly the dominion dart as usual, fly to above 350 metres, level off (your
speed should be 1,781 kph) and fire a missile.  Pick the missile up once you
get close to it and then land.  Go to 08,08, take the crashed intergalactic 
craft and go to 08,06, go underground, exit your ship and walk through the 
triangular door - you now have access to the authors cheat room where you'll 
get keys to every door, passes out of prison and the ability to carry a lot
of stuff.
