                    MEAN STREETS SOLUTION

Unless you are really stuck.  I wouldn't recommend using the 
solve since the story of the game will be greatly hindered (and 
its a great story!).  I haven't included what the entire plot is 
so as not to ruin it.  So, use them when you need'em...

SOLVING MEAN STREETS 
-------------------- 

Although at first you are investigating into Carl Linsky's 
murder, things get deeper and eventually you find yourself on a 
mad plot to save everyone's brains (you'll understand as you play 
the game).  Your primary objective then, is to gather up all
eight passcards and passwords from eight scientists and use them 
to activate the destruct sequence on the "central" computer.  
Here are the locations of all the cards and any special things 
required to get them. 

ORANGE (Cal Davis).  Password: CHECKMATE 
     This is found in the box found in the ape's cage in Cal 
     Davis' lab at NC 3720.  To get it, you will need the pole found 
     in Greg Call's lab (NC 8911). 
     SECURITY:  Move Rat Cages.  Open Control Box.  Turn Off 
                Switch. 
 
PURPLE (Greg Call).  Password: KNIGHT 
     This is found on the shelf behind the vines on the large 
     stalagtite in his lab at NC 8911.  You will need the leather 
     gloves found in Cal Davis' Lab (NC 3720).
     SECURITY:  Move small Stalagtite.  On/Off Button. 
 
BLUE (Carl Linsky).  Password: BISHOP 
     This is found in Carl Linsky's Lab/Warehouse at NC 4675.  It
     is found in the Band Aids can inside the wall-mounted Cabinet. 
     SECURITY:  Open Bar.  Move Shoebox.  Turn Off Switch. 

RED (Ron Morgan).  Password: STALEMATE 
     This is found in Ron Morgan's Beach House at NC 6470.  It is
     inside the fish tank containing the killer fish.  You will 
     require the fish food (to occupy them) which is found behind the
     plant in the upper left corner of the room. 
     SECURITY:  On/Off Button 3 on Coffee Table. 
 
GREEN (John Klause).  Password: PAWN 
     Find John at NC 7012 and ask for it. 
 
YELLOW (Sam Jones).  Password: QUEEN 
     Find Sam at NC 0021 and ask for it (you may have to beat or
     bribe it out of him). 
 
GREY (Larry Hammond).  Password: KING 
     Enter the Law and Order's Head Office at NC 5037.  It should
     be in the safe (whose combination is in the closet inside the 
     coat). 
     SECURITY: On/Off Button at Desk.  Open Closet. (It's in 
               there somewhere! - Can't remember right now.) 
 
BLACK (Bosworth Clark).  Password: ROOK 
     This can be found in the Bus Station at NC 5194.  You will 
     require the key found in Frank Schimming's/Lola Lovetoy's 
     Apartment (NC 4605)
     SECURITY: Move Art.  On/Off Button. 
 
NOTE:  Some of the security systems are only activated if you try
       to steal something valuable. 
 
[==============================================================] 
 
That's all it takes to solve it.  But there is a lot of running 
around and a lot of interaction between characters in order to 
find the locations for most of these places and people (along 
with getting roughed up a little, getting sprayed with mace, and
getting a whopping kick to the groin). 
 
Though the company must have over estimated the difficulty of 
their game.  What they judged as taking 20-40 hours, I completed
in about 10 to 10 1/2.  Though, the game wasn't easy... just 
didn't take THAT long. 
 
I've also included the "Mean Streets Yellow Pages: Everyone 
you'll ever wanna meat in Mean Streets."
