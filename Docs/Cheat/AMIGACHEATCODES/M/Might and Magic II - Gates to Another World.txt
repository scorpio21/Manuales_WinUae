INTRODUCTION TO CORAK'S TRAVELOGUE

  Corak the Mysterious disappeared in a fiery blast of energy while searching for a means to save the world of Cron from destruction.  He had told no one of his previous attempts to rescue the world and had kept his efforts shrouded in secrecy.  The nobles of the realm commenced a search of his dwelling so that they could learn about the danger and maybe what had happened to Corak.  No major clues were discovered.  However, a most interesting journal was found.

  This journal, which follows shortly hereafter, details the world of Cron.  Modern Cron, including the fearsome Elemental Planes, is divided into 60 maps of 16x16 dimension. (which you'll half to map yourself because I don't have a scanner!)  Areas of major importance such as castles, towns, highways, caverns, and dungeons are highlighted.  Ancient ruins are marked down and noted, secret paths and passageways are uncovered, and warning signs lead away from locations of great natural hazards.

  Also included in Corak's journal is a compendium of weapons, items, and miscellaneous equipment.  Functions of these articles are alos noted.  Perhaps most useful and interesting of all is a list of every monster encountered in the history of Cron.  The list contains all that is known about each monster; strengths, weaknesses, and immunities.

  Corak also left many riddles to be diciphered (which I will so kindly let you decipher).  It is believed that these riddles offer insight into how to solve the mysteries and puzzles which Cron hides.  They might even contain information as to how to relieve Cron of its impending doom.

  The journal of Corak is given to the hearty adventurer as a guide and supplement for adventure in the world of Cron.  With perseverance, determination, and a little luck Cron can be saved from catastrophic end.

TOWNS OF CRON

  Towns are the cornerstone of life and society in Cron.  Practically all transactions of every type and manner take place in the five proud towns. 

  Characters can purchase rations, hear the most thrilling rumors in Cron, and eat and drink exotic creations in the Taverns.  At the Blacksmith's, characters can choose from a wide variety of weapons, armor, and useful items, some even are enchanted.  The Mage Guilds teach many useful and powerful spells to the fledging or accomplished Sorcerer.  Temples provide healing for a price and teach spells to aspiring Clerics.  At an Inn, Hirelings can be added to the party.  Training facilities offer different degrees of expertise to the advancing character.  Finally, three towns provide entertainment through combat arenas.

                           
The Town of Middlegate

  The most important town in all of Cron, Middlegate is the hub of commerce.  A simple town, Middlegate's wide plazas and multitude of shops make it unlike any other town.  Every building is occupied, some by residents who wish the trespasser ill.  Some of the places that should be visited are The Arena, Travel Moore, Otto Mapper, Esq., and the kindly wizard Nordon.

The Town of Atlantium

  This is the noblest and most advanced town in Cron.  Atlantium boasts an interesting statuary, the only City Jail in all of Cron, and some of the finest Secondary Skills available.  The Atlantians are also profit hungry, and their town is the most expensive.  However, the quality of items and services are generally worth the exorbitant price.  Do not miss The Colosseum, the most magnificient and challenging of the three combat arenas in Cron.
 
The Town of Tundara

  Located in the frigid Ice Tundra, Tundara is a lonely and secretive town.  Terrorized by various snowbeasts, Tundara has a wild outer wall and town seperated from the safer, conservative inner town.  Rumors of dangerous experiments taking place in the outer wall abound.  This deadly town has a justifiably bad reputation which should be heeded.

The Town of Vulcania

  In this extremely hot town, only the most rugged survive.  Frequented by many warriors, this mercenary town is actually built upon an active volcano.  Adventurers are thus advised to watch what doors they open, as lava may flow upon the unwary.  The central statuary should be seen, as should the Wild Section.  For military skills, this town offers unparalleled opportunity.

The Town of Sandsobar

  This barren town is run by thrifty desert traders.  Gambling is popular as is crime.  The Slums are a hotbed of violence and deceit, and the shops are too expensive for what they offer.  The narrow alleyways harbor seedy criminals, and the shop themselves dishonest proprietors.  Monstor Bowl, the combat arena, is perhaps the only plus in this ramshackled town.  Caution and distrust are the way of life here, so adapt.  

THE CAVERNS

  These 16 natural formations occur throughout Cron.  Every town has a subterranean level, and many others are scattered across the world, serving as homes, hideouts, or haunts.  They are generally unsafe, but can be tamed.  If a cavern appears too hard to adventure in, come back  to it later when you have a larger arsenal at your disposal.

The Cavern below Middlegate

  This cavern is a hideout for some ruthless and daring criminals.  Two rival gangs war for subterranean authority, each having stolen something valuable from the town above.  Their hideouts are well guarded, but successful recovery of the items can lead to great reward in the town above.  Examine closely the walls here, for much useful information can be found by the observant.

The Cavern below Atlantium

  The Atlantians are busily revamping this cavern, hoping to make it civilized.  Many statues decorate the area, each offering its own reward.  Only the foolhardy enter the maze area, though those that survive often leave more intelligent than when they entered.  Information here can lead to companions and great success in tournaments.

The Cavern below Tundara

  This cavern serves as a warm place to stay for the towns people above when Tundara freezes over.  Divided into four parts, a mystic machine allows instant access to anywhere in the cavern.  Many unique and curious things are stored here, some useful, some deadly.  Much information as to location of powerful items and spells can be found here.

The Cavern below Vulcania

  This cavern is a test in endurance and skill.  At the end of every path here, a reward is to be found.  However, many deterrents add danger to the paths.  Levitation proves its usefulness when spelunking about.  People in need of help should be attended to and information should be recorded.  A warning, only the truly hardy should visit here.

The Cavern below Sandsobar

  This vermin-infested cavern is home to two nefarious master thieves.  One will help the untrained while the other plays sly tricks.  Beware ankle traps and obvious choices.  Here also are passes of eight.  Information learned here can help with later adventures and combination locks.

Corak's Cavern

  This cavern was once the private home and workshop of mighty Corak, now it is his tomb.  The cavern is overrun by the most foul of the Undead, who have turned this once prodigious laboratory into a sideshow and a hostel for restless spirits.  Adventurers need a pass to view Corak's Crypt, and can only be Clerics if they wish to actually view Corak's body.  Only valiant Lloyd, one of Corak's assistants, remains hidden in the cave, offering information for those willing to learn.

Square Lake Cavern

  Little is known about this region.  Rumors abound of endless corridors and Demon King guardians.  It is a place of great evil and should be avoided by all but the most qualified and mighty.

Ice Cavern

  This desolate cavern is home to desperate, renegade monsters fleeing the piercing cold of the Ice Tundra and the stiff arm of justice.  They use the cave as a center from which to organize raiding parties of adjacent environs.  As a result of their raids, there is a large stockpile of guarded treasure in the cavern.  It is rumored that a vist to the Ice Caverns can serve as an enhancement to Personality.

Sarakin's Mine

  This deserted mine was once an incredibly rich source of gold in time long past.  However, as the years progressed, its proprietor, Sarakin, grew more and more concerned with his rapidly advancing age.  As he searched fanatically for a cure to aging, he became quite mad and eventually died.  His malignant spirit is said to terrorize the crumbling mineshafts.

Murray's Cavern 

  This is where Murray, retired adventurer extraordinaire, runs his vacation empire.  Murray has very good information lines and has many useful facts for the party shrewd enough to discover it all.  Murray himself has much to offer friendly adventurers.  His Power Oil and Goofy Juice are perhaps two of the most powerful potions developed in modern Cron.  Be warned, do not steal from Murray, he is ruthless!

Druid's Point Cavern

  Originally established as a center to study the force of nature, this once proud facility is now divided by warring factions.  Disciples of Water, Air, Fire and Earth have been subverted from their original course of study to a new route of fighting by the Elemental Lords.  Chief amoung the new order is The Horvath, a deadly, mutated human.  A venerable druid master, the last hope of the old genre, will  greatly reward anyone who will help him restore order in his domain.

Forbidden Forest Cavern

  This once pristine forest is now a bastion of evil might.  A gruesome army run by pair of clever dragons operates from this cavern.           
The dragon leader, believed to be a Frost Dragon, is rumored to be wanted killed by the Jurors of Mount Farview.  Paladins should especially be interested in this.  A word to the wise, stay away from here suicidal.  The army is very large and very strong.

Dragon's Dominion

  Ever wonder what would happen if over one hundred dragons decided to form an organized community?  Well, trespass in this their home and learn the hard way!  This messy kingdom holds best treasure in all of Cron.  The dragons are not particularly worried about theft, as they have many powerful guards throughout their home.  The Ancient Dragon who rules has also been emntrusted with the guardianship of valuable  secrets dealing with Hit Points.  A lesson; many of the ambitious have come here seeking wealth and adventure, only the fleet of foot have survived.

Dawn's Mist Cavern

  Upset that only humanoids could rest at Murray's Resort Isle, Dawn, once his protege, built Dawn's Mist Cavern.  In here, monsters can rest easy and enjoy themselves from the rigors of harassing humanity.  Different theme rooms provide a variety of entertainment suit to fit the most discriminating of violent tastes.  Dawn also has some precious artifacts stored here.  Be sure not to disrupt the monsters at play.   They do not appreciate interruptions while they are on vacation.

Gemmaker Volcano

  This cavern is the richest depository of gems in all of Cron.  It will probably remain so for many years to come, as no one has found a safe way to travel through the molten core of an active volcano.  The timeworn Gemmaker makes his home in these fiery depths where he cuts precious gems, makes powerful weapons with fire built into them, and studies the finer aspects of enchanting weapons.  A recluse, he will teach only the persistent in his arts, and often extracts a hard price from them.

Nomadic Rift Cavern

  This simple cavern houses those who flee the restraints of city life.  They have bonded together in order to survive the harshness of the area about them.  They share everything and have caches of treasure and weapons throughout their domicile.  The nomads also collect information in order to keep in touch with the world around them, and have an exclusive library of fact and rumor scattered amidst their long halls.  It is also rumored that they can train the ability Speed to those who are willing.


THE CASTLES

  In the modern world of Cron, there are four castles spread across the land.  The lord of each castle dispenses justice in his or her region.  They also aid Crusaders by giving them quests to complete.  Most castles are heavily guarded against casual visitors, so do not wander around much.  In times past, there was a fifth castle that was destroyed.  Its floorplans are printed for posterity's sake.

Castle Hillstone

  Scenic Castle Hillstone, nestled between the Quaqmire of Doom, the Plains of Peril, and the Lithospheric Barrier, is nearly as deadly as its surrounding lands.  Lord Slayer, a sadistic yet just a man, keeps a bevy of some of his favorite monsters in his infamous Zoo.  However, he is constantly seeking more trophies and will not hesitate to ask the more adventurous party to bring him them.  Slayer is not without a lighter side and his Court Jester, Foof, does his best to entertain Slayer's guests.

  Points of interest: The Bishop of Red Battle takes forced residence within these halls.  If you require help in your adventures, visit Prison.

Castle Woodhaven

  Castle Woodhaven, encircled by Timberlands, Lost Soul's Woods, and Corpse Creek, is perhaps the most elegant castlee in all of Cron.  Avaricious Lord Hoardall constantly seeks new items to add to his renown collection of baubles.  A man of great trust, much of Hoardall's cache lays strewn about the castle halls.  Do not think to enrich yourself at his expense.  He has a mind like an elephant and his servants will cause a thief much grief.
Assorted tidbits:  Hoardall has recently added the Bishop of Green Battle to his collection.

Castle Pinehurst

  Surrounded by Ice Tundra, sparse forests, and Cronian Waters, Castle Pinehurst has possibly the strangest combination of local environs.  Lord Peabody Von Pinehurst is also quite probably the most singular noble on Cron.  He dabbles in sciences and wizardries even the most foolhardy would shy away from.  Lord Peabody respects loyalty above  all else and often ask friends to help out other friends.

  Things to remember:  The Bishop of Yellow Battle is not a loyal friend of Lord Peabody.  Also, beware time when you walk through this castle's halls.

Luxus Palace Royale

  This elegant captiol of Cron is rather inaccessible except to the adventurous.  Nervous Queen Lamanda, ever-aware of her father's greatness, holds a feeble hand over the reins of government.  Since Corak abandoned his study and disappeared, Luxus Palace has been a dangerous place to stay.  To have audience with the Queen you must satisfy her exacting conditions, winning both the Black Ticket Triple Crown and successfully completing the tasks laid forth by the Jurors of Mount Farview.

  Royal Gossip:  This Bishop of Black Battle has had a fight with Queen Lamanda and is locked up.  However, he too particularly enjoys Black Ticket Triple Crown winners.

Castle Xabran

  This castle of the past rested central in Cron before it was destroyed by the Elemental Lords at the end of the Ninth Century.  Castle Xabran was a hub of learning and information.  Keys to powerful artifacts and answers to puzzles and messages were kept here.  Studies of time were begun here and locations of mighty adventurers and powerful spells were discovered and recorded through arcane devices.  Seek this castle in help in adventuring.

DUNGEONS
 
  Each modern castle has its own pair of dungeons beneath it.  The dungeons serve many purposes, most of them disagreeable.  They also hide many items of value and clues of extreme interest.  They should be avoided until characters have achieved a high level of potency.  Each lord's dungeon has some unmistakable, personal touch to it.  There are 10 dungeons, 8 of the various lords, and 1 each to the good and evil wizards of the Isle of the Ancients.

Slayer's Dungeon

Level 1:  Lord Slayer's rather straightforward dungeon holds some items of interest for Ninjas and Barbarians.  Unfortunately, they cannot be present to recieve these items.  Lord Slayer is quite generous to parties with no Half-Orcs.  It is also rumored that Might can be exchanged for Intelligence here, that a teleporter to Lord Hoardall's Dungeon offers express travel, and that a mystical fountain converts treasure into experience, though rumor as to the fountain's exact dungeon level contradicts itself.  Finally, a note from the wise, avoid spikes.

Level 2:  This deadly dungeon of Lord Slayer is much like his first level, only more difficult.  Again, Ninjas and Barbarians desire items hidden here, but cannot be present in the dungeon.  Half-Orcs have no reason to be kept in the party while in this dungeon.  The mystical fountain of experience might be located on this level, though rumor sometimes mentions that Lord Slayer actually has two fountains.  Also of interest in this dungeon, many who come adventuring with a party of mixed sex leave all male after extended stays.  Beware poison!

Hoardall's Dungeon

Level 1:  This maze-like dungeon holds treasure that augment the abilities of both Robbers and Clerics.  Lord Hoardall keeps these items to insure he has the upper hand on the people most likely to take money from him.  For some strange reason, Hoardall also has taken a dislike to Elves, and has a device which discriminates against that elder race.  If you wish, exchange Might for Personality.  Avoid darts whenever possible.

Level 2:  Lord Hoardall wants no visitors in this dungeon and has thus made it near impossible for adventurers to travel about.  It is rumored that in addition to the artifacts for Robbers and Clerics and the rewards for non-Elves, there is a pool which makes all Neutral and  a legendary fountain which allows you to exchange gems for experience.  It is further known that Personality can be traded for Luck.

Peabody's Dungeon

Level 1:  As Lord Peabody's castle is filled with arcane traps, so is his dungeon.  Watch your spell points when you travel through these dank passageways.  This confusing maze hides objects useful to both Knights and Paladins not present.  Accuracy may be gained in exchange for Speed, or if you have patience, for nothing.  Humans should be left behind before entering this dungeon.

Level 2:  Lord Peabody's second labyrinthine dungeon leave its treasures out in the open, but only the most powerful and innovative adventurer can gain access to them.  Spell points  turn to naught here, yet all spells cna be learned for a steep price in the dungeon.  Knights and Paladins, as well as Humans, should be left behind when conquering this musty dungeon.  Lord Peabody has left an amulet to change all to Good and a way to convert Luck into Personality.

Lamanda's Dungeon

Level 1:  The Royal Dungeon houses some of the most incorrigible criminals in the land.  Only Royal Guards are allowed free passage through this deadly dungeon.  Unauthorized visitors will be fined severely.  Some of the more enterprising guards have set up an exchange program, Endurance for Speed.  Sorcerers and Archers should note that items are stored here for their use.  Dwarves should stay away from this dungeon, if they wish to retain their party's goodwill.

Level 2:  This puzzling dungeon holds messages about Cron's secrets and only the most meticulous adventurer will get the entire answer.  Some of the worst criminals, salesmen, have free reign in this dungeon.  Amoung the things that can be purchased or found are a focal point for Evil, a way to exchange Might for Speed, a means of changing from Male to Female, a way to increase Hit Points if you are not a Dwarf, items useful to Archer and Sorcerers, and a mystic Hit Point Maximizer.

Dark Keep

  This maze holds within it one-half of the path of completion for Sorcerers, the Mastery of Evil.  Follow the advice of the Jurors of Mount Farview and the Status of Atlantium before venturing here.  Bring many Sorcerers here, for it is only they who can explore this dire castle.  Look to the walls and answer the riddles to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

Tower of Mercy

  Resting on the southern portion of the Isle of the Ancients, this castle guards the secrets for manipulating the Good component of Sorcery.  Stack you party with Sorcerers after visiting Mout Farview and Atlantium and wresting from them their knowledge to add to your own.  Remember, choose the proper doors to walk through or fight near continuously.

OUTDOOR REGIONS 

  Travel cautiosly when outdoors.  The lords of Cron have set up a road system which is the most safe way to travel, short of magic, between towns and castles.  For open, wide spaces a Navigator is necessary so as not to become lost.  There are many natural hazards, distinct to each of the 20 regions that can be devasting if they catch a party unawares.  Weaker parties should avoid the outdoors.

Region Layout

 A1 B1 C1 D1 E1
 A2 B2 C2 D2 E2
 A3 B3 C3 D3 E3
 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4

Region A1

  One of the four corners of Cron, anchored onto the tempestuous Elemental Plane of Air, this region is primarily a frigid wasteland.  The sturdy town of Tundara is the lone outpost of civilization in the area.  While travelling, stick to the road as blizzards, snow drifts, and avalanches ravage this desolate province.

Region A2

  Castle Pinehurst, the westernmost seat of civilization and authority, rests in this bizarre, half tundra, half timberland terrain.  Surrounded by the evil Sarakin's Mine, a focal point of evil spirits waiting for the foolish to entertain them, and the dreaded Death Spider, responsible for keeping the area free of corpses and living bodies, Lord Peabody erratically maintains order in this, his immediate domain.

Region A3

  A truly grisly region.  Corpses line the seashore as the fearsome Siren causes more and more shipwrecks in the treacherous waters, complete with tidal waves and whirlpools, around the Petrified Peninsula.  On land, flying dragons swoop down on the unaware traveler for an easy meal.  Many adventurers have met their doom here, believing themselves stronger than they actually were.

Region A4

  Waves of water seeping in incredible quatities from the Elemental Plane of Water make this aqueous region a popular place for watery death of mighty travellers.  Perhaps the only reason to journey here is to visit proud Atlantium, most sophisticated of the five cities.  Rumor has it that the Pearl Islands are a source of great wealth for the city's mining crew.

Region B1

  Perhaps the most mile tundra region, Fortress Haart, home to an ancient noble line, rests in this inhospitable, icy zone.  A majestic Pegasi is said to live here, waiting patiently to aid the true saviors of Cron.  Also, a warlike group monsters is said to conduct raids out of an artic ice cavern hidden deep within the swirling snows.

Region B2 

  One month out of the year, the fabulous Circus sets its tents up in this pleasant meeting place.  Troughout the rest of the year, different groups hold conventions and meetings in the Falcon Forest.  It is best not to disturb these meetings unless you are invited.  Another person not to disturb is Baron Wilfrey, who terrorizes the wood with his fabled bow and arrow.

Region B3

  This region has two main attractions for the curious adventurer.  First, the Dark Keep, home of the evil sorcerer Ybmug, rests upon the northernmost tip of the Isle of the Ancients.  This forbidden tower is of particular interest to Sorcerers throughout the land.  Next, the mighty Dread Knight jousts regularly here, defeating all Knights who have faced him in recent times.

Region B4

  The superstar of Cron, Murray, has his world famous resort isle nestled in the lulling waves of the gentle ocean.  The aged and beaten party will find relaxation and solace in kindly Murray's hot springs, gym, and other leisure-minded activities.  Also of note is the good wizard Yekop's Tower of Mercy, located on the southern tip of the Isle of the Ancients. For the curious, visit Native's Cove, where cannibalism still thrives.

Region C1 

  Castle Woodhaven, home to advaricious Lord Hoardall, guards the northernmost of the realm's frontiers.  His job as peace-keeper is difficult at best, as his immediate neighbors are the vile undead of Lost Soul's Woods and Corpse Creek.  If you seek action, visit the Hermitt of Beggar's Grove and help him recover what he has lost.  Lastly, this region is loaded with magic, so be aware of any opportunities.

Region C2

  The hub of Cron, the town of Middlegate serves as the center of trade and commerce for the civilized.  As a result, enchanted roads lead to all land-bound towns and castles in the realm.  Many interesting locales are to be found here.  Square Lake, shrouded in dire mystery, ruins of Mystic Castle Xabran, destroyed by Elemental Lords, and abandoned Corak's Cavern all lie nearby, waiting to be explored.

Region C3

  The inherent evil of the Forbidden Forest intrudes upon the natural calm of Druids Point.  The druids have set up a defensive perimeter to defend against the evil menace.  Of special note to inquisitive travelers is Murray's Boat Ride.  Simply make reservations in Middlegate, embark at the dock, and see Crom as it should be seen - at a distance.

Region C4

  On the west, Barbaric Hills, on the east, Quagmire of Doom.  This is not a region to take young, inexperienced adventurers.  King Kalohn fought the Mega Dragon in this once fertile savannah turned swamp and ever since evil has flourished here and throughout Cron.  Watch where you step, for quicksand and sinkholes abound.

Region D1

  An area of great peril, this is where King Kalohn blasted a mountain to defeat the four elemental lords.  The derivative of the battle is the Dead Zone, a tract of land so ruinous that to enter it is to die.  And ensconced in the hills bordering this fatal area is Dragon's Dominion, the realm of the majestic dragons of Cron.  And to complement the hazards of the area, Bozorc and his cluster of bandits raid travelers who journey the once safe Queen's Road.

Region D2

  The capitol and seat of government of all Cron rests here, in Luxus Palace Royale.  Queen Lamanda rules the realm with a tremulous grip.  On the road to the palace, her brother, the audacious Mandagual, has set up a toll station in direct conflict with Lamanda's wishes.  The only people above the Queen's jurisdiction, the Jurors of Mount Farview, also hold court in the region.  Stay away from the desert, for it is not heedlessly named Desolation.

Region D3

  This vacuous region does not have too much to offer the swashbuckling adventurer.  The supreme Mr. Wizard studies in the Arcane Wilderness, hoping to find the rumored Lich Lord who dwells within its confines.  He offers his services for a steep fee, but knows every spell in existence.  The only other inhabitant of the area is a rather crazy old man who once worked in the Circus.  Converse with both characters, as they have much to offer.

Region D4

  Bloodthirsty Lord Slayer decided to build grim Castle Hillstone, Guardian of the Southern Realm, on the border of the Quagmire of Doom and Dawn's Mist Bog so that he could go to battle frequently.  He certainly chose the right place, as monsters constantly traverse in and out of Dawn's Mist Cavern, mord often than not to the Quagmire itself.  Slayer has had problems recently with farmers, and recommends that citizens do not tour any.

Region E1

  This explosive region is riddled with volcanoes and lava pools creeping from the Elemental Plane of Fire.  The arid town of Vucania lies beneath the shadows of many dormant volcanoes, offering a safe place for expeditioners to linger.  One should not stray from the roads, unless complete immunity to heat and fire is gained.

Region E2

  This is the singlemost deadly region in all of Cron.  Thrilling seeking acventurers will have many battles of which epic sagas could be made.  The Desert of Desolation also offers two interesting resort areas, though only the most staunch and fearless characters can appreciate what they have to offer.  A Navigator is a necessity for travel.

Region E3

  Earthquakes and sandstorms ravage the barren countryside as monsters patrol the area seeking food.  Concealed on the desert border, the Nomadic Rift Cavern offers escape from the patrols and civilization.  The Inner Limits is rumored to do both great harm and great good, dependent upon previous actions.  Walk carefully here.

Region E4  

  Sandsobar, the most decrepit and depraved of all Cronian cities, brazenly sits in the shadow of the Elemental Plane of Earth.  Though rocked occasionally by earthquakes, this region is surprisingly safe and sedate.  This is a good place for yound travelers to visit.

ELEMENTAL PLANES

  The four elemental planes are perhaps the most deadly locales in Cron.   Special preparations must be made prior to expeditions, for each plane is composed entirely of its element, making it very difficult for non-elementals to get around.  Each elemental lord can perhaps destroy any adventurer foolish enough to challenge his supremacy.

Elemental Plane of Water

  Mighty Lord Acwalandar is best avoided on this, his home plane of existence.  He keeps many minions on hand for amusement and protection.  Adventurers are advised not to visit this endless stretch of water unless they extraordinarily powerful.  Of course, Lord Acwalandar also guards a coveted talisman of power, nestled in a hidden shrine somewhere on the plane.  If you seek exit from here, rest.

Elemental Plane of Air

  Flighty Lord Shalwned discourages adventurers from travelling to his airy plateau by having a vast number of patrols scour the area fro humanoid life.  Hence, only the foolhardy come here voluntarily.  Rumor has it that a mystic temple houses a powerful device which allows control over Air itself.  If you seek exit from here, rest.

Elemental Plane of Fire

  Sadistic Lord Pyrranaste encourages brutality and fighting amoung his subjects. He believes it builds character in his minions.  It also makes the Elemental Plane of Fire a dangerous place to stay.  A flame-guarded mosque is believed to hide an arcane amulet of destruction.  If you seek exit from here, rest.

Elemental Plane of Earth 

  The Imperial Lord Galkor, former Tyrant of Cron, does not allow admittance to his kingdom by non-elemental creatures.  Nevertheless, many come to seek a powerful shrine which house an earthen charm of high potency.  None have found it and lived.  If you seek exit from here, rest.

CLUES AND HINTS

  There are many details that have to be sorted out in the world of Cron.  Formidable quests must be completed, potent artifacts must be recovered, and personal power of all manners and all forms must be earned and then augmented.

  Following is a compendium of all of the most useful hints and clues necessary to adventure in Cron.  The most basic clues are listed plainly, with exact location and coordinates given.  Also, the more difficult goals are listed clearly, as simply arriving at the objective is an arduous task in itself and once you arrive, you discover that you were supposed to bring a certain something with you.  The difficult and most important clues have been encoded, so that the casual glance does not ruin the rest of the game.

  Happy adventuring and good luck!

Messages

  There are three different encoded messages spread across Cron.  Yellow eases travel while Green and Red help the adventurer save Cron.

Green Message         Yellow Message       Red Message

The Significance of Keys

  Throughout Cron, keys play a major role.  Between the different colored keys, Mark's Keys, and the Castle Key, many locks will be opened.

  First of all, the Castle Key comes into play.  In order to gain easy access to each castle, the key must be shown as a pass.  To obtain the key, see first the Wizard Nordon in Middlegate and then his sister Nordonna.  Upon completing Nordonna's task, she will explain all.

  Next come the four colored keys, Green, Yellow, Red, and Black.  A locksmith selling one type of each key can be found in each town, save  Tundara which has none.  In each of the four major castles, Hillstone, Pinehurst, and Woodhaven, as well as Luxus Palace Royale, there resides a Bishop of similar color to each key.  Each key frees the corresponding Bishop from imprisonment.  However, greater rewards can reaped if for each color the party first wins in every one of the three combat arenas.  For example, a party which has obtained a Green Key then proceeds to fight Green Ticket in the Arena, Monster Bowl, and Colosseum.  They then free the Bishop of Green Battle from his incarceration and recieve a hero's reward.  Find the Bishops as follows.

Bishop of Green Battle: 
   Castle Woodhaven                         10,6

Bishop of Yellow Battle:
    Castle Pinehurst                        13,3

Bishop of Red Battle:
    Castle Hillstone                        11,4

Bishop of Black Battle:
    Castle Palace Royale:                   14,14

  Finally, Mark's Keys must be found.  Before this, Mark himself must be sought out.

  Find Mark in Beggar's Grove, Area C1 at 1,1.

  Find his keys in the Death Spider Lair, Area A2 at 2,9.

  For those willing to part with gems, a dragon will trade some of his vast experience for them in Hoardall's Dungeon, Level Two at 4,4.

  In the dungeons below each castle, characters can gain a randow amount of Hit Points permanently if they follow the proper procedure.  Make sure the you heed the signs that isolate the different races, and then actively seek out where they are prohibited entry.  Depending upon the dungeon level, few or many Hit Points can be attained.

  The dragons in the Dragons Dominion guard two ways to increase Hit Points.  For characters lesser in power, visit 0,0.  Of course, guards will attempt to block your passage.  For characters of great strength, a dangerous way to raise potential by an incredible amount is to defeat the Ancient Dragon at 15,8.

  For those who could not afford the steep price of the finest training from level to level, there is a Hit Point Maximizer which will raise the Hit Point level to its current maximum, calculating both Level and Endurance.  Find it hidden in Queen Lamanda's Dungeon, Level Two at 0,15.  Much wealth should be brought, as the price is exorbitant.

  Are the spell-casters in your party having problems finding all the spells scattered throughout Cron?  There is a simple solution, bring all your spell-casters and all your gold (and some more!) to Lord Peabody's Dungeon, Level Two at 0,0.  All spells will then be known by all characters present.

Tavern Specialties

  Most people think that each town's tavern is only a place to procure food, listen to the patrons exchange wild rumors, or unearth the bartender's personal thoughts on affairs in Cron.  However, the taverns also offer speciality gourmet meals and exotic drinks which can alter each and every adventurer's disposition temporarily.

  Each tavern has the same drink menu, use the code key to decipher what attribute each drink effects.  (Remember, if you drink too many exotic drinks, you could become sick.)

Key to Might and Magic Two Item List

  Over 250 total items are to be found in Might and Magic II.  Of these 250 items, there are three major types to which they may be classified.  Weapons, which have been subdivided into one-handed, two-handed, and missile lists, armor, which has been split into body armor and shield/helmets, and finally miscellaneous items, those items not previously able to be classified.

  Each list follows the same basic menu system.  First, the name of the item as it appears in the game is listed.  For each individual list, those items appearing in it have been alphabetized for your convience.

  Next, class restrictions are printed.  The first letter of any class able to use the item is used to designate the limitation.  The eight classes are represented as follows: (K)night, (P)aladin, (A)rcher, (S)orcerer, (C)leric, (R)obber, (N)inja, and (B)arbarian.  An example; a KSR assignation means that only (K)nights, (S)orcerers, and (R)obbers can use that specific item.  If no letters are printed, then all classes may use the item. 

  Thirdly come up the Equip Bonus.  Any power that the item might alter is listed along with the degree to which that statistic or resistance is raised.  If the item cannot be equipped, then "no equip" appears.  If the item has no magical force that changes statistics, then the space is left blank.  A note: items affect individual elements rather than elements as a whole.  Also, PHP stands for Poison/Hold/Paralyze, AC for Armor Class, Enrg for energy, and Thf for the Thievery ability.

  Special Powers, if any, follow.  The same abbreviations are used as in the Equip Bonus column.  Additionally, spells are listed as follows: an S or C denote whether the spell is a Sorcerous or Clerical spell.  Then the level of the spell and spell number on that level are listed.  So, if S7/3 is listed it would mean that the item can cast Sorcerer level 7 spell number 3, Etherealize.  Every item with a special power has a randomly determined, finite number of charges.  A Detect Magic spell will inform you of the charges remaining.  An item does not need to be equipped for its special power to be used.  Remember, a special item is temporary.

  Next come the Gold Value of that item.  Items are normally sold for one-quarter total value.  Merchants can sell items for one-half total cost.  Store Keepers are under no such limitations and often sell items at inflated prices.

  Finally, for weapons comes the Damage/Bonus.  This is the amount of damage the weapon does without modifiers.  Strength modifies damage done and accuracy modifies the characters chance to hit.  A weapon with a "+", for example +3 long Sword, modifies both to hit and damage numbers.  For armor, the final category, Armor, lists the number by which a characters Aromor Class is inflated.  A "+" raises the armor class additionally.  A last word, a "+" on any item also modifies the Equip Bonus and the Special Power of that item.

  by LORD YUTU

Amazingly...  I finished a game...  my second game I ever finished... Thanks
to New World Computing for making such a simple game...  (how come I couldn't
solve MM1?  I even had the hints and I couldn't win...)

I only detailed the cleric/wizard's spells that you have to look for, actually
most of these spells are pretty useless.  The only spell I found really useful
was Divine intervention which I used once.

You do not need to find every single hireling (though I found them all A-X).
Only one, Sherman, is crucial in winning the game.  (You must find Sherman to
get the use of the time machine that Lord Peabody has!).  I gave some hints on
where they are though...

Provided some explanations of 'TRUE' and triple crowns...  Also, some insights
on circus games...

I have a pretty detailed runthrough of what is needed to win the game...  Hope y
a have some characters of at least 20th level and some good stats...


---------------
Clerical Spells
---------------

A lot I don't remember but these are the ones that I do!

Nature's Gate - Go to bar in Vulcania and eat red-hot wolf nibble chips. Then
                go Druid's Grove (C3 - 1,9) and you will find a druid eating
                the same thing.  He'll like your breath so much he will give
                you the Nature's Gate spell... (Frankly, I don't find much use
                for this spell)

Walk on Water - Can't remember the exact co-ordinate (it is in C2)

Air Transmutation - 8,8 in the air elemental plane (Area A1)

Air Encasement - 1,14 in the Air Elemental Plane (Area A1)

Frenzy - A group of natives who resides in Native's Cove (Area B4 - 8,1) often
         go into a Frenzy

Earth Transmutation - 8,8 in the earth elemental plane (Area E4)

Water Encasement - 1,1 in the water elemental plane (Area A4)

Water Transmutation - 8,8 in the water elemental plane (Area A4)

Earth Encasement - 14,1 in the earth elemental plane (Area E4)

Fire Encasement - 14,14 in the fire elemental plane (Area E1)

Fire Transmutation - 8,8 in the fire elemental plane (Area E1)

Divine Intervention - Go to the Druid's Cave, at 14,15 is a arch druid who
                      needs a favor from you.  Find Horvath!  Well, Horvath is
                      within the cave (5,3?) find him and kill him.  Horvath is
                      a pretty tough opponet so beware...  If you succeed, go
                      back to the druid and he will grant you this spell.

Holy Word - In the Lost Soul's Wood (Area C1 - 9,7?)


-----------------
Sorceror's Spells
-----------------

Eagle's Eyes - Do the quest in Middlegate, this spell is part of the reward.

Lloyd's Beacon - In Corak's Crypt (7,11)

Wizard's Eye - In Sandsobar (Geez, the door says Wizard's Eye!)  Pay the man!

Fingers of Death - Supposedly at C1(1,8) but never found it.

Dancing Sword - Kill the Mist Warrior at Mist Haven (A1 - 15,11) and you shalt
                learn the spell.

Starburst - It is suppose to be in the middle of the Dead Zone, but I have yet
            to find it.  You die when you enter the Dead Zone...

Enchant Item - Find the Gemmaker in the Gemmaker's Cave (D1 - 10,12? a bit
               north of Vulcania!)  The Gemmaker is at 3,3 in the dungeon.
               Warning: His fee is TIME! (You character gets AGED.)

Anyways, a list of all spells to be found is at the Hall of spells in Castle
Xabran.


---------
Hirelings
---------

Do you really care?  Nah...  Some clues anyhow...

- Dead Eye and Red Duke are in Bozorc's (BOSS ORC) control in D1 at 14,1
- Sir Kill and Jed I are in Sarakin's Mines, unfortunately, ya gotta kill
  Sarakin first (and his undead friends!)
- Might Nakazama and Lord Peabody's servant Sherman were last seen having
  some problems with amazons near Native's Cove at 10,1
- A couple of guys are in prison in Atlantium, break em out....
- A couple of kids are in kept in prison by kobolds in kobold's HQ in the
  dungeons beneath Middlegate
- Buy fried troll's liver at bar in Vulcania...  I think there are a couple
  of hirelings who likes your taste... But ya gotta demonstrate your skills
  to them first... (So what is killing a dozen cripples and misers...)
- A couple of hirelings are almost dinner for the snowbeast in Tundara...
  Kill the snowbeast (in the outer walls of the city), skip the emerald ring
  or you will be accused of murder, and save the 2 hirelings...
- A lichlord guards a high level wizard in Area D3.
- A couple of guys are currently being held in prison in Castle Hillstone.

Anyways, with the exception of Sherman, most of the hirelings are not necessary 
to win the game.  They are nice to have around.  The most a hireling can cost is
 50000 gold a day.  There is a list of all the hirelings and their locations in 
the hall of hirelings in Castle Xabran.



------------------
Raising Statistics
------------------

On days 140-170 at B2 - 14,4 (the circus grounds), there is a circus.  Now
try a few events there...  You will probably lose, but you do a some
consolation prizes...   A cupie doll!   Now go (fly is quicker) to D3 - 4,13?
(somewhere there!) and meet this old raving hermit...  He will take the doll
and direct you to the pool in the Inner Limits (E2 - 10,11?).  Bath in this
pool (usually it is acid, but now!) and you will feel like a WINNER!  Go back
to the circus grounds and choose a category you want to improve on.  For
example, if you want improved strength, try to ring the bell...  Horseshoes for
improved accuracy...  Kissing booth for better personality...  Shell game for
better intelligence... sack race for better speed...  head dunk for better
endurance...  now what was for luck and stamina? (You get the idea...).  +10
to the category...



-----------------
Individual Quests
-----------------

For one to be true, each class must fulfil his quest... Each class must be
alone or be in the company of thieves.  When the quest is done, return to Mt.
Farview in area D2 - 7,0 to claim true status (+) and 5 million experience.

Fighters - Must kill the Dread Knight at B3 - 5,14.

Paladins - Must kill the Frost Dragon in the dungeon among the Forbidden Forest
           in Area B3.

Archers - Must kill Baron Wilfrey at B2 - 11,2

Ninjas - Must assassinate Dawn in Dawn's Mist Bog in D4 - 8,9

Clerics - Must defeat a haunt of ghosts at C1 - 10,15 in the Lost Soul's Woods
          and collect Corak's Soul.  Then go to Corak's Crypt and reunite the
          soul with his body.  One must have an Admit 8 Pass to enter the crypt
          though, and to obtain one, you have to get it from a zombie in the

TO WIN THE GAME
---------------

First you will need the Element Orb.  To get the Element Orb, you must first
grab these items, A-1 Tolidor (0,6 in Luxus Palace), J-26 Fluxer (7,6 Castle
Pinehurst), N-29 Capitor (3,13 Castle Hillstone), M-27 Radicon (2,11 Castle
Woodhaven).  Now this part I am not too sure of...  Go to Dawn's Mist Bog
Cavern at 10,15 and you will find the Element Orb.  You will find that you canno
t leave the dungeon with the Orb in hand.  There should be a teleporter 
in the dunegoen (very near the entrance), use that instead and you should end
up in Murray's Cave in Murray's Resort Isle.  Another way I devised was to
transfer the Orb to the hireling and then 'D'ismissing my hireling.  Now I can
leave the cave with no problem and I can find the hireling with the Orb same and
 sound back at the original inn... (Sorta cheated on it...)

Ok, so you've got the Element Orb, now you will need the 4 elemental talons.
Travel back in time using Lord Peabody's time machine to the 9th Century (Era
8), and go to Castle Xabran at C2 - 14,8.

In Castle Xabran, get the following items... Air Disc (15,15); Earth Disc
(6,2); Fire Disc (6,14); Water Disc (15,0)

Now, either using the time machine in Castle Pinehurst, or thru the vortex
holes at the corners of each elemental planes, travel back to the year 100, 200
300, 400 to find the talons.  The time of air hides the talon at 11,7.  In the P
lane of Water, 10,10 will reveal the water talon.  In the plane of earth, the
talon is enshrined at 8,8.  In the plane of fire, the talon rest at 4,4. Each
shrine which holds the talon requires the appropriate disc to open.

Now you should have all 4 talons and the orb.  Go back to the 9th Century again
and find King Kalohn at C4 - 14,5 and see him fighting the Mega Dragon. When he
sees you with the talons and Orb, you will haved changed history because
history had said the battle would have been lost.  Now that the dragon has been
vanquished, King Kalohn will live after all.... (confused?)

You return to the 10th Century and you go back to Luxus Palace.  Instead of Prin
cess Lamanda, you now see King Kalohn!  He tells you of the final quest.
To go to Square Lake and try to stop the villain that is going to doom Cron.

You enter this fantastic maze (that you won't be amaze with).  At the end of
this simple maze, you meet him.  SHELTEM and his elemental friends...  You
should be able to defeat him, but alas, can you beat his recorded message?  He
has left a pre-recorded message and REAL-TIME cryptogram puzzle.  If time
expires, the world crashes into the Sun.  Now, the encription algorithm changes
EVERY time so I can't help you with that.  But the message is the same every
time.

Here is the message,

We, the people of Terra, in order to form a more perfect union, establish
justice , insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense...

The answer of this is given already, Preamble.  Now, find the corresponding
encryption and translate the word Preamble to its encrypted code and then you
are done!   Cron is saved from crashing into the Sun.


By the way, New World Computing tells you to give them a shout if you should
finish...  Here's where to send New World computing, P.O. Box 2068, Van Nuys,
California 91404 USA.   Wonder what Might & Magic 3 has in store?  (No, I don't
want a 16 sided M+M3).
