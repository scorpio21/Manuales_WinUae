                        HINTS FOR MICKEY MOUSE

The objective is to seal all the doors off in the tower without getting
killed.  Use your squirt gun to kill the ghosts and dragons. If you kill
them you will get a bottle or a key. The key lets you in the door and the
bottle refills your squirt gun.

In the Maze.
The object of this is to get the hammer, nails, and boards without getting
killed by the minotaur. The blue spots are where the minotaurs are produced,
so move quickly over these areas.
The bomb kills all minotaurs on the screen and gives you a bonus of one
thousand points.
The heart gives you your lives back if you have lost any.
The spring makes your hammer rebound of walls and helps to hit the minotaurs
better.
The "P" makes you invincible to the minotaurs temporarily.
The skull will kill you so don't touch it; also the ladder is the way out.
Don't leave until you have the hammer, nails, and boards!

The bubble room
The object is to keep hitting the bubbles with your hammer by throwing it
down. Also, don't get hit by the ghost and hit the ghost with your hammer.
If the bubble keeps hitting the floor then it eventually will cause holes.
Try not to fall in them. If you do than you will be put back in the
tower and the door won't be sealed.
Keep sealing the doors.  If you run out of keys kill the dragons and ghosts
to get some.  After you've sealed all the doors go to the top floor with
the big tarantula and into the gate. You will then fight the witch who will
shoot fireballs at you. Jump up and duck down to avoid them. Meanwhile you
should be trying to chuck your hammers at her.
