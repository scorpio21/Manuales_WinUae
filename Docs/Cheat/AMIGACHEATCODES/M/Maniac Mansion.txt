Maniac Mansion Solution


Written by Capricorn


General info

To solve this game you actually only need 2 people, so in the following 
solutions I'll only use Dave and that second person.  If I feel that a third 
person is needed to make playing the game easier, I'll show this one as '3rd'.  
(eg: in the solution with Dave and Michael, I could have had Dave come all the 
way downstairs to push the Gargoyle and then go back all the way upstairs.  
Instead I chose to bring in the third person.)


Dave and Syd

Dave: Walk to the front door, pick up the doormat and the Key underneath.  
Unlock the front door with the Key and go inside.  Open the first door you come 
across and enter, this is the kitchen.  What you have to do now is a bit tricky.  
You have to keep moving towards the other end of the kitchen until you see Mrs. 
Edna, then you immediately turn around and walk out the kitchen otherwise she 
catches you and you're locked up in the cellar.  Go back into the kitchen and 
pick up the Flashlight.  Open the refrigerator and pick up the Can of Pepsi.  
Now go into the room to your right.   Go right again and pick up the Fruit 
Drinks and the Glass Jar.

Syd: Position him by the mailbox.  As soon as you hear the doorbell and you see 
Weird Ed leaving his room to open the front door switch to Syd and pick up the 
Package.  (You don't have to wait for the doorbell, just keep on playing but 
soon as you hear the doorbell, switch and pick up the Package)

Dave: Go back through the dining room and the kitchen to the main hall.  Now go 
towards the most right door and enter that room. Enter the room to the right.  
Find the lamp and turn it on.  Go to the far right of the bookcase and open the 
loose panel.  Pick up the Cassette Tape.  Go back to the main hall and climb the 
stairs.  Go into the room to your left.  Pick up the Paint Remover and the Bowl 
of Wax Fruit. Exit.  Go through the steel security door.  Go all the way to the 
right and up the stairs.  Here you'll encounter the Green Tentacle.  Give him 
the Bowl of Wax Fruit and then the Fruit Drinks.  Go up the stairs and enter the 
first door.  Pick up the Dime and climb the ladder to the left.  Pick up the 
Record and the Yellow Key.  Go back into the hall, skip two doors and enter the 
fourth.  Use the Hunk-O-Matic Machine.  Go back downstairs to the hall where the 
paint room is.(top of the main stairs and in front of the security door) Enter 
the room to the right.  Use the Cassette Tape in the tape recorder and use the 
Record on the victrola.  Turn on the cassette recorder and the victrola and wait 
for the vase on the piano to shatter.  Then turn victrola and recorder off and 
pick up the Cassette Tape.  Turn on the TV.  Exit.  Go down the stairs and into 
the room to the right.  Open the cabinet door, use the Cassette Tape in the 
cassette player and turn it on.  Wait for the glass chandelier to fall, then 
turn the cassette player off and pick up the Cassette Tape.  Pick up the Old 
Rusty Key.  This key is your way out of the dungeon, so if you get caught use 
this key to get free.  Go outside.  Give the Cassette Tape, the Key (the one you 
found under the doormat) and the Old Rusty Key to Syd. By now the Package should 
have arrived and Syd's the one who's got it.  (If the Package hasn't arrived yet 
then wait a while, it can't take be much longer.  Or you can go ahead and 
position the 3rd person at the mailbox to pick up the Package when it arrives.  
Meanwhile you can continue with Dave and Syd.)

Syd: Give the Package to Dave.

Dave: Open the Package, some uncanceled Stamps should fall off.  Go to the left 
bush next to the front door steps.  Pull the bush and then pull the grate.  Go 
back inside and position Dave in front of the door to the right of the main 
stairs, the door without handle that you can't open.

Syd: Go inside and push the right gargoyle at the bottom of the main stairs.

Dave: Enter the room.  Find the light switch and turn it on.  Go all the way to 
the left and pick up the Silver Key.  The door you see there is the way into the 
dungeon, so if another character other than Syd (or the one who's carrying the 
Old Rusty Key) is thrown in the dungeon, this is where you bust them out.  (Or 
another way is to make the guy or gall who's carrying the Old Rusty Key get 
caught on purpose and then bust out.  Yet another way to escape is to get one 
person to push the loose stone below the left window so that any other person 
can escape)  Exit the way you came in and go through the kitchen to the room 
where you picked up the Fruit Drinks.  Unlock the door with the Silver Key and 
exit.  Use the Glass Jar with the swimming pool.

Syd: Go outside and through the grating.  Walk to the right and turn on the 
water valve.

Dave: Go down the ladder, pick up the Radio and the Glowing Key.  Whatever you 
do, DO NOT PUSH THE RED BUTTON! (or at least save before you do so you can 
reload afterwards) Go back up the ladder.

Syd: Turn the water valve back off.  (Important otherwise there's a meltdown and 
... well, kaboom, I guess...)

Dave: Open the gate, walk through it and open the garage door.  Open the trunk 
with the Yellow Key and pick up the Tools.  Go back upstairs to the room where 
you pumped up your muscles with the Hunk-O-Matic Machine and wait by the door 
that leads to the hall.

Syd: Go back through the grate and push the doorbell. Hurry to get inside and go 
into the kitchen.

Dave: Wait a few seconds, then go into the hall.  Open the first door to your 
left and enter.  Pick up the Hamster, then the Card Key.  Open the Piggy Bank 
and pick up a Dime.  Exit and enter the door on the far right.

Syd: Go to the music room with the piano.  Use the Cassette Tape in the tape 
recorder and turn it on.  Now use the piano to play a cool tune.  Turn off the 
tape recorder and pick up the Cassette Tape.  Go to the Green Tentacle's room 
and give him the Cassette Tape, he'll listen to it and then leave his own Demo 
Tape on the bed.  Pick it up.

Dave: Use the Paint Remover on the paint blotch.  Enter the door.  Find the 
light and turn it on.  Open the Radio.  Use the Batteries in the Flashlight (not 
the Old Batteries, they don't last long enough).
Syd: Go downstairs to the main hall and position yourself in front of the secret 
door.

3rd: Go to the main hall and push the right Gargoyle.  (You can make him go into 
a room or back outside or whatever after Syd has gone inside so he won't get 
caught just standing there in the hall)

Syd: Enter the room.  Find the light switch and turn it on.  Open the fuse box 
and turn off the circuit breakers.

Dave: Turn on the Flashlight and use the Tools on the wires.  Wait for Syd to 
get caught or if you're fast enough and get Syd to turn the circuit breakers 
back on before the Purple tentacle checks on him, he can avoid getting captured.  
Don't forget to turn your flashlight off.  Exit to the hallway and enter the 
room that leads to the Green Tentacle's room.

Syd: Go upstairs and join Dave.  Give him the Demo Tape.  Exit and open the door 
directly to your right, this is Edna's room.  Syd will get caught again but this 
doesn't matter.  As soon as you're able, switch to Dave.

Dave: Exit and enter Edna's room.  Go up the ladder.  Find and turn on the 
light, then open the painting.  Go back through the hatch.  Now you're both 
trapped in the dungeon.  This is where that Old Rusty Key comes in handy... Use 
it to unlock the door on the right.  Go back upstairs to the floor where Weird 
Ed and Edna's rooms are, enter the door on the far right.  Use the Can of Pepsi 
on the Man-eating-Plant.  Then use the Jar of Water with it.  Climb up the plant 
(walk to hatch).  Use two Dimes in the Coin Slot, then push the Right button 
twice.  Now use the Telescope to read the combination code.  Write this down.  
Go back downstairs and use the same method as before to get Dave through Edna's 
room up the attic.  Open the safe with the combination code, pick up the Sealed 
Envelope and exit.

Syd: Unlock right door with Old Rusty Key.

Dave: Go to the kitchen.  Turn on the faucet, use the Glass Jar with it and turn 
the faucet back off.  Now open the microwave oven and put both the Jar of Water 
and the Sealed Envelope in it.  Close the microwave oven and turn it on.  Open 
it again and pick up the Envelope.  Open the Envelope and you get a Quarter.  
Now go to the room with the Man-Eating-Plant and use the Envelope in the 
typewriter.  Now put the Demo Tape in the Envelope and stick some Stamps on it.  
Go outside, put the Envelope in the mailbox and close it again.  Don't forget to 
pull the flag up.  Now it's time to wait... The best way is to get Syd to wait 
by the mailbox and continue with Dave.  As soon as you hear the doorbell, switch 
to Syd and get him to open the mailbox and pick up the Contract.  Meanwhile Dave 
continues... Go to the Arcade room.  Use the Quarter in the Meteor Mess game 
(for this to work you should have seen an animation of Dr. Fred playing this 
game).  Write down Dr. Ed's high score, this is the code to open the door to Dr. 
Ed's lab.  You can't continue until you've got the Contract, so if you don't 
have it already get downstairs and wait for it with Syd.

Syd: Give Contract to Dave.

Dave: Go to the Green Tentacle's room and give him the Contract.  Now we've got 
a protector and he's a lean mean green killing machine.  Head downstairs to the 
dungeon.  Open the upper and lower padlock with the Glowing Key.  Next use the 
code to open the second door.  After your bold protector got rid of that purple 
nuisance go through the door on the right.  Open the locker and use the 
Radiation Suit.  Use the Card Key in the slot next to the door to open it.  Pull 
the switch once inside the Meteor's room.  Pick up the Meteor and open the door 
to the right.  Put the Meteor in the trunk of the Edsel and close the trunk.  
Use the Yellow Key to get the Edsel started and you're finished!

Note: If you want a different ending, resume play from before Syd gave the 
Contract to Dave.  Have Dave give Syd the Glowing Key, the Card Key and the 
Yellow Key.  Now finish Dave off (kill him).  To do this you can send him down 
the swimming pool and let another kid turn the water valve back on while Dave's 
still at the bottom of the pool.  Or you can have another kid than Dave (he's 
too smart to do it himself) fill the Glass Jar with water from the swimming pool 
and put the Jar of Water in the microwave oven.  Get Dave to turn the oven on 
and then open it.  Another way to get him killed is to get Razor or Syd to put 
the Hamster in the microwave oven and turn it on.  Get Dave to give the poor 
thing back to Ed.  Anyway, after you killed Dave, have Syd give the Contract to 
Green Tentacle and then finish up as Dave would have done.

Tentacle the Contract when he bugs you.  Now go through the door on the right.  
Open the locker and use the Radiation Suit.  Use the Card Key in the slot next 
to the door to open it.  Pull the switch once inside the Meteor's room.  Show 
the Meteor the Contract.  
Note: If you want a different ending, resume play from before Wendy gave the 
Contract to Dave.  Have Dave give Wendy the Glowing Key, the Card Key and the 
Yellow Key.  Now finish Dave off (kill him).  To do this you can send him down 
the swimming pool and let another kid turn the water valve back on while Dave's 
still at the bottom of the pool.  Or you can have another kid than Dave (he's 
too smart to do it himself) fill the Glass Jar with water from the swimming pool 
and put the Jar of Water in the microwave oven.  Get Dave to turn the oven on 
and then open it.  Another way to get him killed is to get Razor or Syd put the 
Hamster in the microwave oven and turn it on.  Get Dave to give the poor thing 
back to Ed.  Anyway, after you killed Dave, have Wendy do what Dave would have 
done.  Another way to end the game is to make Dave pick up the Meteor instead of 
giving it the Contract, leave through the door on the right, put the Meteor in 
the trunk, close the trunk and fire up the Edsel with the Yellow Key.  Another 
way is by killing Dave first and making Wendy do all this in his place. Yet 
another way is if you're playing with Bernard as well as Wendy.  Use Bernard to 
call the meteor police right before you go into the lab as described in the 
solution with Bernard.  Now finish the game with Wendy by giving the meteor the 
contract.



Dave and Bernard

Dave: Walk to the front door, pick up the doormat and the Key underneath.  
Unlock the front door with the Key and go inside.  Open the first door you come 
across and enter, this is the kitchen.  What you have to do now is a bit tricky.  
You have to keep moving towards the other end of the kitchen until you see Mrs. 
Edna, then you immediately turn around and walk out the kitchen otherwise she 
catches you and you're locked up in the cellar.  Go back into the kitchen and 
pick up the Flashlight.  Open the refrigerator and pick up the Can of Pepsi.  
Now go into the room to your right.   Go right again and pick up the Fruit 
Drinks and the Glass Jar.  Go back through the dining room and the kitchen to 
the main hall.  Now go towards the most right door and enter that room. Enter 
the room to the right.  Find the lamp and turn it on.  Go to the far right of 
the bookcase and open the loose panel.  Pick up the Cassette Tape.  Go back to 
the main hall and climb the stairs.  Go into the room to your left.  Pick up the 
Paint Remover and the Bowl of Wax Fruit. Exit.  Go through the steel security 
door.  Go all the way to the right and up the stairs.  Here you'll encounter the 
Green Tentacle.  Give him the Bowl of Wax Fruit and then the Fruit Drinks.  Go 
up the stairs and enter the first door.  Pick up the Dime and climb the ladder 
to the left.  Pick up the Record and the Yellow Key.  Go back into the hall, 
skip two doors and enter the fourth.  Use the Hunk-O-Matic Machine.  Go back 
downstairs to the hall where the paint room is. (top of the main stairs and in 
front of the security door) Enter the room to the right.  Use the Cassette Tape 
in the tape recorder and use the Record on the victrola.  Turn on the cassette 
recorder and the victrola and wait for the vase on the piano to shatter.  Then 
turn victrola and recorder off and pick up the Cassette Tape.  Exit.  Go down 
the stairs and into the room to the right.  Open the cabinet door, use the 
Cassette Tape in the cassette player and turn it on.  Wait for the glass 
chandelier to fall, then turn the cassette player off.  Pick up the Old Rusty 
Key.  This key is your way out of the dungeon, so if you get caught use this key 
to get free.  Go outside.  

Bernard: Meet Dave in front of the house.  

Dave: Give the Key (the one you found under the doormat) and the Old Rusty Key 
to Bernard.  Go to the left bush next to the front door steps.  Pull the bush 
and then pull the grate.  Go back inside and position Dave in front of the door 
to the right of the main stairs, the door without handle that you can't open.

Bernard: Go inside the house and push the right gargoyle at the bottom of the 
main stairs.

Dave: Enter the room.  Find the light switch and turn it on.  Go all the way to 
the left and pick up the Silver Key.  The door you see there is the way into the 
dungeon, so if another character other than Bernard (or the one who's carrying 
the Old Rusty Key) is thrown in the dungeon, this is where you bust them out. 
(Or another way is to make the guy or gall who's carrying the Old Rusty Key get 
caught on purpose and then bust out.  Yet another way to escape is to get one 
person to push the loose stone below the left window so that any other person 
can escape)  Exit the way you came in and go through the kitchen to the room 
where you picked up the Fruit Drinks.  Unlock the door with the Silver Key and 
exit.  Use the Glass Jar with the swimming pool.

Bernard: Go outside and through the grating.  Walk to the right and turn on the 
water valve.

Dave: Go down the ladder, pick up the Radio and the Glowing Key.  Whatever you 
do, DO NOT PUSH THE RED BUTTON! (or at least save before you do so you can 
reload afterwards) Go back up the ladder.

Bernard: Turn the water valve back off.  (Important otherwise there's a meltdown 
and ... well, kaboom, I guess...)

Dave: Open the gate, walk through it and open the garage door.  Pick up the 
Water Faucet Handle.  Open the trunk with the Yellow Key and pick up the Tools.  
Go back upstairs to the room where you pumped up your muscles with the Hunk-O-
Matic Machine and enter the room to the right.  Pull the curtain, use the Water 
Faucet Handle on the water faucet and turn it on.  Turn it back off and write 
the phone number down.  Exit and wait by the door that leads to the hall.

Bernard: Go back through the grate and push the doorbell.  Hurry to get inside 
and go into the kitchen.

Dave: Wait a few seconds, then go into the hall.  Open the first door to your 
left and enter.  Pick up the Hamster, then the Card Key.  Open the Piggy Bank 
and pick up a Dime.  Exit and enter the door on the far right. Use the Paint 
Remover on the paint blotch.  Enter the door.  Find the light and turn it on.  
Open the Radio.  Use the Batteries in the Flashlight (not the Old Batteries, 
they don't last long enough).
Bernard: Go downstairs to the main hall and position yourself in front of the 
secret door.

3rd: Go to the main hall and push the right Gargoyle.  (You can make him go into 
a room or back outside or whatever after Bernard has gone inside so he won't get 
caught just standing there in the hall)

Bernard: Enter the room.  Find the light switch and turn it on.  Open the fuse 
box and turn off the circuit breakers.

Dave: Turn on the Flashlight and use the Tools on the Wires.  Wait for Bernard 
to get caught or if you're fast enough and get Bernard to turn the circuit 
breakers back on before the Purple tentacle checks on him, he can avoid getting 
captured.  Don't forget to turn your flashlight off.  Exit to the hallway and 
enter the room that leads to the Green Tentacle's room.

Bernard: Go into the room where you smashed the chandelier.  Open the old 
fashion radio and pick up the Radio Tube.  Now join Dave upstairs.

Dave: Give the tools to Bernard.

Bernard: Go downstairs to where you found the Cassette Tape and use the tools to 
fix the phone.  Now call Mrs. Edna.  As soon as he's on the phone with her, 
don't move him or he'll put the phone down.

Dave: Enter Edna's room and go up the ladder.  Find the light and turn it on.  
Open the painting.

Bernard: Call Edna again.

Dave: Go back through the hatch and out to the hallway. Enter the door on the 
far right.  Use the Can of Pepsi on the Man-eating-Plant.  Then use the Jar of 
Water with it.  Climb up the plant (walk to hatch).  Use two Dimes in the Coin 
Slot, then push the Right button twice.  Now use the Telescope to read the 
combination code.  Write this down.  Go back downstairs and use the same method 
as before to get Dave through Edna's room up the attic.  Open the safe with the 
combination code, pick up the Sealed Envelope and exit. Go to the Arcade room.  
Open the envelope, you get a Quarter.  Use the Quarter in the Meteor Mess game 
(for this to work you should have seen an animation of Dr. Fred playing this 
game).  Write down Dr. Ed's high score, this is the code to open the door to Dr. 
Ed's lab.  Now go downstairs to the secret door.

Bernard: Exit to the main hallway, give Dave the Old Rusty Key and push the 
right gargoyle.  

Dave: Go down to the dungeon.  Open bottom and top padlock with the Glowing Key.  
Now open the second door using the code you found in the Meteor Mess game.  

Bernard: Go upstairs to the room where you found the Dime.  Use the Radio Tube 
in the tube socket.  Read the wanted poster.  Turn on the radio and use it.  
Turn it back off again afterwards.

Dave: Now it's time to wait until the Meteor Police comes and arrests the 
meteor.  Pick up the Badge and go into the lab.  When the Purple Tentacle bugs 
you, show him the Badge.  Now go through the door on the right.  Open the locker 
and use the radiation suit.  Use the Card Key in the slot and enter the next 
room.  Pull the switch.  That's it!

Note: If you want a different ending.  Kill Dave before you go into the lab and 
make Bernard finish the game instead.  Another way is if you're playing with 
Wendy as well as Bernard.  Use Wendy to rewrite the Manuscript and get the 
Contract as described in the solution with Wendy.  Now make Bernard call the 
meteor police right before you go into the lab and give the Contract to the 
meteor.



Dave and Razor

Dave: Walk to the front door, pick up the doormat and the Key underneath.  
Unlock the front door with the Key and go inside.  Open the first door you come 
across and enter, this is the kitchen.  What you have to do now is a bit tricky.  
You have to keep moving towards the other end of the kitchen until you see Mrs. 
Edna, then you immediately turn around and walk out the kitchen otherwise she 
catches you and you're locked up in the cellar.  Go back into the kitchen and 
pick up the Flashlight.  Open the refrigerator and pick up the Can of Pepsi.  
Now go into the room to your right.   Go right again and pick up the Fruit 
Drinks and the Glass Jar.

Razor: Position her by the mailbox.  As soon as you hear the doorbell and you 
see Weird Ed leaving his room to open the front door switch to Razor and pick up 
the Package.  (You don't have to wait for the doorbell, just keep on playing but 
soon as you hear the doorbell, switch and pick up the Package)

Dave: Go back through the dining room and the kitchen to the main hall.  Now go 
towards the most right door and enter that room. Enter the room to the right.  
Find the lamp and turn it on.  Go to the far right of the bookcase and open the 
loose panel.  Pick up the Cassette Tape.  Go back to the main hall and climb the 
stairs.  Go into the room to your left.  Pick up the Paint Remover and the Bowl 
of Wax Fruit. Exit.  Go through the steel security door.  Go all the way to the 
right and up the stairs.  Here you'll encounter the Green Tentacle.  Give him 
the Bowl of Wax Fruit and then the Fruit Drinks.  Go up the stairs and enter the 
first door.  Pick up the Dime and climb the ladder to the left.  Pick up the 
Record and the Yellow Key.  Go back into the hall, skip two doors and enter the 
fourth.  Use the Hunk-O-Matic Machine.  Go back downstairs to the hall where the 
paint room is.(top of the main stairs and in front of the security door) Enter 
the room to the right.  Use the Cassette Tape in the tape recorder and use the 
Record on the victrola.  Turn on the cassette recorder and the victrola and wait 
for the vase on the piano to shatter.  Then turn victrola and recorder off and 
pick up the Cassette Tape.  Turn on the TV.  Exit.  Go down the stairs and into 
the room to the right.  Open the cabinet door, use the Cassette Tape in the 
cassette player and turn it on.  Wait for the glass chandelier to fall, then 
turn the cassette player off and pick up the Cassette Tape.  Pick up the Old 
Rusty Key.  This key is your way out of the dungeon, so if you get caught use 
this key to get free.  Go outside.  Give the Cassette Tape, the Key (the one you 
found under the doormat) and the Old Rusty Key to Razor. By now the Package 
should have arrived and Razor's the one who's got it.  (If the Package hasn't 
arrived yet then wait a while, it can't take be much longer.  Or you can go 
ahead and position the 3rd person at the mailbox to pick up the Package when it 
arrives.  Meanwhile you can continue with Dave and Razor.)

Razor: Give the Package to Dave.

Dave: Open the Package, some uncanceled Stamps should fall off.  Go to the left 
bush next to the front door steps.  Pull the bush and then pull the grate.  Go 
back inside and position Dave in front of the door to the right of the main 
stairs, the door without handle that you can't open.

Razor: Go inside and push the right gargoyle at the bottom of the main stairs.

Dave: Enter the room.  Find the light switch and turn it on.  Go all the way to 
the left and pick up the Silver Key.  The door you see there is the way into the 
dungeon, so if another character other than Razor (or the one who's carrying the 
Old Rusty Key) is thrown in the dungeon, this is where you bust them out.  (Or 
another way is to make the guy or gall who's carrying the Old Rusty Key get 
caught on purpose and then bust out.  Yet another way to escape is to get one 
person to push the loose stone below the left window so that any other person 
can escape)  Exit the way you came in and go through the kitchen to the room 
where you picked up the Fruit Drinks.  Unlock the door with the Silver Key and 
exit.  Use the Glass Jar with the swimming pool.

Razor: Go outside and through the grating.  Walk to the right and turn on the 
water valve.

Dave: Go down the ladder, pick up the Radio and the Glowing Key.  Whatever you 
do, DO NOT PUSH THE RED BUTTON! (or at least save before you do so you can 
reload afterwards) Go back up the ladder.

Razor: Turn the water valve back off.  (Important otherwise there's a meltdown 
and ... well, kaboom, I guess...)

Dave: Open the gate, walk through it and open the garage door.  Open the trunk 
with the Yellow Key and pick up the Tools.  Go back upstairs to the room where 
you pumped up your muscles with the Hunk-O-Matic Machine and wait by the door 
that leads to the hall.

Razor: Go back through the grate and push the doorbell. Hurry to get inside and 
go into the kitchen.

Dave: Wait a few seconds, then go into the hall.  Open the first door to your 
left and enter.  Pick up the Hamster, then the Card Key.  Open the Piggy Bank 
and pick up a Dime.  Exit and enter the door on the far right.

Razor: Go to the music room with the piano.  Use the Cassette Tape in the tape 
recorder and turn it on.  Now use the piano to play a cool tune.  Turn off the 
tape recorder and pick up the Cassette Tape.  Go to the Green Tentacle's room 
and give him the Cassette Tape, he'll listen to it and then leave his own Demo 
Tape on the bed.  Pick it up.

Dave: Use the Paint Remover on the paint blotch.  Enter the door.  Find the 
light and turn it on.  Open the Radio.  Use the Batteries in the Flashlight (not 
the Old Batteries, they don't last long enough).
Razor: Go downstairs to the main hall and position yourself in front of the 
secret door.

3rd: Go to the main hall and push the right Gargoyle.  (You can make him go into 
a room or back outside or whatever after Razor has gone inside so he won't get 
caught just standing there in the hall)

Razor: Enter the room.  Find the light switch and turn it on.  Open the fuse box 
and turn off the circuit breakers.

Dave: Turn on the Flashlight and use the Tools on the wires.  Wait for Razor to 
get caught or if you're fast enough and get Razor to turn the circuit breakers 
back on before the Purple tentacle checks on her, she can avoid getting 
captured.  Don't forget to turn your flashlight off.  Exit to the hallway and 
enter the room that leads to the Green Tentacle's room.

Razor: Go upstairs and join Dave.  Give him the Demo Tape.  Exit and open the 
door directly to your right, this is Edna's room.  Razor will get caught again 
but this doesn't matter.  As soon as you're able, switch to Dave.

Dave: Exit and enter Edna's room.  Go up the ladder.  Find and turn on the 
light, then open the painting.  Go back through the hatch.  Now you're both 
trapped in the dungeon.  This is where that Old Rusty Key comes in handy... Use 
it to unlock the door on the right.  Go back upstairs to the floor where Weird 
Ed and Edna's rooms are, enter the door on the far right.  Use the Can of Pepsi 
on the Man-eating-Plant.  Then use the Jar of Water with it.  Climb up the plant 
(walk to hatch).  Use two Dimes in the Coin Slot, then push the Right button 
twice.  Now use the Telescope to read the combination code.  Write this down.  
Go back downstairs and use the same method as before to get Dave through Edna's 
room up the attic.  Open the safe with the combination code, pick up the Sealed 
Envelope and exit.

Razor: Unlock right door with Old Rusty Key.

Dave: Go to the kitchen.  Turn on the faucet, use the Glass Jar with it and turn 
the faucet back off.  Now open the microwave oven and put both the Jar of Water 
and the Sealed Envelope in it.  Close the microwave oven and turn it on.  Open 
it again and pick up the Envelope.  Open the Envelope and you get a Quarter.  
Now go to the room with the Man-Eating-Plant and use the Envelope in the 
typewriter.  Now put the Demo Tape in the Envelope and stick some Stamps on it.  
Go outside, put the Envelope in the mailbox and close it again.  Don't forget to 
pull the flag up.  Now it's time to wait... The best way is to get Razor to wait 
by the mailbox and continue with Dave.  As soon as you hear the doorbell, switch 
to Razor and get her to open the mailbox and pick up the Contract.  Meanwhile 
Dave continues... Go to the Arcade room.  Use the Quarter in the Meteor Mess 
game (for this to work you should have seen an animation of Dr. Fred playing 
this game).  Write down Dr. Ed's high score, this is the code to open the door 
to Dr. Ed's lab.  You can't continue until you've got the Contract, so if you 
don't have it already get downstairs and wait for it with Razor.

Razor: Give Contract to Dave.

Dave: Go to the Green Tentacle's room and give him the Contract.  Now we've got 
a protector and he's a lean mean green killing machine.  Head downstairs to the 
dungeon.  Open the upper and lower padlock with the Glowing Key.  Next use the 
code to open the second door.  After your bold protector got rid of that purple 
nuisance go through the door on the right.  Open the locker and use the 
Radiation Suit.  Use the Card Key in the slot next to the door to open it.  Pull 
the switch once inside the Meteor's room.  Pick up the Meteor and open the door 
to the right.  Put the Meteor in the trunk of the Edsel and close the trunk.  
Use the Yellow Key to get the Edsel started and you're finished!

Note: If you want a different ending, resume play from before Razor gave the 
Contract to Dave.  Have Dave give Razor the Glowing Key, the Card Key and the 
Yellow Key.  Now finish Dave off (kill him).  To do this you can send him down 
the swimming pool and let another kid turn the water valve back on while Dave's 
still at the bottom of the pool.  Or you can have another kid than Dave (he's 
too smart to do it himself) fill the Glass Jar with water from the swimming pool 
and put the Jar of Water in the microwave oven.  Get Dave to turn the oven on 
and then open it.  Another way to get him killed is to get Razor or Syd to put 
the Hamster in the microwave oven and turn it on.  Get Dave to give the poor 
thing back to Ed.  Anyway, after you killed Dave, have Razor give the Contract 
to Green Tentacle and then finish up as Dave would have done.
