 A circuit that demands a great deal from the transmission with numerous
 gear changes. The long left hander can also make it very exausting for
 the drivers who have to fight the strain on their kneck muscles.
 It's important to be quick on the two long 200mph straights, cars can be
 set up with very little downforce. However, this makes th inner sections
 of the track more difficult to drive with the wheels loosing some grip
 and the cars feeling jumpy and twitchy.
 From the pits straight, flat out in 6th at 200mph, you sweep left and
 thenright for Curva1 and Curva De Sol then wind up for the long curva 2
 lefthander and accelerate past reta oposta in 6th gear at 190mph.
 To slight left handers after curva 3 and storm through the forth gear
 feradura. From here you need to get into a good rhythm to take you
 through a series of slow winding bend: Laranji (2nd gear, 55mph) then
 Prinhearinho, Bico Do Pato (2nd gear 55mph) and finally, Merghulho.
 Curva 4 taken in 2nd or 3rd gear is next, a bumpy slow left hander.
 This corner is important in that taken properly it can put you in a
 good position to approach the long left hander that leaves to the pit
 straight Arquibancadas. Winding up through Subida its quite possible to
 line yourself up to "get a tow", slipstream a car in front of you and
 overtake.

 A bumpy, brusing anti-clockwise circuit where the cars run little wing
 and are often struggling for grip or clipping the kerb.
 From the grid, you roar towards Tamburello, a long, fast 6th geat left
 hander that pushes you into speeds in excess of 170mph.
 Accelerating into Rettifiolo, the cars can reach 200mph before they brake
 for Tosa, an off-camber tight left hander thats taken at 2nd in 60mph.
 Here you have a good chance of getting on the brakes late and overtaking
 but its not easy. Double back up the hill to a fast left at Piratella,
 flat out in 4th, then change into 5th just as you leave the bend.
 Next, down the hill into the long left hander towards the Acque Minerale
 chicane. The appoach is off-chamber and blind; you have no view of the
 "S" until you are in it an 2nd at 50mph. Here, there is a tendancy to
 bounce from one side of the track to the other and many drivers spin off
 this corner.
 Then flat-out through the small chicane at Variante Alfa and down
 towards two bumpy left handers, Rivazza, that shake the car so much you
 can hardly see where you are going.
 Back in 5th, you approach Bassa, a right hand chicane that leaves you a
 bit blind with no idea where the apex is, then weave through Traguardo
 and back into the finishing straight.

 The Qualifying laps for this circuit are very important because it is
 practically impossible to pass anybody here unless they make a driving
 error or crash.
 The cars are set up for maximum downforce and suspension is a little
 softer to deal with the many bumps on the course.
 After the mayhem of the first bend at Sainte Devote, when the field
 tries to squeeze through, you pass Roses Bar flat out in 6th at 170mph,
 great uphill straight but full of dips, bumps, and manhole covers that
 make the car judder and thump.
 Then to Casino, hard through the left-hander and quickly right downhill,
 off camber, almost brushing the barrier as the road gets narrower,
 slipery and very bumpy.
 Mirabeau next; a tight simple, second gear bend. Accelerate sharply then
 brake practically to a standstill for Loews. This is a first gear, 40mph,
 hairpin that needs maximum lock (many drivers increase the lock of the
 car for this Race). Often, there is a procession of cars here and if your
 not in the first 6 then you have to wait your turn.
 Accelerate gently through Portier then flat out into the Tunnel, 3rd, 4th
 and 5th. The improved lighting in the tunnel means that its not so much
 of a shock coming out of the daylight but you have to be careful; the
 dirt, grease and oil does not get washed away by the rain and this is not
 the place to skid. Roar out in 6th at about 175mph, stay well out to the
 right and line up for the Nouvelle Chicane. Take this fast in 4th, left-
 right zigzag but this narrow section needs to be driven with utmost
 precision. One touch of the kerb and your out of the Race.
 Out of the chicane, flat out in 5th, the road widens and you head for
 Tarbac and the Swimming Pool complex. in 3rd, 2 esses, acceleerate
 briefly, brake hard and almost touch the barriers with the right hand
 side of the car. La Rescasse next, than in 2nd for Antony Noghes,
 accelerate out of this bend, roar through the gears and then in 6th
 heading for the finishing straight.

 A fast circuit comprising of a succession of hard braking and
 accelerating. Drivers take off downforce which make the slower sections
 much more difficult and emphasis the uneven surface.
 From the start, the cars proceed into the slow left/right 1st gear Island
 Hairpin, taken at 45mph. The drivers get a lot of wheelspin as they leave
 this corner and build up to the long extended "s" bend which they can
 approach in 5th at 160mph. Then its flat out in 6th, 180mph to 185mph
 along the back straight before slamming on the brakes for the 1st gear,
 40mph Pits Hairpin. Its very important to get a good, fast exit out of
 this bend, then right, left, through what is thought to be the most
 dangerous part of the circuit with high concrete walls on either side of
 the track. Past Old Pits and into 6th gear, than accelerate through the
 straight at 175-185-195mph. This is the fastest section of the track and
 leads to one of the least favorite corners mong many drivers, down to
 5th, 160mph, a quick right-left. Its very easy clip the kerb and spin off
 here either on entry or on the apex, but if you come out of it well, it
 sets you up for a charge down the finishing straight.

 A hard, bumpy circuit, which needs lots of gear changes but generally
 very fast. The cars require little downforce and becoaus of the high
 altitude almost 20% of power is lost but this compensated by a reduction
 in drag. Concentration is vital on this course. Drift off-line and you
 find dusty parts of the track with little grip. Mexico can also have
 vicious bumps that can cause a lot of damage to the car and knock the
 breath from your body.
 After a long straight, the fastest on the course in 6th at 190mph, and
 one of the best places to overtake, you brake hard onto the 1st corner,
 down to 55mph in 2nd or 3rd. Right, left, right into the shorter straight
 flat out towards a long series of bends, the Esses. Its easier if you can
 get into a rhythm because they are very similar. When you hit the back
 streight in 6th and head for Peralta, a notorious corner taken in 5th at
 160mph and a challenge to any driver, exit on a kerb than accelerate to
 170mph past the grandstand.

 This new course in the World championships. Smooth and challenging,
 doubling back on itself, with fast fourth-fifth gear corners and first
 gear hairpins as well a long top-speed straight, Magny-Cours has been
 built to appel to the Formula One spectators and TV crews alike.
 The circuit has several constant radius corners but the cars are set up
 to carry less downforce. The 5 fast straights mean that acceleration and
 top speed are more important than the fraction of a second to be gained
 at corners when carrying more downforce.
 After the pits straight, you roar into a fast left hander which changes
 into a slow left hander at Big Bend. Taken in 4th or 5th, this propels
 you into a slow left hander it Big bend then turns into a long sweeping
 right hander: Estoril Bend. Taken in 4th of 5th, this propels you into
 the long back straight, past the Golf Course Bend, in top at 190mph.
 after the fastest point, brake hard for the 1st gear hairpin at Adelaide
 Bend and turn into the infield part of th course. Swing into the 2nd or
 3rd gear Esse then a short straight before Nurburring, a slight right,
 then a sweeping right, then a sweeping left which turns into a double-
 apex 180 degree bend that throws you into another short straight almost
 parallel with the previous one.
 Next, a 5th gear left handler, Imola, which leads into the fast 4th gear
 bend at Chateau d'Eau then another short straight, under the bridge and
 into the chicane before you take a good line sharp right into the Lycee
 Bend, then flat out across the finishing line.

 The circuit has been altered for the 1991 Championship because it was
 considered far too dangerous. A bend such as Club corner taken in 6th at
 185mph with no run off track particually hazardous.
 Copse is a forth gear corner that pushes you into a fast straight leading
 to Maggots, where you swing into the "S" shaped Beckets in 2nd or 3rd.
 This slows the cars down and provides a better specticle for the cars
 down and provides a better spectacle for the crowd. Then the cars roar
 away from Chapel along the Hangar Straight, under the bridge, towards
 the double apex right-hander Stowe; taken in 3rd of 4th at 100mph.
 After the Vale complex you have to take Club, a 3rd gearleft-hander that
 throws you into the Abbey straight, a favorite overtaking stretch.
 In 6th, at 185mph sweep into the Farm Straight and a fast right under
 Bridge towards Priory and Brooklands.
 Two second or third gear left-handers followed by two right-handers
 ending at Luffield, then its flat out along the fast Woodcote and through
 the finishing straight.

 HOCKENHEIM - GERMANY

 Lap Record (Qualifying)...1M 37.087 Seconds
 Lap Record (Race).........1M 43.569 Seconds

 There are 3 chicanes on the circuit, one fast and two that have to be
 taken slowly. the rest of the course is a series of streights.
 This means that to have good top speed almost all downforce is taken off,
 and the cars are a horror to drive with no grip and twitchy on any bend.
 From the start you take a 4th gear right hander at 140mph, then put your
 foot down till you hit 6th at 200mph for the fastest part of the course.
 Brake hard for Chicane 1 which hooks sharp right and can be taken in 2nd
 at 50mph but if you drive a bad line you may be forced to drop to bottom
 gear. Up through the gears again, flat out, 200mph for the sweeping
 right-hander then brake again for another chicane which you take in 2nd
 at 50mph, come out of that and roarinto Ostkurve, one of the fastest
 bends of any championship course, take it in 6th, 200mph. Slow down for
 Chicane 2, drop to 4th or 3rd, then flat out for the rest of the straight
 until Agipkurve. thisis the most difficult part of the circuit and tends
 to wear out tyres prematurely. Drivers have not built up any rhythm for
 the bends and all concentration is loston the long straights.
 Approaching Sachskurve, slip to 4th, line the car into the right-hander,
 foot down, sweep round, then second gear to take the hairpin, speed up,
 line up the car for the tight right-hander, brake lightly and roar out of
 Opelkurve in 3rd towards the finishing straight.
 Hockenheimring is a good overtaking circuit but the slow chicanes
 require brutal braking and brakes tend to cool off on the long straights
 making them less efficient. Most drivers find it difficult to establish
 a satisfactory rhythm on this course.

 BUDAPEST - HUNGARY

 Lap Record (Qualifying)...1M 16.147 Seconds
 Lap Record (Race).........1M 21.547 Seconds

 A tough but reletivly slow circuit with a large number of corners and a
 few straights. Its difficult to overtake on this course and you have to
 be quite patient, waiting for the right moment. Cars are usually set
 upfor more downforce to gain the advantage of good grip on the numerous
 bends.
 Roaring away from the start, downhill, flat out in 6th at 185mph, the
 pit straight is the main overtaking point on the course. Then through
 the first of several constant radius corners at 130mph in 4th, a short
 back straight, then a double-apex left-hander leading to a long sweeping
 right. Accelerate to 165mph in 5ht, sweep left then go into another
 double apex bend. Slow down for a second gear chicane, then drive hard
 into a whole series of fast corners before the constant radius Pit Lane
 bend throws you into the long finishing straight.
 The twisting up and down nature of the track means that the average
 speeds are quite low, about 105-110mph and tyres wear out quickly as the
 drivers lose patience and try to exit corners faster than the tyres will
 allow. Most teams find that drivers come in for a tyre change much
 earlier than planned, if only to get away from the queues that develop
 on this circuit.

 Fast, challengoing and exilerating, Spa is a favourite among Grand Prix
 drivers. It successfully combines fast 6th and 5th gear corners with good
 1st gear hairpins and 2nd gear chicanes. Generally cars are set up with
 little downforce.
 frmo the start line, there is a short space of time before the cars reach
 the 1st gear, 45rpm La Source hairpin, the scene of many opening-lap
 shunts, as 26 cars brake from 160mph to 45mph while trying desperatly to
 overtake each other. Then, its a Race up through the gears, downhill in
 6th at 180mph, you drop into the Eau Rouge dip, a slight left, then sweep
 right uphill past Reidillon. This is one driving line you cannot afford
 to get wrong, one error and your off the circuit!
 Speed up through Kemmel and into a long straight, flat out at 195mph,
 weave through Les Combes and then take Melmedy in 2nd.
 This is a tricky 180 degree corner, downhill and off-chamber. Pouhon is
 next; an extremely difficult left-hander that starts off in 6th, then
 drops to 5th at 150mph. Through Les Fagnes and Stavelot then brake hard
 for the Bus Stop Chicane. Bus Stop is the drivers least favourite corner,
 to be quick you have to run over the shallow kerbs, which is always a
 risk.
 The weather is always a big factor at Spa-Francorchamps and it is
 invariably wet which results in small, hazardous steams crossing the
 circuit, making driversadjust their driving line.

 MONZA - ITLAY

 Lap Record (Qualifying)...1M 21.114 Seconds

 Monza is always full of screaming, hysterical crowds being marshmellowed
 by even more hysterical officials. The drivers absorb the atmosphere and
 are spurred on to perform to their utmost, especially if they are driving
 an italian car.
 The cars run little wing to take advantage of the very fast start/finish
 straight, Rettifilo, which is crossed at speeds inexcess of 200mph.
 The track has been modified to make it safer including the introduction
 of the 2nd gearVariante Goodyear, a chicane that leads into the famous
 5th gear Curva Grande.
 Flat out towards Lesmos in 5th there is another 2nd gear chicane: Curva
 della Roggia before the double right-hander Curva do Lesmos corner.
 You take the first part in 4th gear then power up to take the 2nd part
 flat out. These corners have to be taken just right for any slight error
 will slow you down considerably and puy you in a bad position for the
 180 mph back straight, Curva del Serragilo.
 then its a tricky 3rd gear chicane Variante Ascari, come out of this in
 5th and change down Rettifilo Centro at 190mph in top and brake hard for
 the famous Curva Parabolica, a fast, 180 degree right-hander thats taken
 in 4th at 140mph. Accelerate to 160mph out of the bend, then storm
 through the finishing line with your foot down ni 6th.

 ESTORIL - PORTUGAL

 Lap Record (Race).........1M 22.837 Seconds

 Estoril is a tough, tiring circuit with several long, constant radius
 and some very bumpy straights. If the car is starting from near the front
 of the grid then its wise to run a lot of downforce to cope with the long
 bends, but it you are starting lowdown in the order then you must use
 less downforce, otherwise you'll find it very difficult to overtake.
 The start/finish line is in the middle of the circuits longest straight.
 cars accelerate to 190mph in 6th before Turn 1, trying to overtake each
 other, before braking into 4th gear corner. Turn 2 is another sweeping
 right-hander, then its up to 5th for the short straight, brake hard for
 turn 3, the Martini Bridge Bend, a tight double-apex right-hander.
 Its important to drive a good line through the infield at estoril,
 avoiding the kerbs and the sandy, greasy edges.
 Turn 4 is almost a mirror image of the previous corner. Take the left-
 hander in 2nd at 45mph, then Racew up through the gears, swing through
 the slight right-hander, Turn 5, then flat out in 6ht at 180mph.
 This is probably the best place to overtake on the whole circuit.
 Through Turn 6, a corner that begins tight then opens out, foot down for
 a short straight and into the long series of fast bends, Turns 7-8-9-10.
 Its important to maintain a good rhythm through these bends, keep
 concentration, change up, change down, brake hard.
 The final corner before the pit straight, Turn 11, is a real challenge
 for any Formula One driver. its a long, constant redius sweeping bend
 that you enter in 4th and leave in 5th, accelerating all the way, ready
 to get in position ot overtake.
 Estoril is a circuit thats not only hard on gears and tyres but also
 tough on tyres; the long sweeping bends often mean that many drivers
 return to the pits earlier than planned as the heat and rough surface
 take their toll.

 BARCELONA - SPAIN

 Lap Record (Race).........1M 22.837 Seconds

 A new circuit that has a wide range of corners from slow, 2nd gear to
 fast 4th/5th gear and includes a very long 200mph overtaking straight.
 In shape it is very similar to Estroril but the surface is much smoother.
 drivers will have to compromise between downforce needed for the many
 bends and the speed required for the pit straight. Most will opt for
 little downforce and try to nurse their cars through the infield section.
 From the start, accelerate through the gears, flat out in 6ht heading for
 Elf, a slow left hander. if you are not in lead, this gives you a good
 opportunity to overtake under braking. then, its a slight left before a
 long sweeping 4th gear right-hander that you leave in 5th and speed up
 for the short straight to Repsol; a corner which turns back on itself
 but whose angle progressively widens. Next, a short burst of speed into
 seat, brake, drop to 2nd at 45rpm, accelerate, then slight left, slight
 right before taking Wurth in 4th and roaring off to Campsa, a fast,
 3rd/4th gear right-hander.
 After that its right and left through Nissan and flat out, up to la
 Caxia. This is another corner that starts tight and opens out. Steer in,
 get on line early and as the corner widens, move to the outside of the
 track. There is no time to put your foot down before you reach the Banc
 Sabadell, along constant radius bend.
 Next comes the approach to the straight. Sweepright, foot down , then
 right again take Renault in 3rd, change to 4th and charge out in 5th
 before hitting 6th, flat out, past the finishing line.

 An interesting, undulating course and the only figure of eight in the
 Grand Prix. Tiough, 6th gear corners combine with 1st gear hairpins to
 make tyre stops essential. Little downforce is set because of the 3 long
 straights and the cars generally feel sluggins in the corners.
 The pits straight is a 6ht gear, 190mph charge where it is perfectly
 possible to overtake, then its down to 5th for the First curve.
 You drift the car to the left side of the track, down to 4th and Race
 out of the corner.
 Next you came to a series of 4th gear bends (The S curve).
 Driving as tight a line as possible through these, you leave Dunlop Curve
 with your foot down in 5th, going uphill and blind for the oncoming left-
 hander. The car feels light as you roar over the bumpy crest and come
 down hard for the 2 right handers Degner Curve and Crossover.
 You now pass under the circuit and approach at a slow 40mph for the 1st
 gear Hairpin Curve. This corner can play havoc with your rear tyres if
 you try to exit too quickly and overspin the back wheels. Now line up the
 car for the long double apex left hander. Enter in 4th but slow down for
 the 2nd part of Spoon Curve for its quite easy to spin off here.
 Next you get one of the fastest straights, 6th gear, 180mph, sweeping
 left with both hands on the wheel, ease your car carefully through the
 slow Casio Chicane then storm through flat out past the finishing
 straight.

 A hard, unforgetting street circuit that requires numerous gear changes
 and is very tough on brakes and tyres. The last Grand Prix venue of the
 champoinship season and always very exciting as teams try to finish the
 year off with a win. Adelaide has been responsible for deciding the
 outcome of several championship, the most famous being Nigel Mansells
 blow out in 1986. Again, there is a need to compromise; youll need a lot
 of 90 degree bends but you will also need speed of the Jones and Brabhim
 straights.
 After the start, you come to a fast 4th gear chicane at Wakefield Road,
 take this at about 140mph then flat out towards the Finders Street
 complex. The road is very bumpy here and the occasional manhole cover
 will knock the breath out of you. Brake hard for a difficult 2nd gear 90
 degree right hander then left 90 degrees and right 90 degrees.
 Through East TerRace and a fast off-camber left-hander, drop down to 2nd
 gear and steer a good line to hit Jones's straight in 5th. Foot down,
 then a slight right and into Brabham straight, under the 2 bridges flat
 out, 200mph in 6th.
 Next you step on the brakes to take the tricky 1st gear 40mph hairpin
 and speed up into 3rd for a deceptive tightening corner stay wide as
 long as possible hit the apex late, brake, change down, take a line on
 the outside and follow the curve of the bend to give you the smoothest
 possible exit angle. Past Pits and right through Racecourse, brake hard,
 change down into 2nd for a good fast exit into the finishing straight.
