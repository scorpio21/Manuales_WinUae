Mighty Bombjack

Play the game and get a high score.  Enter one of the following words
instead of your name:

RABBIT     Activate cheat mode
SAMPLENUM  Shows game version information

Once the cheat mode is activated, you will see a new option on the
title screen allowing you to choose the starting level.  Use the keys
'F4' and 'F5' to increase/decrease the starting level.  You will also
gain infinite lives (but not M's).

On the final level, there are hidden chests you have to open by
jumping on them to open the exit.  The first sub-section has a chest
about 4 blocks on the level just above where you start.  The second
subsection has a hidden chest at the bottom of the tower of chests,
and the final subsection has a hidden opening just to the right and
above the person you have to rescue.
