Magic Pockets


 CHEAT MODE:

 As you loose your last life, hold down the fire button.
 Now when the game restarts, you will begin with your previous score.
 Keep repeating this process untill you have 100,000 points at which
 point you'll receive Giga-Power!
 This cheat only works with early copies of the game.


 TIPS:

 On the first level, enter 3 secret rooms using the teleport helmet.
 In the third room you will find a golden chalice. Pick it up and
 you will start each subsequent level with full power-ups.
