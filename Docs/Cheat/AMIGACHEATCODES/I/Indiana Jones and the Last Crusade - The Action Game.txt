Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade (Action Game)


 CHEAT MODE:

 Enter 'SILLYNAM' into the high score table for infinite lives.

 If that's still not enough then type 'IEHOVAH' on the title screen.
 Now pressing [L] during play skips levels and keys [1] and [2] will
 take you to the halfway points in the level.
