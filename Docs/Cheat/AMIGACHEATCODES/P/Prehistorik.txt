After killing the strange turtle-like creature on the first level, you should
come to a screen with two carnivorous fish bouncing up and down in the water,
along with four banks.  To get to the secret room don't jump over the first
well.  Instead, jump inside it and fall down into the secret room!

Later on the first level, look out for a ladder near some water which leads
up to a platform containing an egg.  Climb the ladder and take the egg, then
go to the left into the water to find the submarine room.

There is also a way to find some hidden extra food.  Go to the third screen
of level three and jump forward hitting empty space.  The hidden food should
now appear.
