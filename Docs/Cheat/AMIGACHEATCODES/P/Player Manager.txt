PLAYER MANAGER

        1.  Buy a few young, cheap players and keep them in the squad for a
            whole season. Next year, their price will have increased and you
            should have no trouble selling them for a huge profit. 

        2.  Only buy players with very high agility ratings, as this effects
            all their other attributes. If agility is high (about 200),
            expect the player to become an excellent footballer, given a
            season or two. 

        3.  Remove 8 or 9 players from your team, then after 2 or 3 big
            defeats you will receive sponsorship.
