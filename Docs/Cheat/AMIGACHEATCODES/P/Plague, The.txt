The Plague
----------

On the loadingscreen, hold down the left mousebutton and then press the fire
button to get unlimited lives.
(This cheat only works on the pre-release version of The plague).

First make your score end in a three (by shooting the bubbles). 
Then hit 'P' to pause the game, then hit ESCape, then click "No" when asked
if you want to play again. This takes you to the title screen with the 
barbarian.
Now type the following: 'KOM JE ILLEGAAL DOOR DE PLAAG DAN GRIJPT DE JUNGLE
COMMAND JE IN JE KRAAG' (This is a Dutch sentence); then hit RETURN.
The border should turn green. Hit the fire button to return to the game.
Now you'll have infinite lives. You must do this on Level 1 before you're 
killed even once.
