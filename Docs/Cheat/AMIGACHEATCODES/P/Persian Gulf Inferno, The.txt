Persian Gulf Inferno


 PLAYING TIPS:

 Here are  some directions that will help you get going in PGI.
 When you come across terrorists always remember to shoot the terrorists
 in front of you and keep running in the same direction. Do not worry
 about the terrorists behind you.


                           THE WALK THRU
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                       
                         B.A.S.I.C. TRAINING
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Not having had the benefit of the manual that was most likely included
with PGI, (for reasons best left unsaid). I've no idea how thoroughly the
elementary moves are described. Since some operations seemed not readily
apparent to me, I'll cover what might be good-to-know stuff first... 

  THE CLOCK: Ticks away to blast off time, but a secondary counter keeps
track of your neutral, (that's centered), joystick time. You are penalized
for standing still. This hidden timer allows about 5 minutes of
accumulative head scratching time before nukeing you. If you keep moving
there's plenty of time to search and destroy everything.

  EXITING ROOMS: Pressing the fire button gets get you out again, but a lazy
finger will snap off a few rounds of your current weapon. Hold your stick
full Left or Right while punching the button to exit. This maneuver gets you
out and trotting all in the same stroke.

  WASTING TOWEL HEADS: You can't shoot 'em if you're movin', (the familiar
chewing gum syndrome). You have to stop first. If you have an adjustable
tension joystick, (ie: GRAVISICK), set it to hard and it will center faster
when you release it. Got some fancy buttons? Use 'em!:  Quickest on the
trigger gets the last snicker!... (Oooooo!).

                       When everyBODY in front of you is falling down, move
FORWARD immediately, or the rat who showed up late on the other side of the
screen  will back-shoot you. Square away who ever shows up next and keep
moving til the back-rat is off screen, and he will disappear, (I think the
coward runs off and hides in one of the empty rooms you've checked out).

                       Kneeling down and rolling forward are major time
wasters in the fire fights... Stand up and take it like a man! Turning
around to pop the back-rat is verrry bad for your health.

                       Switch weapons BEFORE entering a hazardous area, as
this move also requires standing still, and you will pay for it if being
shot at. I have never run out of ammo while continuously shooting, even when the 'Mag' count dropped to zero, also, there is a clearly visible finger
print embossed into the hard plastic of my fire button!

                       With Pistol or UZI, one or two hits will stun a
bad-guy, for a very short second, three hits are required to put 'em down.
  The shotgun is efficient but slower for rapid fire. It will re-fire faster
with multiple presses of the fire button, a little risky in multiple
encounters, as timing is critical, but then the effect is also very
satisfying!

  EXPLOSIVE CHARGES:  Are for convenient doorknob eradication.

                      Lesson A ...

                         1. Stand in front of a door.
                         2. Press the SPACE BAR.
                         3. Watch yourself blow-up and fall down dead!
                            (a most useful feature for ending the game
                             quickly and getting back to preparing dinner
                             for the kids!)
                             * Read thoughtful programming here!

                      Lesson B ...

                         1. Repeat steps 1. & 2. above.
                         2. !!! This time run away !!!
                         3. Open previously locked door and remove contents.

                (These puppies will also work on UNlocked doors!)

             ** Special note: You are issued two charges at the
                start of the game. There are two more behind a
                locked door...
                Use one to eradicate THAT doorknob, and you now have
                THREE opportunities-to-end-the-game-quickly! And...
                you are feeling very, very baa-aad! But more on this
                fine point latter.

  To be prepared to try this daring ploy, you will have to be fairly
familiar with the terrain of the two PGI buildings. So I'll not bore you any
further with the detailed directions I've used before, but simply sketch out
locations and items you'll need.


                       And for everyone else...

  If you haven't etched the building layouts onto the backs of your eyeballs, as some have, then you probably would not appreciate the elegance of this
route through towel land anyway. So, go play a few more rounds and earn your
wings.

Minimal route to Nirvana:

BLDG. #1 - 1. Pick up both cards and ALL ammo.
           2. Get the shotgun if you're the security blanket type.
              (but if you have to use it your chances of success are slim)
BLDG. #2 - 1. Go up the first stairs and blow the first door to get the
              two EXPLOSIVE CHARGES, (two for one! not bad!).
              You now have three.
           2. Run the cat-walk on floor seven and do the best you can.
           3. Go down and up to get the UZI on floor nine, (that's right,
              blow the door of its hinges), but don't use it.
              You now have two EXPLOSIVE CHARGES.
           4. Go down to floor four and clear the way to the first door.
              Grab the ammo.
           5. Keep going and pick up the free-bee ammo at the yellow door.
           6. Come back to the elevator and then up to floor ten.
           7. Get another free-bee from the door just past the stairs.
              (you'll have something left in your pistol, 8mags for the
              shotgun and a full load in the UZI, switch to the UZI).
           8. Back to the elevator again, we're taking the long ride to the
              roof. (Getting the picture? Yep, over the top and down the
              throat).
           9. Go up the roof access, turn left and limber up your trigger
              finger.
              You'll make or break it right here. Rush the guards and gain
              as much ground with each break as possible. Control your
              bursts. It takes three rounds to knock down each man, but
              only a half dozen to kill everyone in your line of fire. They
              will pop up four, five sometimes six at a time. If only one
              or two show, then stun them with a short burst, then nail all
              of them when more appear. Do it right and you'll eventually
              make it to the West roof access that leads into the secured
              office area. (Didn't know it was this easy did ya?)
          10. Jump down the roof access ladder. You may have one mag left
              for the UZI, if so use it, if not switch to the shotgun. If
              you were feeling really mean and didn't bring the shotgun,
              don't bother with the pistol, keep the empty UZI.
          11. Now for the tricky stuff!... turn right and rush to the ammo
              door. As soon as you're on it blow it up. Run left to avoid
              the explosion, and immediately back and open the door. Manna
              from heaven! There's nine mags for the UZI and several for the
              shotgun. The guards seem stupefied by this outrageous behavior
              so you'll probably only take one or two hits. Duck back into
              the stairwell, they won't follow.
          12. Down to the bottom, turn right and rush again WITH the UZI
              till you reach the BOMB DOOR. Place your last charge and run
              RIGHT, (I know, right into the line of fire. But if you run
              the other way the explosive will get you!?! Somebody musta
              fixed it that way.), you'll take some serious damage before
              getting back to the door. But you're tough, and close only
              counts in horse shoes. Get in the door and you're home free!
          13. Do your stuff, pick your wire not your nose, and Janet will
              have your babies.


                Thee-a-thee-a-thee-a That's all folks!
                                   See you on the firing range.
