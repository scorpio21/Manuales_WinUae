Power Drift


 CHEAT MODE:

 Enter and win every race on every course except course D.
 You must win them and get a gold medal, finishing in the top three
 isn't good enough. Collect all the gold medals and you will enter a
 bonus round on a secret course with you in control of the F-14 Tomcat
 from Afterburner with no collision detection.
 Do the same thing on course D and collect all the gold medals and
 this time you will be in control of the Super Hang On bike.
