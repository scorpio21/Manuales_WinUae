Power Drive

Here are the level codes for the game.  All codes start with the
minimum 1% damage to the headlights (which is the cheapest thing to
fix and because the car is damaged, allows you to buy a new car) and
$500,000 cash (which should be enough to complete the game):

Level Codes:

Stage 2 - "BBBBBBBCMBCLBBBBLBR1" - (Kenya)
Stage 3 - "BBBBBBBCMBCLBBBCLBR2" - (Sweden)
Stage 4 - "BBBBBBBCMBCLBBBDLBR3" - (Corsica)
Stage 5 - "BBBBBBBCMBCLBBBFLBR5" - (Arizona)
Stage 6 - "BBBBBBBCMBCLBBBGLBR6" - (Finland)
Stage 7 - "BBBBBBBCMBCLBBBHLBR7" - (Australia)
Stage 8 - "BBBBBBBCMBCLBBBJLBR9" - (Great Britain)

If you complete the final stage (Great Britain) you become world
champion and get a bonus track in Arizona (which has no level code).

Note that the level codes have the drivers name built into them so you
will always appear as "IAN" if you use any of the codes above.
