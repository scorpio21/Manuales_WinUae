PGA Tour Golf

Before you tee off on the first hole click the button for the tournament
statistics. Look through all of these, and then play the game as normal and
you'll find that your opponents have dropped quite a few shots. Do this on
each hole and by the end of the game the computer players will be quite a
way behind you.
