Tony Donaldson is arrested by showing his diary to the Policeman telling of
how he burned his parents.

Susan   Blandford  is  arrested  by  showing  the  Policeman  the  marriage
certificate,  the  crumpled note and the developed photographs, proving her
relationship with Peter Mason and the planning of her husband's murder.

Peter  Mason,  although  he  is  killed  in  the car crash, would have been
arrested  by showing the Policeman the broken numberplate and the bill from
his garage, which proved he ran down Susan's husband, Jimmy Blandford.

Michael Williams is the Vampire.

Alice Greenwood is the Witch.

All these people must be got rid of, plus the Hell-Hound, before attempting
to finish the adventure.

                         Policeman of the walled-up woman, but make
                         sure that you have done all you need to do
                         as the Vicarage is then guarded by the Police
                         who stop further entry to the Vicarage).

                                THE ENDGAME

YOU WILL NEED:
                     THE HOLY WATER IN A CORKED BOTTLE
                     THE HOLY AXE COMPLETE WITH HANDLE
                            THE CEREMONIAL ROBE

Go to the Manor driveway and wait for the Gardener to leave at 11:00pm

There are TWO ways that you can proceed from here, one is the correct way,
and the other is the wrong way.


THE WRONG WAY................
                               Enter the Manor, swing across the gap using
the rope or climb it and go down the stairs. Enter the burnt-out library,
move the leaves and find a trapdoor, open the trapdoor and go down, find
yourself in a vaulted corridor..........This way is a RED HERRING!!!!

THE CORRECT WAY..............
                 ENTER THE MAUSOLEUM AND 'PUSH THE COFFIN'
               (This will open up a passageway leading down)

                  'WEAR THE CEREMONIAL ROBE' and go DOWN.

                         MOVE EAST ONCE THEN STOP.

       (You now have to wait until 12:18pm when two Acolytes appear)

                     'REMOVE THE CORK FROM THE BOTTLE'
   (When the two Acolytes enter the Chamber at 12:24pm, you follow them)

                              IN THE CHAMBER

(A group of Acolytes appear and stand around a pyre upon which a young girl
is about to be sacrificed)

While this is going on, type: 'KILL FATHER WITH AXE'......But DON'T hit
[RETURN].

When told that you recognise the Main Acolyte as your Father, THEN hit
[RETURN].

Upon killing your Father, the Devil stands in his place.

                          'THROW WATER AT DEVIL'


.................The end of your Personal Nightmare, or is it?!!!
