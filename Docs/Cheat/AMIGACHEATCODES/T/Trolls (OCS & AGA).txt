Trolls


 CHEAT MODE:

 Begin the game and walk along to the Soda Pop level door.
 Pull down on the joystick to enter the level as normal and as soon
 as the "Get Ready" screen apears, push up on the joystick and press
 the [K] key while pressing fire. You should now start that particular
 level and if you press the [Escape] key at any time during the game
 you will complete whichever level you're curently on.
