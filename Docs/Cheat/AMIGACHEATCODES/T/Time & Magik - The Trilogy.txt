CONGRATULATIONS
You have completed Red Moon and saved the Kingdom of Baskalos
Your score 1000/1000 and are a Grandmaster Adventurer.

THE PRICE OF MAGIK
Level 9 (1986)
Walk Through by Dorothy Millard

Notes

1. There is no limit to the number of items carried.
2. You should avoid combat unless it is essential, as dealing with your
opponent's ghosts saps your stamina and slows progress through the game.
3. Casting magik spells costs you years so check "SCORE" at regular
intervals.  Touching the red moon reduces your game age.   If you become 80
you're living dangerously and at 100 you're dead.

2. DED - Cancels all spells (focii alloy wheel)
3. DET - Detects danger (focii elder cross)
4. DOW - Checks the magikal properties of target (focii pendulum)
5. ESP - Look into another room (focii crystal ball)
6. FIN - Turns mail-clad target into a fish (focii silver mail)
7. FIX - Cures target of injuries (focii valerian)
8. FLY - Causes target to "levitate" (focii broom)
9. HYP - Hypnotises target to obey you (focii staff)
10. IBM - Scares the target (focii blue box)
11. KIL - Madly confuses target in combat (focii axe)
12. MAD - Angers target (focii grimoire)
13. SAN - Restores sanity to target (focii claw)
14. SEE - Detects secret doors (focii feldspar lens)
15. SPY - See into room of target (focii candle)

grey, white - it is necessary to magikally examine each one in turn with
the DOW spell to establish which one contains the salt that you will need,
to do this you will need to study the action of the pendulum when the spell
is cast... a circular movement of the pendulum indicates no contents, a
side to side motion is the indication that you've located the correct
chest... the colour of the chest containing the salt is randomly allocated
for each game), CAST DOW AT (colour) CHEST (repeat this with each chest in
turn until you get the correct response from the pendulum), OPEN (colour)
