Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles


 CHEAT MODE:

 When entering the protection routine type in '8859' and then '1506'
 before entering in the correct code. Now during the game pressing the
 [Help] key will toggle invincibility on/off and if you have lost any
 turtles it will restore them all to full energy.
