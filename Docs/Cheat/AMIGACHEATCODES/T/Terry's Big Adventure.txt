Terry's Big Adventure

On the first level go to the right until you come upon three mushrooms
in a row (the first mushrooms you will see).  Get the first mushroom,
jump over the 2nd one and get the 3rd one.  Now continue to the right
until you reach a section with two special weapon power-ups that are
next to two mushrooms (right before the first bridge and there is a
cloud above them).  Stand in front of the first power-up and pull down
to take it.  Now jump over the other power-up and the first mushroom.
Get the 2nd mushroom.  Work your way past the bridge until you come to
the next tree in the background and stand in front of the tree.  Now
push the fire button and push up on the joystick.  The screen should
flash yellow letting you know it worked.  Finally press 'C' to toggle
infinite lives and invincibility and press 'N' to advance levels.

NOTE:  If you die before you activate the cheat you must press
       'RETURN' to abort the game and restart.  Also, you can pick
       up all the mushrooms and power-ups between the sections.
