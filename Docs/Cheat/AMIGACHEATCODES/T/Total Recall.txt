Total Recall


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the title screen (the one with Arnolds face on it) type in
 'LISTEN TO THE WHALES'. The screen will then flip in acknowledgement
 that the cheat mode has been activated. This gives you infinite energy
 on all of the platform levels.
 However, on the driving sections for infinite energy you must type in
 'JIMMY HENDRIX' instead.
