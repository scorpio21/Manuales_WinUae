Tactical Manager


 CHEAT MODE:

 Type 'CODE' on the main screen and a prompt will appear asking you to
 enter a code. Put in the word 'CODE' a second time and a list of cheats
 will appear. To access the full editor just type 'EDIT' on the main
 screen (without typing 'CODE' first). You can now press:

 [W] - Enables you to manage any team, but make sure you have accessed
       the editor otherwise it doesn't work.

 Once you have typed W, a small green and yellow strip should appear
 just along from the logo and auto icon things, under the second logo
 space. You can now go to the managers menu and join any club.
 Your rating automaticlly jumps to that of the new team, unless you
 are joining a lesser club. Finally, if you want to alter teams because
 of transfers among Premiership and Division 1 teams, to maintain more
 accurate club records, instead of creating a whole new player in the
 editor, it is best to make yourself the manager of the club who bought
 the player, enable FREE transfers, and transfer the player that way.
 This means the player keeps his original ID number. For example,
 Paul Furlong was bought by Chelsea from Watford, so to enable this
 change, simply become Chelsea manager, enable FREE transfers, and
 approach Watford.
