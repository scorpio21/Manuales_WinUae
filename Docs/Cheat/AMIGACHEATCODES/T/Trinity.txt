World tensions seem to be running high, but so what else is new? Darned if
you're going to let that get in the way of enjoying the last day of your
vacation. You don't get over to the east side of the Atlantic often and
there's no reason for angry rhetoric to spoil a stroll through Kensington
Gardens. It's a spot you will have to learn to love, since you're doomed to
be passing through it forever. But the good news is you're going to become an
integral part of the space-time continuum. But that's for physicists; let's
get on with the game!

As in any game, be sure to map. The mapping is especially fun in this game,
since it shows great symmetry with the props included with the package,
particularly, the Sundial. You start off at the Palace Gate, getting ready
for a stroll through the park. The first place to go is off to the northeast,
The Wabe. Here you'll find an object that is the central theme for the whole
game, a Sundial. If you examine it, you notice that the gnomon, the piece
that casts the shadow, is loose. Hmmm. UNSCREW GNOMON. It falls to the
ground. TAKE GNOMON.

From the Wabe go southeast to the Flower Walk. But what's that in the bushes?
A soccer ball. TAKE BALL. (There are very few red herrings in this game.) Go
north from here. I'll meet you at Lancaster Walk.

There is water on two sides of us here. First try going east toward the Long
Water. Whoa! That's some tough grass. But notice what an easy time the
bicyclists have. Well, let's head off to the west. This is the Round Pond, a
quaint European scene. Take a look at the boats. What's this, a paper bird?
TAKE BIRD. Look at the bird. There's some writing. OPEN BIRD. READ PAPER.
Take a look at your watch. 4 pm isn't far away. You're going to have to find
a way across that grass.

Go northwest. This is the Black Lion Gate. Some irresponsible nanny has
forgotten her perambulator. (Don't worry, you can call it a pram.) OPEN PRAM.
Whew! At least she didn't forget the child. This has wheels, kind off like
bicycle tires. Better bring it with you. PUSH PRAM SOUTH.

Here at the Broad Walk you see an old woman selling crumbs. At least she
isn't on the dole. Patronize the woman; BUY CRUMBS. She offers the bag and
your change: TAKE BAG AND COIN. Put the coin and the paper (from the bird) in
your pocket. Might as well give some crumbs to the birds. FEED BIRDS. (Once,
and only once. You'll notice that the wind shifts.) What's this? A Ruby? Try
to take it. Beep Beep! A Roadrunner in England? These crumbs are going to be
useful, so take care not to spill them.

PUSH PRAM NORTHEAST. Here you are at the Iverness Terrace. There is a
typically preoccupied British youth listening to his walkman and blowing
bubbles. Don't antagonize the fellow, just remember the scene for future
reference. PUSH THE PRAM EAST.

Here at the Lancaster Gate you'll see a woman struggle with and lose her
umbrella. Oh, the poor woman, look at her face. Before you can help, she has
left and her umbrella is in the tree. Well, maybe you can give it back to her
at some other time. THROW BALL AT UMBRELLA. Down it falls. TAKE UMBRELLA.
PUSH THE PRAM SOUTH, back to Lancaster Walk.

Time is running out. GET IN THE PRAM. (Don't you feel silly? You certainly
look silly.) Now how to get this thing moving? Remember the wind? OPEN
UMBRELLA. Eiiiiiggghhhh! When you get up you'll notice you will have dropped
everything. TAKE ALL. (Don't worry about the pram.) When you read the
description, you'll notice that the rhetoric has turned into war and the
first missile is on its way! Fortunately, a door appears over the water.
ENTER WATER. ENTER DOOR. (And, yes, it is a good direction!) You're on your
way to the other side!

You find yourself in a meadow. A shadow lies across the room. You will become
very familiar with the shadow. Also here is a gigantic mushroom. There are
six others like it in this part of the game. Five of them must be solved
before the sixth one can be solved. (If you haven't yet done so, save the
game and have a look around and then continue from here.) The only way out of
this room is to the north. You are now at the Summit, and have seen or will
see a meteor fly through the sky and hear it hit the ground.

From the Summit go northeast to the South Bog. Amid the bog is a decaying
log. It sparkles as it decays. Most adventurers recognize a potential light
source when they see one, and this is certainly one. KICK LOG. TAKE SPLINTER.
No need to worry about grues or other such creatures now. Go east to the
Bottom of the Stairs. Go up twice to the Top of Vertex, and notice the
temperature. EXAMINE HOLE. EXAMINE RING. Try to screw the gnomon in the hole.
The threading doesn't match. You'll try again later. Go down twice.

From the bottom of the stairs go south to the Trellises and southwest to the
Arborvitaes. Go east to the Arboretum and notice the statue. Go north to the
North Arbor and then up to the Top of Arbor. Here you'll see an axe. TAKE
AXE. It will be an extremely important piece of equipment. Go down (to the
south if they ask) and you'll be in the South Arbor. Go down into the
Arboretum and once again notice the statue. The name is sdrawkcaB! Go west
and then northeast to get back to the Trellises and then north again to the
Bottom of Stairs. Go up twice. Now SCREW GNOMON IN HOLE. It works this time
because the threading (and everything else) has been reversed. EXAMINE THE
RING again. Notice that the symbols on the ring are the same that are on the
sundial in the game package. Also note that they are present in the
"Illustrated Story of the Atomic Bomb" in the game documentation. You'll
notice a lever has popped up, too.

Go down twice. From here go northeast to Under Cliff. You will see a bee hive
here. Go east to the Crater's Edge and east again into the crater. Here is
that meteorite that you saw earlier. You can't take it now, however, because
it is too hot. You will have to find a way to cool it down. Go west and then
northwest to the Bluff. Here is a cottage. OPEN DOOR. Go east into the
Cottage. Examine the surroundings, they are interesting and amusing. LISTEN
TO THE BIRD. Get the whole recipe; be sure of it by WAITing enough times so
that bird repeats the first thing you heard. (Not including "Awks!" or other
bird-type sounds.) Now you have a quest.

OPEN THE BACK DOOR. Go east to the Herb Garden. You'll see some mushrooms,
one with a door, and a refuse pile. SEARCH PILE. TAKE GARLIC. You now have
one of the necessary ingredients. Go west back into the cottage and DROP THE
GARLIC (not in the cauldron). Go west again to the bluff and then southwest
to the Chasm's Brink. You'll see the shadow here and a big tree. In order to
cross the chasm, you have to fell this tree. Fortunately, you have your axe
with you. CHOP TREE WITH AXE. Make sure the tree falls where you want it to:
PUSH TREE NORTH. The tree will bridge the gap and you can go north to the
Mesa. When you get there you will see another mushroom, but the white is
open. ENTER DOOR.

If you've noticed the correlation between the sundial and the documentation,
then you know where you are. Climb down from the Scaffold. OPEN BOX. TURN ON
SWITCH. You can listen to the final procedure checks. PUSH BUTTON. Now you
can get out as the doors open. Go south to the South Beach. You can walk
around a bit, but better just to go northwest to West Beach. You can see a
small islet a short way off shore. Try to enter the water. Owww! Don't bother
trying to placate these crabby creatures, it can't be done. If you simply
WAIT a few turns some interesting things happen. You will see a large dark
fin approach you and you will see a coconut fall from a tree on the islet.
Don't back away from the fin; just prepare yourself for...a dolphin! He's
friendly and intelligent and, sadly, probably soon dead. When the tide has
risen so that the coconut is afloat, POINT AT COCONUT. The clever dolphin
understands you and sends it to your feet. TAKE COCONUT. You must now take
leave of the dolphin and go back through the door. Go southeast then north.
UP. ENTER DOOR.

You are now back on the Mesa. Go south and then northwest. You see the boy
again, but now he's huge. You'll get back to him. Go south. This is the North
Bog, directly north of the South Bog. Notice the Venus Flytrap. Go southeast
to the Bottom of the Stairs. DROP UMBRELLA here. Go northeast. This hive is
no doubt the place for the honey. This is no time to stop taking risks: PUT
HAND IN HIVE. Now you've done it. You need a defense. The Flytrap! Without
hesitation go west twice. The bee will get sidetracked (permanently) and you
can go back for the honey. Go east twice. PUT HAND IN HIVE.

From here you must go back to the cottage to get rid of this honey which is
stuck to your hand. Go east then northwest, then east again to enter the
cottage. You were daring to get the honey, now be daring to get rid of it:
PUT HAND IN CAULDRON. That's one down, three to go. DROP COCONUT. CRACK
COCONUT WITH AXE. TAKE COCONUT. POUR MILK IN CAULDRON. That's two down and
two to go, and the garlic is right here on the floor. But what about the
lizard? DROP THE COCONUT and let's find it.

Go west, southeast, west and southwest to get back to the Bottom of the
Stairs. Go up twice and TURN RING TO THIRD SYMBOL. Go down twice and west
twice until you reach the Waterfall. Go north to the Cemetery, noticing the
crypt, and then north again into the Barrow. You'll see a barrow wight here,
but he'll not bother you so long as you have a light source. You will also
see a small hole in the wall. Go north again and you'll be in the Ossuary,
surrounded by those less fortunate then yourself. SEARCH THE BONES and you
should find (appropriately enough) a skeleton key. TAKE KEY. The mushroom
here has its white door open. (The shadow from the enormous gnomon is the key
to the doors; by changing the position of the gnomon by turning the ring, you
direct the shadow from the suns toward a particular door. While the shadow
touches the door it remains open (until you pass back through it). By keeping
the lever down the suns are prevented from moving.) ENTER DOOR.

This area is the Underground. You'll notice a small thermonuclear device
waiting to be detonated. You will also see a lantern. TAKE LANTERN. Go west.
TAKE WALKIE-TALKIE. A skink is a small lizard, by the way. Go west. By now
you have probably noticed that the skink is afraid of light. To get it out of
the crevice, PUT SPLINTER IN CREVICE. The skink then runs by to the east.
Time to corral that li'l critter. Go east. TURN ON LANTERN. DROP LANTERN. Go
west and there is the confused and bewildered skink running around at you
feet. TAKE SKINK. PUT SKINK IN POCKET. This is no time to be squeamish. Go
east and TAKE LANTERN. Go east twice, the second time being back through the
door.

Now that you are back in the Ossuary, you have to get out of this creepy
place but those bars are there to see that you don't. Go south. Remember that
hole? PUT KEY IN HOLE. TURN KEY. Just go DOWN to get out to the Ice Cavern.
First thing to do is TURN OFF LANTERN. You will need it again later. In fact,
LOOK AT LANTERN. It is now time for some inventory management.

Go east to get to the Waterfall and then east twice more to get to the Bottom
of Stairs. DROP WALKIE TALKIE AND LANTERN. Those two items and the umbrella
should now be here. Return to the Ice Cavern by going west three times. LOOK
AT CEILING. There are icicles there, just the thing to cool a hot meteorite.
THROW AXE AT ICICLES. One falls to the ground. TAKE AXE AND ICICLE. Save the
game here. (I hope you have been doing so regularly.) Take the icicle to the
Crater using the shortest possible route. Oops, didn't quite make it, eh? A
detour is in order. From the Ice Cavern go east three times to the Bottom of
the Stairs and up twice to the Vertex. (Remember that it's cold in thin air.)
While you're here, TURN RING TO SECOND SYMBOL. Now that the icicle is
refrozen, go down twice, northeast, and east twice to get into the crater. No
time to lose, PUT ICICLE ON LUMP. You can feel its pull on the axe, so you
know it is a magnet of sorts. TAKE LUMP. It is now time to visit the bubble
boy.

Go west three times and then northwest to get back the Promontory. GET IN
WATER. WAIT until you are swept up into a bubble. You do not have to worry
about any special means of guiding the bubble, simply give directions
normally. Go south, then southwest and finally IN. The bubble freezes and you
are floating in space. When you read the description, you will notice that
the moon, in crescent form, is coming into view. TAKE SKINK. KILL SKINK. Soon
you will collide with a satellite (the kind Cap Weinberger dreams of) due to
the force of the magnetic meteorite. Save the game. When the satellite brings
you VERY close to the white door, BREAK BUBBLE WITH AXE. This will propel you
into the door and send you back to the Waterfall.

You now have the last ingredient for the potion the bird described. Go
northeast, east, northeast, and east to get back into the Cottage. Open the
cage door and let the bird go. PUT SKINK IN CAULDRON. TAKE GARLIC. PUT GARLIC
IN CAULDRON. EAST. WAIT. After the Boom you can go back into the cottage. The
book and pedestal and map are all destroyed. However, if you look in the
cauldron there is an emerald there. TAKE EMERALD. That leaves three mushrooms
to go.

TAKE CAGE then go west, southwest, southwest again, and east back to the
Bottom of Stairs. You can now DROP ALL BUT CAGE and go up twice. SET THE RING
TO FIFTH SYMBOL and go down twice. Go west, northeast, northeast again, east,
and east again. This will bring you back to the Herb Garden where the door in
the mushroom is now awaiting you. ENTER WHITE DOOR. This brings you out onto
the Platform in Siberia. Go down to Under Platform. Eeek, what's that? WAIT a
turn and you'll see that the ground is covered with rodents which are racing
to the northeast. May as well follow them so go northeast twice. At the Cliff
Edge you recognize these rodents as lemmings. They are so thick underfoot
that they almost obscure the fissure beneath your feet. EXAMINE FISSURE and
sure enough, there is a lemming in there just waiting for you to take it.
TAKE LEMMING. PUT LEMMING IN CAGE. CLOSE CAGE. That's what you're here to get
so go southwest twice, up, and ENTER DOOR to exit back to the Herb Garden.

Go west twice, southwest twice, and east. Now go up twice and SET RING TO
SIXTH SYMBOL. Go down twice, DROP CAGE, and TAKE UMBRELLA AND PAPER. Go east
twice to the Moor where another mushroom with an open door invites you in.
ENTER DOOR and ooops...where's the ground? Pretty far down so you'd better
OPEN UMBRELLA. Once again you seem to have dropped everything so TAKE ALL. Go
east into the Shelter and TAKE SPADE. Go west back out to the Playground and
examine your surroundings to be sure you know where you are. WAIT for a
little while and a girl will appear and be very interested in that umbrella
of yours. It's clear she would like it but maybe you should charge her for
it. You'll need a way back up to that white door in the sky. If you could
only fly. Did you see anything in the school windows that gave you an idea
what to do here? Perhaps one of those paper birds is the answer. Of course,
you still have your own paper bird, don't you? Oh, it's a little ruined? So
refold it. YOU can't. GIVE PAPER TO GIRL. Now we're on to something. GIVE
UMBRELLA TO GIRL. See, you knew something magical would happen! BOARD BIRD
and once it stops just ENTER DOOR.

Now it is time to use the spade. From our map we know that the seventh
mushroom must be across the river, but if you've ever tried to board that
dory while you were alive, you know you can't. If you've never tried it, go
ahead, it doesn't hurt and may yield a smile. From the Moor go west four
times and then north. Here in the Cemetery is that crypt whose lid you may
have tried to pry with the umbrella or axe. Neither of them worked; but if
you examine the spade, you'll see that it looks sturdy enough. PRY LID WITH
SPADE. LOOK IN CRYPT. EXAMINE CORPSE. TAKE SHROUD and you may as well WEAR
SHROUD. TAKE BANDAGE and then LOOK IN MOUTH. TAKE SILVER COIN. Looks like
we're ready to cross that river now. But wait, that silly corpse is wearing a
green boot and a red boot. TAKE RED BOOT AND GREEN BOOT. WEAR RED BOOT. WEAR
GREEN BOOT. They may just come in handy. Go south and then east twice. You
can DROP BANDAGE AND SPADE. You should now TAKE CAGE, EMERALD, WALKIE-TALKIE,
LAMP, AND BAG.

You are now ready for the seventh mushroom. Don't forget to go up twice, SET
RING TO SEVENTH SYMBOL, and go down twice before you set out for the river.
Go southeast and WAIT. Once the real ghosts take a seat you can BOARD DORY.
Because you have covered up those tourist shorts with a shroud you should
have no problem with this. GIVE SILVER COIN TO OARSMAN and you're off on the
final leg of your journey.

From the Sand Bar, go south. You should be greeted by the roadrunner with
that ruby. ENTER DOOR after the roadrunner and emerge in New Mexico. You are
in the Shack and because of the voices outside it seems prudent to stay here
for a while so let's read a little. DROP CAGE. TAKE BOOK. READ BOOK. It's not
very interesting so DROP BOOK and TAKE SLIP OF CARDBOARD. EXAMINE SLIP OF
CARDBOARD. READ POETRY and EXAMINE DIAGRAM. Take careful note of the diagram
each time you play because the diagram is different each time and its
information is critical to your success. DROP SLIP OF CARDBOARD and TAKE
CAGE.

It sounds as if the men have left so go west and then down twice. Here's the
roadrunner and that ruby. Hmmm, we already have an emerald. That makes a red
gem and a green gem! There must be some connection then between the gems and
the red and green boot. EXAMINE GREEN BOOT. Yup, looks like that emerald
would fit into that recess. PUT EMERALD IN GREEN BOOT. Interesting,and
probably useful. TAKE RUBY. PUT RUBY IN RED BOOT. Looks like you are ready
for some speedy traveling and that is essential because time is short. From
your Illustrated Story of the Atom Bomb you know that the bomb will be tested
at 5:30. (With the wings on your boots you can cover one move in the desert
in 15 seconds but without the wings it will take you 5 minutes. Brewing up
that emerald was a required part of the game!)

Go northwest three times and you will be at the Paved Road near the jeep.
OPEN DOOR and ENTER JEEP. EXAMINE RADIO and EXAMINE DIAL. That dial matches
the slider on your walkie-talkie pretty well so let's SET SLIDER TO X where X
is the number the radio dial is set to. (This number varies with each game
you play.) OUT. Don't worry about that wallet, you don't need it. RAISE 
ANTENNA and TURN ON WALKIE-TALKIE. There just may be some useful information
to overhear. Go southeast five times and then east once. Now go south and
then west.

There are two doors here. Let's OPEN RIGHT DOOR and go west. Yipes, this
looks like trouble. I would leave fast, so go north. Boxed yourself into a
closet, huh? Well, first CLOSE DOOR. Whew! Safe for now. But what can you do
now? Maybe if you distracted the snake with another prey, it would be
satisfied and leave you alone. OPEN CAGE and OPEN DOOR. Perfect! Just as
planned. Go OUT. MOVE PAPER, DROP CAGE, and TAKE SCREWDRIVER. Go south and
then west. TAKE KNIFE. You really don't have time to explore the rest of the
house but you now have all that there is for you here.

Go east, north, east, east again, and southeast. DROP ALL BUT BAG AND LAMP.
(Never, ever drop that bag unless you want to use it -- that roadrunner is
hungry!). Go up and DROP BAG (I guess it is safe here). Go IN and DOWN. TURN
ON LAMP. (I hope you saved as much of the power in this lamp as possible.)
DROP LAMP and go UP and OUT. Now go down, northeast, and up. TAKE BINOCULARS
and oops! Here we go again! But we've prepared in advance so just go DOWN and
TAKE BINOCULARS. Now go UP and OUT and TAKE BAG (wouldn't want those tasty
crumbs to get wet). Go down and TAKE WALKIE-TALKIE, SCREWDRIVER, AND KNIFE.
Go northwest, north, west, and then northwest twice.

Let's explore the south road next. (If you've been listening to your radio,
you know that time is getting short. Or you can check your wristwatch, it is
working again.) Go south four times until you are Behind the Shed. WAIT a bit
until your friend the roadrunner arrives then EXAMINE SHELTER WITH
BINOCULARS. That bird sure is nosy, isn't he. Put him to work by typing POINT
TO KEY. DROP BINOCULARS, TAKE KEY, and then go north four times. UNLOCK
PADLOCK WITH KEY, TAKE PADLOCK, DROP PADLOCK, OPEN BOX, and EXAMINE PANEL.
OPEN CIRCUIT BREAKER. Listen carefully to what you hear, especially the part
about the "kid" and the line he may have forgotten to connect.

Now in your next move CLOSE HANDLE or they will come to investigate. Again,
listen carefully to what they say because the timing of the final puzzle
depends on what you hear. OK, you now know what you need to do. If you can
somehow disconnect the line that the crew thinks is faulty, and you do it
AFTER the autosequencer starts, they will chalk it up to a "wet line" and let
it go. You know which line it is because the kid is worried about it. I can't
tell you which one it is because it changes from game to game.

It will be the positive, ground, informer, or detonator. These are
abbreviated as POS, GND, INF, and DET on the slip of cardboard you found in
the book. Remember that panel in the Shack? You now have the screwdriver you
need to open it and you have the knife to cut the proper wire (the slip of
cardboard will translate the name of the wire into the color of the wire you
need to cut). All you have to do now is go up into the Shack, open the panel,
wait for the autosequencer to start, and then cut the correct wire. Oops,
there is that searchlight, isn't there? Maybe we should take care of that
first.

Then it should be safe to climb back up into the Shack. Go southwest four
times and you will be Outside Blockhouse facing a big dog who is sleeping.
Perhaps you have looked on this dog as a problem but he is, in fact, the
solution to a problem. The searchlight is mounted on this blockhouse. Have
you ever disturbed the dog or allowed the roadrunner to disturb him? Notice
that when the crew comes out to investigate, they turn the searchlight from
the tower to the blockhouse area. This is what we need to use to our
advantage.

Also, have you studied the actions of the roadrunner here? He's been hungry
all during the game. The dog seems to provide a good dinner table but not for
long. If you could just find a way to have the roadrunner disturb the dog
when you were at the tower, you could climb the tower while the searchlight
was aimed at the blockhouse area. So, here is what you can do.

After arriving at Outside the Blockhouse, WAIT for the roadrunner. As soon as
he jumps onto the dog, DROP BAG. Whew, he is more interested in the crumbs;
but when he's done, he will probably go back onto the dog and alert the crew.
After dropping the bag, immediately go northeast four times. If you haven't
wasted any crumbs along the way, you should see the searchlight sweep away
from the tower just as you arrive (you are still listening to your radio, I
hope).

We're almost there now but no time to linger. Go up twice and then east.
UNSCREW SCREWS WITH SCREWDRIVER and LOOK IN PANEL. Too dark? Then just turn
on your lamp. Oh, that's in the reservoir? OK, just TURN ON THE BULB that is
conveniently in the Shack. That's better. Now LOOK IN PANEL. As you suspected
from the diagram, there are four wires which are red, blue, striped, and
white. Using the card and the information regarding the "wet line" you gained
after you opened the box, you now know which wire to cut with the knife. But
DON'T do it until AFTER the autosequencer starts at T-45. WAIT as long as
needed. CUT xxxx WIRE WITH KNIFE.

CONGRATULATIONS! Perhaps their next test will be a little less ambitious and
you will survive your London vacation after all. To get the final messages
from the game (now that you are back in Kensington Gardens at the Palace
Gate), go east, north, and north again. EXAMINE WOMAN and read your final
rank.
