Escape From Colditz


 PLAYING TIPS:

 Opening Doors
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 There are hundreds of doors throughout the castle and many will be
 locked. A collection of keys and lock-picks can be found and used to
 open these doors. There are three types of door, which are:

 Low Security Door........Use a lock-pick to open it.
 Grade 1 Security Door....Use a Grade 1 key to open it.
 Grade 2 Security Door....Use a Grade 2 key to open it.

 Each key/lock-pick can only be used once but any unlocked doors will
 remain so until the end of the game.  Beware of the Prisoner's Quarters
 because many of the doors here lead into small empty rooms - therefor
 precious keys may be unecessarily wasted. Explore all areas as soon as
 possible and remember which contain useful items so they can be collected
 early on in future games.

 Avoiding Germans
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The Castle is regularly patrolled by sentries, who walk around on
 selected routes looking to stop escape attempts.
 Some Germans (if they think a POW is getting away) may open fire.
 As these guards are skilled marksmen, they will need only one bullet to
 kill a potential escapee. To minimise the chance of a Guard shooting you
 in the back, place a solid object (such as a wall) between yourself and
 the Nazi. Even better is to walk through an unlocked door where you will
 be able to hide and should remain safe for a while.
 Wait in a room in 'Stooge' for a couple of minutes and the guard should
 go away, as they rarely enter certain rooms at all. However, leaving
 sanctuary too early may mean the guard is still snooping around and you
 are likely to get arrested.
 Beware when opening doors because sentries have a nasty habit of waiting
 on the other side. Arrest in this situation is almost unavoidable, as you
 will usually walk straight into the German!
 Remember there are always at least two sentries patrolling each courtyard
 at any time.

 Equipment
 ~~~~~~~~~
 Various tools and other important items can be collected to aid your
 escape. Most are hidden behind walls, tables, bunks, etc, so you should
 investigate every possible hiding place. Some of the most important
 equipment includes:

 Keys..................Use these to open specific doors.
 Lock-pick.............Use these to open low-security doors.
 Uniform...............Disguise yourself as a Nazi.
 Pass..................Use this with the uniform.  It will be discarded -
                       if stopped and interrogated by genuine guards.
 Papers................Needed at the main gateway in conjunction with -
                       the Pass and Uniform.
 Pick-axe, Saw, Spade..Use to re-open disused tunnels.
 Candle................Needed in tunnels to light your way.
 Stone.................Throw to distract the attention of suspicious -
                       guards.

 Never carry too much equipment at once because if you're caught every
 item will be confiscated and lost. Stash equipment in 'Safe' areas
 (such as the Chapel) as these places are never searched by the Germans.
 Although several trips may be required and this can be time consuming,
 you run no risk of having valuable equipment confiscated.

 General Hints
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Pressing the [F9] key will allow your POWs to go to sleep in a bunk at
 their start location. This is very useful at night because the Fatigue
 bar will diminish. If a tired POW is sent to Solitary, rest him for a
 few minutes when he is returned to his Quarters.
 Use the map supplied with the game as it gives an outline to each sector
 of the castle. Although not every room is included, at least it shows
 you roughly your current whereabouts.
 Nazi guards will not hesitate to open fire if it looks as if you're
 getting away. If a pursuing sentry stops running then it's a safe bet
 he's about to fire - and they never miss. A good tactic to avoid this
 is, if the German is not too close, to suddenly stop running.
 The sentry will run towards you to make an arrest at which point you
 should continue your escape and head for a door or obstacle to put
 between you. As it takes a second for a Nazi to raise and lower his
 rifle you will still be able to successfully avoid him - but only if
 your timing is right! Fatigue plays an important part in the game,
 especially after a POW has been doing a lot of running.
 If the Fatigue bar is filled, you will only be able to walk.
