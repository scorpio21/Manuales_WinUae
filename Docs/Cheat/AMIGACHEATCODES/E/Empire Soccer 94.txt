Empire Soccer 94

Select the ten minute game and hold down the fire button at all times
(even when your player gets the ball).  Stop running but keep the fire
button pressed.  The opposition will immediately slide tackle you.
This will almost always cause them to get fouled.  They will be given
a yellow card (and eventually a red one) and eventually be sent off
the field.  Continue this until there is only three players left on
the opposing team (the goalie and two field men).  You might be able
to get more players fouled out, but it may be hard.  You should now
have all you players and will be able to run circles around the
opposing team.
