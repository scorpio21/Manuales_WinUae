     To find secret levels at the start  of the game immediately go left to
     the desert,  then continue left  to the fire zone.  Head to  the upper
     most left corner of this area and  you should see lava with a patch on
     it that looks like a section of  the Firewall spell. As quickly as you
     can, walk on this patch and you will be whisked away to secret levels.
