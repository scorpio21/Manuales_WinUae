     Here's a little cheat I've discovered for Kingpin Bowling from
      Team 17. It requires a joystick or joypad with a really fast 
     autofire, but  you may be able to emulate it on a joystick/pad
           by pressing the fire button really quickly.

       During play, if you line up the man where you want, and then
      press down the autofire, it will generally throw the ball down
      the centre of the lane. The less force there is, the closer to
     the centre of the lane the ball will be bowled.  If you put your
     man to the far right, and put the speed up to almost full force,
        you can generally bowl a perfect strike. Its a very useful 
                               technique. 

      Also, if you have a single pin left, or a similar situation
     in your game, then this is an  excellent technique to line up
                               the ball.

     This cheat will not guarantee a strike, or spare, but at least
     it makes the game a hell of a lot easier. No more,  "I fucking
                       lined that up..." trauma.
