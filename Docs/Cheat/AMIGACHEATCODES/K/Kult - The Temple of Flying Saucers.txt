You don't have to complete all five Ordeals. Instead, go into the tunnels
(from The Noose) and wait an hour. Then leave the tunnels and go to The
Master's Eye. Wait around until The Master dies. Search his body for the
whistle. Use it and a panel will open up. Reach Inside and grab the egg.

                               KULT-THE STORY
                               --------------

The central theme of this is for you to find and rescue your girlfriend
Sci-fi who has dissappeared under mysterious circumstances. But for you to
rescue her you must enter the labyrinth beneath the city, which is easier
said than done as you can only enter them from a point that is controlled by
the Protozorp, which in turn can only be entered once you have achieved your
five skulls. The skulls are to be found in five seperate rooms and an object
is required to solve the five problems.
Once each room is solved the skull is taken to a Protozorp and the object
can be traded in for another object.

                              KULT-GAME STRUCTURE
                              -------------------

The game is controlled by using the mouse to highlight an object or
structure and pressing the mouse button, this will display a brain which
gives you the available commands that can be used on that object. Icons
along the right of the screen can also be accessed by the mouse, the most
important of these being the Psi Powers that are available to you.
In the solution that follows i will display the commands in BOLD TYPE and
the locations in the following manner "----------".

                              KULT-THE SOLUTION
                              -----------------

The rooms can be solved in any order as long as the room called "IN THE
SCORPIONS PRESSENCE" is the last to solved. The game starts in the "MASTER'S
ORBIT" where he will give you one of the objects.

THE TWINS:- object needed GOBLET. Once in "THE TWINS" go to "THE SOURCE" and
INSPECT the fountain this will reveal a switch in the eye, PRESS THE EYE,
this will fill the fountain. Highlight icon marked POSSESSIONS and click on
the goblet select FILL GOBLET and go back to "THE TWINS". OPEN both serpents
and select the goblet from the possessions, EMPTY the goblet in the left
serpent. A die now appears which can be obtained by highlighting the icon
marked OBJECTS IN THE ROOM, click on the die and TAKE, it now goes to
possessions. Select die and PUT IN the right serpent you can now go to "WHO
WILL BE SAVED". If there is a way of solving the riddle of the hands i am
not aware of it so a bit of trial and error is needed to complete the
ordeal. Highlight the Serpent's head and PRESS, now go to "THE SOURCE". You
will notice the slab in front of the fountain is now split up into six cubes
the skull you are seeking is under one of them (it changes fromm game to
game) LIFT cube# to obtain it. It would be adviseable to save the game
before lifting the slabs as a wrong choice means death.
After obtaining the skull exit via "THE RING" and follow the "PASSAGE"
untill you reach a side passage leading to "THE RETURN" and on to "THE
MASTER'S ORBIT". GIVE skull to Protozorp who is standing beneath the Trader.
You can now exchange the goblet for another object. This is done by
highlighting the trader and selecting TRADE ITEM, select both the object you
wish to trade and the item you wish to have. (BE WARNED the trader will use
the old shell game trick to hide the skull and a wrong choice will mean that
you lose, thus meaning your efforts have been in vain. So it would be
adviseable to once again save the game before trading.)

THE WALL:- object needed DAGGER. Click on zone 3 then zone 2 to close the
barrier then enter either of the doors. Inside you should CLIMB ON the step
and take the dagger from Possessions. Click on dagger and PUT IN slot. The
dagger will now be in objects in the room, click on dagger again and TAKE
it. Take the side "PASSAGE" to reach the "DEAD END", select the deep cavity
and STICK YOUR HAND IN, you now have a skull. Retrace your steps until you
can reach the "MASTER'S ORBIT". GIVE skull to the Protozorp, but do not
trade.

THE NOOSE:- object needed NONE (however the lantern can be used if desired).
Once you entered "THE NOOSE" use Solar Eyes from Psi Powers to obtain light.

obtain another skull. TAKE the lower left rope. Return to the "MASTER'S
ORBIT" and GIVE skull, do not trade.

icon untill a vertical column appears. Select rope from possesions and LASSO

to the other side, where you will obtain another skull. Go to the "MASTER'S
ORBIT" GIVE skull and trade for the stone spider.

IN THE SCORPIONS PRESSENCE:- object needed STONE SPIDER. PRAY at the statue
and enter the "THE WEB". Click on the web and CRAWL. GIVE the stone fly to
the Mistress, but REFUSE to kiss her. GIVE FLY TO BLUE SPIDER and you will
be given possession of the red spider, return to the "IN THE SCORPIONS
PRESSENCE". Select the red spider and PUT IN opened mouth, a trapdoor will
now open. PASS through the trapdoor to receive another skull. Return to the
"MASTER'S ORBIT" and GIVE skull. After a speech by the Master of Ordeals you
will be given an egg.

Follow "THE RING" untill you come across a passage guarded by a Protozorp,
SHOW egg to gain access and go to "THE CONCOURSE". Use Brainwarp on
Protozorp and take the "PASSAGE" he is guarding. Follow passage untill you
reach the Toad's Head and INSPECT it to reveal an eye, PRESS eye to go to "A
HIDDEN PLACE" and use solar eyes. Take the rope and LASSO the lever and
PASS-THROUGH the trap door. Follow the "GALLERY'S" untill you encounter Ash
and Normajeen in the "CAVERN". TALK to them and TELL TRUTH, after they have
finished speaking use zone scan to reveal a slab. LIFT slab and TAKE both
the flask and the bean. Follow the left passage and go through the trap-door
to enter the "RECTORY". Go to the "THRESHOLD OF TRUTH" where a priestess
will present, you will have no option but to ATTACK her. Select the egg and
PUT IN opened mouth to gain access to "THE SCRIPTURES". INSPECT the lectern
and use psi shift to obtain the statuette in the upper left corner. Go
through the door to re-enter "THE THRESHOLD OF TRUTH" and go to "IN THE
PRESSECE OF GOD" and then to the "PLACATING THE POWERS" where Saura and a
priestess are sacrificing a Deivo. ATTACK the priestess and brainwarp Saura
whom you should then GIVE FLASK TO DRINK. She will now reveal that she is
actually Sci-fi and will explain what happened to herself. (If things go
wrong at this stage kill Saura and GIVE BEAN EAT, she will now relive and
you can have another attempt to GIVE FLASK TO DRINK). TAKE sacrificial
dagger and go to "IN THE PRESSENCE OF GOD" Sci-fi and the monkey will follow
you. Go to "SAURA'S RESPOSE" and select statuette and PUT IN niche, a tunnel
is now revealed, click on monkey and PUT IN TUNNEL, return to "IN THE
PRESSECE OF GOD" where the starry wall should lift. Enter the "BIRTH OF A
DIVINE RACE" and wait, two aliens will enter from a concealed trapdoor who
are intent upon your death. Select psi powers and use extreme violence to
kill the first alien, Qriich the parasite will be incapacitated momentarily
and the second alien will capture Sci-fi. Brainwarp Harssk where upon Qriich
will possess his mind, quickly psi shift the trapdoor to close it. Quiich's
attention will be diverted and you can THROW the sacrificial dagger at
Harssk to kill him.
And that unfortunately ends the game, the story concludes by telling you
what the final outcome is. Oh well you live happily ever after and you do
have a nice new flying saucer to play with. Trouble is that Spawn-o matic
looked like it might have been fun to mess around with....
