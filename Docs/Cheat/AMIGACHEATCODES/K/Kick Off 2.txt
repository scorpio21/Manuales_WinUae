Kick Off 2
----------

-> cheat #1 <-
 Switch on autofire, or repeatedly press the fire button and the result will
 be that your keeper will save the ball every time.
-> cheat #2 <-
 In mid-match press all the function keys from left to right (<F1> to <F10>).
 "S12" or "S14" should appear in the top right hand corner. You will now be
 able to substitute the computer's keeper and the new guy will be completely
 useless.
-> cheat #3 <-
 During penalties, pushing 'R' will show where the computer is going to kick
 the ball to.
-> cheat #4 <-
 Substitute the opposing goalkeeper twice and he will not save your shots.
