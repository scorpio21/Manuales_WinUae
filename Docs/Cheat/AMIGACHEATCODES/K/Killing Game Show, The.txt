Killing Game Show, The


 TIPS:

 Dont press the fire button while you're on the good luck screen,
 instead press the [Help] key and a map of the forthcoming level
 will appear. Once again, when the "press fire to start" 
 message pops up, press HELP and all your lives will
 be restored. If you still get killed, hit the HELP key once more during
 the replay. You will start again, from the point at which you died, 
 with five lives

 When I was browsing through the game (AR), I came across this in
 the high score table code:

 ''I 'aint gonna type no name in no hiscore table''

 I wasn't good enough to get my name on the high score table to
 try it out so I thought I'd tell you so you can have ago.
 Enter exactly what you see above. If it is a cheat mode could
 some one let me know what it does?
