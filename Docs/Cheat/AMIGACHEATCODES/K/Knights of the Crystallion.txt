                        KNIGHTS OF THE CRYSTALLION HINTS

     By BILL Williams (The Programmer). Typed in by PARASITE.


     When the Crystallion appears, he's telling you that you should
     probably donate some more to the Tsimit. The Crystallions accuracy,
     however, improves with the strength of your telepathic connection. If
     you have a low-to-moderate amount of telepathy, he will probably tell
     you to donate more than you have to.
     This is where the flashing rate comes in. If he only flashes rarely,
     you're probabelly pretty close to satisfying the keepers demands. When
     feeling cheap, you can try leaving the number there, without bumping
     it up to where be disappears completely.
     if hes flashing vigorously however, hes probably telling you the
     truth, even at low levels of telepathy.

     CLUES
     The backwards speech on the games soundtrack are actually hints, sh
     here they are the right way round.
     1) "To win at the highest level of Bosu, you must use misdirection.
     Let your opponent count on a crucial ray until your very last stone,
     and then take it away from him."
     2) "75% medium quality, 25% high quality is a good balance"
     3) "If you develop the ability to teleport, you may enter the Tsimit
     without paying the keepers."
     4) "Watch out for twins... watch out... watch..."

     START-UP TIPS
     1) Go to the Haresh and stableise your economy. make sure you've got a
     couple hundred Joriba.
     2) Go to Deketa. Play enough games to get teleportation ability.
     3) Go to the tsimit. Collect some crystals for testing the Proda, and
     get down to at least the second level, then teleport out ( Put the
     mouse in the upper right-hand corner of the screen and press both
     mouse buttons to cheat).
     4) Next time you select the Tsimit, the warrior-woman should appear.
     Take her offer.
     5) Try the Proda with the Crystals you collected. If you can't figure
     out what's going on, start a new game and enter the proda with no
     crystals - that invokes a special training mode.
