F-29 RETALIATOR


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the enlisting screen, enter your name as 'THE DIDY MEN' but don't
 press the [Return] key. Instead, click on the Colonel icon, press
 [Return] and select a battle area. Choose and accept a mission and
 start playing the game as you normally would. Now you can activate
 an automatic landing sequence by pressing the [Enter] on the numeric
 keypad.

 Also, on enrollment enter your name in as 'CIARAN' then load up the
 pilots log. The name should now read Ocean OK. Now you can play any
 mission with the huge benefit of infinite missiles and cannons.
