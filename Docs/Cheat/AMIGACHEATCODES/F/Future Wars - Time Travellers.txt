                             (Palace/Delphine)


1.  Examine  every  named  object  on  the  screen  WHILST STANDING CLOSE -
otherwise some things can easily be missed!

2. There are many objects 'hidden' in just ONE PIXEL - examine objects with
microscopic precision!

3. Pick up EVERYTHING - you won't end up with a cluttered inventory.

4.  SAVE  the  game regularly - you can't go back at all so the saved games
help even more than usual.


THE PRESENT

Your  quest starts on a window cleaner's cradle outside an office block. At
this point you don't have an inkling as to what's going on. After getting a
blasting  from  your  boss,  you  wring  out your chamois leather and start
exploring.  EXAMINE  the scaffolding to reveal the lift control and OPERATE
the  UP button to bring the cradle up to the correct level. TAKE the bucket
and OPEN the window that your boss appeared from and enter the building.

Inside the building, your boss prevents you from exiting via the right-hand
door.  USE  your  empty  bucket with the sink to fill it, and then OPEN the
toilet door. TAKE the little FLAG and OPEN the cupboard to your right. TAKE
the  INSECTICIDE  and  then TAKE the empty PLASTIC BAG from the waste paper
basket. Walk over to the exit door and TAKE the KEY (under the carpet!) you
find  there. USE the BUCKET with the door your boss appears from to balance
it  on  top of the doorway. When your boss appears, the bucket falls on top
of him, leaving you free to exit.

In  the  Map Room, USE the KEY you just found with the cupboard to reveal a
typewriter.  EXAMINE  the  TYPEWRITER  and write down the number you find -
40315  in  this  particular  case.  Then, OPEN the desk drawer and TAKE the
SHEAF  of blank paper. Walk over to the map and USE the red FLAG with it to
open a secret passage. SAVE the game at this point and then enter.

You have to work FAST to shut down the mechanical ceiling before it crushes
you!  OPERATE  the numbered keypad and punch in the number you found on the
typewriter. You can only put in one number at a time, so being quick on the
draw  with  the  mouse  is  the  key.  When the fifth digit is entered, the
ceiling raises and a hidden door appears. You don't have to be told what to
do next.

You realise something is amiss when you enter this next room - this room is
hardly  a  normal  office  environment! All that seems to be normal is that
photocopier  in  the centre. USE your SHEAF of blank paper with the opening
on  the  machine  and  OPERATE the GREEN button followed by the RED button.
When  the documents appear, TAKE them and an alarm will sound. QUICKLY leap
onto  the teleport pad to the right before the Crughon guard appears. After
a  blinding  flash  of light, you find yourself in the middle of a swamp in
the year 1304!


1304



Before  you  can  do  anything  else,  you have to get yourself out of this
treacherous  mud  hole.  Make  your  way across to the left, walking on the
GREEN  AREAS ONLY - any other part of the screen is lethal! Get as close as
possible  to  the  swarm  of mosquitoes and USE the INSECTICIDE to see them
off. Walk further across to the left and EXAMINE the GLINT OF LIGHT to find
a PENDANT. TAKE it and exit to the left.

Walk  to  the tree near the lake. EXAMINE the foot of the tree. USE ROPE ON
TREE BRANCH. TAKE SLACKS - TAKE TUNIC. Walk to the left.

Walk towards the hens and turn LEFT between the tree and the moat. Continue
on out of sight behind the castle wall.

In the Clearing, walk to the tree. OPERATE TREE - EXAMINE GROUND. Return to
the Village.

Walk to the Inn and OPERATE DOOR and go inside.

USE  COIN  ON  INNKEEPER  -  (you  will  have the coin from the tree in the
Clearing) - using the coins gets you seated by the Innkeeper, which in turn
enables  you  to overhear the conversation of the villagers. You have to do
this before the Guard will let you into the Castle. Go outside now.

Outside, walk to the Guard. USE PENDANT ON GUARD. There is now an automatic
sequence  where  you are taken into the Castle and converse with Torin, The
Master,  then  being  put back outside in the village again. The Guard will
now be asleep, so....TAKE LANCE, then walk to the Clearing again.

At  the  Clearing, walk up to that tree with something hanging from it - it
is a Monk's habit which is currently out of your reach. USE LANCE ON MONK'S
HABIT. Return to the village.

Walk  down  towards  the  bottom  of  the  screen to a forest path near the
gateway to a Monastry.

EXAMINE  WOLF  - (don't get too close!!) - EXAMINE GLINT at the back of the
Wolf.  Yes,  it's  an  electrical  wolf!! Return to the lake screen via the
village.

[SAVE YOUR GAME FOR SURE HERE!!]

USE  PLASTIC  BAG ON LAKE - you now have a rapidly leaking plastic bag full
of  water  and your first really nasty timing problem! You have to get from
the lake, through the village, along the path and onto the bridge as far as
the  exact  spot  which  causes the Wolf's head to lower in readiness. From
this  position only can you effectively USE THE FULL BAG ON THE WOLF. There
is  only  EXACTLY  enough time allowed to get this right before the plastic
bag  is  empty again. It may seem impossible at first but it's the only way
to  kill  the  wolf and means finding out about the most economical ways to
move  your  character.  There  are  several places where things depend upon
EXACT positioning and timing!

Once you have disposed of the wolf, walk across the bridge to the Monastery
door and OPERATE DOOR to enter.

(If you follow ALL the foregoing steps you will be wearing the monk's habit
by  now and may enter the Monastery safely. If you kill the wolf and try to
enter wearing other clothes then the monks will kill you - you MUST get and
wear the monk's habit!).

Once inside the Monastery, there is a strict rule to abide by! You may only
walk in a CLOCKWISE direction around the outer path (as the other monks are
doing) and NEVER try to get to the white circle in the centre of the room -
you  don't need to! Stick to this rule and you can go in and out of all the
necessary doors quite safely.

Walk around the path to the RIGHT-HAND door and OPERATE DOOR to enter.

The  Father  Superior  will  ask  for  a  drink.  Leave  the room then walk
CLOCKWISE around the path to the LEFT-HAND door and OPERATE DOOR to enter.

Walk  across this room and take the cup then leave the room and walk around
the  path  CLOCKWISE  to the door OPPOSITE where you entered the Monastery.
OPERATE DOOR to enter.

You  will  now  be in the Wine Cellar. Walk up to the ladder by the barrels
and  stand on it. USE CUP ON BARREL (the one on the TOP SHELF - FARTHEST TO
THE RIGHT). Return to Father Superior around the clockwise path again.

Father  Superior  will  take  the  cup  of wine from you and become drunk -
serves  the  miserable  begger right!! EXAMINE FATHER SUPERIOR and you will
get a Control Device. USE CONTROL DEVICE ON PIECE OF FURNITURE and you will
get  a  Magnetic  Card.  Return  to the Wine Cellar, again by the clockwise
route.

Stand  on  the  ladder again and USE CONTROL DEVICE ON BARREL - (TOP SHELF,
DIRECTLY  ABOVE  THE  LADDER).  A  passage  will now open and you enter the
Hi-Tech Room.

In  the  Hi-Tech Room walk close to the glass case. EXAMINE GLASS CASE. You
will  get  a Gas Canister if you are standing close enough.....if not close
enough  then you get only a description but NOT the canister, and you can't
get past a certain point without it! USE MAGNETIC CARD ON CONSOLE.

The   program   now   automatically   takes  over  so  just  sit  back  and
watch.....Lana  is  freed and takes over, points the pendant at you and you
re-materialize  in the Castle to rejoin her father.....revelations are made
to  you  which  culminate in the discovery that these two are from the year
4315 and that's where you are now off too!


4315

In the ruins walk to the BOTTOM RIGHT of the screen and EXAMINE RUBBLE. You
will get a Blowtorch. Walk up the screen a little to the right and onto the
next screen.

Walk  to the WHITE DOT (named as rubble) and EXAMINE RUBBLE (The white dot,
that  is)  whilst  standing  very  close. You will get a Box of Fuses. Move
slightly  to  the  RIGHT and down to an orange-coloured, discus shape (also
named  as  just  rubble).  OPERATE  RUBBLE  and you will uncover a manhole.
OPERATE MANHOLE COVER.

You will now enter a Sewer. Walk to the RIGHT. As you go into the 2nd sewer
screen,  your  character  begins to walk automatically, and where you click
with  the  LEFT mouse button is where he stops. Up to this particular point
in the game your character is usually still and where you click is where he
walks  to.  Here  it  is  reversed  so  that in a few more screens you walk
straight into a creature which kills you! After one or two screens you walk
past some pipework that has a tap on it - graphically it is not obvious! It
is  merely  an  extra  LIGHT  BLUE DOT OR TWO STICKING OUT OF THE PIPEWORK.
Click near the tap to stop your character at this point.

USE BLOWTORCH ON TAP. Guide your character around the sewer to walk out the
BOTTOM  LEFT  of  the  screen.  He begins to walk automatically again - let
him.

Just  before leaving a certain screen you will get a windowed message about
hearing  a  woman  crying  for help. When you click to clear the window, he
will  go  into  the next screen. You will get TWO MORE windowed messages as
you  begin  to walk towards the Creature. Once the windows have cleared the
character will carry on automatically towards the Creature. NOW is when you
must  use  a click to stop him at a spot BEFORE THE POINT WHERE THE BACK OF
THE CREATURE'S BODY STARTS. Although it looks as though you can walk around
behind him to get to the woman and child, in fact you can't!

USE  BLOWTORCH  ON  CREATURE.  There is now an automatic sequence where the
woman  helps  you  out of the sewer and gives you directions to the Supreme
Council. You will shortly be outside the Metro.

Walk  directly  in  front  of the doors under the Videocamera. USE LANCE ON
VIDEOCAMERA. Now walk through the door.

Do not attempt to leave the Station via the door you came in. Walk close to
the Newspaper Machine. EXAMINE NEWSPAPER MACHINE very carefully. There is a
Coin Collector and a Money Slot on it. EXAMINE COIN COLLECTOR - USE COIN IN
MONEY  SLOT  -  EXAMINE  COIN  COLLECTOR  (Again)  - USE COIN IN MONEY SLOT
(Again). You will now get a newspaper. Walk to the train doors and go in.

At  the  Shuttle Port walk down the stairs at the bottom of the screen. USE
FUSES  ON  FUSES  - they are on a fusebox on the wall. Now go upstairs. The
Inspector  is  now  watching  T.V. and there is just enough room for you to
guide  your  character  BEHIND  him  and  into the arrowed channel onto the
escalator. It's a kind of 'Don't let your pixels bump into his pixels while
you're  trying  to  sneak  on  board  the Shuttle without a ticket' type of
problem!

There  is  a  long  automatic  sequence  now  involving the capture of your
Shuttle in mid-flight and you end up in a Crughon Prison Cell.

Even  KNOWING  what to do next doesn't make it any easier, I'm afraid!! You
have  to enter THREE commands, but after the 2nd one you must enter the 3rd
one  SO  INSTANTLY  that  you  have  to  make sure that your mouse arrow is
physically  very  close  to  the  air-duct named on screen. This is because
after  building  the  commands  from  the menus you still have to move your
pointer  to  the place on the screen to operate them on........You MUST use
this fraction of saved time by opening the menus near the air-duct and thus
lessening  the  distance that the pointer has to travel to it to be able to
implement the 3rd command - in short: YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY, VERY QUICK!!.

The  three commands are: USE KEY ON AIR-DUCT - USE GAS CANISTER ON AIR-DUCT
- USE NEWSPAPER ON AIR-DUCT........if you haven't been gassed to death then
the door will open. Walk out.

There  is  now another automatic sequence here involving the capture of the
Crughon  ship you are in by an Earthship and you being hauled up before the
Supreme  Council  as  a  Crughon  spy! (Death sentence??!! Firing Squad??!!
Saved  by  Lo'Ann!!  Back to the Council for further explanations!! Go with
Lo'Ann to another Hi-Tech Room).

She and you now time travel to the Prehistoric era!!!!

65 MILLION B.C.

In the caves, walk to Lo'Ann then walk to the left.

There is now a mini shoot-em-up game.

You have to shoot all the Crughons by clicking on them with your mouse. The
ones  that  get near the centre of the screen will exhibit a red danger box
around them - these Crughons are dangerous to you because they can actually
shoot  and  kill  you.  All  the other scan be shot but deal instantly with
those  that show a red danger box as they are your only real threat at this
point.

At  a  certain  point in this sequence, the Crughon Leader will emerge on a
hover platform from the right of the screen - shoot him.

Now  clear  the  arena  of  all  remaining Crughons, still paying attention
immediately  to  any  that  exhibit  a danger box. Once you have killed the
Leader  there  won't  be  any  fresh  Crughons  feeding into the screen any
longer, so you can now clear the arena completely.

Lo'Ann  now gets shot by a sniper. EXAMINE LO'ANN three times (you will get
an invisibility pill and the pendant). USE PENDANT ON LO'ANN. Walk down the
screen and to the RIGHT.

In  the Crughon spaceship, walk close to the dead Crughon. EXAMINE CRUGHON.
You get a Magnetic Card. Walk up the ramp.

You  are  now  in the ship's Control Room. USE MAGNETIC CARD ON CARD READER
(on  the  wall,  right  of the door). Walk to the case. OPERATE CASE - TAKE
GARMENT.  Walk  to the videocamera. USE GARMENT ON VIDEOCAMERA. Walk to the
case. Click on the case to get in. OPERATE CASE.

There  is  now  another  automatic  sequence  for  5 screens through Space,
docking you at the Crughon Space Fortress.

CRUGHON SPACE FORTRESS

Walk  to  the  left until you are just past the doorway, so you are already
out  of  the  way of the Guards who are about to walk in. USE PILL ON HERO.
After the SECOND Guard has passed you, go straight out of the door (You are
invisible from when you take the pill until ONE MINUTE LATER.

You  are  sent  automatically  down  a  ramp  to  the  Floor  Level  (Still
invisible),  where  you must guide your character between the boxes and the
Guard  to the bottom of the screen - NOT the apparent doorway at the top of
the screen!

Now go to the left to hide behind the boxes by the time the pill wears off.
As  with  the  Inspector at the Shuttle Port, you musn't 'bump' your pixels
into  the  Guard or else he 'feels' rather than sees you, and of course, if
you  are  not  quick  enough  your  pill  wears  off and the Guards see you
anyway!!

It  is extremely difficult and you are well advised to SAVE THE GAME at the
point   where   you   are  about  to  initiate  the  space  flight  to  the
Fortress....you  only  have just enough time when you arrive to move to the
left,  take  the  pill,  go  down  the ramp and walk around in front of the
boxes,  where  you can see the character but the Guards cannot, so there is
no time to mess around with saving and loading games!

Walk left to the box. OPERATE BOX.

In the Box Room, listen to Albert and walk to the door.


THE LADDERS & LEVELS MAZE

Here  is  just  a  matter of a few practice games to learn the one and only
route down to the lowest level of the Fortress.

It is really quite simple as you experiment and recognize routes.

A  timer that counts down from 6 minutes in single seconds is displayed and
you  have  this  time  to  access  the  Master  Computer Room on the lowest
level.....through   an  arched  doorway  surrounded  by  a  hoop  of  white
lights....and escape again.

Once you are in the Master Computer Room, walk close to the console and USE
MAGNETIC CARD ON CONSOLE, then exit to the maze again.

Return  the  way  you  came, but now you must turn off the route to another
door  - higher up the levels than the Computer room but not as high as your
start level - and kind-of-left-ish!

This  door  has  4 large arrows around it and won't allow you through until
you've  completed the reprogramming of the Master Computer. All you have to
do  is  run through this door...........so, from leaving the Box Room, down
to  the  re-programming of the Master Computer and up through the door with
the arrows.

The  foregoing must be completed before the counter reaches 00:00...You win
if you get through this door before the timer runs out!!

The program now controls the automatic end sequence.


                   YOU HAVE NOW COMPLETED FUTURE WARS!!!
