FALCON
------

 CHEAT MODE:

 During play press [Ctrl], left [Shift] and [X] simultaneously for
 increased afterburners, eight sidewinder missiles and a full magazine.

 For a perfect landing, hold the [Help] key down about 10 to 20 feet
 above the runway.

 If you get badly hit, don't bail out, instead swing round and head for home.
 Press HELP and the '+' on the keypad and keep them depressed. The F16 will
 stay level and drop down.
 Switch to tracking mode and rotate to side view.
 Just before touch down, pitch up the nose and the plane will touch down
 successfully every time.
 Select "end mission" and you will be rescued even if you are in enemy
 territory.
