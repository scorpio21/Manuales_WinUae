F-16 Combat Pilot
-----------------

If you`re fed up with landing try the following: Jetison all fuel and
weapons and climb to 65000 feet. Stay there until the last of the fuel runs
out. Dive towards the ground and at 10 or 11 thousand feet pull up hard.
You will then be able to rise about 4000 feet and then start falling towards
the ground. Just as you hit the ground the mission will end safely.
