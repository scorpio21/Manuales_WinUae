Fantastic Voyage


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the title screen, press fire to start the game. Now when you are asked
 to insert disk two, enter the 2nd disk. After you insert the 2nd disk the
 drive light should go on for a second and then off. It is at this point
 when you should quickly press and hold the Left and Right mouse buttons,
 the Fire button and the [Spacebar]. Hold them until the drive light goes
 out again. You should now be at the control room  screen. Press fire to
 start and you will now start with 99 lives.
