 CHEAT MODE:

 Enter your name into the high score table as 'SWAMP THING' to enable
 these in-game keys:

 [B] - Activates large bullets.
 [S] - Provides shields.
 [T] - Cycles through the extra weapons.
 [E] - Activates the cheat where levels can be selected at will by -
       pressing the [+] and [-] keys on the numeric keypad.


 EDITOR:

 To call up the editor push the joystick diagonaly up/left,
 press fire, and then press the [E] key.


 ANOTHER CHEAT:

 Start the game as normal, collect the ship and fly to the extreme top 
 left of the playing area. Disembark from the ship and drive the buggy
 into the corner. Type in 'STONKER' and re-enter the ship. Now pressing 'D'
 cycles through the available  weapons (including shield plus weapons), and
 pressing 'C' cycles through the levels.  NOTE: when entering a level, it's
 always best to station the ship at the top left of the screen again, to
 avoid  appearing at an illegal position, or even off-screen. On the
 second level repeat the above process, getting the buggy back in the top
 left hand corner, and retype 'STONKER' again. It now enables the ship to fly
 through walls, and pressing 'F' while hovering over switches allows them to
 be collected while in the air.
