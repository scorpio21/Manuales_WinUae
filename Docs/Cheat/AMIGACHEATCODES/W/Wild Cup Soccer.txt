Wild Cup Soccer

On the main menu with the options Wild Cup, League and Unfriendly,
plug a joystick into the mouse port and hold down the joystick button
while pushing forward at the same time.  Now hold the main joystick
forward and keep doing this for about 10 seconds.  The words "CHEAT
MODE" will appear at the top of the screen, and you still start with
$20,000,000 in the bank.

After the first cheat is active, you can activate a second cheat by
holding the joystick in the mouse port left while holding the main
joystick right for about 10 seconds.  The word "SPECIAL" will appear
at the top of the screen underneath the words "CHEAT MODE".  All
players will now start with the status Brutal as well as the normal
cheat mode of $20,000,000 in the bank.
