Wizkid


 CHEAT MODE:

 Tips For Finding The Secret Rooms:

 On round 1, collect 150 wizdollars and buy a token from the wizshop.
 Exit the shop with wizkid in body mode, raise the bucket in the well
 by leaping up and down on the handle, then go down the well and enter
 the gent's toilets. Use the token on the condom machine, then wizkid
 will be transported to the entrance of the secret cave.
 Enter the caves by going through the door on the left and leave by
 going through the hidden door on the right, now go back through the
 door on the left again and the current room number will be displayed
 at the top of the screen.

 Progress Through The Caves As Follows:

 Going through the door on the left will take wizkid to the cave number
 which equals the current cave number multiplied by two, and then added
 to one. For example, going through the left door in room 6 would take
 wizkid to room 13. Going through the door on the right will take
 wizkid to the cave number which equals the current cave number
 multiplied by two, for example, going through the right door in room 5
 will take wizkid to room 10. Going through the hidden door on the
 right will take wizkid back to the cave entrance so you can either go
 back in or return to the start by going through the door marked exit.
 Using these methods you can enter a number of rooms with loads of
 features.
