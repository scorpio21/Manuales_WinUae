Wings


 CHEAT MODE:

 There are a few cheats for this game and they are as follows:

 Click on the bullseye on the airplane at the top right of the flight
 school menu to get an awesome pilot. You will then be returned to the
 Main Menu. Now when you return to the flight school and add a new
 pilot enter the name 'Orca The Killer Tomato' (using the upper and
 lower case). Orca is all ready and doesn't need flight school.

 Also each letter of the word WINGS on the Main Menu has an effect.
 To access them, hold down [Ctrl], left [Shift] and the left [Amiga]
 keys while holding down the right mouse button. Now click on one of
 the letters in WINGS with the left mouse button while pressing the
 above combination, and each letter will do the following:

 [W] - Toggles the music on/off.
 [I] - Turns the [Caps Lock] key into an autofire button.
 [N] - No flight school missions required for new pilots.
 [G] - Guess.
 [S] - Saves game without having to exit.

 Start a new game and add a new pilot, name him '  Who is The Riddler'.
 Note, two spaces before the name and use the upper and lower case.
 Now don't press [Return] as normal to enter in his name, hit the [Esc]
 key instead. Now follow the various on screen cheat prompts.
