HINT & TIPS


   For those of you who are not accustomed to playing strategy trading
adventures games here are a few hints and tips to help you get started.

Problem: No money to trade.

Your crew is poor (e.g PARADOX) , very poor. To get your first credits
fly down to the city of Penthe on Planet Castra and walk to position 1.
Talk to Greg Morgan and ask him what he is doing here.

You cannot help him now, but just walk around and try to pass position 2.
Two rowdies are beating an old man, called George Mc Mil. Beat them up
and help George. Then talk to him. He offers you 1500 credits and his
telephone number (write it down!).

Now you can start to make money travelling with the Whale, but it's easier
to continue in Penthe.

Walk to position 3, take the little girl Whinnie with you and see Walter
Wim, her father, in his shop at position 4. 

After you return Whinnie to him he offers you some weapons for your trouble.

Take the guns and load them.

When you leave the shop, a thief tries to get your reward. Fight and kill 
him and the police will give you 3000 credits. Go to Max Flesh at position
5 and ask him for a job (be careful!).

Accept the mission by taking the heart he puts on the counter.

Beam up to the escape from the killer who also want the heart.

Call George Mcmil. He helps you shrink Greg Morgan.

Beam down again and go to Greg at Position 1, shrink him and dont forget
to take the CD.

Now fly to Lapis and search for Jack Nock. He will give you 100 000 creds
for bringing the heart. Now it should be easy to start trading!

When you have got enough money and extras for the whale go to Jack Nock
and try to solve the other 97% of the game.
