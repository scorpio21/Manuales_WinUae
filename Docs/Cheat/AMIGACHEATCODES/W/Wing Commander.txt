Wing Commander


 CHEAT MODE:

 Here is a handy cheat for jumping through the missions.
 When you take off from the Claw speed up until you reach around 400kps
 and then wait a few seconds. Now turn around and head straight for the
 Claw with your after- burners on. Eject just before your ship
 disintegrates and voila! - you'll be ready to start your next mission.
