CHASE H.Q.
----------

 CHEAT MODE:

 Start the game and hold the left mouse button, fire button, and then
 type 'GROWLER'. You can now press [T] for more time or [N] to skip to
 the next level.

 Also, after Nancy has given you the info about the car you're after,
 press the [Spacebar] repeatedly until the game begins. Your car should
 now be doing over 100Kph.
