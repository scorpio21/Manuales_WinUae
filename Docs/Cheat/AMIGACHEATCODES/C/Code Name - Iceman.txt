2.  Replace first group of three letters from the code with the corresponding
    number from the decoding book.  Those three numbers represent page number,

    that is your primary word.

1.  Your message will consist of two groups of 3 letters, write them down.
    Read the decoding book in your possession.
2.  Replace the first group of 3 letters from the code with the corresponding
    numbers in the decoding book.  Add the CIA offset to the number you get
    from the decoding book (be sure to select the N for Navy offset).  
    Anytime you get a number greater than 10, subtract 10 and 
    the remaining number is your true number.  
    Those three numbers represent page number, line, and word.
3.  Look at the file PAGE.DOC for the page indicated.

After you did get all the stuff...
Go upstairs and to helm.

HELM & DESTROYER
****************


OKEY HERE WE GO AGAIN!
I USED THE MOUSE TO CONTROLL THE SUB.
BUT SEE YOURSELFES.
SOME OTHER ADVICE IS.......................
GET A FOOL( LIKE I DID) TO PLAY THIS 'COZ IT TAKE HOURS
TO GET THE DESTROYER SANK.!!!(THANKS TO MIKE!!)


Do the below so that you only use one decoy.
Bring down weapon control panel.  
Turn off active sonar, F3.  
Turn on silent running, F4.  
Dive to below 600 feet.  
Slow down to 5 knots.
Don't attack too soon and give your position away.  
Shoot decoy, Shift + F6 to lock.
Then Shift + F8 to fire to get rid of torpedo.  
Try to use only one!.
When a white line appears and gets to the middle of the Close Circuit
Monitor, shoot your Harpoons ONLY.  
You have to hit him at least three times before he sinks.

Get up (Get code and decode it.)
Go back to helm.

HELM & ICEBERGS
***************

Navigate it so that you are always going north, 350-15.  
Try not to hit anything.
Contact ice station.
Once you're through and your sonarman tells you that it's...Ice Station.
Get up.
Get code and decode.
Go to helm.


HELM & ALPHA SUB
****************


You're now fighting the Alpha sub.  
Dive to 1200 feet.  
Stay there, turn off your Active sonar.
Turn on your silent running.  
Do not shoot your decoys for the first group of about 6 torpedos.  
After the first 6 past, dive quickly and turn on your Active sonar.  
Use your decoys to get rid of the torpedos.
Also, decrease to 0 knots.
Shoot your decoys immediately after the torpedos appear on the screen.
Once you see the bottom on your active sonar screen..
get it so that you're as close to it without breaching your sub.  
Then turn off your active sonar, turn on your silent running and wait.  
Watch the sub on your Close Circuit Monitor.
Wait until the white line goes all the way across the screen and then almost
all the way back to his screen, about 2 or 3 centimeters from leaving the
screen.  
Then shoot two or three Stingers.  
Then increase your speed, and turn.  
Try not to get hit by the torpedos that the sub will launch.
Wait till your sonarman says that he hears irregular pings.  
Then turn on your active sonar and turn it off quickly.
You then follow the Coontz, which will be the cross on your screen.  
Imagine your screen as a compass with 0 degrees being North, 
90 degrees being East,
180 being South, and 270 being West.  
As the Coontz moves, follow them right into Tunisia.  
One note, you can turn faster if you are moving faster.
