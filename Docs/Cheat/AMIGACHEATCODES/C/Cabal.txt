CABAL

Type SCHLIKA during play.  The border will flash and now F2 finishes the
level.

If you pause the game you will discover that you can still aim the cross-
hair. Now you can position the crosshair over the motionless bodies, then
unpause the game and let `em have it.

* Shoot as many of the buildings as you can, as they block your shots at
  attacking / hiding enemies.
* Shoot the enemies at the bottom of the screen as the bullets they fire
  needless time to get to you and can often trap you in a corner.
* Don't forget that you can shoot the enemies' bullets!
* Try to pick up the bonuses straight away.  The 100, 200 and 300 point bonuses
  are very useful if you want extra lives.
* Collect special weapons straight away as their rapid fire removes buildings
  faster, giving more breathing space.
* The grey uniformed soldiers (the ones that take a few shots to kill) can give
  a grenade or a special weapon. When he does, two men carrying a stretcher
  will appear.  Shoot these and they will give you two grenades, collect them
  and then shoot them again before they go, to receive two more grenades.
* Never stay in corners for too long, the enemy has a habit of zeroing in on
  you.
* Don't waste grenades on buildings unless you really need to.  If you opt to
  shoot in small bursts at every building rather than concentrating on one
  building at a time then a grenade may finish the job a lot quicker.
* Try not to get killed when the end-level guardians appear otherwise your FOE
  meter will drop to zero and you'll have to start again.
