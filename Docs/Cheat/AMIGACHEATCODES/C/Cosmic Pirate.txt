Cosmic Pirate


 CHEAT MODE:

 Whilst playing, press the [Spacebar] to pause the game. Now press the
 [.] key and a requester will appear. Type in 'GZAIMASEN' and you will
 here a sampled sound. You are now invincible.
 Once this cheat mode is active you can choose which space truck to
 attack by recalling the requester and typing 'GIMMESHIPx', replace 'x'
 with a mission from A to Z. This only works before entering the sector
 with the space truck.
