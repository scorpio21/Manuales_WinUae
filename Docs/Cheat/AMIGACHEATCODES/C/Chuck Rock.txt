SPECIFIC ALIENS - LEVEL ONE

  Coconut throwers - protect your head with a rock.
  Tiny big mouth - stand still and when he jumps to attack, jump stright up
    and kick.
  Orange hammer dudes - see above
  Homing pterodactyls - important to hit straight away. The best way is to
    wait for them and when they stop above you, move away quickly and hit
    them as they swoop down.
  Splitting chargers - good timing is required. Stand still and butt early.

END OF LEVEL BOSS - FRANK THE TRICERATOPS

  The safest place to stand is at the back of the screen on the raised floor
  (not the floating platform). Grab your rock and throw it at Frank when he's
  charging at you (about halfway across the screen) then jump out of the way
  onto the raised floor. When Frank is running the other way, go and grab
  your rock again and repeat this procedure until Frank cops it.

LEVEL TWO

  Head in mud dinosaur - when in range he will chuck mud off his head at you.
    Jump towards him and kill him with a kick.
  Speedy - runs like jiminy. Butt him early.
  Rock falls - protect your head by carrying a rock.
  Fire breather - take him out with a flying kick.
  Mud man - only hits you when out of the ground. Unkillable, so watch your
    timing.

END OF LEVEL ALIEN _ STEVE THE SABRE TOOTHED TIGER

  This is quite difficult, so get in quick and try to trap him in the corner.
  If he's going to roar, get as far away from him as possible.

LEVEL THREE

  Little frogs - leap around a lot. Get there just as they land.
  Crab - be careful with this one. When he gets in range he lunges and snaps
    quickly. Be ready with a butt or a kick.
  Swordfish - rush in and get him before he starts swiping with his sword.
  Lobster - he likes somersaulting, so watch out for the fast twists
    towards you.
  Diver - jumps in water when you're in range, so watch out above you.

END OF LEVEL ALIEN - NESSY

  Align yourself with the biggest part of her belly about a centimeter away
  and start kicking. This requires good control so get there straight away,
  but if you don't align first time get back to the surface for air.

LEVEL FOUR

  Icicle - watch the ceilings for these falling spikes. Your best bet is to
    nip under and back away instantly.
  Sneezers - when he starts to breathe in, get out of range of his `ACHOO!',
    then raush in and take him out.
  Cold dude -a couple of fast butts for this one as he takes a couple of hits
  Sliding frozen dudes - stand still and butt early.
  Snowball throwers - wait until he throws, jump the snowball, then kick him
    quickly.
  Little mammoths - watch these, they're quick, so butt early.

END OF LEVEL ALIEN _ WAYNE THE WOOLLY MAMMOTH

  This requires perfect positioning. When Wayne jumps to his most forward
  position, get in there and start kicking but remember your position. After
  a few kicks get ready to dodge the snowballs. First stand approximately 
  three inches from the left and then an inch from the left for the second
  set. Then get totally to the left and keep pushing left to counter-attack
  Wayne's suck. After this return to your attack position.

LEVEL FIVE

  Angel/devil dude - butt him and get away. You can butt again if he turns
  into a devil.
  Bandaged dino - runs around blind, so watch out for his erractic turns.
  False teeth spitter - get in quick before he manages to spit his teeth out.
    If you're good, see if you can kill both the dino and his false teeth!
  Amoeba - this one homes in on you so take it out as soon as possible.
  Hearty - nip in to trigger him off and back away to time your kick/butt.
  Leaping worms - watch out for their big jumps. Get in just as they land.
  Big worm - unkillable, so watch yourself. Use your rock to jump over them
    if need be.

END OF LEVEL ALIEN - TIM THE TYRANNOSAURUS REX

  Timing is the key. Wait on the platforms about halfway across and watch for
  the first move of his attack. Back away and let him carry through with his 
  move, then get in quick for a couple of kicks, then repeat the procedure.
  Take your time!
