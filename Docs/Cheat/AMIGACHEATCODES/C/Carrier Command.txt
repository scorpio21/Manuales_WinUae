CARRIER COMMAND
---------------

 CHEAT MODE:

 During play, pause the game and type 'THE BEST IS YET TO BE'.
 The game will restart automaticlly and print "Cheat mode activated" on
 the message panel. Now when paused, pressing [+] and [-] on the keypad
 toggles Manta invincibility. The flying craft are no longer vulnerable
 to aerial attack, although collision with large objects is still
 fatal. Pausing and pressing [1] on the keypad refuels the craft in
 question while pressing [2] replaces lost sheilding. Once a course has
 been programmed for the carrier, Mantas or Walruses, engage autopilot
 and click on pause. Now pressing [3] on the keypad and unpausing again
 takes the corresponding craft directly to it's destination.
 Pressing [6] brings up the programers palette, [7] speeds up the game
 and [9] shows the current difficulty level.

 Also, press [Ctrl] and [M] on the title screen for some interesting
 effects?


 EDITOR:

 Before starting the game, type 'GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME' and then use
 the [+] and [-] keys on the keypad to view all the objects from the
 game.


To take over the island in an action game, load up a Manta with two
missiles on each side and three in the middle. Launch and fly to the
opposite side of the island, then fly in at top speed firing violently
at the enemy command centre. This will free the island and only take
about thirty seconds.
