    CHAMPIONSHIP MANAGER ITALIA '95    
              PLAYING GUIDE            
---------------------------------------
        C.A.T./PYRAMID & GALAXY        
---------------------------------------

--------------
PICKING A TEAM
--------------
It's important to pick a good Squad.
They should have some good Players,
1M+ Account, 26- Players, some old,
experienced Players, and also some
young ones.

You should try:

1. Milan
2. Parma
3. Juventus
4. Inter
5. Fiorentina
6. Sampdoria

-----------
STARTING UP
-----------
Look through Your Staff, and if You've
got some whose Rating is below Very Good
then sack him.
Also, if some of Your Players is unhappy
with some of Your Coaches, sack those
too.

-------------------
PICKING THE PLAYERS
-------------------
Quite simply pick the best Players!
However make sure not to use Rebellious
and Withdrawn Players. Also don't use
Players with Influence 6-.

----------
THE TACTIC
----------
Make sure Your Tactic suits Your Players
best possible.
Also make sure that EACH Player actual-
ly plays in a Position, he can. Other-
wise would make him play badly.

Try this 4-3-3

 1 Keeper
 2 Left Back (Forward)
 3 Right Back (Forward)
 4 Center Back
 5 Center Back
 6 Center Mid (Backward)
 7 Center Mid
 8 Center Mid
 9 Center Forward (Forward)
10 Center Forward
11 Center Forward

Or this 3-4-1-2

 1 Keeper
 2 Center Back
 3 Center Back
 4 Sweeper
 5 Left Wing (Forward)
 6 Right Wing (Forward)
 7 Center Mid
 8 Center Mid
 9 Support
10 Center Forward
11 Center Forward

---------
THE STYLE
---------
It is hard to say which Style is the
best. I normally use Continental/Pass
to Feet. Long Ball can be useful in
a few Games, and Counter Attack is al-
ways bad.

-----------
THE CAPTAIN
-----------
The Captain of Your Team should be:

25+ Years old
Responsible/Thoughful
18+ Influence

Never use a Rebellious/Withdrawn Player
for Captain.

---------
CONTRACTS
---------
Since the Players Value depends on the
Lenght of the Contract, always try to
get it as long as possible.
If one of Your younger (-27) Players'
Contract expire, and he only wants a 1-2
year Deal, just refuse it, and he've
probably changed his Mind the next Week.
Always remember; the Player decides what
to do, after the 3rd Bid (or was it 4th)

--------------
BUYING PLAYERS
--------------
Always buy younger (-26) Players, and
only those with high Stats.
Try not to buy Players on the National-
Team, and only those of poorer Clubs
and with short Contracts. This Way,
You'll get the Player much cheaper.
You can't use more then 3 Foreigners,
so go for the Italian Players. Those
will also increase Value a lot, if
they enters the National-Team.
Also don't buy Rebellious/Withdrawn
Players and those with 6- Influence.
You should only buy one big-name Player
for each Position. If You've got two
identical Players, one of them won't play
and therefore get unhappy.
An example is Savicevic (Right Forward)
and Simone (also Right Forward) from
Milan. Make sure to get rid of one of
them.

---------------
SELLING PLAYERS
---------------
Always sell the Players You're not in-
tending to use anymore.
Unless You transfer-list a Player at the
end of the Season, other Clubs won't get
interrested in him.
If another Club approaches You, with an
offer always ask for +25% of theit bids,
until the 3rd Bid. Here You accept the
Bid, if it is higher than the Player
Value.

-------------
END OF SEASON
-------------
At the end of a Season pick the Players,
(ie. give them a Shirt Number) You want
to use the following Year.
If You've got some 30+ old Players, You
don't want to use anymore, insure him,
and make sure he've got no shirt no.
Then he'll probably retire, and You'll
get a lot of Insurance-Money.
Also this is the Moment to transfer-list
those Players You'ld like to get rid of.

----------
NEW SEASON
----------
In the beginning of each Season click
through all your Players. Increase their
Wages if they demand it, and always re-
new their Contract.
Also look through ALL new Players on all
Clubs, and check for new Talents. If
found, buy them immediately. At his Sta-
ge, they're very cheap.
This is the best Way to earn Money. Buy
the Players cheap, raise them, and sell
them expensively to the big Clubs.

----------------
FRIENDLY MATCHES
----------------
Play 3+ Matches against Italian Teams,
in the beginning of each Season.
This is a good Moment for Experiments
with young/new Players.

--------
THE GAME
--------
In the halftime Break, substitue the
Players which Rating is 2+ below the
the average of Your Team.
If You had Troubles in the first Half,
try to substitute some players and/or
change Your Tactic/Style. Sometimes
the Long Ball-Style can be very good.
If You're leading 2+ Goals in the 70th+
minute substitute Your 2 best Players,
with 2 young Talents. In this way, You
won't injury Your good Players, and Your
young Players will get some experience.
