Get a high score and type "CHEAT-PETE" as your name.  It will change
to "HI.PETE..." to show you that it worked.  The scrolling message at
the bottom of the title screen will change slightly and show you what
the author thinks of writing games!  This may also activate another
part of the game but I haven't found out what yet.

You can also enter no name into the score and the game will randomly
put in a name for you.
