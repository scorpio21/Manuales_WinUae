When you land go and pick up the message from Ratt on Butre, then
return to the Swan and then land again.  There will be another message
from Ratt.  Pick this up as well.  Repeat this 88 times (!) and put
all the messages in the backpacks, and when they are full, carry them
in the hands and one on the cursor, enter a base and find a shop.  You
can sell all the messages and get about 18,500 credits.

In the earlier stages, brute force is your best friend.  It's a good
idea to trade your droids' experience points for brawling skills and
simply clobber all the opposition.

Basic Bullshit hints:
---------------------
WALLS - There are some walls that are funny looking. As in they have like
little row of rocks on the bottom of the wall. These are MOVABLE walls you
can PUSH them.  To push these walls hit the Right Mouse Button on the
MOVE FORWARD ICON.  Only move it forward ONCE, cause twice and you might
block off something else.

All these brass knucles, gloves, knives, swords you find serve no real
purpose.  Keep them around to mark areas you have expored fully and such.
Also, after you write down a computer code from one of the clipbpoards, sell
 it!  They are worth 200 bucks. The maps (don't know what use they are) are
worth 500 bucks.

Ok... When exploring the higher planets, remember the following.
Every Switch has a purpose. Its allways good to scout out an area that is
safe, so you can rest or recharge and not be disturbed.
ALLWAYS be prepared to move to a better position after you open a cubard
thing (two small metal doors on a wall), to MOVE cause it might open up a
wall so ememies can kill you!)

The higher levels are tricky. In the Cubards you sometimes have to push the
bare wall that is show inside of it, cause there might be a little movable
brick that will open a door! This goes for the bricks that are allready
moved and the bricks you don't see as moved (look like a normal bit of
bricks). Its complicated, but just remember you can't be "stuck" in a part
of the maze, there is allways a way out!

Play with a friend. This is VERY helpful.  Have your friend control the
mouse and you the keyboard.  That way, you can move all around w/ the
keyboard, and he can kill and recharge, and buy and everything else w/ the
mouse. Saves many a life. I could not of gotten past level 2 with out using
the keyboard to move me. Plus it saves wear and tear on the left mouse
button.. I know so many people have bad mouses. Use BOTH keyboard and
mouse, or don't play.

Check EVERY shop.. Some sell weapons some sell armor, some sell nothing
worth a shit. But, allways check.  Stores that sell weapons, buy back
weapons at full price, and repair weapons at lowest cost. Shops that sell
armor, buy back armor at full price, and repair at lowest price.

Armor - At like lvl 3 you will have an option of buying some yellow armor
(it will be the third type of armor on the list).  This is good shit.  Buy
the first two people full armor of this type (selling your old) and buy
chest plates for the back two people. (allways purchase SUPER for all types
of armor). And when you get to lvl 4 buy this type for ALL your people. You
will also be able to buy rifles on lvl 3. Do this!

Mutant Humans - Once in a while you will come up against a normal looking
human character.  He Will NOT attack you until you attack him.. When you DO
attack him, he sprouts a big wolf head and bites the shit out of you.  They
ALLWAYS have a bit of paper on them with a computer code on it, and some
money.

GURU MEDITATION ERROR - Maybe once every 4 hours of play, a little bogus
red box will pop up saying "GURU MEDITATION ERROR 0000004.000 DROID LINK
TERMINATED, PRESS LEFT MOUSE BUTTON TO RETRY." Just hit Left Mouse Button,
its just a joke in the game from the programmer. Haha, real funny. shit.

Green Probes - You use the green probes on the galactic map. Just Drop one
on the galactic map and it will locate the next base for you to raid.
Simple.

Anti-Grav - Anti-Gravity is very important.  You can use it in the dungeons
, to float over water and not get hurt.

Fighting Tactics:
-----------------
a) Doors : It is a decent tactic to slam the door on an enemy that is in
the door way, while you attack him.  Thus, it takes damage from both the
door and you attacking it.

b) Purple Worm run-a-bout : This is where you lure your enemy into an open
area (at least 4x4 square) and attack him then move away. Then when he
moves to your old position, you attack while he is facing away from you,
then side-step again and turn.  Keep on doing this, it is an excellent way
of eliminating a single group of foes.

c) RETREAT : This is where your in a long stream of corridores and an
enemy pops up that is powerful.  What you do is attack, move back a space,
and when the enemy takes your old position, attack and move back again.
Since you normally are faster at attacking then the enemy it works out ok,
as long as you don't back your self into a close space. With shooting
enemies, just attack them at junctions, so they are facing away from you.
Enemies can only attack what they are facing.

d) Up-Down : This is what you do when you climb up a ladder just to face
some nasties that wanna kill ya.  All you have to do is, climb down (or up,
we will just say that down is the safe area and up is the dangerous one),
recharge your weapon, climb up, and attack and before your enemy attacks
back, when youve fired all you can (when all your hands are shadded) climb
back down.. Keep doing this until all dead.. Also, sometimes enemies will
move around, so the next time you go up, they could be behind you.  It is
good if you can get them from behind.

e) Left-Right : OK! There are some obsticles your enemies can not progress
through, (ie. WATER, FIRE, DRAINS, FIRE HYDRANTS). So, if there is a bit of
un-passable-to-monsters square in front of a corridore that holds monster,
all ya do is this.  Get behind it (where you are safe from them moving
forward, but maybe not from them shooting) go left, recharge and wait for
the enemies to TURN, then jump back and fire. When they turn to face you,
jump back. So on, and so forth, and boom. You kill them and they didn't lay
a pseudo-pod on ya!

f) Shock Therapy : You can shoot the electricity that you electrifies your
finger in the light sockets.  Basically, you just find a spot thats safe
and juice up, run to the enemies and fire away.. Its got a good range and
does heavy damage. Good weapon.

g) Upside Down : Some Creatures will not be hit by your weapons (Ither the
weapons will fire to low to hit flying creatures (like pistols do) or fire
to high to hit small creatures (like RIFLES)). So, if you have pistols and
come up against flying enemies, just use ANTI-GRAV (Dev-Scape Basic) and
you will be on their level and can kill them! Or if you have like Rifles
and come up against low to the ground enemies, flip and the rifles and hit!
