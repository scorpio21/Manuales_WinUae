Now leave your room and continue up to passage to the
garden where the queen hangs out. 
Talk to her. 
ASK ABOUT FLOWER.

she talks about if you want. 
Now exit the room and continue down the passage.
Go to the next tower where the treasury and Wizards room are. 
To get to the wizards room you continue to go forward in the

Then READ SCROLL, READ TRANSLATION. 
Go to the chest and open it. 
GET LODESTONE. 
Now go down from the wizards room. 
Pass the next tower and do not leave through the exit, 
but instead walk past it to the last tower you have not been to.

Go to each of the alters here and KNEEL. 
Put a gold coin on each alter. 
Go the exit you passed earlier to the courtyard. 
ASK GUARD ABOUT GALAHAD AND LANCELOT.

Now back on the map, the first place you go is to GlastonburyTor. 
You will see a little forest sprite on the screen as you enter. 
Give him a copper coin. 
Now go west and you will see a poor hunter there. 
Give the poor hunter a copper coin. 
Ask him about lots of people if you want information. 
You can ask about Lancelot, Gawain, Mad Monk, Black Knight, 
and maybe some others.
Give the man a gold coin and he will give you the spear you need.
Now get back on your horse and continue west. 
You will fight three boars here. 
You just press space bar when the boar is real close. 
Now continue on to the next screen. 
Talk to the CROW. 
He will ask you if you want to challenge Black Knight,say YES. 
Now look at the dead guy by the tree.

Talk to him and ask him questions and then....
Put Gawain on your horse and he will betaken back to your castle.
