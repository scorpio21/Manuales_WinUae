   to control him. O.k move behind the pillar in the middle  of the room so
   the troll cant see you...the troll should now fall asleep.                        
13)Walk over to the troll-be careful not to   stand on  any  loose tiles as
   they'll make a noise and wake up the troll. The route I found  to be the
   easiest is to go up around the pillar and straight across the room.
14)Attach the match to the troll's foot and then click  on the  defend icon
   and then on the matchbox to light the match.Pickup the fire extinguisher
   and Benn will appear and take you back to the village.

   the far wall,shout `help' and pickup the bottle.
10)Alright,go to the locked door  next to the band and  insert the  keycard 
   into the slot.
11)Now,this bit is a tiny bit tricky and might be easier with the joystick.
   Notice the bag at the left  of the screen well all you have to do to get
   it is use the wind to blow you towards it.  Walk left   towards the  bag
   until the wind  starts to blow  you back, then move right until the wind 
   starts to blow you back again-this time you should be able  to get close
   enough to the bag to pick it up.
12)Remember the robot guarding the shipwreck? well go up to him and hit him
   with the sock filled with gold.
13)This bit is very hard to explain  through  text alone but here it  goes.
   Pickup one of the planks and walk to the middle  of the screen, as close
   to the waters  edge as possible... you'll have to be pixel accurate with
   this but the place you should be  standing  roughly is  where  the  sand 
   starts to dip  inwards in a curve shape. Push/pull  plank  and our  hero
   should  lay the plank horizantally ACROSS the  sand-if he lays the plank
   down vertically towards you your in the wrong spot. Once  youve laid the
   first  plank correctly pickup the second  plank and stand  in the middle
   of the  first plank. Push/pull plank and he'll  lay the  plank acoss the
   water to  the other side allowing you to  cross.  Cross  the  plank  and
   pickup  the rag near the bag of the ship.
14)Go back to  the screen  where the  cave is and a door  will appear, walk 
   through it.
15)Stand by the patch  on the wall at  the top  and  throw  the bottle  and
   then push/pull the rag to reveal a  button. Push the button to raise the
   gate. Walk  up to the circuit board and throw the bag.Throw the tray and
