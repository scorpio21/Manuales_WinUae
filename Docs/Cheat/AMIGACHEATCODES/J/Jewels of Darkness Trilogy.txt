                              COLOSSAL ADVENTURE
                    
    There are several 'random' elements within this adventure, so it is not
    possible to indicate EXACTLY where or when they occur. The best thing
    to do is follow the procedures, detailed in these preliminary notes, to
    deal with each problem as and when it arises.


    (1) The first Dwarf you meet will throw an axe or small knife at you.
    It always misses the first time. Ignore the knife but get the axe. From
    then on, when you meet a Dwarf, throw the axe and take it again. One
    throw will usually suffice but you may have to repeat the action.

    (2) When you have some treasures the Pirate will rob you. To retrieve
    them (also the chest, which is itself a necessary treasure) go to the
    West End of the Hall of Mists. Now follow these directions EXACTLY:
                       S - E - S - S - S - N E - E - NW.
    You will now have found the chest containing your stolen treasure. Take
    the chest AND your stolen treasures and proceed EXACTLY as follows:
                      SE - N - DOWN - E - E - SAY XYZZY.
    You are now back at the Small Brick Building. deposit the chest and
    treasures and resume where you left off. The Pirate will not return.

    (3) When you are told that the lamp is flickering, this is a warning
    that the batteries need replacing. Go back to the Small Brick Building
    and GET THE COINS. 'SAY PLUGH' and then 'ON LAMP' then proceed EXACTLY
    as follows:
              S - S - UP - W - W - W - W - W - S - E - E - CLIMB.
    You will now have found the Vending Machine and you should 'DROP
    COINS'. The machine will dispense new batteries and your lamp is
    automatically 'recharged'. Now proceed:
       N - UP - E - E - E - E - E - DOWN - N - N - OFF LAMP - SAY PLUGH.
    You are now back at the Small Brick Building. As the coins were a
    necessary treasure, this procedure will deduct TEN points from your
    final score! This solution cuts a few unnecessary corners out, and
    fully utilises ON/OFF LAMP and the magic words: PLUGH, PLOVER and XYZZY
    to reduce the chances of needing replacement batteries.

    (4) The 'Endgame' will materialise when ALL treasures have been
    collected and shortly after you are informed that the 'Caves are
    closing'.

    (6) Finally, each time you 'SAVE' your position, ONE point is deducted
    from your score.

    Right, off we go!!

    (Score out of 1100 depends on how many times you 'SAVED' and if you
    used the coins to renew the lamp batteries or not!!).

                                 FINAL MESSAGE

    The Demon Lord freezes you with a look: "YOU WILL STILL FAIL!", he
    snarls, "NO AMULET CAN WORK SO CLOSE TO THE CENTRE OF MY POWER". But
    the Phoenix dives at the fire, destroying it completely! The Demon Lord
    screams and implodes to nothing. Your mission is successful!! You
    scored 5475 out of about 6000. You are clearly a Master Adventurer!

==============================================================================                  
                   D U N G E O N   A D V E N T U R E 

                                

Before  commencing  this  adventure  it  is  important  to  understand  the

'teleport' system as this saves a lot of trudging about. There are a number

of  coloured  collars  hidden  throughout  the game, and an equal number of

pedestals  with  the corresponding coloured light shining upon them, placed

at strategic locations. The colours are on the scale of the colour spectrum

(i.e: Red, Orange, Yellow, etc, through to Gold and Mithril).



Take  and  wear a coloured collar, go to a pedestal location then 'UP'. Say

any  colour,  up  to  an  including  the  colour of the collar that you are

currently  wearing,  and  you  will  teleport to the corresponding coloured

pedestal.



To  teleport  to  'higher'  coloured  pedestals,  you  must  be wearing the

'higher'  coloured collar. Be careful when teleporting to the BLUE pedestal

as  this is located in the Wight's House and you must be carrying the cross

and crucifix to force them away when you descend from the pedestal!



Maximum use of this system is made throughout this solution.



A COUPLE OF 'RANDOM' OCCURENCES BEFORE YOU START!!

(1) The Roc will carry you to it's nest from any of the locations indicated

on  Map  7.  If  it doesn't strike at the point shown in the solution, then

move towards the nest location until it does, then proceed as shown.



(2)  The  boulders  falling  down  the stairs always occur when you have at

least  TWO  MOVES to a place of safety (See Maps). If and when you are told

that  there is a sound of boulders from ABOVE, then seek the NEAREST gulley

and  'WAIT' until it passes safely. You are then safe to proceed UPWARDS as

the boulder rolls away BELOW you!



Finally,  you  have a limited number of moves in daylight, at the start.You

must find a temporary light source BEFORE SUNSET to carry on and enable you

to  locate  a  more permanent light source. Following this solution EXACTLY

will allow enough time to achieve this.



                               THE SOLUTION
