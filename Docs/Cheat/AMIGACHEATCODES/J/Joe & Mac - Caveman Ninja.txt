Joe & Mac - Caveman Ninja


 PLAYING TIPS:

 The caveman carrying the rock will nearly always drop fruit.
 Hit him, and then jump on the rock he drops three times to get the fruit.
 Now and again you'll come across a caveman who isn't doing anything.
 When he wakes up and starts chewing, hit him for extra points.
 Vertically scrolling levels have a special Spaceman bonus.
 Stay on the right side ofthe screen to get this.

 On levels 9 and 10, after you have defeated the spiky guy and the disk
 loads for the next level, hold the joystick left and hold the firebutton
 until the bonus section starts. You'll float down slowly, and will be
 able to catch more bonus fruits.
