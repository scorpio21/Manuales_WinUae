The Jetsons: George Jetson And The Legend of Robotopia

                          Jetson's Solve

WARNING!! This is a super game. There is ALOT of mapping and some
tough puzzles (in spite of what some are sure to say). However, the
mechanics of the game (and the ability to install it on a HardDrive)
made the mapping almost fun. Reading the following text file will ruin
the game for you. If you are careful you should be able to read a step
were you are stuck with out ruining the rest of the game. Hope this
helps if you get stuck. The maps show only a few hints (ie, get some
thing here) and may be used without reading the actual solve. Oh Yes,
for those that want to see the end of the game without going through
the game I have included a SAVEGAME from the game named JETFINISH. It
is at the very end. Just go to Cogswell's office and let the fun begin.

SOME GENERAL RULES: Save the game before each interaction, the proper
responses are needed in each situation and sometimes they are tricky.
Be honest except where noted. Don't waste any moves. You have a limited
amount of time. Give Spacely only one piece of new information when he
appears, this gives you a little more time. Stay in character. Putting
items into the briefcase allows you to carry more items. To operate
things in the game click on yourself (or an item), then click on the
Red Arrows Icon, then click on the object you want affected.

ABOUT MAPS: The first map is of the planet Robotopia. This map is in
text form and pretty straight forward. The second map is of the area
containing the Control Room. The next five maps are of the Caves. In
these areas it is easier to move around using the small window on the
right and clicking on the little red dots. The dots on the maps are in the
correct positions. You don't need to go to alot of places in the caves,
but it is easy as hell to get lost and without the maps you can wander for
a long time (believe me!). The letters are the holes in the floors of some
of the cave rooms. Each of these rooms will have a set of stairs going
back up. The small s in some rooms are the stairways back up a level. I
think it will become clear after a short period of movement. The last
two maps are of Cogwell's factory. These were a bitch to map and I did
the best I could mapping them. The maps make perfect sense to me now and
I can get around easily. Each room has a different set of colored tube ways
in it. A room is represented by a combination such as; WBG. This means
the room contains a WHITE tube on the far left, then moving to the right
a BLUE tube, and finally a GREEN tube.....get it. I thought I would never
be able to map this area, but now I can zip around and never get lost. If
you go get lost, look at the combination of tubes in the room try to find
the same combo on the map amd move to the next room and check to see if
its what you expected to find there. The following is the list of letters
I used:

W = White
B = Blue
V = Violet
G = Green
L = Light Yellow
Y = Yellow
P = Pink

I never did figure out if the markings on the tubes meant anything. Except
for two places (Special rooms like the Loading Dock) taking the same
color tube after going to a new room will take you back to the old room.
Well, I guess thats it....now on to the solve.....

Go to Mall and buy "Port-a-Nuk" and JetPack.

(MESS AROUND UNTIL THE SCIENCE FAIR STARTS AT ELROY'S SCHOOL)
 (This might not be necessary, but you need his help later and
 he may not help you if you don't show up.)

Go to Science Fair and talk with Elroy. Get Device from him.
Go to Rocket Port, drop Elroy's device and board rocket.

(USE PLANET MAP)

Go to Hotel and talk to explorer. Give him donation. Get Lamp.

Use JetPack and fly North to Volcano. Descend.
Talk to the two robots. Get Harmonizer.
Fly to Trackless Jungle. Descend. Go to Ruins.
Go to the circle (must use green arrow), turn on lamp. Use Harmonizer.
Get Blue object (Conscience Generator) (Notice triangles on wall?) and exit.
Fly to West End of Wall and descend. Get COG.
Fly to Cloud City and see the King. After the first response, show him
 the COG. After he responds, show him the Conscience Generator. Get the
 crystal key.

Fly to Great Canyon and descend. Use the following technique to open
 entrance. Click on Crystal Key, then the Red-Arrows (Use Icon), then the
 correct colored panel of the door.

(Open Rock to Command Room - YELLOW, VIOLET, GREEN, RED, BLUE)
(USE CONTROL ROOM MAP, ONLY TWO LEVELS)

Follow map to Control room. Keep PULLING handle until the Green light
 flashes on the control panel. Try to go back to the entrance. You will
 get stopped by some droids. Tell the truth until the question with a
 choice of "Tell about sleeping droid" as an answer, pick it. Lie and
 say you haven't touched the controls.

(Open Cave - VIOLET, YELLOW, BLUE, RED, GREEN)
(USE CAVE MAPS, EIGHT LEVELS)

Follow map to level eight. Its confusing but if you do the following it
 should be relatively easy. Go to C on level one. Go down it and then
 to H on level two and down again. Go Down L, M, and N. You are now on
 level six. Go down Q and then again in T. Get the drill.

Now, go back to way you came, up to level four (the map calls this
 position Level 4 - Entrance L). Now follow the map to the blocked
 exit. Use the drill on the exit and continue to follow the map to the
 King's Room. By the way you can drop the drill. Talk to King and
 get ID Card.

Fly back to Hotel. Give explorer the crystral key and get his help with
 customs.

Go to Rocket Pad. Board ship. Let customs search you.

(Back on Home Planet)

Return to your house. Get BonBons from Living Room table.
Go to Elroy's Room. Give BonBon to Astro. Talk to Elroy. Get him to
 come with you. Get Elroy's Jet Boots.
Go to Cogswell's Factory and show ID Card to Robot. Enter Bigger Tube.

(Inside Cogswell's Factory)
(Use Factory Maps - These are color coded tubes)

Follow map to Tool Cabinet. Get Tools.
Go to room marked "Conveyor". Enter tube. Sic Astro on robot dog. Help
 Astro fight dog.
Follow map to "Sorter". Use green arrow to go to exit in ceiling. You
 won't fit. Give Jet Boots to Elroy. Let him help. Enter door across room.
Click on Elroy, the Red Arrows, and then the droid. Help Elroy by handing
 him the correct tools as he asks for them. Remove the Blue chip. After
 the flash, continue on with the operation.
Go to Cogwell's Office. Follow the coversation.

               Thats it!!!      Easy wasn't it.

The following is a map of the planet in the Jetson's Game.

The map is a 16 by 16 square grid.

A = Concrete Jungle                B = Enchanted Basin
C = Crystal Grove                  D = Cloud City
E = Eden by the Bay                F = West End of Wall
G = Great Canyon                   H = Hotel
I = Isle of Mist                   J = Jungle
K = Blue Mountains                 L = Lake
M = Mount Bloom                    N = East End of Wall
O = Ocean                          P = Phoenix Lake
Q = Aulleaux River                 R = Rose Cliffs
S = Singing Jungle                 T = Robodolphin Cove
U = Ruined Wasteland               V = Ice Covered Volcano
W = Wall                           X = Plateau of the Sun
Y = Mare Cyborium (A large Sea)    Z = Zen Valley
a = Garden of Ions                 b = Betree Forest
c = Space Port                     d = Blue Green Jungle
e = Low Mountains                  f = Sunset Isles

k = Pixel Grove                    m = Bolean Basin
n = Trackless Jungle

Moving East and West near the poles jumps to the next different type of
landscape. So Moving East on the line with the Rose Cliffs would
come out ROSE CLIFFS -> JUNGLE -> MYSTIC JUNGLE -> JUNGLE -> ROSE CLIFFS,
get the idea. This is true only of the two lines near the top and bottom
of the map. The very top and bottom of the map (VOLCANO and SILICA SEA)
produce strange results going EAST or WEST but the map is correct. You
start out above the Hotel or the Space Port. Hope this map helps...
