James Pond II  (RoboCod)


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the roof before the first door, pick up the objects in this order:
 Cake, Hammer, Earth, Apple, Tap.
 Pick them up in that order (spells CHEAT). You are now invincible for
 about 15 minutes.

 Enter the first door, there are the following pick-ups close together:
 Penguin, Oil, Wine, Earth, Racket
 Pick them up in that order (spells POWER) and you'll receive a few
 extra power bars.

 A little further along the same level are these pick-ups:
 Lips, Ice-cream, Violin, Earth, Snowman.
 Pick them up in that order (spells LIVES) for infinite lives.

 If you've activated the first roof cheat (which can also be repeated
 towards the end of the first level) then use the exit pole at the
 begining of the level. Now when you restart, all the locks will have
 been removed from the doors leaving you free to start on any level in
 any order you like.

 Or alternatively you could try the following cheat mode.
 At any time on the intro or the title screen, type 'LITTLE MERMAID'.
 The screen will flash green to confirm the cheat has been activated.
 The following in-game keys are now activated:

        [F] - Toggles wings on/off.
        [C] - Toggles car on/off.
        [P] - Toggles plane on/off.
        [B] - Toggles bathtub on/off.
        [S] - Save current position.
        [G] - Go to saved position.
        [M] - Map selector (enter desination from 0 to 50).
        [K] - Kills Robocod.
        [X] - Go to exit pole (using X to often crashes the computer).
   [Return] - Toggle invincible on/off.
  [F6]/[F7] - Toggles 50/60 Mhz mode (if you have big or super agnus).
 [F9]/[F10] - Toggle timing colours (isn't a cheat but you can do it).

 Going into map select mode enables you to leap to various points in the
 game. These are accessed using the following numbers:

 TIPS:

 There are two hidden worlds behind the main tower, another sweets
 level (including a Liquorice Allsorts World, the infamous Bouncing
 Jelly World, another Cake World and an upside down Jelly World)
 and an extra scrolling section. To reach them, run along the ground
 floor - avoiding the doors - then go up and over the first flight
 of stairs.  From the bottom of the second (smaller) tower, make
 your way up to the landing above Dr. Maybe's final door and run left
 into the wall.  You'll disappear behind the screen and arrive in the
 Secret Tower room.

 Once you've  finished the bath level, drop down to the bottom of the
 castle, and walk left until you get to the small snowman statues.
 Jump on these and they'll turn into a moving platform.  Once you get
 to the top of the screen, walk left into thin air and jump.  By now
 you should be next to some doors.  Go through them for bonus city!!

 Go to the same place after finishing the circus room (the last room
 before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden snowmen again.
 A platform made of two bonud blocks should float upwards, revealing
 a secret tunnel.  At the end of this are even more extra lives and
 stars.
    
 Do as above after the sweets level, but go to the left of the
 castle.  Go on the snowmen once more, and at the top of the screen
 grab the umbrella and collect all the goodies while you're floating
 down.

 On the second teddy bear level, keep jumping over the spikes until
 you see a hole above you.  Jump through this and catapult yourself
 off the bus there. Once you've done this, get on the higher level
 and keep walking left, bounce on the trampoline and collect the
 wings.  Now fly along the top of the screen to the right and you
 should find a different exit.  Go through this for a special bonus
 level. 

 Complete a level with does not feature a guardian and you will
 always find something new when you return to the castle "selection"
 screen.  In one case you will find a whole sequence of lifts and
 things (see above) that lead to a door that you cannot normally get
 to.  If you go to the very right of the factory screen and look down
 you will see a load of crowns, which you can access after coming
 back from other levels.

 It is possible to finish Robocod by only doing half the levels.  A
 choice of two new doors to enter is given when the correct level is
 completed.  Start by completing the Fluffy Toys one and then by
 doing the Cars one.

 Finish the bath levels and as soon as you come out of the door run
 straight to the golden snowmen in the bottom far left outside the
 castle.  Jump into these snowmen and you'll float upwards to the top
 of the screen where you'll be met by a door.  Getting through this
 door is tricky but worth it.  Inside are loads of extra lives and
 energy stars.  Go to the same place after finishing the circus room
 (the last room before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden
 snowmen again.  A platform made of two bonus blocks ahould float
 upwards revealing a secret tunnel.  At the end of this are even more
 extra lives and stars.
