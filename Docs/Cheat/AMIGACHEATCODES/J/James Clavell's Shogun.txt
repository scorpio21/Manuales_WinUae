SHOGUN Walkthrough
By Graeme Cree [72630,304]


This is a walkthrough for Shogun, a Graphic Interactive Fiction title
written by Dave Lebling and James Clavell, and published by Infocom.

Like the game, this walkthrough is divided into 18 separate scenes, with
each and every command needed to get through the scene listed.  In the one
or two cases where the game produces random results, this is noted.  Commands
preceded by a "*" increase the player's score by 5 points.  When a command
produces a graphic image, this is noted in a column on the right.
