Xenon 2


 CHEAT MODE:

 It is alleged that pausing the game and typing 'RUSSIAN AIR' will
 enable the [N] key to skip to the next level. However, the Renegade
 help line tells me that the Bitmap Brothers never put cheat modes in
 their games. But that's not exactly true, is it?


 PLAYING TIPS:

 What And Where To Buy
