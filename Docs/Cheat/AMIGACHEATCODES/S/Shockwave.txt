SHOCKWAVE

A few hints and tips follow on how each of the four zones (armys,
factorys, mines and rigs) effect the game:

MINES - Each time a mine is purchased the income you receive for
        each time pass doubles.

FACTORYS -  The more factorys you have the faster more weapons
            are produced, these are essential.

RIGS -  These supply you with the fuel for each mission run.  The
        more rigs you have the greater the amount of fuel you
        receive for each time pass.

ARMYS - For every army unit you own, the enemy slows down.  You
        have one army unit, for each four time passes that occur
        the enemy won't move for one time pass.  If more than 50%
        of the sector is occupied by the enemy then you will lose
        one of your assests for each time pass that occurs.  The
        best solution is when 30% of the sector is occupied go an
        attack the enemy.
