Super Space Invaders


 CHEAT MODE:

 Type in 'KRIS' on the option screen and you'll then be able to skip
 through the levels simply by hitting [F1].

 TIPS:
 
 When you collect the pod that produces four bases, placed at equal
 intervals along the bottom of the screen, don't just leave them
 there. If the invaders are quite low, shoot the bases up the screen
 and into the alien swarms. This way you are guaranteed of killing
 aliens as they die upon contact with bases, rather than allowing the
 space fiends to destroy them before they come down.
