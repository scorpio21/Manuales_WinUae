Silkworm


 CHEAT MODE:

 Press the [Help] key and the fire button together and you'll receive
 infinite lives. You can now also move through the levels by pressing
 the numeric keys [1] to [0] and the minus key.

 If you have the latest version then attempting the above will reveal
 the message: "Congratulations!, you have found the cheat mode...
 unfortunately it has been ZZAPPED!". If this is the case then you must
 type 'SCRAP 28' on the options screen instead. This will have the same
 effects as the original.
