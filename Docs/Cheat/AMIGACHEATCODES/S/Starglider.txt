Starglider


 CHEAT MODE:

 Slow down the ship completely and press [F] for fixed sights.
 Now pause the game with the [Backspace] and type in 'JS ARG S'.
 You'll now be invincible and your fuel and sheilds will never deplete.
 It also enables these keys:

 [P] - Restock missiles.
 [E] - Reboots the disk.
 [N] - 5000 points.
 [M] - Stops enemy aircraft.
 [Z] - * Secret object viewer.

 * - If you press [Z] to activate the secret object viewer pause the
 game and use the [{] and [}] to manipulate the objects. You can now
 use all of the keys except [Q] and [Esc]. Use the mouse to change
 the point of view, or magnification with the right mouse button.
