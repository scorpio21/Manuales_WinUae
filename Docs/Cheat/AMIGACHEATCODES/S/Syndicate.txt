                        SYNDICATE - HINTS `N` TIPS
                        ==========================

Getting Started
---------------

o   The first step is to get used to the controls and to how the man will
    react in different situations. Be aware of where you are clicking on
    the screen as your man will try to reach the exact point.

o   As you are viewing the cityscape from an airship it is hard for you
    to direct your man to an area that you cannot see (behind a building,
    for example). Some times it is easier to click the location on the
    scanner.

o   For the first missions you should only take in a single agent. If you
    take in too many agents then you run the risk of losing some while
    your concentrating on just one of them. Stick with one agent until
    you feel confident with your degree of control. Then gradually start
    increasing the number of agents and use `GROUP` mode a lot. Once you
    have got the hang of that you can move on to advanced tactics.

The Slider Bars
---------------

o   A major gameplay feature in Syndicate is the use of the slider bars
    to affect each agent`s performance. It is possible to complete the
    game without altering the bars, but I wouldn`t recommend it. Although
    the way in which your interact with the bars is very simple, the way
    in which they affect the agent is highly complex.

    Each bar has three values: the Actual level (light bar), Grabber level
    (dark bar) and Natural level (white line).

    ACTUAL: The level that you set is the Actual level. This is the value
    that affects the agent directly. Moving the Actual level to the right
    of the Natural level raises the amount of fluid in the body, while
    moving it to the right lowers the amount.

    GRABBER: The Grabber level is the agent`s natural bodily defence
    systems. Overexposure to any fluid damages the body, so the other
    systems in the body try to counter this. The Grabber level works 
    it`s way towards the Actual level. When it gets there it begins to 
    drag the Actual level back towards the Natural level.

    NATURAL LEVEL: The Natural level is the base level of the fluid in
    the body. Exposure to a lot of the fluid will raise the Natural
    amount in the body and thus reduce the body`s capacity for more. In
    short the person will not be able to gain as much from a fluid boost
    as the Grabber level will react more quickly.

    What all of this means is that you cannot turn the agent into a
    superhuman indefinitely. Boosting all the values at the start and
    keeping the agent running at full throttle for the whole game is
    impossible.

o   After a period of major activity and boosting, it is advisable to
    find a quiet spot, if possible, to give your men a rest. Likewise,
    if you are expecting to have a prolonged period of extreme fluid use
    then rest the agents beforehand. By `rest` I mean move the Actual
    level in the opposite direction to the way you will use it. So, if
    you expect a situation that demands high Perception, reduce the 
    agent`s Perception beforehand. This will trick the body`s defences
    (Grabber level) and give you a longer period of higher Perception.

    After all of that how about a more detailed description of what the
    bars actually do?

    ADRENALINE - The Red Bar
    ------------------------

    In it`s simplest form, the Adrenaline level alters the agent`s 
    speed. The higher the amount, the faster the man will run. If the
    Adrenaline level is reduced to the minimum then the agent enters
    `rest` mode. The body reacts to the fluids quicker and tries to
    balance itself out. What this means is that the Grabber and and
    Natural levels sort themseves out quicker. It also allows enhanced
    Chest modeifications to conduct spot repairs on the body faster
    than they would normally.

    PERCEPTION - The Blue Bar
    -------------------------

    Perception governs how aware the agent is of his surroundings. When
    it comes to weapon using a high Perception will result in very
    accurate shooting, excellent for sniping or making every shot count.
    A low Perception results in shots going wild. With automatic weapons
    weaponry such as the Uzi and Mini-Gun this makes them ideal for
    mowing down innocent civ... er.. enemy hordes. Ahem. In addition,
    Perception is best used in conjunction with Intelligence to allow
    the agent to react to people in a wider area. Of course, if you 
    don`t want the agent to react then lower the Perception so that he
    cannot see them. This is useful for NOT shooting people that you want
    to keep alive.

    INTELLIGENCE - The Yellow Bar
    -----------------------------

    Intelligence has to be used in conjuction with Perception. The 
    Intelligence of an agent affects how he reacts in certain situations.
    With high Intelligence he will react to people he considers to be a
    threat. A threat is usually somebody trying to shoot him. If the agent
    has a selection of weapons then he will pick the best available weapon
    and shoot the threat. This is very useful for letting the agent clear
    out hostile buildings since you cannot see where the targets are. If
    the agent doesn`t have a weapon, or he is out of ammo, then a high
    Intelligence will ensure that he runs away from the threat. This does
    mean that he is unlikely to make the mad run to the gun lying on the
    floor when it is surrounded by armed psychos - lower the Intelligence
    for that one. There are also situations where you don`t want the agent
    to whip out his weapon and start blasting (like when you are 
    surrounded by police officers). Lower the Intelligence for that as
    well.

    Well that`s about it for the bars. As you can see, there are hundreds
    of different combinations that I can`t go into here. Experimentation
    is the order of the day.

The Best Laid Plans
-------------------

o   The most important thing about any mission is the briefing. READ IT!
    There is a lot of useful information in the briefings and it is
    always worthwhile spending the money on extra information. Can`t find
    the bloke to <Persuade>? Died whilst trying to find a way through the
    sewers? Got blown away because the guards were all armed with Tac 
    Nukes and you only equipped your lads with pointed sticks and harsh
    language? Well you get no sympathy from me. Should have read the
    briefing.

o   After reading the briefing thoroughly you should then think about what
    equipment you will need...

`I`d Like a Big Gun That Hold Lots of Bullets Scenario
------------------------------------------------------

Getting the right equipment for the right situation is always important.
Take the very first level as an example. Most of the guards are armed with
pistols. You have a choice of Pistol or Shotgun. "Aha!" says an observant
player. "Shotguns are more expensive than pistols, they must be better!
I`ll have half a dozen pump action 12 gauges." In walks Rutger Hauer Jr
with his arsenal and gets pick off by a weedy bloke with a hand gun. By
the time he gets close enough to use his weapons he has been seriously
wounded. It all boils down to the right tools for the right job.

o   Pistols in the early levels can easily outrange people with Shotguns.
    A Shotgun will kill an enemy agent a lot quicker than a Pistol or 
    even an Uzi, if you get close enough to use it. It`s no use trying to
    pop a guy standing a screen away, even with a Mini-Gun. Use a Long
    Range Rifle Instead. See?

What Weapon?
------------

o   Pistol
    A free weapon with a slightly longer range than the Shotgun. It`s
    good as a backup weapon or for use when the opponents have Shotguns.

o   Shotgun
    Cheap and devistating at close range. Hide in doorways or around
    corners of buildings and wait for some sap to appear before firing.
    It will damage even the most armoured agent, so be warned.

o   Uzi
    All agents should carry an Uzi - they should become the mainstay of
    your arsenal. Reletively cheap to purchase and maintain, the Uzi has
    a moderate range, is useful against light vehicles such as ground
    cars or dust carts, but can run out of ammo fast.

o   Flamer
    The most lethal weapon at a close range. It should be used in the 
    same way as a Shotgun, although it is a tad on the heavy side and
    unmodified agents should stick to Shotguns. It has stacks of ammo
    and one blast is usually enough to barbecue even the toughest agents.

o   Long Range Rifle
    The ideal sniper weapon. Use it to pick off your targets from rooftops
    far away from the combat zone. It`s not much use against heavily
    armoured targets or vehicles but is quite good at keeping enemy agents
    at bay.

We`re a Team and There`s Nothing We Can`t Handle
------------------------------------------------

Moving around the city as part of a team is fairly simple. With `GROUP`
mode on, all agents will accept commands at once. This is devastating if
you instruct them to fire at a target. However, it does turn them into
a nice target for enemy agents because they are all bunched together,
hence the `SCATTER` option. When moving them around in a city that has
an active police force, always ensure your weapons are stashed away and
not carried openly. You may have to lower the agent`s intelligence to
stop them getting their guns out whenever they are startled by something.

o   When you enter a combat situation that looks like it may continue for
    longer than a couple of bursts of Uzi fire, you should try to split
    your squad up. Try to come at the enemy from as many different sides
    as possible, the principle being that they cannot shoot in all
    directions at once and you should be able to tag them before they get
    you.

o   Vehicles and other transport systems should be used as often as
    possible. Not only are they a lot faster than an unmodified agent,
    but they provide a larger amount of protection. If the vehicle comes
    under heavy fire then be prepared to get out and make a run for it;
    you don`t want to get caught in an exploding car! While they cannot
    leave the road, vehicles under your control can run over people at
    pedestrian crossings or enemy agents that get too close.

o   The same applies to defending an area. Set your men up with high
    Intelligence and Perception and ensure they have plenty of ammo.
    Cover all the attack points and keep your men spread out. Leave them
    in `GROUP` mode so that you can bring them all to fire on a single
    point if it looks like the enemy are about to get through. Apart
    from that let them have a field day.

o   Once you have got the hang of moving in `GROUP` mode you may like
    to try these other, more complex methods of moving around:

    The `Skirmish Line`. Your agents line out side-by-side to cover
    almost the screen. They then move forwards until the enemy is 
    engaged. When the enemy is found, then the line can concentrate it`s
    firepower on the one spot. With any luck you should have sufficient
    width in the line to negate almost all cover that the enemy may have
    and you also automatically attack from multiple directions.

    The `Drag` formation. One agent on point with two others as flankers,
    three blocks behind and to either side. The fourth agent hangs back
    with support weaponry (either a Mini-Gun, Long Range Rifle, Laser,
    or Gauss Gun). The point man will reveal where the enemy is (ensure
    he is well armoured or has an energy shield) and if the flank agents
    cannot deal with them, then open up with the support agent. Don`t
    worry about shooting your own lads unless you are using the Gauss
    Gun because the explosion will kill your guys too.

Dug In Deeper Than An Alabama Tick
----------------------------------

Here is how to get rid of those ennoying guards in hard-to-reach 
places...

o   Any guard in the open
    Shoot them with a Long Range Rifle. Wait well out of range and then
    pop them in the head. Serves them right for not having any cover.
    Sucker.

o   Guards in the open but not far enough away
    If possible drive past them in a car and give them a taste of 
    Shotgun in the gut. If not, then split the squad and come at the
    guard from two directions. Get the agents as close as possible using
    available cover. When in posistion switch to `GROUP` mode and move
    them in, shooting as you go.

o   Guards at the end of road bridges
    Run `em over. Bounce `em off the bonnet. No problemo. If they`re not
    on the road then drive up and shoot them. Not as much fun though.

o   Guards behind closed doors
    Come at the door from both sides. You should get right up on it
    before it opens. Make sure you have Shotguns selected and high
    Intelligence and Perception. Turn your Adrenaline right down so that
    if you do get hit you will heal a lot faster. When you are ready
    move your agents to the doorway so that the door opens. If the 
    guards are too far back then you will need to select a different
    weapon.

Playing The First Couple of Levels
----------------------------------

o   Western Europe. Before starting the mission, set your research boys
    looking into Automatics. Take in two agents with Pistols. Leave one
    of the agents at the start zone and move the other towards the base
    entrance. He should be approached by two guards, one from the West
    and one from the South. As long as his Intelligence and Perception
    are high then he should deal with them himself. The building to the
    North of the courtyard (top left of the screen) also houses a guard.
    Be aware of him as you move towards the target building to the North
    West. As you approach the building, the target will attemp to leave
    in the ground car. When he opens the door then blow him away. If he
    makes it to the car then shoot the car as well.

    There is also an Uzi up for grabs which will come in handy for the
    Research Team. It is currently being used by a guard on the South
    entrance to the base. Drive up to him in the car, park next to him
    and shoot him in the head. The Uzi is then yours for the taking.

o   Scandinavia. Take in two agents. Only use the second agent if the
    first is lost. Equip them with Persuadertrons and Pistols. If you
    have the Uzi then bring that too. Head straight for the first
    target, West of the city. Select your Persuadertron on for the
    journey, as when you arrive you may be able to pick up a couple of
    unlucky civvies on the way.

    You should now be facing a small building at the top of a large
    area if steps. There are three guards here; one has a Pistol, one
    a Shotgun and one an Uzi. If you have only got Shotguns then you
    will get hammered going up the steps. Try another way. If you have
    Pistols or Uzis, go for high Intelligence and Perception before
    going up the steps. Once you have disposed of the guards and robbed
    them of their weapons head inside and <Persuade> the target. To do
    this, select the Persuadertron, and click the pointer on the South
    East corner of the building (pointer be a crosshair first). Once
    he is taken, head towards the second target leaving the 
    Persuadertron on and finally the drop zone.
