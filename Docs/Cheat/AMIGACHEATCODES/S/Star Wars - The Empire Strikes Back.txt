Empire Strikes Back, The


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the title screen hold down the [Help] key and type 'XIFARGROTCEV'
 (VECTORGRAFIX backwards). This enables the following in game keys:

 [C] - Shows a picture of C3P0.
 [D] - Shows a picture of Darth Vader.
 [L] - Shows a picture of Luke.

 Pressing the numbered keys will also play the various pieces of
 sampled speech while the [Return] key will turn off the cheat.
 Surely there must be more to this cheat than just this?
