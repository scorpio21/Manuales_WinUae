                                What to do

TISRON: Take the guided mine in the third screen from the right (to get it
you must go through trade).

ERINA: Place the mine in front of the big droid - after the explosion,
pick up the fallen circuit, which now has to be placed in the centre of
the drive circuit - a new system will appear on the card.

SKEVIS: Pick up the magnetic card, it contains the Cassandra access code
in Centaurian.

SKAVER: Go to see the magician.

XYLOGNA: Kill the thief who stole the spell (alien), then go back to
skaver to return the spell to the magician.  To thank you, he will teach
you his psychic powers which will be essential to you on Cassandra.

ENDROMA: Recover the XMT-03BK gun, the destroyer of Cephalhydras.

CASSANDRA: Thanks to the two magnetic cards, you will be able to find the
following access  code: Sigmund.  Here you need to eliminate the
Cephalhydras with the XMT-03BK.

                                 General

OUT OF FUEL: Send an SOS message and wait for help - the cost will be
deducted automatically.

ALIEN INTRUSION: Go to the circuitry rooms to kill them - be careful, each
time the bell rings another alien reproduces itself.

TRADE: Rarer commodities are traded between planets of differant types
(for example grain or water in the desert, metals in town).  Starblade
stocks can be used to transport goods in large quantities.
