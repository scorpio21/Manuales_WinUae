Super Hang-On


 CHEAT MODE:

 To activate the cheat mode you must beat the highest score on the
 current continent highscore table, Africa is fairly easy.
 Enter '750J' on the highscore table and press the fire button, it
 should now change to '....'. The cheat mode is now enabled.
 To get into the cheat alteration menu hold down [Ctrl], left [Alt],
 [Z] and [T] while the credits screen changes to the options screen.
 If all goes well the screen will turn black and it is at this point
 when you should release all of the keys. You will now be asked to
 enter new values for the outer and inner road turn effect coefficients
 using the numeric keypad, just repeat the same numbers that are on the
 screen or if you want an easy ride change them to 00 and 00.
 Now when playing simply hold the left [Amiga] key and you will be able
 to fire a machine gun which will destroy all other bikes and road side
 obstacles.
