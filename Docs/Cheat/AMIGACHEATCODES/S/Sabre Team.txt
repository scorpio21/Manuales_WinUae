 During the game click on the blue print icon. On the right there are
 the faces of the four men you picked to play the game. Simply imagine
 they have been numbered 1 to 4 from top to bottom, then click on them
 in this order: 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3.
 Now return to the game by clicking on the top left arrow.
 You will now have unlimited action moves for each player and you can
 skip to the appropriate level by pressing [1] to [5].
 Once you have skipped or completed a level you will have to repeat
