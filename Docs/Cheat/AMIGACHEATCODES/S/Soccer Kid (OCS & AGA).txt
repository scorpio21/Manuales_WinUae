Soccer Kid


 TIPS:

 Unfortunately there is no cheat mode for this game. There is however
 some very handy special icons to be found in the trees during play.
 On various levels in the game (not too sure which) stand directly
 under the trees and kick the ball straight up the tree trunk.
 If there is a special icon to be found in that tree you will notice
 it flash slightly. You must kick the ball up the tree and hit the
 hidden icon four times and you will then receive an extra 4000 points.
 If you now repeat this process again and hit the icon another four
 times you will uncover what special icon was in that tree.
 These icons vary from invincibility to speed boots, just collect
 them and away you go.
