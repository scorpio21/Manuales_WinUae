Shadow Fighter


 CHEAT MODE:

 To automaticlly win the round, pause the game and type 'EBBRAVOSCECCU'.
 Now unpause the game and the fight will finish with you as the winner.

 For infinite credits, type 'TEREAKKU' on the character selection screen.

 These next two cheats only work during a non championship fight.
 If you want to fight as PoPazz, then on the character selection screen,
 type 'PARAPONZIPOPO' and press the [Esc] key.

 Or if you want to fight as Shadow Fighter, then follow the above method,
 but type in 'MBARIVIDSOCCAFFARIMBARI' instead.
