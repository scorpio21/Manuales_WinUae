Skeleton Krew - AGA


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the title screen, type in 'I WOULD RATHER BE WATCHING FOREST' and
 press the [Spacebar]. The bottom part of the screen will now change
 to "CHEAT MODE ACTIVE ALL". Now highlighting Options with the joystick
 and moving it left and right means you will be able to select and jump
 straight to any of the various levels within the game.
 Also during play, pressing [F1] to [F4] will change the control method.
 The full stop key will skip the current level and pressing [Enter] on
 the keypad will give you nine lives.

 Also try typing in 'BLOOD AND GORE' and again hit the [Spacebar].
 The bottom part of the screen will now read "CHEAT MODE ACTIVE ??3".
 What effects this exactly has on the game I'm not too sure.

 And just for fun, on the title screen type in 'LOTTERY'.
 The computer will now randomly generate some lottery numbers.
