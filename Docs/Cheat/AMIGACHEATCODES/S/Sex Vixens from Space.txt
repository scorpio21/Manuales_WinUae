                     CORRECT SOLUTION TO SEX VIXENS

                       SOLUTION WORKED OUT AND DOC
                        TYPED IN BY THE LICKER!!
                                   
                         
The solution to this game requires both mouse control and/or text 
input.  I will try and make this Doc as easy as possible to 
understand!
After booting the game up, you are confronted with the control 
panel or Captain's Bridge, and below this is a text viewing area 
and Icon panel in the far right bottom corner.
The first thing you must do is sit down, (once the on board 
computer says WHAT NOW?).  To do this, click on the 'D' icon in 
the far right hand bottom corner (with the mouse).  The next step 
is to blast off.  To do this, you must click on the left hand 
throttle handle in the middle of the screen (keep clicking on it 
until the computer tells you that you have blasted off!).
From now on, all mouse movements will be in lower case, and text 
inputs in UPPER CASE, O.K.?  
Now, stand up (remember, use the mouse for lower case), south, 
south, south, open air lock (air lock button is the red button 
underneath the green air lock sign), south, east, up, GET CARD, 
INSERT CARD, north, north, pick up coin (with mouse), GET CARD, 
give card to robot (with mouse), west, GET CARD, INSERT CARD, 
east, GET COIN, INSERT COIN, west (turn on computer with mouse), 
GET LILA, KISS LILA, LIE DOWN, MAKE LOVE, ASK LILA, west, south, 
south, up, north, north, down, blast off (with mouse), up, south, 
south, south, open air lock (with mouse), south, open air lock 
(with mouse), west, west, EAT FOOD, east, east, south, GET CAPSULE,
give capsule to captain (with mouse), down, blast off (with mouse 
click on left hand throttle), up, south, south, south, open air lock 
(with mouse), south, east, west, REMOVE CLOTHES, KISS HER, LIE           
DOWN, MAKE LOVE, ASK HER, east, turn on ray gun (with mouse), 
then click on the red unmarked button on the right hand side,
west, west, east, LIE DOWN, KISS HER, MAKE LOVE, ASK HER, east,
RIDE, up, down, blast off (with mouse).
 

THE END.
