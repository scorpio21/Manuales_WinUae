 policeman but the target is a normal citizen. Move all your agents into
 the house and kill enemies as they enter. Wait until they are all dead

 building because all guards fire guns at you. Kill all guards, persuade

 PARAGUAY - Protect
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The path that the man takes is; east, south before the eastern most
 building, west at the fence and stop beside the female citizen.
 Continue west stopping at another female and, upon reaching the pillar,
 north, past the house at the first ending of road, and then west between
 the first two houses. The mission then ends. There are 56 enemy agents.

 PARAGUAY - Recon Sweep
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 There are three methods to do this mission as you are told in the
 emergency update that all you need to do is evacuate. Each method only
 requires one agent to be sent in.

 First Method:-
 Give your agent a persuadatron. At the start, persuade two citizens and
 two policemen. Then go into the house and as the enemy agents run into
 the house they are persuaded. Once all the enemy agents are persuaded go
 north and kill the policeman. Get on the monorail and go east to the pick
 up point. This method can be used if you are low on agents as it is the
 easiest mission to persuade the enemy.

 Second Method:-
 Put your agent inside the house and kill the agents as they run in the
 door. Follow the directions as in the first method, once all agents have
 been eliminated.

 Third Method:-
 This is probably the hardest one. Go north along the street, on the
 monorail and east to the pick-up point only pausing to kill agents which
 catch up with you as you run.

 ROCKIES - Escort
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Park your car in front of the targets car. Get out and move two agents
 south and two south at the street west of the first street. kill the
 onrushing agents. Leave one agent beside the target to protect her.
 Move the other three west, slowly taking out everything, making sure you
 send atleast one agent to take out the roadblock. Lots of agents gather
 in the far north west so you can kill them all with one laser shot.
 All the agents to the extreme west and south west put up no resistance.
 Once all enemy agents are dead, move your car out of the targets way and
 let her do her job.

 SOUTHERN STATES - Data Acquisition
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Get to the target as soon as you can, killing as many enemy agents as
 possible. Go south to the T-junction, west to the crossroads and then
 follow the road south until you are outside the target building.
 Move about outside the house until all the agents come out and you can
 kill them. Once they are dead, persuade the target. Go west to the
 T-junction then north killing the agents (who put up no resistance).
 Fire gauss guns at the doors where the guards are and they should get
 caught by the blast. Get the access card, go back to the start to be
 picked up. Make sure you protect the informer after persuasion because
 he walks slower than your agents. There are 28 enemy agents.

 URUGUAY - Equipment Grab
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Give each agent five lasers, two gauss guns and a shield, except one
 agent who gets a scanner and a mini gun instead of the gauss guns.
 Swap a gauss gun for a persuadatron for another agent. Move two men east
 to the edge of the city. Move two men east, one persuading all the people
 and following the road until they reach the junctions.

 Move the two agents to the west to the north and just inside the complex.
 Kill the agents on the ground with lasers and the three guards with a
 mini-gun. Get the medikit and kill the remaining agents on the platform.
 Stay inside the complex until no more agents attack you. Move the agents
 that went east to the north east complex, and kill all exposed guards.
 Move all agents into the north east complex and place them on the ramps.

 Use the agent. Turn on the shield on the platform. If your energy gets
 to about half, turn on your shield and go back to the rest of the squad.
 Use an agent who has full energy and do this repeatedly until all guards
 on the platform are dead. Now use the agent with the persuadatron.
 Turn on his shield and rush up to the group of guards round the target.
 Use one agent to clear a path to the pickup point and stick close to the
 wall but no so close that a blast of a gauss gun gets you if it misses.
 The enemy fire about six gauss gun shots at once, so you die if you get
 caught by them. There are at least 48 enemy agents.

 VENEZUELA - Combat Sweep
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Set your men up so you can see in all directions but you can only be
 attacked from two - for example at the T-junction west of the start.
 Position your men in a square and kill all the enemy agents as they
 rush at you. There will be a long wait before the final agent comes
 to meet his doom. There are 56 enemy agents.

 YUKON - Escort CIV
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Move all of your agents to the other side of the street. Send one agent
 round the north edge of the building and one round the south side of the
 building. Move the other two south. If you have done this correctly then
 the CIV will not move. Position the agent who went round the south side
 of the building directly across from the alley. Kill the oncoming agents
 with the two agents that went south. Once they have been killed, use
 these two agents to sweep the streets, ridding them of all filth and the
 police. Once all enemy agents are dead, move one of your agents near to
 the CIV and he will start his movement. The CIV will not be attacked by
 the police but there is more fun wasting them.
 There are at least 39 enemy agents.
