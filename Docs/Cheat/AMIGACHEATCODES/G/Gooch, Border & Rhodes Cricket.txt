 TIPS/CHEAT:

 When batting, to get a lot of runs press [P] when the fielder picks
 up the ball to pause the game. The fielder will be frozen, but your
 batsmen won't. Simply waggle the joystick and your batters will run.
 You can now chalk up a high score. When you've had enough simply press
 [P] again to unpause the game.

 You can also press the [Spacebar] twice while your bowler is running
 to start your bowl again.


 TIPS:

 Don't always bowl at the fastest possible speed, a slower ball may fool
 the batsman.
 Right-handed computer batsmen seem to be weaker on the off-side.
 The straight-drive can be the most effective stroke, but make sure you
 don't edge the ball to the slips.
 Don't forget to vary the position of the wicket-keeper to suit the speed
 of the bowler.
 If you find that you are a dab hand at bowling but your batting leaves a
 lot to be desired, or vice-versa, then maybe it never occurred to you
 that you can save the game and alter the skill level for each innings.
 You can also try picking a leg or off spinner when it's your turn to bowl,
 then place the box as close to the bowler as possible and inline with the
 wickets. Now, if you bowl with no spin, the ball will bounce over the
 batsman's bat and hit the wickets!

 Note: If you've never seen it rain, check out the name of the main file
 on the program disk. It should be something like: '130593.AG' - if you've
 got an earlier date, return your disk to Audiogenic for a free update.
