 CHEAT MODE:

 Whilst playing simply press [I] to skip to the bonus level and then
 press [U] on the bonus level to go to the next level. Hold [F5] for a
 couple of seconds and you will become indestructable. Pressing [F2],
 [F5], [F4], and [F3] one at a time for infinite everything.

 Or

 Type 'EASYMODE' on the high-score table.  From now on, <F9> skips levels and
 makes you invulnerable. <F8> turns off the cheat mode.

 Or

 Start a one player game and crash into the first building. Now hold down the
 <F5> key until the status screen appears. You should now be able to fly
 unscathed through everything.
