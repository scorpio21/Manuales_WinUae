GALDREGONS DOMAIN/DEATH BRINGER

The secret to completing the game is to find five objects,
which allow you to kill the guardians of the five gems, keep your
strength and stamina high, so only enter combat if forced to. Keep
your characteristics on display at all times - objects are just lying
around, so this is the only way to spot them:

 GEM 1:  This is guarded by a lich in Rotari's castle. You need to get
 the cross frome the deamonmaster's tower to kill him.

 GEM 2:  This is in the caves of doom and is guarded by a rock monster.
 Kill characters in the cave until you find a diamond. Then kill the
 rock monster.

 GEM 3:  In the catacombs below the temple of Set. It's guarded by a
 deamon which can only be killed while you carry a ceremonial dagger.
 Kill priests in the large room in the east of the temple to find the
 dagger and a key to unlock the demons chamber.

 GEM 4:  At the SW corner of the map is a hidded labyrinth. Enter, and
 kill Minotaurs until you find a key and a mirror. Find the Medusa,
 kill her to get the gemstone.

 GEM 5:  Go to the forest of the Elves in the West. Kill the Elf lord,
 and take his Elven cloak. Go to the Assasins forest in the SE, find
 the leader and kill him and get the gem.
         Now return all five gems to the king.
