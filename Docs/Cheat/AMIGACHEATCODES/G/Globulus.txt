 TIPS:

 The most important thing to remember is that all the puzzles can be
 solved without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think it's
 the only way to solve the screen, look closely. Some of the puzzles
 get pretty obscure after level 10, but once you eventually beat them
 you'll kick yourself for not seeing the solution earlier.
 Look before you leap. Think about how the screen will look from a
 flipped perspective. A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary
 and waste time and switches if you don't. Make sure you have enough
 switches, at least 10 per screen. It is possible to get stuck on a
 downward slope with no way to get back up or kill yourself, and the
 only way out is to press [Esc] and start the whole game over.
