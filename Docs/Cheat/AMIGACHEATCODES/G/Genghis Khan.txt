Genghis Khan

If you get a land that isn't connected with an enemy, move everything
to your home country.  The land will be safe, but if another leader
captures a nearby land, make sure you put something back in or he will
attack on his next turn.  Don't move all your forces into your command
unit, or an enemy commander will wait till he is down to his last few
men and challenge you to a one on one fight.  If you lose, he will get
half your command unit.
