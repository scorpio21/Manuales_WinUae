Grand Monster Slam


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the main option screen, type "Losers.help!" to activate the cheat.
 The screen will flash and the message 'YOU CANNOT LOSE!' will appear
 in the upper left corner.  Now even if you do lose you win!  That's
 'SHIFT' + 'L' at the beginning and 'SHIFT' + '1' at the end and the
 '.' is on the main keyboard.

 On the main options screen, type "professional" and the message
 'Professional Mode!' will appear in the upper left corner.  This
 allows you to start in the professional league.

 If you make a mistake typing select the 4th option 'Hall of Fame' and
 press fire to get back to the main options screen.  You will now be
 able to re-enter the cheat.

 NOTE:  Only one can be active at a time.
