DEFENDER OF THE CROWN
---------------------

Anytime after the character selection screen, press the "K" key for 1,024 knights in your army and castle.
You can do this as often as you like, just remember that both your Home Army and Campaign Army 
will be reset to 1024 Knights.
This only works in the Eu version and not the US.

If you begin the game at the lowest castle, move all your men in your
army and take the 3 high vassal/income territories below. This will
give you a lot of men in your army. Move back to your castle ad you
will also be able to buy lots of men.

When sword fighting move forward, backward, strike, and repeat, you
should beat your opponents with no problems.

Move your lance until it is just left of your opponents shield, then
down a little. Count the number of bounces and on the 5th strike at
the lowest possible point.
