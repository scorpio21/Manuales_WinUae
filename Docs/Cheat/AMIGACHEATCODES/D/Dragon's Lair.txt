                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~         By: Skylark / Canada

Dsk1 Screen 1 (Opening Bridge-This will always be first!)
     ~~~~~~~~
     Watch Dirk The Daring walk across bridge until he falls through.
     When the "Things" come toward you, hit the BUTTON and watch Dirk take
     a swipe at them.  Then, hit UP and you will raise yourself up to the
     bridge again, and run into the castle.

     Screen 2  (DrinkMe Sign-This will always be second!)
     ~~~~~~~~
     This one is a tuffy!  When the "DrinkMe" sign flashes, hit RIGHT; Dirk
     The Daring will bravely kick the door open to the right of him and
     stomp out.

     -Screen 1 Repeats, laterally inverted!-

Dsk2 Screen 3  (The Falling StairWell-This may come after Screen 4....)
     ~~~~~~~~

     You will either be walking left or right down the stairwell.  If you
     are moving left, when the stairs ahead of you flash, hit LEFT.  If

     you are going right, hit RIGHT.  You will jump over the hole in bridge
     and continue... Do not mind the bats, they are there for decoration!!

     Screen 4  (The Tentacles-This may come before Screen 3....)
     ~~~~~~~~
     As soon as the tentacle drops from the ceiling, hit BUTTON!  Dirk will
     then slash it.  As soon as you slash it, hit UP.  You will go to the
     front of the room.  Then hit RIGHT or LEFT (depending on where the door
     is), and you will go to the door.  Then hit DOWN and you will goto the
     back and automatically start going up the stairs, at this point, hit
     LEFT or RIGHT (depending on where the little table is.)  As soon as you
     get on the table, hit UP and you will go out the door in a few seconds.
     WARNING: IF YOU HIT MORE THAN ONE MOVE YOU WILL DIE!  Just hit the move
     once and wait for it to take affect!!

     -Screen 3 and 4 will repeat again laterally inverted!-

Dsk3 Screen 5  (Ye WhirlPools/Ye Rapids-This may come after Screen 6...)
     ~~~~~~~~
     You will start off with the Ye Whirlpools.  If the whirlpool is on the

     right, hit LEFT; if on the left, hit RIGHT.  You will easily use your
     manouvering abilities to steer carefully around them.  NOTE: Don't
     hit left or right more than once, or you will be sucked in!  Then come
     the Ye Rapids.  Now on my A2000, all you do is hit LEFT or RIGHT
     (depending on the direction of the light blue path), then when I get
     into the middle, I hit UP and go all the way down (Both Screens..)
     But I've heard other stories and this is what I've been able to piece
     together... If you have an A500 (hahahaha): Do what I do (above), but
     the second screen, hit UP one more time.  If you have an A1000, do
     what I do, then on the second screen, hit up twice. (Once on each of
     the two levels).  Experiment.. One of these techniques is sure to work
     but I can only confirm my way.

     Screen 6  (Slime Stew-This may come before Screen 5...)
     ~~~~~~~~
     On this screen, you mainly watch... You will dodge the slime, then
     pick up a drink automatically.  Then, the Slime Goon will appear, hit
     BUTTON and you will slice him.  Just watch the rest of the board.

     - Screen 5 & 6 will appear again laterally inverted! -

Dsk4 Screen 7  (The Black Knight-This may come after Screen 8...)
     ~~~~~~~~
     First, make note of what side the Black Knight's sword is on.  If it is
     on the left, you will have to hit RIGHT first.  You then jump right.
     Right after this, hit LEFT... Then UP... Then LEFT... Then RIGHT...
     Then Left... As jumping left now in mid-air hit RIGHT because you don't
     have anytime to spare once you land.  (Remember, better early than
     never!)  If it is reversed, just do the above backwards.  This is one
     of the "Most-Moves" boards so eventually you'll get the hang of it.

     Screen 8 (Marble Madness-This may come before Screen 7...)
     ~~~~~~~~
     You will appear in the distance walking casually at the end of the
     half-pipe.  Then, a huge black ball will appear behind you wanting to
     make Autie-Em's World Famous Pancakes out of you.  The screen will
     change angles and you will see a coloured ball go by.  As soon as it
     goes by, hit DOWN.  Then, another coloured ball will go by; again, as
     soon as it passes, hit DOWN.  This is all you do, there will be a few
     more balls to get by, but if you can do one, the rest is really simple!
     WARNING: DON'T HIT DOWN MORE THAN ONCE PER BALL!  When you run by
     successfully, it looks really close... It is supposed too!

     - Screen 7 & 8 will repeat again laterally inverted! -

Dsk5 Screen 9  (The Bedroom Wall-This will come first!)
     ~~~~~~~~
     Pretty simple.  Just keep hitting UP at a leisurely pace and you will
     get through, listen for when the game records your specific up moves
     and when you get better, you won't have to hit up rapidly... But I
     still do anyway because it guarantees me getting through.

     - This screen will repeat again laterally inverted! -

     Screen 10  (Dragon's Lair Part I-Computer Randomly Chooses Which
     ~~~~~~~~~                        Lateral Screen You Will Do.)

     You will see a wobling bunch of "furniture".  Hit LEFT or RIGHT
     (depending on where it is...)  Then it will flash to the Dragon who
     starts to wake up and Princess Daphne (or something) says "Oh, save
     me!"  Then it will flash back to you - hit RIGHT or LEFT (the opposite
     direction of the furniture), then DOWN.  You will go onto another
     screen with more furniture.  This time, hit DOWN to catch it.  Then you
     will see the Princess moving around in the bubble saying, "Use the
     Magic Sword!".. As she is saying this, hit the BUTTON and then when
     she stops yapping, you will see the magic sword in a rock.

Dsk6 Screen 11  (Dragon's Lair Part II-Computer Randomly Chooses Which
     ~~~~~~~~~                         Lateral Screen You Will Do.)

     You will be behind a tree... Hit down to duck Singe The Dragon's mighty
     claws.  * MAKE NOTE OF WHERE THE DRAGON'S HEAD WAS! *  After ducking,
     go in the direction Singe's head was.  Then, you will automatically
     rip the magic sword out of the rock...  Then, you get another screen
     showing you and the Dragon waving his tail.  Hit DOWN to dodge, and
     while you dodge it, on the way down, take note of the timing at which
     your sword glows.  Right after you dodge the tail for the first time,
     Singe will try again, just hit DOWN again.  Again, make note of the
     timing.  After you dodge it for the second time, Singe will try yet
     another time to get you... This time, hit DOWN (like usual), but this
     time when the sword glows (or a touch earlier), hit the button and you
     will whip the sword into the dragon.

                           T H E     *     E N D

NOTE: NEVER, IF UNSURE, HIT EXTRA MOVEMENTS AS THEY USUALLY TURN INTO
      UNPLEASANT DEATHS!!!!!

   I hope this helps all you's that can't finish Dragon's Lair yet, but this
has been a bitch to explain in words...
