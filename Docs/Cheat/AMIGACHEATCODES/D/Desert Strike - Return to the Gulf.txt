 PLAYING TIPS:

 Campaign 2
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 Mission 2:
 Some buildings near the jails have MIAs inside signalling you with
 mirrors from the windows. Destroy these buildings carefully with your
 cannon and collect the men.

 Mission 3:
 The best way to get SCUDs is by collecting the SCUD commanders and then
 the SCUD launchers.

 Mission 6:
 Shoot the watch towers so that the APHIDs fall to the ground, then shoot
 a hut, collect a full load of POWs and drop them off at the nearest
 landing zone. Then repeat the process, always keeping a look out for ZSUs.

 General tips:
 There is a quick ladder in a building in the road diamond nearest the
 furthest north landing zone. A F-15 is parked in the northeast corner
 where you will find co-pilot Jake and an extra life.

 Campaign 3
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 Mission 1:
 Enter the main city and use a couple of Hydras on the two APHIDs
 attacking the UN boys, and kill the ZSU. Then pick them up and drop
 them off.

 Mission 3:
 Destroy all the silos quickly before the missiles are released.
 Then destroy the dunes around them for extra supplies and a life.

 Mission 4:
 Destroy each boat (but not the friendly ones) with six Hydras.

 Mission 6:
 Destroy the defences and then let loose on the Madman's yacht until
 there is a hole and then pick up a full load of MIAs before they drown.

 Mission 7:
 Destroy the defences and all the buildings surronding the one with a
 flag outside. This one contains the chap you are after.

 Mission 8:
 Enter the Embassy City from the west to replenish your fuel and ammo from
 the buildings you destroy. Take out all the defences, keeping an eye out
 for three helicopters. Then land on the 'X'. Kill the fresh defences that
 have arrived on the scene, including the two helicopters. Once everyone
 is on the bus, destroy the gate carefully with your cannon and guide the
 bus to safety. When you reach the SEAL post, don't forget to pick up your
 co-pilot (who was driving the bus).

 Campaign 4
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 Mission 4:
 The dump trucks are in the city at the bottom right of the map. Take out
 the defences, and then the trucks with the bomb parts in them (look in
 the back when they are driving up the screen). Watch out for the decoys.

 Mission 5:
 The radar sites must be taken out first. One is immediately south of the
 factory, the other is just to the northeast of the nearby landing zone.

 Mission 7:
 Shoot all of the small buildings after getting rid of the defences.
 Collect the extra life, destroy the building and land on the X.

 Mission 8:
 Fill up on ammo and fuel then fly towards the bomber and take out the
 defences. Next, shoot the wing and collect your co-pilot, then really
 let rip with your ammo and shoot the hell out of the bomber - it'll take
 about three crates of ammo to finish him.
