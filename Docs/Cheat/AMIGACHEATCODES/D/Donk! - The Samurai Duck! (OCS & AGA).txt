 CHEAT MODE:

 At the end of the level, when the screen turns red and you're making
 your way to the exit, type in 'ABLE TO CHEAT'. You will hear a small
 sound from the game which tells you that the cheat mode is activated.
 This enables these in-game keys:

 [F1] - Extra shield.
 [F2] - Extra Bomb.
 [F3] - Extra Jump.
 [F4] - Extra floats.
