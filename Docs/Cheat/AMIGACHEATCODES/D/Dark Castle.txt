Dark Castle
-----------

The first thing you do is to go to the shield room. Once there press (W) up
and (S) down. Keep them both pressed. This will cause your hero to go up and
down between the two screens. After half an hour or so you will have about 25
lives, this is the only screen you can do it on.
