			ALL THE GAME SECRETS!

This is for the Current V2.5. It seems like updates may now become very slow
as Edgar works on his next Donkey Kong game. I would like to thank Edgar for
this great game, I hope he reads this one day & I hope he doesn't get annoyed
that I have released this. Oh my previous high score was 12 Million, then after
reading all these and using them to my advantage, my new high score is 97
million. If anyone has got a higher score than this, please Mail me at any of
the addresses at the bottom of this text file. Onto the text!
If a new version gets released & new secrets added, this file WILL be updated
and available at my BBS for Download.

 1 - Catching a skull will add to the chances that extra life and cash
     multiplyer bonuses appear.

 2 - By shooting the hurry-up ship, you can collect the rank marking that you
     are missing.

 3 - When a smart bomb have exploded and the gems are falling. You can collect
     them by holding down the joystick.
 
 4 - If you have a multiply when entering the meteor-storm, you may get alot of
     points.

 5 - Catching a warp icon in an alien stage with a bonus level will give you a
     perfect score.

 6 - Red, Green and Blue skulls will give you a very good weapon. Full fire
     power and the best ship speed.

 7 - When a hurry-up ship have appeared 8 times. A money ship will appear.
     Shooting this ship can give you alot of money.

 8 - If you have a weapon type, and catch the same weapon, you will get more
     firepower.

 9 - Completing the Meteor-storm will give you 100,000 points and 1,000 in
     cash. And if you ... hmm. He He..

10 - You can figure out what skull you have not taken by looking at the colour
     of the meteors in the meteor storm.

11 - If you have caught 2 aliens and the scope is active. You can get alot of
     points by the aliens off the screen.

12 - If you have the rank of Admiral and you buy more rank markings, you will
     get 1,000,000.
 
13 - Having a multiply active when completing the game will give you alot of
     points.

14 - If you have all the rank markings for a new rank, and then buy more rank
     markings, you will instead buy a new rank.
 
P.S. to Edgar. Active has an E on the end :) :)

P.P.S to anyone. Game Secret 13 seems to be impossible, you would have to get
the bonus multipler on level 74 (Bonus Level) and keep it during the whole
level, and the kill the level 75 beastie in record time. And that would have
to be quick, though i did notice muliplyers do stay longer as each round of
75 starts again...

P.P.P.S. What is the extra bit on Secret 9...got me wondering.
