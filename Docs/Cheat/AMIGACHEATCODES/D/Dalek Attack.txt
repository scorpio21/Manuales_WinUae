 PLAYING TIPS:

 If you're having trouble getting to the city from the caves, here's how
 you do it. After you've destroyed the tunnelling machine and survived
 your encounter with the super Dalek, go through the door he was guarding.
 You will then find yourself in a small room with no apparent exits.
 Use your grenades to destroy the floor section and you will soon find
 yourself on your way to the city.
