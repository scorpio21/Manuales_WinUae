                               INTRODUCTION
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~

  It wasn't always like this. There was a time when the skies of Oceana
weren't the color of lead, and when the air didn't smell like meat. Our world
has become a waking nightmare since Namtar rose from the pit. Some of the
young ones have never experienced a world without war. And this is jus the
start of what Namtar has planned for us.

  Here and there you'll find people holding out against the dark, but don't
expect them to pitch in on your side just because your campaigning against
Namtar. These are desperate days, and even honest folf won't hesitate to take
you on if you look like an easy mark.

  Collected in this book of lore you'll find maps and descriptions of all
the major areas of Dilmun, the Land Where the Sun Sets. I've assigned the
report of each earea to someone intimately associated with that region. You
may meet several of my correspondents in your travels. I take no responsibility
for the accuracy of the information. Note also I have room only to describe the
most prominent features of the areas you will visit--even armed with the 
knowledge this books provides, you will still encounter many surprises as you
explore Dilmun. You have been warned.

                         A BRIEF HISTORY OF DILMUN
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The archipelago collectively referred to as "Dilmun" is composed of nine
large islands and several small atolls. Many of the islands were formerly
dominated by independent city states. The city states previously existed
in a rough balance of power, with no single city able to dominate the
others. All that changed when Namtar rose from the Pit.

  In the beginning, Namtar was a simple wizard to the court of King Drake
of Kingshome. Namtar was not human, but many demi-human creatures existed

                                     4

peacefully with man in those days. Shortly after Namtar arrived at Drake's
court, observers noticed a change in the old King, and things started to 
turn bad.

  The first thing King Drake did was recall his daughter as governor of the
city Purgnati. Drake then ordered the guard tripled in the city, sealed off the
city's gates, and left the people within to rot. In the absence of authority,
Purganti became a living hell....and Purgatory was born.

  Next Drake declared a general ban on Magic. This was followed almost 
immediately by the first appearance of Namtar's new secret police, the
Stosstrupen. The Stosstrupen sacked the City of the Yellow Mud Toad and
destroyed Lanac'toor's school of magic. The great, if eccentric, Lanac'toor
himself was killed in the battle. Simultaneously, Zaton the Displaced, the
master of Druidic magic, mysterously went mad. It is unknown exactly what
deal Mystalvision struck with Namtar, but the Master of Sun Magic continues
to hold court in Phoebus, the City of the Sun.

  Open warfare from Namtar's perfidy. King Drake wasted no time, but went right
for the throat. With the City of the Yellow Mud Toad already in ruins, Drake
unleashed dragons against the peaceful maritime city of Tars, utterly destroying
it. The city of Lansk immediately sued for peace, but only after determining
their dragon was sick and unable to defend the city. The city of Byzanople, 
ruled by Drake's own son, Prince Jordan, was promptly beseiged by the 
Kingshomer army. Phoebus was never touched by war.

  Some of the wild places remain free. In the Eastern Isles, Namtar is but a 
shadow, but the shadow grows longer and darker by the day. Here and there are
scattered those that remain loyal to King Drake, convinced the King is not
responsible for the reign of terror. But resistance is feeble and disorganized.
It seems only a matter of time before Namtar is triumphant.

                                     5

                                 PURGATORY
                                 ~~~~~~~~~
  This used to be a nice place before they sealed off all of the exits
and cut off the food. Now rats rule the streets, and I, Clopin Trouillefou,
am King Rat!

  I know Purgatory like the back of my hand, so you'd do well to listen to
what I say. Your first priority on arriving armored and to get armed. You'll
doubtless have a brawl or two almost immediatley after your arrival, but
you should have little trouble surviving unless you're a total wimp. A good
initial strategy is to strike almost due north from the main city square
and sign up for a battle in the arena. You'll get the snot kicked out of
you but at least you'll score some weapons.

  Magic is forbidden in Dilmun, but no one can stamp out the Art entirely.
You'll find a modest scroll shop due west of the statue of Namtar (a nice
bit of irony, that). The scrolls won't do you any good unless you are 
skilled in Low Magic. If you intend to do any intense spell casting in the
city, you'll want to investigate the southeast corner of town, right behind
the harbor wall. You'll find it refreshing.

  My favorite tavern is in the northeast section of town, not far from the
arena. the place is usually lousy with drunks, but they'll scatter if you
give them a taste of steel. The tavern is good picking for the latest 
rumors, and you even find a fool there interested in joining your quest.
If one of your friends dies, you should do your civic duty abd deliver the
corpse to the city morgue north of the harbor and east of the main city
square. I've heard some have tried to escape the city hidden in a 

                                     7

bag of corpses, but I wouldn't want to try it. Now would I ever consider 
surrendering myself to slavery just to escape the city, but you can take that
way out by visiting the salve market north of the staue of Namtar.

  My own part of town is southwest, and you'll likely stumble on my court if
you wander in my neighborhood. I might have a job for you, if you're a cut
above the common scum I usually deal with. Play your cards right and and you
might even score enough gold to pay the outrageous prices demanded by the
black market. The black market shop is just a few blocks west of the arena.
Not far to the north of my court you'll find a shrine to the Dark Lady,
Irkalla...be sure to pay her your respects before entering the Aspu Waters.

  One last bit of advice. Don't be in such a hurry to leave Purgatory. As
bad as it is inside, it is tougher outside. If you don't belive me, have a
look for yourself. There's a secret door leading behind the wall in the
northwest tower of the city, and a door leading to "freedom" in the southwest
corner of the wall.

Be seeing you.

                                SLAVE CAMP
                                ~~~~~~~~~~  

  You'll probably find the slave camp if you ever escape from Purgatory, 
especially if you do so through the harbor. The camp was founded by escapees
from Purgatory and Mog's slave estate. Why poeple would escape from one
pit and immediately cluster together to form another is beyond me.

  Mostly you'll find shattered nerves here...tread softly and never draw
your weapons. Use your bureaucratic skills to convince the slaves you
mean no harm.

  A wizard lives in the camp, and he'll welcome anyone displaying a bit
of their skill in the art. Healing the sick--or at least trying to--can
be to your benefit. They brew good stew by the campfire. Mostly you can
serve yourself best by keeping your mouth shut and your ears open

                                     9

Get in, get some information, and get out. I visit about once a month, but
things never get interesting. The slaves are mostly losers, aside from an 
old rogue name Louie, whom I'm sure would join your party if given the 
opportunity.

						                       -Clopin

                              GUARDED BRIDGE
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  North of Purgatory, you'll find a bridge connecting the isle of Forlorn
with the Isle of the Sun. You'll need citizenship papers to get past the
guards, and even then expect to get shaken down for some gold in the form
of a toll. You can get citizenship papers by winning a battle in the
Purgatory arena, or by looking in the right place in the Slave Camp. A
complete search of the region near the bridge is worth your time.

						                       -Clopin

                            MOG'S SLAVE ESTATE
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  I am the world's greatest artist. Of this there is no doubt. My works of
art are displayed for the benefit of cretins such as yourself at my slave
estate on the isle of Forlorn. You should come visit, but don't touch 
anything. 
 
  I maintain a large garrison in a wing adjoining my home, so don't think
that you can get away with anything. My finest art is displayed in the 
middle garden. I do not mind telling you this--even should you fight your
way through my guards, you will not have the strength to claim my gold.

  No monsters or beasts are permitted inside my house. Leave your familiars
and summoned pets at the door.

						                          -Mog

                                    11

                                SLAVE MINES
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~

  I'm working on a plan. I think that I know a way out of the mines. I would
never have sold myself into slavery to escape Purgatory if I'd known how
impossible it would prove to get out of these mines.

  I don't have much time. If Mog's guards catch me talking to Outlanders,
they'll flay me alive. I've been in these pits so long that I'm no longer 
afraid of pain, but I don't want to die! (WIMP!)

  There's no way to escape the mines so long as I am bound by Mog's chains.
The guards beat me for sport, and the chains prevent me from reclaiming
my stolen goods. They key to escape is to break the chains, recover my
goods, then play the guards a sharp turn.

  The richest man in the mines is about to die. You'll know him when you
see him--he's the one in the main quarters who still owns a pair of shoes.
I've tried to befriend him but he is unconcious most of the time, and when
he is awake all he does is moan for water. Even if I could find the spring
rumored to exist somewhere in the mines, how could I bring him water? It's
not like the guards provide us with drinking cups. It's not the old man's
shoes I want--it's his laces. I found an old axe handle, and there are
plenty of loose stones lying around....with the laces I could make a
hammer. And with a hammer, I could break my chains!

                                TARS RUINS
                                ~~~~~~~~~~
                          (EAST COAST OF FORLORN)
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Of course my city wasn't always in ruins. Prior to the attack by Namtar's
dragons, this was the proud city of Tars, the greatest maritime center of
the world.

  Little remains of Tars' past glory. You might find something interesting
in the southwest corner of the ruins, where a magic scroll shop formerly
stood. You would likewise be wise to investigate the old hero's house...
you'll know you are near when you find the magic snake that guards his
home, long after the house itself has been destroyed.

  One skilled in tracking should be able to follow the clear trail through
the ruins to the threshold of the undercity. Many looters have doubtless
passed this way, but a few treasures might remain. You will discover the
entrance to the undercity beneath the great slab of stone if one of your
party possess great strength. The ruins below are overrun by monsters,
but important treasures can be found near where your footsteps sound
hollow. You will also find a shaft descending to the Underworld.

  Although the ceiling may sometimes seem about to cave in, you have
nothing to fear. The undercity is also smaller than it appears...at one
point, minor magic may permit you to see your own party as if it stood
at the end of a hall.

                                  PHOEBUS
                                  ~~~~~~~

  Phoebus, City of the Sun, is a city well past its prime. While Phoebus
puts on a bright face, there is little to recommend it as a destination for
adventurers or pilgrims. It is in fact a very dangerous place.

  Ignore the Welcome Waldo. It is a bit of civic folly. Our funds would
have better been invested in restoring the ruined sections of the city. It
is true we were never touched by the war, but peace has not been pleasant
for us. Namtar's Stosstrupen have destroyed several buildings and many of
the public monuments that formerly graced my city.

  The streets in the southwest corner of the city are uninteresting, and
doubly dangerous since a tribe of goblins (of all things!) took up
residence in the city. Thieves squat in several buildings, hoarding their
ill-gotten gains. The big buildings in the center of the city are occupied
by the Stosstrupen, and are not a healthy place to linger. The large
compound in the southeast of the city is controlled by the military, You
can join the army by visiting there, but remember, as a friend of mine used
to say...the army's not just a job-it's a lousy job!

  In the northwest corner of the city you'll find the Icarian Triumph, my
favorite pub. You'll find me there from time to time. The pub is also
frequented by an old collegue of mine named Valar, He is skilled in the
ways of Sun Magic and could prove a valuable addition to your party.

  The north side of the city is dominated by the Temple of the Sun. You
can't miss the Temple-just travel directly north along the main street from
the city gates. While the temple remains an architectural wonder worth
seeing, it has become a perilous place since Mystalvision, the High Priest
of the Temple, was corrupted by Namtar. I am afraid only misery greets
pilgrims who call at the Temple these days.

                                                                  -Berengaria
                                    17

                             PHOEBAN DUNGEONS
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  As is all too common these days, if you visit Phoebus you'll probably
wind up in the dungeons. Do not waste your spells or strength
trying to escape from the magical cell in which you'll be imprisoned.
I will help you when I can. Beating your head against the door will
release frustration and help to pass the time.

  Although the jailor drinks heavily, he will notice anyone moving
through his room that does not take care to hide. The secret tunnel
south of the jailor's room is poorly maintained, and subject to cave-ins
You may need to recover a shovel from the dungeon's armory
before you can successfully travel the tunnel.

  When excavating these dungeons, it was discovered the Temple of
the Sun was built on the foundations of a considerably older druid
shrine. The treasure of this shrine is still guarded by a powerful
supernatural force that will permit passage only to those using the
proper password. The Stosstrupen even now torture a poor druid in
the depths of this dungeon to learn the password. He might respond
to kindness, rather than cruelty. I have also heard the password is
identical to the name of a freelance adventurer who frequents the "Brew's
Brothers" tavern in Freeport.

  Mystalvision resides in the dungeon, but know that even should you defeat
him you will be robbed of victory. There is a dragon here, poorly tended by
a demented hunchback keeper. Angering the dragon could destroy the dungeon
and entire city of Phoebus above-a fitting revenge, perhaps, but cruel to
those few honest poeple who still dwell there.

                                                                -Berengaria

                                    19

                                MYSTIC WOOD
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~

  My woods are a holy place, and so far we have been largely un-
touched by the war. Zaton, the chief Druid of our Temple, is absent
and mad, however, so all is not well. The woods are home to all
manner of beasts, and this is their home, so do not expect to explore
here with impunity. Combat with animals is a regrettable but natural
aspect of the order of things, but you could easily come out on the
poor end of most encounters here...it would not be shameful to run
from such encounters.

  The Temple is sacred to Enkidu, and adventurers may summon the
god to flesh by blowing his horn. One strong in both body and spirit
will most benefit from grappling with the god. Beside the Temple is
the Well to Hell, down which the foolish can climb to the Under-
world.

  In the midst of the forest you'll find an enchanted glad-those
skilled in tracking may follow a trail to the very place. It is also
important you find the shrine to the Old Druid Zaton. Should you
rescue Zaton's soul from the Eastern Isles, return it here for your
reward.

  Just to the east of the glade is a magical pond. The shrine on the island
in the pond cannot be reached by swimming...you must leap across the pond
using a magic item's assistance. The shrine is very old, dating back to the
days of sacrifice. Use a weapon to shed blood on the shrine, and the old
god should awaken.

  Somewhere in the forest you'll find a patch of mushrooms. Do not eat
these, as they drive mortal men mad. The mushrooms are the favorite
delicacy of the abominable Nergal, and you should have them ready if you
would serve him.

                          HEAVILY GUARDED BRIDGE
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The soldiers garrisoning the bridge connecting Lansk with the Isle of
the Sun take craven profits from the war. Travellers are required to
pay outrageous fees in the name of "customs inspections"-in truth,
this is simple highway robbery. At first you'll have no choice but to
pay this fine, but when your party grows strong you'll do well to pay
these finks with steel. It is also possible to outwit these dullards with
high levels of skill.

  The building to the south of the bridge is a barracks filled with sleep-
ing guards. The guard nearest the door sleeps with a valuable My in
his pocMt. A nimble fingered sort will profit from relieving the
soldier of this My, and using it on the strongbox found elsewhere in
the room.

  To the north of the bridge is a customs house occupied by a tiresome
Lansk bureaucrat. The man is a turgid bore, but a regular party guy
compared to the plastic clowns you II meet in Lansk. He means what
he says when he threatens to turn the guards on you. Should you
defeat the guards, be advised the treasure to be had here is still not
without protection.
                                                                    -Clopin

  Everything on ground level in this city is pure ya-ya. Find the
Department of Lubrication, cut through the red tape using your bureaucratic
skills, pay the man at least 500 gold, then join us in the undercity. The
party is just beginning!!

                                                             -a wild woman

                              LANSK UNDERCITY
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Whereas the surface portion of Lansk is staid and conservative, the
Lansk Undercity is a wide-open party town. Nominal city laws re-
quire you keep your weapons sheathed and refrain from violence in
the city streets, but experience has proven this is all but impossible.
Venture into the Lansk Undercity at your own risk, and beware the
wild women!

  The usual range of city services are available here: weapon smiths, ar-
morers, and healers. You will also find the Ministry of EZ Paperwork,
which will provide invaluable documentation for a price, including
tickets for the ferry to King's Isle which regularly departs from the
north docks.

  Strictly off the record, there is a grey market magic shop hidden in
Lansk. It's not too hard to find if you poke around, and the manage-
ment has valuable scrolls as well as dragon stones to sell.

  Visit the statues in the four corners of the Undercity to learn some-
thing of Oceana's religion and history. Strive also to visit the Lansk
dragon. The dragon pen is in the center of the Undercity, and while
it is not normally open to the public, with determination you can gain
entrance. The dragon found within is sick, and needs healing from
spell or item.

  And remember...look out for those wild women!!

                                                                 -Doctor Death
                                WAR BRIDGE
                                ~~~~~~~~~~

  There is little to say about this bridge. The soldiers gaurding it require
a governor's pass of any who would travel to or from war-torn Quag. The
pass is most easily available from the Ministry of EZ Paperwork in the
Lansk Undercity. Or you can jump through a bunch of hoops and get your pass
by dealing with Lansk desk jockeys, but why waste you life in such
pursuits?

  The woman in charge of the Quag Tourist Bureau is mad. Treat her kindly,
and pay no attention to what she says.

                                                               -A. Pismo Clam

                              YELLOW MUD TOAD
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

  The City of the Yellow Mud Toad suffered mightily in the war, and the
squatting inhabitants of this place have done little to repair their
decaying home. Large sections of the city wall have been destroyed,
and the city streets are overrun by swampy horrors.

  The Temple of the Golden Toad has always been a lesser attraction in
Dilmun, and few seem to care that the poorly constructed building is
sinking on its foundations. The priests of the Toad reputedly offer a
pair of magic golden jumping boots to anyone who can shore up the
supports of their Temple. It is a wonder this has not yet
happened...all you need do is locate where the wall surrounding the
Temple leaks mud, stand just outside it, then seal the fissure with a
Create Wall spell. See what good outlawing magic does? Buildings
fall down but no one is allowed to repair them!

  The souvenir shop in the southeast sector is worth a visit, as is the
Cavern Tavern in the northeast corner of the city. The tavern is some-
times frequented by Berengaria, an Acolyte of the Temple of the Sun
in Phoebus. Most of the town garrison has gone mad, but I've heard
of one group that guards a valuable treasure hidden in the walls.

  The City of the Yellow Mud Toad was formerly the site of Lanac'toor's
College of High Magic. All that presently remains of the College is a
ruined statue of Lanac'toor. Legend holds the statue is actually Lanac'toor
turned to stone. The pieces of the statue or scattered in the four corners
of Dilmun-in the Necropolis, the ruins of Tars, Freeport, and along the
shores of the penal colony of Snakepit. Returning the various pieces of the
statue here could prove interesting.

                             LANAC'TOOR'S LAB
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  I've seen the place. It's ain't such hot tuna. For one thing it's in the
City of the Yellow Mud Toad, which is the devil's armpit so far as I'm
concerned.

  I don't think Toor will ever finish the place. It verges on another di-
mension, such that if you wander off too far in one direction you'll
come back again to where you started from another. That's a real
pain in the neck, especially without all the corridors In place yet.

  The best way to get around is to use Soften Stone spells. There's one
place where Toor's uncovered an entrance to the Underworld. Seal-
ing it up with a Create Wall spell will cut down on the available
supply of wandering monsters.

  Toor kept all his valuables in a single room. The way the dimensions
wrap around, you can reach it by heading southwest, northeast,
northwest, or southeast. There's no best way to get there-just pick
a direction and be assertive. You'll get there.

Unless, of course, you run into one of those pockets of water. But
best not to think of that.

  Arr..to you it may be Smuggler's Cove, but I calls her home, and me crew
calls her Pirate's Cove. We don't much care for visitors, and if you find
us on the north coast of Quag, don't expect much hospitality.

  Pieces of eight will soften our salty hearts...bureaucracy is our
language. Offer enough money, and you might score a meal and passage to the

                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  NOW DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA. IRKALLA IS QUEEN BUT I'M
NO CONSORT. SOMETIMES I JUST GET SICK OF THE UNDERWOFLD,
IS ALL. NOBODY THROWS ME OUT. YOU GOT THAT? I JUST GET
SICK OF IT.

  I HAVE A LITTLE SUMMER PLACE CALLED THE NECROPOLIS. IT'S
FULL OF DEAD GUYS AND GOOD FOR A FEW LAUGHS: A PAIR OF
GRIM GUARDIANS PROTECT THE ENTRANCE TO MY PALACE. GO
AHEAD AND KILL THEM--THEY'RE USED TO IT.

  MY BACKYARD IS FULL OF CORPSES. THEY'RE ALL WAITING TO
SEE ME, BUT I'M A BUSY MAN. THEY'LL BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN
YOU. IF YOU'RE VERY LUCKY YOU MIGHT FIND THE SECRET EN-
TRANCE TO MY PALACE, BUT YOU'LL PROBABLY BE DEAD BY
THEN. AND THEN YOU WON'T CARE SO MUCH.

  I KEEP MEANING TO CLEAN OUT THE EASTERN GUESTHOUSE OF
MY PALACE. THE PLACE IS FULL OF SPIDER WEBS. I SUPPOSE I
SHOULD JUST BURN OUT THE SPIDERS, BUT THAT SEEMS CRUEL.
THERE USED TO BE A TELEPORTATION PORTAL BUILT INTO THE
GUEST HOUSE, BUT I HAVEN'T USED IT IN AGES. THERE'S ALSO
AN UNDERWORLD ENTRANCE ON MY PROPERTY, BUT IT JUST GOES
DOWN TO THE WELL OF SOULS, WHICH IS A REALLY DULL PLACE
UNLESS YOU WANT TO BRING SOMEONE BACK FROM THE DEAD. YOU
HAD BEST BE VERSED IN ARCANE LORE IF YOU WISH TO TRY.

  DON'T DARE TO FACE ME WITHOUT A STRONG RIGHT ARM, A
STRONGER STOMACH, AND PLENTY OF MUSHROOMS.

MIGHT BE THE KEY TO YOUR ADVENTURE.

                                 ~~~~~~~~

  There was a time when this dock was very busy indeed, before Namtar and
the war. Not only was this the single port connecting Lansk with King's
Isle, it was also the primary point of departure for Nisir, the Mountain of
Salvation.

  Now traffic has slowed to a crawl. Passage is offered to Lansk but the fare
is necessarily high. In honor of the old traditions, properly attired pilgrims
are still offered free passage to Nisir.

                        BRIDGE OF EXILES & SNAKEPIT
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Previously a leper colony, the spit of land on the western end of King's Isle
is known as the Isle of the Damned on some charts, but now known far and
wide as the site of Snakepit, Namtar's penal colony for the criminally
insane. The isle is reached by bridge from the mainland. The bridge
permits traffic in one direction only. Those who cross over to Snakepit do
not return by the same route.

  Namtar has lately exiled many who disagree with him to Snakepit, so a few
bits of wisdom might be found amid the madness. The central cluster of
the village's huts conceals a secret chamber, within which is the private
apartment of the colony's most important member. It is here that the late
King Drake of Kingshome lived out his final days after being sent into exile
by Namtar.

  The western coast of the village is known as Toxic Beach, and while the
inhabitants think of it as a resort, sane folk are unlikely to agree.
Interesting artifacts sometimes was up along the beach.

  There is a patch of fresh pine somewhere in the village, which should
stir something in your sould if there's anything like a druid in you. If
you find an old man sitting out of doors and refusing to go inside, he's
probably on eof the colony's mad druids. Show him fresh pine branches and
do the fellow a kind deed.

  You may first encounter servants of the king here. Remember that in times
of strife, evidence of the King's seal is often enough to convince one you
are on the business of the King. The King is innocent of wrongdoing, and
many good and noble people still serve him.

                                                                   -Josephina

                         DWARF RUINS AND CLANHALL
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  In a desolate part of King's Isle you are likely to find a once-proud
dwarven statue. The statue gazes at a tunnel into rock, but within
the rock no door or crack can be found. The dwarves are enemies of
evil and they have been all but driven from the world by Namtar.
The entrance to the clanhall will remain sealed until the statue is
restored. Somewhere in Dilmun you will find a pair of jade eyes that
will fit the statue. Namtar cast the eyes into the sea, but I hope some
fisherman or pirate will recover them one day.

 Rumor has it a terrible doom overcame my people even before
Namtar rose from the Pit. A hideous monster was supposedly re-
leased from the dwarven mines...a monster that turned my people to
stone. It has been said the proper spell can soften the dwarves
stony hearts, and it has never been more true than now. Should you
gain access to the clanhall, beware the beast that lurks in the dark-
ness.

  Also be advised that dwarves are jealous people, and even should
the clan be indisposed, their treasure will be well hidden and well
guarded. It is best to rescue the dwarves from their fate, rather than
taking advantage of their misery. That way, you will win both the
friendship and the treasures of the dwarves, and avoid thier defenses in
the bargain.

  Sealed behind an unbreachable wall of glass at the heart of the clanhall
you'll find the fires of a magical forge. In former days great treasures
came from this forge, but now the smith is idle. The forge cannot be
reached from the clanhall--you must brave the fires of the Underworld to
arrive there. IT was a dwarf who forged the Sword of Freedom, and perhaps
someday that deed will be repeated.

                                                                    -Josephina

                          SIEGE CAMP & BYZANOPLE
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  It's bad enough I have to fight a war without having to give an orien-
tation tour to every greenhorn cadet that walks into my office. If yer
in my camp, yer in the army. It is isn't important to me if you signed
up at the gate or in Phoebus...all that matters now is that I'm the
boss!

  Right! There isn't much to say about the siege camp because we
don't expect to be here much longer. One way or the other we're
going to resolve the war with Bysanople, and then the camp will be
abandoned.

  Armies are armies and men are men and I'm confused...what I'm
trying to say is there are things that always follow armies (and I don't
mean women!) and you'll find several of them in the camp. I know
there's a black market (even though I'm not supposed to know) and I
think there's a healer (even though I am supposed to know). Don't
forget to report to yer commandin' officer--that being me! And
don't try to desert--my boys don't take kindly to rats who go
AWOL.

When you're done goldbrickin' in the camp, strike out north and
head for the siege of Byzanople. We've just about starved the rebel scum
out of their city, and all we need is a few suckers--er, I mean hereos--to
find a way into the city and open the gates. Yer best bet is to run along
the wall and try the main gate, but I suppose getting peppered with arrows
and boiled by oil might make you wanna cry for mommy. Our dwarf sappers are
supposed to be diggin' a tunnel under the wall, and there might even be
other ways to get into the city. Once yer in, on yer own--but remember that
amnesty I ptomised ya if you do a good job.

  Now quit loafin' and get to work!!

                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This is no place for adventure, but rather the nerve center of my war
effort against Namtar. He has corrupted my father and lay siege to
my city. I fear I cannot long hold out against the forces of evil.

  The halls are regularly patrolled, and should my sister find you she
will request your surrender. You would be well advised to comply. I
am a fair man, and I know many who fight beneath Namtar's banner
do so not of their own choosing. Perhaps you could start anew for
me.

There is a treasure chamber here, but my stores have been depleted
by war. A single stair leads from the dungeon to the city above.
Near the stair is a locked door leading to the crypts of my ancestors. My
great grandfather is buried there, still clutching his magic axe, and a
legion of undead soldiers protect him.

                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Understand that I have not visited my father's court at Kingshome for
many years. When last I was there the place was bustling with activ-
ity. I have since heard the palace is a virtual morgue, with its great
stonework stripped away to build fortifications on the frontier. Re-
gardless, if King's men still patrol the place, they'll respect the King's
seal and permit you to enter the castle.

  If the Great Hall is abandoned there may still be things worth finding
in the antechambers. My father owned great riches, although I doubt
much remains. Of interest is my father's library and wardrobe.
Somewhere in the palace you may still be able to view poorly ren-
dered portraits of my sisters and me.

  The dungeon beneath the palace was not used in my father's time,
but I can well imagine the use to which it's been put lately. There's
no way out of the cell block without passing through the guard room,
so if you're imprisoned here you'll have to carve your way out. I'm
sure the various barracks are claimed by mercenaries and
Stosstrupen.

  The long north-south passage has a secret door directly in its midst--it
leads to a tunnel that to my knowledge has not been completed. My father
intended the tunnel system to serve as a treasure vault, but I do not know
if he has gone through with his plans. The only way out of the dungeon
leads through the royal apartments in Kingshome. I doubt anyone is in
residence there now, but should you find my father please tell him to cease
his war against me. I mean him no harm and fear for his safety.

                            ROYAL GAME PRESERVE
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  It's been a long time since the King hunted here. His young boy
Jordan was a firebrand, and he liked to hunt, but they don't come
around anymore. All the way out here on the Isle of Rustic I don't
see much of anyone anymore, and that's the way I like it.

  I've filled the forest with snare traps to capture poachers. They're
heaviest around my home. If you get captured I'll get around to you
when I can, but don't try anything funny or I'll let you have it with my
bow Nevermiss.

  Around the ford you'll find some animal tracks, but remember not to
hunt any game as the forest is King's property. The forest is still a
pretty wild place, and killing in self defense is all right, I reckon.
Some outlaws have made camp on the far side of the river, and they
look pretty tough. I'll clean `em out when I get around to it.

  Bring me news of the King and I'll be much obliged.

                                                                   - Old Jack

                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The scorpion bridge guards the way from Rustic to the Eastern Isles, the
Utnapishtim's College of Music. The man-scorpions that guard the bridge are
fearsome beasts and not to be crossed. Recall, however, that Enkidu is
patron of beast-men and man-beasts...if you show the man-scorpion the Totem
of Enkidu to be found in the Mystic Wood, they wkll permit you to pass the
bridge.

  Within the bridge you will find darkness, confusion, and fierce beasts.
Remain on a straight and true path and you will find your way to the far
side of the bridge. Do not stray into the north-south passage or you may
never leave the bridge.

                                 ~~~~~~~~

  Freeport is aptly named, for it is the last free port in Dilmun. The city
is located in the Eastern Isles, and you will have to acquire a boat
before you can sail here.

  The city is arranged around the best harbor this part of the world has
to offer. Along the waterfront you'll find the Brews Brothers tavern-
the best pub hereabouts--and the Order of the Sword. The Order of
the Sword is a pack of thugs and they deserve to be put in their
place. Everyone else you'll meet in town is friendly and industrious.
Most of us are from somewhere else, and we know what it means to
lose your home, so we work all the harder to keep Freeport free.

  You'll find the usual armoring, magic, and healing services if you look
in the right places. You'll also find the town's most important arti-
fact, the Sword of Freedom. The Sword was set in the harbor by the
great hero Roba when he founded the city. Legend holds that so
long as the Sword is safe, Freeport will thrive. The same legend
holds that in a time of need a great hero will appear to claim the sword
and fight against the darkness.

  Several months ago a dark figure was spotted on the island where the
Sword of Freedom is displayed. The Sword is still visible, but I can't help
but wonder if the mysterious figure did something evil to the weapon.

                             COLLEGE OF MAGIC
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Cliff's Notes: Utnapishtim's requirements for graduation are stiff and
uncompromising. If you would pass his test, keep the following
points in mind. And remember these notes cannot substitute for a
first hand experience of the test...they are intended as a guide for
study only.

  First, you will be unable to enter the College unless you can see the
entrance, and to see the entrance you must use a pair of rarely found
magical spectacles. Lanac'toor had one such pair. Use them where
you see tracks in the mud.

  Utnapishtim requires you overcome a number of obstacles to claim
his boon. Most require the use of magic, so don't bother coming
here before you are well-versed in spells and their use. The first
room requires that you overcome a wall of fire. Defeat fire with ice.
The next room presents you with another wall of fire, but all is not as
it seems. Reveal the glamour of Utnapishtim's illusion, and take ap-
propriate action when you see the true nature of your task.

  Invisibility will let you move unseen past the creature that kills with
its gaze. Cloak yourselves with an arcane spell. When the time comes to
kill the Phillistine,do so and without remorse. Magic will not help you
here. And even if you clearly see and understand what you think is an
obvious trap, you must trigger the trap with magic before you can safely
pass. Either disarm the trap or eliminate the stone block by softening away
to nothing.

  Neither magic nor any other action help when Utnapishtim demands to see
something novel--just walk past him and claim your reward. The ring and the
staff are amusing but only the Soul Bowl will genuinely help you in your
quest. Take all you can when the treasure is offered--you can't come back
for seconds!

                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Exploring Dragon Valley is a quest for heroes and fools. There is little
to be gained by venturing here, unless you love bloodshed or seek
an invaluable ally against Namtar.

  The Valley is wide and flat, and crawls with dragons and other beasts.
Legend holds the teeth of a dead dragon make for powerful weap-
ons, so should you find a dragon skeleton be sure to make the most
of your discovery. A large collection of dragon bones can be found
just north of the entrance to the valley, but they will not be without
guardians.

  At the north end of the valley, beside the water, you'll find the lair of
the Dragon Brood Queen. She is as powerful as all her children put
together, and no one can hope to survive combat with her. When
confronting the Dragon Brood Queen, your only hope is to prove to
her you are a friend of dragons--a difficult task after hacking through
legions of her children to reach her. Correct use of a dragon gem--such as
that to be had from the dragon of Lansk--will temporarily bind the Dragon
Queen to your will. Entering Dragon Valley without such a gem is sheer
folly.

                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Not far from Dragon Valley you'll find these exotic coastal ruins. The
ruins exist both above and below water--to explore the underwater
portion of this area, you will require the water breathing potion lrkalla
maKes available in the Underworld.

  The ground level of the ruins is mundane. No amount of skill will
permit you to pass the locked door. Seek a secret way past the door
rather than wasting precious experience on improving your lockpick-
ing skills.

  Once past the gate, explore the ruins thoroughly. You will soon
uncover a blank area where a secret door will prove the only means
of entrance. At this point you must use your water breathing potion
if you would advance.

  Important treasures are to be had here, but none more so than the
skull of the legendary hero Roba. The skull is required to reforge the
Sword of Freedom. The skull is trapped in the maw of a clam...just take the
clam, and it will shrivel away to reveal the skull when you leave the sea.

  There are other items of interest in the ruins, not the least of which is
the original Davy Jones' locker. However, you will doubtless come here
late in your quest, and be anxious to confront Namtar. In such a case, it's
probably best not to linger here and risk falling prey to some aquatic
horror for no good reason.

                             MAGAN UNDERWORLD
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Beneath the surface of Dilmun is a magical Underworld. The kingdom is
called Magan, and it is not a place for the weak or inexperienced to explore.
You will have to come here eventually to complete your quest, but better
later than sooner.

  The Magan Underworld is coterminous with all of Dilmun, which means many
of the surface world's locations can be reached directly from the Underworld.
Veteran adventurers sometimes find travel through the Underworld ultimately
less taxing than similar travel overland across Dilmun. If you prefer 
combating Underworld beasts to dealng with pesky bridge guards and swarms
of goblins, you may agree.

  Of course, there is more reason to explore the Underworld than simply
searching for a rapid means of travel across Dilmun. Irkalla's Realm is an
important land, but you will gain admittance only after sacraficing an item
to the Dark Lady at one of her surface shrines. Irkalla herself is on an
island which can be reached only by using a magic item. The Dark Lady is
further bound in chains that can be removed only by the grace of Nergal,
the lord of the Necropolis, who certainly owes Irkalla no favors. It is
well worth your time, however, to rescue Irkalla.

  The entrance to the magical forge of the Dwarven clan hall can be reached

                                    53

through the field of fire in the Magan Underworld.

  Elsewhere in the Underworld you'll find access to several surface lo-
cations, magic pools, and an oracle cave that will further explain your
quest. The Well of Souls, the only place in Dilmun where the dead
may be returned to life, is located in the Underworld, but it can be
reached only through Nergal's palace of the Necropolis. The Well is
only of use to those blessed with arcane knowledge.

  Pay special attention when you find the pit from which Namtar was
spawned. Legend holds Namtar cannot truly be destroyed unless
and until he is pitched back into the pit from which sprang. Making
careful note of the pit's location could save you precious time at the
end of your quest.

                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This old dock has welcomed pilgrims to Nisir, the Mountain of Salva-
tion, for as long as anyone can remember. Not even Namtar would
dare tamper with the will of the gods, and pilgrims are still welcome
here. Be aware, however, that Namtar's Stosstrupen are on hand to ensure
only pilgrims pass this way, and that no adventurers try to take the
mountain by storm.

  To this end, a fortress has recently been constructed near the docks.
Adjoining the fortress is a block of cells in which are imprisoned those
who came here on a quest rahter than on a pilgrimage. The cells are in
frequent use. At least one prisoner is usually present. There is a rumor
that someone recently escaped from his cell by tunneling through the heart
of the mountain, but I know nothing of the details.

                                                              -Wiggly Warmflsh

                                   NISIR
                                   ~~~~~

  Nisir is the holiest place in Dilmun, and also the most dangerous
since Namtar made it his place of primary residence. The old shrine
and even the entrance to the Underworld are unguarded, but the rest
of Nisir is a very treacherous place.

  Your approach up the mountain will be long but unremarkable. Once
at the mountain's summit, be sure to visit the shrine to the Universal
God. Displaying the Sword of Freedom to the God will gain its
blessing.

  While at the mountain, seek the treasure of the Dragon Eyes. They
are powerful magical artifacts that will aid you in your quest.

  The entrance to Namtar's tower is in the southeast corner of the
plateau. The approach to Namtar's stronghold is protected by a
locked guardroom, but an intelligent climber can bypass the guards if
you find the right patch of rock.

  Once past the guardroom. you can't miss Namtar's tower. You'll have to
leap across the chasm with the Golden Boots to enter the tower. What
happens next, no man has lived to say.

                                                                -Jim Nasium

                              DEPTHS OF NISIR
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is here that you will (with luck) engage Namtar in final battle. The
heart of the mountain Nisir is a confusing and treacherous place, complete
with many obstacles not seen in other parts of Dilmun.

  What you do here depends largely on you. Great combats are to be had,
provided such is your ambition. It may be possible to enjoy a final
reckoning with Mystalvision or Buck Ironhead, if you look in the right
places. Likewise, many clues to Namtar's identity and ultimate ambitions
are here for the curious.

  Chances are, however, that you'll want to make directly for Namtar's lair.
You'll have to break out of the initial cavern using Soften Stone spells.
There are many places to wander in the Depths of Nisir, but you'll know
you're on the right track when you find the seemingly uncrossable chasm.

  A summoned air elemental will bear you across the chasm. Pass through the
doors and turn right...continue south to the wall and cast another Soften
Stone. You;ll now be in a large chamber that teems with traps. The doorless
stone structure in the center of the chamber contains the portal that will
transport you to Namtar's lair. To enter it, you must cast another Soften
Stone. This may seem like a difficult path to take to your final
confrontation, but it is nothing compared to the combat that awaits. If this

                                    59

preliminary action exhausts your resources, turn around and get out
while you still can.

  Before you can battle Namtar you will have to get past his army. You
can always hack your way through Namtar's mighty legions, but it's
easier to call upon the Dragon Brood Queen, the alliance of which
you've hopefully secured. Astride her back you can sail high above
the army and arrive at your final confrontation with Namtar.

Good fortune in your final battle with Namtar, and remember that
you will not be entirely done with him until his body is hurled into
the Underworld pit from which he sprung.

                                                                      --?


                             WEAPON STATISTICS
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Following are set forth the names of the different weapons that can be found
in Dilmun, along with the damage each one inflicts and the minimum strength
you will need to wield them.

  Damage is listed as the number of dice the computer will roll followed by
the number of sides on the dice. For example, if a weapon does 2d20 of damage,
your computer will "roll" two twenty-sided dice, add the results together,
and inflict that much damage to your poor opponent. Hand-to-hand weapons
generally require a minimum strength to use, and missile weapons a minimum
dexterity. A minus Attack Value (AV) makes it harder for you to hit your foe,
and a plus makes it easier.  You may wish to "Use" a weapon - or any item for
that matter - both in and out of combat to find out if it has any special
powers. CAVEAT: From universe to universe (or computer to computer) the actual
statistics listed here may vary slightly, or may even have undocumented
abilities.

                         "Which Items do I keep?"

  Items that you should hang onto: the Golden Boots, the king's Signet Ring,
and the Dragon Gem. The Spectacles are useful if you want to return to the
Magic College, though you do not ever need to go to the College to finish
the game.  The same applies to the Water Breathing potion at the Sunken 
Ruins. The Pilgrim's Garb, Citizen Papers, Governer's Pass, and Enkidu Totem 
are all useful for getting around. Of these four items, however, only the 
Pilgrim's Garb is required to finish the game (to get back and forth to 
Nisir). Everything else is of general use over the course of the game, or is 
only useful in a particular spot and can be discarded or sold after that 
use. The mushrooms, Soul Bowl, Jade Eyes, mirror, various Stone statue 
parts, Roba's skull (the clam), stone hammer, Key, Silver key, battered 
cup, and shovel are all one-use items that can be discarded after they 
have been used in the proper location.

  If the item has a price, it can be safely sold. The parrot, drifiwood,
flotsam, crown, rare books, jewels. and Royal Robe have no use beyond any
monetary value.

  Dragon Stones are the primary source of magic power regeneration throughout
Dilmun. Use them wisely since, with the exception of a few shops and minor
locations, the stones listed below are all that exist.
