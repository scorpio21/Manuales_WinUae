                           DETROIT CHEAT CARD
                           ==================
                                                 TYPED BY SHARD - DTL


If you want to be sure to earn a profit in your first month of DETROIT, you
can  plug  the  following  number values into the appropriate places in the
tutorial  (see the "Technical Supplement and Tutorial" booklet).  They will
guarantee  you  a  reasonable  return for at least your first few months in
business.   The  first  set of values gives you hints, the second set gives
you  decent, but not optimal exact numbers, and the third set gives you the
absolute best numbers.

Important Tutorial Change:  When you first start the game, you will now see
a  Difficulty  panel appear with six possible settings The toughest setting
is Loan, where your company starts off in debt to the bank, with no capital
funds.  The easier the setting you choose, the more money your company will
have  as  a  beginning  stake.   In  order for these numbers to work in the
tutorial, set the difficulty level as Medium.
