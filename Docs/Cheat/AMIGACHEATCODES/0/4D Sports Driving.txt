4D Sports Driving

When you crash, rewind the replay videotape until shortly before the
crash.  Now select {CONTINUE DRIVING} from the menu and the car is new
again.

To win the race in no time start driving backwards in the beginning
and turn around after a few meter.  Now when you cross the finish line
you have the lap time.
