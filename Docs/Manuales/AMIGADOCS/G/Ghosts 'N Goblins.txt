GHOSTS 'N GOBLINS

Ghosts 'N Goblins is the authentic home computer version of the classic
coin-operated arcade game from Capcom, authors of the best sellers including
the world beating Commando and 1942.

Ghosts 'N Goblins is the classic fighting fantasy story, heroic Knight to rescue
beautiful maiden from clutches of demonic Overlord. Featuring some
stunning effects and graphics, this technically excellent game is clearly
another winner from the Elite/Capcom stable.
