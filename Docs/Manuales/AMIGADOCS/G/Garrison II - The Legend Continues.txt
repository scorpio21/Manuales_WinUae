                             GARRISON II

GARRISON BUGS?
I bought the original game and can confirm that even there, some problems
seem to occur.  For one thing, the Red Cross boxes which the help page
say should give you 5000 health points, do nothing.  This is a major
problem in attempting to play the game.  Secondly there seem to be some
rooms with the "goodies" locked in areas that cannot be entered, no
matter what you do.  For these reasons, if for no other, anyone wanting
to play the game for more than about 15 levels will want to use the
Garrison Editor (Garrote).

One hint - some of the rooms which seem to be unopenable, actually are.
There are some walls that can be fired at to be opened.  For example in
the room that has a whole area of money at the bottom and food bags
along the left side and top, there is at least 1 hidden door to the food.
So far I have been unable to legitamately get into the money.  The door
is found near the bottom of the series of changing walls that run along
the left of the screen.  Enter the moving walls area and start firing at
the right hand wall (which would be the left hand wall of the food bag
chamber).  You will find a shootable wall to let you into the food.

THE DOCS:

It's recommended that at the title page you type F2 (or just wait) instead
of a space bar. At this point you will see various figures. As you read
them the following information can be gleaned:

SCORE: 
     GUARDS - 40
     SORCERERS - 100 (can go invisible)
     DEMONS - 60 (spit fire at you)
     BLACK DEATHS - 1000 (can be killed by hitting shift key if you have
                          a scroll.  Fire from the Conjurers who lob bombs
                          at you can also kill them)
     CONJURERS - 75
     GHOSTS - 50 (these are the white guys)

HEALTH AND GOLD:
     BOXES - 500
     FLOWERS - 1000
     FOOD BAGS - marked xx - 1000 health
     DRUMSTICKS - 1000
     DINNER PLATE - 2500

     BAD FOOD - (will take away health points, they look like food bags
                 but have more cross hatching on them)
                (Shoot them and they will slow down the monsters)

BOTTLES:
     RED dot - increases speed (S of characteristic)
     WHITE/YELLOW - increases hand to hand combat (H)
     WHITE DOT - increases magic (M)
     PINK DOT -increases armor (A)
     GREEN DOT - increases shot speed (P)
     RED DOT - increase firepower (F)

TRAPS:
     Blue dot in circle - teleporter
     Yellow dot in circle - blocks entrance - will take 1 scroll to
                            remove it
     White crosshatches on block - GLUE - slows you down
     Yellow crosshatches on block - Releases hidden doors/walls/etc.
     DIAMOND with pink dot - subtracts score
     DIAMOND with blue dot - subtracts health
     DIAMOND with pink dots - explosives (see pictures to distinguish
                              these)
     DIAMOND with yellow dot - Stun - locks you in place
     DIAMOND with green - decreases characterisitcs

CHARACTERISTICS:
     The Letters SHMAPF show the abilities for each figure:

     S - Speed of character  1-5
     H - Hand to Hand combat.  Ability hindering a rival in the further
                               participation in the game 1-5
     M - Magic Power.  1-9.  This raises the effect of a scroll.  Some
characters with low magic will only kill Black Deaths, with higher M
they can kill everything on the screen.  Activate a SCROLL with the
left shift key (player 1) or the right shift key (player 2).  The player
cannot move during use of scroll.
     A - Armor - the stronger the armour the lower the losses on health after
                 touching a rival.  1-5
     P - Shot Speed - 1-5
     F - Fire Power  1-9

OTHER FACTORS:
     You can stop game with an ESC
     You can temporarily halt game with SPACE
     There are 128 levels; levels are arranged by chance after level 4.
     Two players can play simultaneously.  One player chooses his figures
     with F1-F5 and another player with F6-F0.  You can only dial each
     figure once per level.
     If the Amiga has less than 512K ram the baddies will look similar,
     more ram and they will have a distinctive appearance.

THE GARROTE EDITOR:
See the docs with come with this for more help.  With trial and error I
have come up with the following chart.  The symbols are listed for the
first 3 down, going from left to right on the screen.

At the far right bottom are the letters of each of the monsters, each one
represents a monster.  Over to the right on the bottom are squares with
these letters insides - these are the monster generators.  There is also
a large X near the right hand side among the last few symbols - this is
the ENTRANCE.

To use the editor you must SAVE each set of four screens. Screens seem to
start at about #38 and proceed upward. To delete, click in square 17 on the
chart which is the first empty on the top and then click on the object to
be deleted.
