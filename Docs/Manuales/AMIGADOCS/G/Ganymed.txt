                              GANYMED

Loading the Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Insert the Ganymed disk into the internal drive (DF0:) when the workbench
is requested. The EuroLine logo will appear. If you want to shorten the
booting time, press the joystick button while the logo is on the screen.
Make sure that the Ganymed disk is NOT write protected.

The Title Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After a few seconds of loading, the title screen appears. It has the high
scores and the names of the authors of the game. When you want to start the
game, press the joystick button.

The High Score List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this hall of fame, the five best Ganymed fighters are immortalized for
all eternity. The high scores are saved to the disk, so keep the disk
write-enabled. To enter your name into the high score list after a good
fight, use the joystick to move the cursor and use the button to select a
letter. "<--" will delete the last letter. The END symbols ends your input.

Playing the Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is your mission to destroy all the robots by shooting them with your
laser. But be careful, the robots will return your fire and a hit is
deadly. Watch for additional weapons in higher levels. If a robot is
blinking, it will explode on the next hit of your laser. Avoid direct
collisions with the robots! To control the game, use the following
functions:

	Left/Right   - moves your ship left or right
	Up/Down      - moves your ship up or down
        Fire Button  - activates your laser
        ESC key      - cancels the game
        Space Bar    - pauses the game

You get an extra ship every thousand points.

The End of the Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The game is over when you have lost all of your ships. If your score is
high enough, you will have the option of entering your name into the hall
of fame. Never reset the Amiga when the drive light is on because the disk
could be damaged.

                        Have fun playing the game..
