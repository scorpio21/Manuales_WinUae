	You are in an interstellar cargo ship. You supervise maintenance
robots. Your ship has crashed and the robots have gone amuck.

YOU MUST:

	1) Reach exit at other end of cargo ship before its complete
	   disintegration.

	2) Find the passages through the ship
	   Fallen rubble has obstructed some of the communication doors.

	3) Use the robot lifts after having partially destroyed them.

	4) Avoid maintenance robots who have become deranged.

CONTROLS:

	ESC - give up     F3 - pause       space - jump
	F5  - save game to blank disk      F7 - load game

INDICATORS  - Middle screen

	1) Lives remaining (heads)
	2) Floor level where you are
	3) Beneath four guages (left to right)
		Health of G.NIUS
		Reserve of electrical energy
		Ammunition remaining in pistol
		Resistance of shields
	4) Score

SETTING PARAMETERS - on screen after demo mode to choose level of
		     difficulty.

	* for each bullet that hits G.NIUS - you can determine amount
	  of energy lost.
	* pistol can fire 15-30 bullets before disintegrating
	* always have 3 lives.

ADVICE:

	To recover arms or energy, you must destroy the maintenance
	robots, depending on the side you hit and number of shots
	different objects will apear (shields, batteries, nails...)

	A destroyed magnet attracts the robots in room for awhile

	Lift robots arrive after you have destroyed all the light pins
	on the floor.

	No sense in mapping the cargo hold - different each game.
