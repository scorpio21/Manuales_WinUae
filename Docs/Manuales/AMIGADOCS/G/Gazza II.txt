                              PLAYING GAZZA II
GAZZA 2 is a largely icon-driven football simulation that allows up to 16
players to manage, coach and play for different teams in a European
Super-league of 4 divisions. These icons are largely self-explainitory but a
full description of each one is given below. The first icon menu that
appears contains four icons: Load Saved Game, Add Manager, Play Game and
Exit. If the strategy elements are not required then the player(s) can
simply play a 1 or 2 player game of fast arcade-quality football by clicking
on the Play Game icon. However, to fully appreciate the depth of the game,
the player should attempt to manage and control his team as well. once the
required number of managers has been entered using the Add Manager icon the
main menu will appear.

MAIN MENU
~~~~~~~~~
This contains 8 icons and leads off to a number of sub-menus used to control
the variousfeatures in the game.

* Manager - The manager's role is crucial if your team is to succeed.
  Whether you are buying and selling players or persuading the bank to lend
  you money, remember: results are everthing!

* Scout - the scout gives you an eagle eye on other teams and players
  currently on the transfer market.

* Coach - another vital component in your success. Not only can you train
  the players in basic strength and tactical power, but you can create
  tactics for specific situations.

* Play Game - When you have finnished planning your strategy, get your
  joystick out and go for it!

* Advance 1 Week - When all players have played their matches, move a step
  closer to the end of season.

* Options - set up the match conditions the way you want them.

* Disk - load and save your game position or your tactics set-up.

* Exit - Restart game to reset players or play a simple match!

TACTICS EDITOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the coach decides to create new tactics a menu appears that allows him
to define what each one of your team is doing at any given situation. In
every ninth of the pitch and for every set-piece (attack and defence) you
can define someone to take a position, mark a specific opposition player or
follow the ball. This is possibly the most complicated and innovative
features in GAZZA 2 and will provide hours of fascination as you strive for
the perfect tactics.

THE MATCH
~~~~~~~~~
This is where the pace really hots up as the supremely fast arcade section
transports you into the stadium. The pitch is laid out from left to right
and control is indicated by an arrow above the player. This player may kick
or tackle depending on weather he is in possession of the ball.

KICKING
~~~~~~~
The strength of a kick is determined by the power bar at the bottom of the
screen. This increases as the joystick button is held down but wraps around
to zero if held too long. The direction of the kick is determined by the
joystick layouts given.

TACKLING
~~~~~~~~
If your controlled player does not have the ball, then pressing the fire
button will attempt a sliding tackle. BE CAREFUL, tackling someone without
the ball is liable to get you into trouble!

GOALKEEPERS
~~~~~~~~~~~
The goalie is automatically controlled by the computer!

SPECIAL NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* At half-time you change ends! * Press "S" during a match to make a
substitution!
