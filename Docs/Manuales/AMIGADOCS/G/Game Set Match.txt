                          GAME, SET AND MATCH

BEFORE YOU START
================

Before  using  any of the programs, please make backup copies of your disks
and  lock  away  your master disks.  That way, if you ever damage your disk
you can always make a fresh working copy.

Computer Viruses
----------------

Sharing  disks with friends has become the major cause for the rapid spread
of  computer  viruses.   Some of these are fairly harmless but nevertheless
annoying.   Others  are  very  nasty  and  will  show varying symptoms from
diskettes   not   loading  unless  not  write  protected,  diskettes  being
destroyed,  programs  not  loading  or  crashing.  Once you have a virus in
amongst  your  disks  they  are  difficult  to  get rid of, not to say time
consuming.   imagine  spending  hours creating a story only to lose it all.
Imagine collecting a years worth of data for a project and losing all that.
Don't  risk  it.   Be extremely careful who you take disks from.  And don't
give  disks  away.  If you already have a virus in amongst your disks, your
friends will not thank you for corrupting their disks

NOTE:
----

If  you  have  a 512K Amiga with an additional external disk drive, you may
have  to  disconnect  that  drive  before you can load some of the enclosed
programs.

TERMINOLOGY
-----------

In  this document, to click on something means to move the mouse pointer to
and item and then press the left mouse button.  To double click is to press
the left mouse button twice rapidly.

Some  of  the  programs take quite some time to load, please be patient and
NEVER take a disk out if the green disk light is on


REMEMBER,  some  of  the  programs  take  up to a minute to load and whilst
loading,  the  screen  may not show any activity for a while.  If the green
"drive" light is still on, your program is still loading.

Getting Going
-------------

Game  Set  and Match is very simple in concept.  Simply turn your Amiga on,
put  in  the disk and when the program has loaded, it will ask you for your
name.

Type in your name and press "return".

Point  the  mouse  and click at any of the green selection "buttons" on the
screen to choose the activity you want.

Once  the  individual  activity is loaded, use the left mouse button or the
space  bar  to control the game.  Follow the instructions on the screen for
each of the activities.

Note  that  all  the  selection  "buttons"  have a letter in the box eg <A>
instead  of clicking with the mouse, you can select the activity by holding
down the control key on the keyboard and pressing this letter.

Choose  activity  <S>  (options)  to  select  different  speeds and control
sounds.
