INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Perhaps in the not too distant future, governments have advanced beyond
those of today.  Control of cities and civilizations is handled from
central control points.

You are one of these governments' leaders, assigned control of a new or
existing world population with instructions to look after and care for it.
You have only limited information and abilities in order to achieve this
goal.  You will have to look carefully at the information you receive from
your sensors; your power is limited, and the environment will be your
biggest enemy.

Any fully enclosed eco system has to be almost perfectly balanced in order
to survive the ages, and yours will be no different.  It will be important
to deal with environmental as well as economic problems - there will be
many situations along your route which hamper this eventual necessity.

Your people will live lives of their own, and they get on with them
regardless of whether you decide to interfere or not.  If you don't, they
may expand beyond their means, and cause huge pollution problems.

Your ability to control people, and issue new commands, depends on two
basic factors:  how happy they are, and how well maintained the surrounding
environment is.  Looking after these, as well as dealing with potential
acts of war from other parties, forms only part of your undertaking.

Should conflict take place, it could cause irreparable situations, perhaps
plunging you into a new ice age, even global warming to levels impossible
to survive - so be warned, you may win a conflict in the short run, but the
long term effects could be fatal to every living creature and plant on the
face of the planet.


         -=- 1 -=-

As a potential head of state, several options are open to you.  You will be
able to take command of an existing colony, where previous leaders have
failed to succeed, and try to repair the damage they may have caused.
There are large numbers of these sorts of planets throughout the universe,
and there would be many possible situations to choose from should you
desire.  Alternatively, you can try a new command of your own, starting on
the world of your choice, facing possibly hazardous situations - maybe
starting on a world very short of fossil fuel for example.  You will have
to fight against these odds, and other pitfalls, in order to build a new
thriving environment and civilization.  There may be many disasters along
they way, from natural ones to vast man made ones - and you will have to
deal with these as they occur.

         -=- 2 -=-


COMMODORE AMIGA VERSION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running from floppy disk Switch on your Amiga, and place the Boot disk
(Global Disk 1) in the drive.  The game will autoboot.

Installing & running from hard disk After booting your Workbench disk,
insert Global Disk 1 into any disk drive.  Double click on the Icon that
appears for this disk, and then double click on the HD Install icon to
enter the installation program.  This program will ask you on which
partition you want to install Global Effect on.  Make sure that there are 2
Megabytes of free disk space left on the partition you have chosen.  To run
the game thereafter, simply double click on the 'Global Effect' icon.


Setup options
------------
When you start Global Effect, you will first have to select which language
and video display you wish to run under.

You will be able to choose from PAL, NTSC or ECS-PAL options.  If you live
in a country where the video system is NTSC, such as America, select this.
If you are living in Europe, you have two options; either PAL, or ECS-PAL.
If you have an Amiga A3000, or A500+, or have bought the ECS (Enhanced Chip
Set), and have a suitable monitor, you will be able to use Global Effect so
that it fills the entire screen.  If you are in doubt, select the ECS- PAL
option and press on the planet gadget.  If the introduction sequence that
will follow flickers wildly, or the screen display is unstable, then reboot
and try again using the PAL option.  Once you have selected the language,
press on the planet in order to start the introduction sequence.


         -=- 3 -=-


IBM PC COMPATIBLES VERSION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running Global Effect from floppy disk Start the PC, insert the Boot Disk,
and type 'global' from the prompt.  If you normally run DOS off your hard
disk, you will need to select the floppy drive by typing A:  or B:
depending on which drive the boot disk is in.

Installing and running from hard drive From the dos prompt, select the
drive in which you have placed the Global Effect Boot disk.  Then, type
'install' to load the hard disk installation program.  This will ask you
where on your system you wish to have the program installed, with C:\GLOBAL
as the default directory.

The game will load providing you with three basic choices, first you will
be asked which language you wish to use, once you have selected this, you
then choose one of four sound options:  Silent, PC beeper sound, AdLib or
Roland cards.  Having made this choice, the introduction sequence will load
and run.



THE INTRO SEQUENCE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Global Effect will play you an introduction sequence, ending on the title
screen .  If you leave the computer, it will, eventually, re-start this
sequence and repeat it forever, until you either pre~ a key, or click on a
mouse butlon.  You will be prompted when the introduction is finished to
clic~ or press to continue.

The sequence will play with an accompanying tun~ and effects, and varies on
the different formats.

         -=- 4 -=-


SELECTING YOUR SCENARIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you have continued from the introduction Sequence you will be able to
select your chosen scenario.  There are four basic choices:  'Create a
world', 'Save a world', 'Rule a world', or 'Disk Options'


CREATE A WORLD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the most customizable option.  You will be playing on a blank
world, and will have to start from scratch.

You can decide initially how many players you wish to be involved., either
no others at all, a computer player or finally, another human player,
controlled on another machine running Global Effect through the serial
port.


         -=- 5 -=-

Single player game
------------------
If you select single player game, your game will be a discovery of the
environment, and the various effects of 'human life' on the planet.  The
challenge is to build whole civilizations whilst still maintaining a good
environmental balance.  If this is your strategy, using conflictual weapons
will destroy only you and the environment you created.

Two player game
----------------
If you selected two players, you will get a requester, from which you will
be able to decide on the speed of connection, and the type of connection
you require, and then attempt to establish a link.  It is recommended that
you use a local link (using a null modem cable, see appendix for further
details) rather than modems over the telephone network, for reliability
reasons.  Due to the nature of Global Effect, a vast amount data has to be
sent between the two systems, and, should the link go wrong, it is highly
likely that the program will become confused, or, at worst, might fail
altogether.



         -=- 6 -=-

Player Versus Computer Game
---------------------------
If you chose the computer player, you will be able to decide how it will
play its game.  You can set up how fast it works, its economic ambition,
and its military agression level.  It is recommended you try a low setting
on all three of these initially, as the computer player is quite good at
this game!

Once you have selected the player options, you will have to decide whether
you will be playing either a totally customized world, or one of the eight
supplied environmental situations (Green Field or Scenarios respectively).
If you select scenarios, you will be able to choose one of eight set
scenarios.  These options are described hereafter.


GREEN FIELD
~~~~~~~~~~~
Green field is a game world that you set up yourself.  A requester will
appear, on which you set your own parameters for the game.  When you have
finished, click on 'Accept' and a landscape corresponding to your chosen
parameters will be generated.

         -=- 7 -=-


SCENARIOS
~~~~~~~~~
There are eight pre-designed scenarios, there to test your ability, to
solve a wide variety of environmental problems.  Each has its own
particularities.  You will find that you need to employ different
strategies for each one in order to redress the balance of the earth, and
restore the environment.

Unstable World
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a very young world.  Its surface is very unstable.  Constant
earthquakes and volcanic activity will hamper successful construction.
With little forest cover, large mountain ranges and desert tracts, this a
hostile environment in which to settle.  Choose your power resources
especially carefully and consider the possible outcome of building citi in
unstable areas.


         -=- 8 -=-

Frozen World
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Extremely cold, this world contains few large deserts.  Huge polar caps
cover large amounts of the northem and southern hemispheres.  Most forests
consist of coniferous trees, so there are very few areas of rain forest.
Continued expansion of the ice caps will present a threat to some cities,
and retreating ice flows may leave new, inhabitable areas behind them.
Seismic activity is generally low.


Archipelagos
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This warm, watery world is made up of large numbers of small islands.
Whilst the environment is currently well-balanced, it is also very
difficult to establish a large power base here.  Cities, power, and waste
distribution systems will be limited in scale.  The complex island systems
also make navigation at sea difficult.


         -=- 9 -=-
Barren world
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This world is old, barren, and hostile.  Global temperature is high, with
seismic activity relatively stable.  Huge expanses of desert cover the
world, and trees and shrubbery are scarce.  It will be difficult to build
cities here, whilst maintaining the environmental balance, though
considerable reserves of fossil fuel and uranium may be found.

Pangea
~~~~~~
Much of this planet's surface is taken up by one very large land mass, and
there is little open sea.  Lack of water in inland regions may make it
difficult to establish cities.  Seismic activity is very prevalent here, as
continental drift gradually prizes the large land mass apart.  Global
temperature is high, and extensive forestation covers the continent.

         -=- 10 -=-
Forested World
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heavy forestation on this young world means that large areas of trees will
have to be cleared before effective city building can begin.  This could
result in unpredictable environmental effects.  Seismic activity is still
prevalent, so earthquakes are very common here.  Careful study of seismic
data will be necessary before stable cities can be built.  Global
temperature is high.


Mineral Rich
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A history of massive seismic activity in this worlds' early years has
resulted in many rare minerals being present near to the surface,
especially uranium, in large amounts.  Much of the planet is mountainous or
desert and this has prevented the unchecked growth of forests.  Average
temperatures are fairly high.

         -=- 11 -=-

Fossil Fuel
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a fairly young world.  Much of its surface is still covered in
forests, though there is plentiful grassland available for construction
sites.  Its main character is the abundance of rich fuel sources, both coal
and oil.  These features make this world appear relatively easy to survive
and prosper on.  Seismic activity, however, will present a constant threat
to large cities.




SAVE A WORLD
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This provides you with four scenarios whereby your eventual goal is to save
the world in a set amount of time given a set amount of power.  Your
scenario will be explained to you, and you can either select the "Accept"
or "Cancel" button accordingly.  If you accept it, then the scenario will
load and run.  You four possible settings are:


         -=- 12 -=-

 
Post Nuclear
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The fallout from a massive nuclear conflagration has plunged the world into
a post-nuclear winter.  Few people have survived.  Forests die, large areas
of the planet are now contaminated, and the polar caps are expanding
towards the equator.  You must revive the natural environment to reverse
the damage and allow civilization to thrive once more.


Post industrial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pollution has almost destroyed the world.  High levels of C02, and massive
ozone depletion attest to the environmental crisis.  Over-exploitation has
exhausted many of the world's natural resources.  Without a major change in
environmental policies the world will die.  You must build a new world
order, based on clean, green and energy-efficient decisions, which will, in
time, re-establish environmental equilibrium.


         -=- 13 -=-

Global Warming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heavy industry and the continual use of fossil fuels have resulted in an
accelerated rise of global temperatures.  This in turn has caused the polar
caps to retreat, deserts to advance and sea levels to rise.  Civilization
is threatened and, without your decisive action to reverse the process,
further global warming will rapidly turn this world into a dead planet.


Spent world
~~~~~~~~~~~
Centuries of exploitation through farming and mining have exhausted the
world's natural resources.  Careful organization and management of what few
resources remain is now needed in order to maintain the existing
civilization.  Failure will see the end of life on this world - total
extinction of the human race.

         -=- 14 -=-


RULE THE WORLD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will have two possible scenarios from this option, either a military or
economic opponent - and with limited resources and time, the other occupier
of the world will have to be destroyed and the environment repaired.  Your
two possible scenarios are:


Industrial
~~~~~~~~~~
A rival controller is present on this world.  He will uncaringly develop
heavy industry in order to achieve economic dominance, but will tend to do
so at the expense of the natural balance.  You will need to contain his
expansion by any available means, repair the environmental damage caused by
his greed, and construct a new, cleaner world.


         -=- 15 -=-

Military Force
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your opponent is an ambitious controller whose answer to most problems is
war.  He will stop at nothing to achieve total dominance of the planet.
You will have to defend yourself, and almost certainly engage in military
combat in order to eliminate his threat.  You will also have to guard your
cities carefully from attack, whilst ensuring you have sufficient resources
in reserve with which to rectify the environmental damage which may result
from conflict.


         -=- 16 -=-


PLAYING THE GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have selected all your playing options, you will enter the game
display.

Global Effect is a vast real time environmental simulation.  A large number
of the worlds' workings, such as deserts, coasts, trees and polar caps, for
example, are handled by the machine.  This world consists of over 60,000
separate locations.  When your selected choice of scenario has been loaded,
you will see only a small amount of that map from above.

The game display is called the 'Governmental Console', or GovCon for short,
and is shown on the next page.

It consists of various types of buttons, gadgets, and displays, which are
explained hereafter.

Environmental Balance Graph
---------------------------
This graph is a measure of how nice you are being to the environment around
you.  It starts as slightly above balanced.  Your actions will affect
whether this goes up or down.  If this goes too far down, you should
consider taking drastic measures to rectify what has happened.  If it is
your fault, then you will have had warnings, but it could be the other
player who is at fault!

Global Warming Graph
--------------------
This displays the current trend in global warming or cooling.  If it is
above the line, global temperature is rising; if it is below the line, then
global temperature is going down.

Latitude and Longitude Displays
-------------------------------
These are your present coordinates on the world map.

Power Store
-----------
This displays how many full 'Power Meters' you have, since the power meter
can often go over the top of the scale.

Power Meter
-----------
This meter displays your game power.  Almost everything that you do
involves spending game power.  To start with you have limited amounts of
this, and you should choose your initial actions very carefully indeed.
Your power either goes up, or down, depending on what is happening in the
game.  Performing actions, such as constructing cities, costs you power, as
does bad environmental management.  You will gain power from both your
economic rating, and your environmental rating.  Your economic rating is
calculated from a number of values, including which minerals you have
found, how well your cities are looked after, how big your cities are, how
well your power distribution is working and so on.  Environmental rating is
worked out from how well balanced the eco system is, and what the states of
various pollution factors are.

Clicking on this exits from the game, after a confirmation requester.


Snooze Button
-------------
If you own an Amiga you will be able to pause the game and return to the
workbench screen if you wish to perform actions, such as formatting a disk
to save your game on.  Beware, however, not to use any applications that
require the serial port while the game is paused, as they will not work,
and risk crashing the machine.

This function cannot be implemented on the IBM- PC version of the program,
where this button will simply pause the game, without returning you to the

This displays the currently selected tool, or the battle tool if you are
performing battle functions.  See the section on construction tools for
details of each of the tools available to you.


         -=- 20 -=-

Tool Selection
--------------
By clicking to the left or right of the small drag knob you can change
tools.  There are thirty of them in all, and they are arranged as a
continuous strip, which you can move along to the left or right.  They wrap
round at the ends so it looks like the strip goes on forever.

Mark Position
-------------
Clicking on this will store in memory your current position, to be recalled
by:

Move To Mark
------------
Moves you to the last marked position.

Position Finder
---------------
This allows you to set the coordinates of the place on the Game Area that
you wish to go to.  You do this on the menu that appears.  It also allows
you to go to your 'Active Units' (See the Battle System for details on
active units).

Move To Home Position
---------------------
This will move you to your 'home' position, the place where you started
from in the game.

Movement Arrows
---------------
These scroll you in the appropriate directions for whichever button you
press.

Shortcuts
---------
There are several built in 'shortcuts':

Moving out off the screen with the mouse, and clicking with the left mouse
button at the same time, will scroll the map in the appropriate direction.
(the ESC key on the Amiga, or the DEL key on the PC, will toggle the need
to press the mouse button to move in this way).

Clicking with the left mouse button on any constructions with the right
mouse button held down will, power permitting, destroy that block.

Additionally, on the IBM-PC Compatibles version, you can press the 'Left
Alt' button on the keyboard to tum off the sound.

These are your sources of information as to the state of the planet, and
the effects that you have had on it.  There are seven maps, and three other
data tables:  an environmental balance graph, a seismic survey, and an
economic data table.

         -=- 22 -=-

Carbon Dioxide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cheap to look at, and shows the current global coverage of Carbon Dioxide.
Darker areas are where the level is lower, the lighter areas indicate a
buildup of carbon dioxide.  Trees absorb certain amounts of C02, and lots
of the fossil fuel burners (especially coal) produce it.

Look out for sudden appearances of brighter areas, and be ready to combat
the cause.  Trees convert Cø2 into oxygen, essential for human life to
survive.

Ozone layer
~~~~~~~~~~~
This shows your global coverage of Ozone, a layer of a special kind of
Oxygen which sits high up in the atmosphere and filters out the harmful
ultra-violet rays from the sun.  Holes in this layer, which tend to appear
near the poles, but also over heavy industry, may cause danger to your
civilization and will reduce your economic standing.

         -= 23 -=-

Temperature
~~~~~~~~~~~
This shows you the current temperature of the world.  You can see
"hotspots" here, and watch temperatures rise and fall.  Most of the events
that occur on your world will be affected by or will affect the data on
this map in some way.  Keep a close eye on sudden rises and falls here, as
the effects can be catastrophic.

Air Pollution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From this option, an accurate assessment as to the current levels of air
pollution can be obtained.  Regular checking of this will be required in
order to see where your major pollution offenders are, so that you can take
some action.  It will also give you a fair idea of how the other player is
treating the environment.

Environmental Data Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This button will bring up a table of environmental data about the state of
the planet.  An example of this table is displayed below.

The data displayed gives a general outlook on how the environment of your
planet is progressing.  Beware, however:  the ratings in this table are an
averag all areas of the game world.  You should not disregard the rest of
the data graphs, which wil show you to what levels, and in which localize
areas, any environmental problems are occuring


         -=- 24 -=-

Contamination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Contamination is caused by severe over-pollution, or combat of some kind.
This map shows you where the major sources of contamination are.  If you
see anything at all on this map you will need to act fast, as contamination
affects the eco-balance much more rapidly than anything else.  Nuclear
contamination, for example, may result in trees and your people dying
quickly.



Cash Affording Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By looking at this table you will be able to see which of the many items
that you can choose from to build you can actually afford.  There are
several pages of the most important items.  There are 'next' and 'previous'
page buttons that allow you to cycle either forwards or backwards through
this table.

Each item listed has some small triangles next to it, forming a bar.  The
longer the bar, the more it costs.  The solid green area ahows how much
power you have:  everything within this area that is entirely covered in
green, you can afford.
   
         -=- 25 -=-

Seismic Survey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With this, you can take a seismic suNey of part of your visual screen area.
It then shows you, as a column of percentages, the likelihood of striking
coal, oil and uranium, and also the seismic stability of this area of land.
You can take multiple readings in any area to get the percentages as
accurate as possible and take an average.  Pressing 'Center' will center
the survey on the screen.  Seismic surveys are quite an expensive option to
use.


Balance Graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This shows you how well balanced the different parts of your eco-system
are.  It shows at a glance, the growth or reduction of trees, deserts,
swamps, coastlines and polar caps.  using this function is free.  Too much
change in either direction for any of the graphs something worth paying
attention to, as it reflects imbalance of the environment in one way or
another.

Economic Data Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This table gives you a variety of types of information about your world,
its inhabitants, and the environment around it.  This data is used to
calculate your Economic Rating, which is one of the factors that increase
your power.  The information given is as follows:


Services cover of your city Power sources struck Data on you cities Current
Power/Economic rating Population of your world Game time left/elapsed


Investing in Technology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Investing in technology is a way of improving the efficiency of natural
power sources.  It is quite expensive, but, in the long run, can be very
worthwhile when negotiating an environment friendly scenario.  By clicking
on this button, you will slightly increase the number of city blocks that
wind or solar powered power stations can provide energy for.

World Map
~~~~~~~~~
This shows the entire world map on one screen.  You get one free usage of
this map.  On the map there is a crosshair that shows you where you are at
the moment, and you can select a new position simply by clicking on it, and
so long as you can afford to go you will.

Summary of Data maps and Graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All of the coverage maps, that is, CO2, Ozone, Temperature, Pollution and
Contamination, have an outline map overlaid on them so that you can
properly see where the source of anything interesting is, and, like the

CONSTRUCTION TOOLS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each tool is listed, along with its function, on the following pages.  You
will notice that each tool has its icon at the top of each page, and, on
the same page, the box of four figures needed for the protection scheme at
the start of the game.

Also, on each page, is a figure showing how eac block interlinks with other
types of block.  If you ever have a problem, here is the place to find out
why your constructions don't do what you expect!

You can program any of the tools into function keys by selecting that tool,
and then holding down shift and pressing the appropriate function key.  You
can then jump to any of these by pressing the function key that it was
programed into.  Your function key definitions will be saved when you store
your game on disk.


         -=- 28 -=-


CITY BLOCK
~~~~~~~~~~

Function
~~~~~~~~
A city block is the basic building block of any civilization.  It is within
these that your population grows.  Cities are fairly cheap, and only
require a power source to become populated.  Powered (and therefore
populated) cities will be li up, and will vary in formation.  Unpowered
cities will be blacked out.

Hints
~~~~~
Cities, once powered, will expand on their own, following the evolution of
their population.  However, once cities grow to a certain size, they will
require a certain number of services to keep the citizens 'happy'.  As
cities expand, the population of each block will therefore depend on these
services; for example, no large city can survive without an adequate supply
of food...


         -=- 29 -=-



FARM
~~~~
Function
---------
Farms, one of the services available to you, provide food for your cities.
They are stand-alone units, not requiring any additional 'connections'.
Each farm will provide enough food for a fair-sized city.

Hints
-----
People will generally find a certain amount of food for themselves,
especially in small cities, and lack of food will only really become a
problem if very large areas are not supplied.


         -=- 30 -=-

SEWAGE FARM
~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
-----------
Sewage farms are needed near large cities to dispose of human waste.  They
must be piped to the sea, where sewage that has been processed is deemed to
be safe and clean.

Hints
-----
As with the other services, it is not necessary to have a sewage farms for
very small cities, but will be required for the larger ones.


         -=- 31 -=-

WATER PURIFICATION PLANT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This service provides you with a supply of clean drinking water for your
people.  It must be fed by a pipe from a source of water, either sea or
lake, but not the output of a sewage processing plant!

Hints
-----
Pipelines can be as close as you like to other pipelines, as long as they
do not either touch or cross.


RECYCLING PLANT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Recycling plants allow you to recycle a considerable amout of the waste
produced within your cities, and to re-use resources that would otherwise
be lost.  They have a considerable effect on the pollution in your cities.
Recycling plants are 'stand alone', and do not require connection to other
manmade constructions.

Hints
-----
Without adequate provision for recycling, wasteland will start appearing
around your large cities, where people will be using land for dumping
purposes.

         -=- 33 -=-

RESERVOIR
~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
This is a water store, that will buffer the water supply to your cities.
The reservoir can be placed anywhere in the pipin~ between a water source
and water purification plant.Reservoirs can also be used in the pipelines
between nuclear power stations and their water source.

Hints
-----
Water reservoirs are important since, if a city does not have an adequate
water supply, its population cannot survive.

         -=- 34 -=-

CHOP TREES
~~~~~~~~~~
This will cut down trees, both coniferous and deciduous.

Hints
-----
Trees have a very positive effect on the environment.  It would be a
mistake to cut down any more than you need to!


         -=- 35 -=-

DESTROY MAN MADE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
This tool will destroy any man made object in your cities.The destroyed
buildings will get turned into wasteland.  It should only be used when
necessary, as destroying constructions is quite expensive, and leaves land
that has to be converted to be usable again.

Hints
-----
Destroy man made is generally used when you need to make space for new
constructions, for example, building a pipeline through already established
cities Wasteland-- to connect up a nuclear power plant.

         -=- 36 -=-


CONVERT WASTE TO GRASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Converting wasteland to grass will allow you to build once again on that
land.  It is an extremely expensive option, but will have a small
beneficial effect on the environment.

Hints
~~~~~
Because of the expense of converting wasteland to grassland, ideally, you
should attempt not to have any wasteland in the first place.  Wasteland can
only have pipes and cables built on it, whereas grassland is opGn to any
form of development.

         -=- 37 -=-


PLANT CONIFEROUS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Coniferous trees are the cheapest trees to plant, and survive better than
deciduous trees near the polar caps.  They produce oxygen, and reduce
pollution.

Hints
=----
Planting trees around your cities towards the beginning of the game is the
cheapest way of boxing cities in, to prevent unwanted and excessive
expansion.  Beware of relying too much on trees to contain cities, since
trees do die evntually...


         -=- 38 -=-

                       
PLANT DECIDUOUS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
These trees are best planted near the tropics of your world, where the
climate is best suited to them.  They are a little more expensive than
coniferous trees.

Hints
-----
These can also be used as city borders, but are more prone to dying than
coniferous trees.  ~eciduous trees will absorb more carbon dioxide, and
produce more oxygen, than coniferous ones.


         -=- 39 -=-


CITY LIMIT 
~~~~~~~~~~
City limits provide an effective border to your cities, preventing them
from expanding faster than you would wish them to, or to areas that you
wish to preserve.  They have no effect on the environment, either positive
or negative.

Hints
-----
These are a lot more effective than trees for bordering in cities, since
they are permanent.

         -=- 40 -=-

NATIONAL PARK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
National Parks provide the best form of blocking in a city, in that they
are both permanent and good for the environment.  They are, however, quite
expensive.

Hints
-----
National parks are a very ecologically sound option:  not only are they
planted, but, because they are maintained, there is a knock-on effect on
the permanancy of trees planted nearby.


         -=- 41 -=-

POWER CABLES
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Power cables are used to connect up the electricity supply from a power
station to a distant city.  Also, they connect power between city blocks
that are not contiguous.

Hints
-----
It is not necessary lo connect up city blocks that are touching each other
via other city blocks or constructions.

         -=- 42 -=-

PIPELINES
~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Pipelines connect up a variety of resources.  These are:  water, crude oil,
refined oil, and sewage.  They are required for the following:

Connecting Water to a Water purification plant;
Connecting Water to a Nuclear power station;
Connecting Sewerage plant output to Water;
Connecting an Oil rig to an Oil refinery;
Connecting an Oil refinery to an Oil fired power station.

Hints
~~~~~
Do not mix pipelines!

         -=- 43 -=-

WIND POWER
~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Wind power is cheap, and totally environmentally friendly.  Although cheap,
it will power only a small number of city blocks:  around 20 or so.

Hints
-----
Although useful at the outset of the game, because of its low cost, wind
power will prove inadequate for rapidly expanding cities, unless you invest
substantially in developing environmentally friendly technologies.

See also: Investing in Technology

         -=- 44 -=-

SOLAR POWER
~~~~~~~~~~~

Function
~~~~~~~~
Solar Power is the more powerful of the two natural-resource power
generators, but only by a very little amount, as it can only power up to
about 25 blocks; it costs a little more than wind power.

Hints
-----
As with wind power, solar power produces no pollution, but will remain a
limited form of power generation unless you invest in technological
developments in environmentally-friendly power.

COAL MINE
~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Coal is the easiest mineral to strike on most worlds; a coal mine is of use
only when coupled with a coal- fired power station, which must be located
within two squares of it.

Hints
~~~~~
Coal power is the worst polluter of all the types of power source.

See also: Coalfired power station; Coal store


         -=- 46 -=-


COAL FIRED POWER STATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Coal-fired power stations are cheap, and produce quite a large amount of
power (around 100 city blocks).  Unfortunately, they are also very bad
pollutants.  The setting up of power with these is quite simple, as they
are, coupled with a coal mine, a stand-alone form of producing power (no
pipelines are needed to connect them up).  To be powered, city blocks must
be placed next to the power station, or connected via cables.

Hints
~~~~~
It is a good idea not to have too many of this type of power station, and,
when possible, to replace them with cleaner forms of energy.

See also: Coalmine; Coal store

         -=- 47 -=-

COAL STORE
~~~~~~~~~~
Function                                               
~~~~~~~~
Coal stores will allow you to plan ahead for unforseen circumstances:  any
break in the power supplied to a coal-fired power station will be
counteracted by the reserves that build up in the coal store.  A coal store
must be placed within two squares of the coal mine that services it.

Hints
~~~~~
Various circumstances can result in a break in the power supply, many of
them natural occurrences.  Although power is one of the last things to be
'dropped' by the population, power sources in a city that is inadequately
serviced will eventually decay.  Power reserves at this stage can be vital
to helping you rebuild a city.

         -=- 48 -=-


OIL RIG
~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Oil rigs allow you to mine oil from the planet.  They can be either land or
sea based.  If they are sea based, the oil will need to be piped first to
the refinery, and from there on to a power station.

Hints
~~~~~
Having oil rigs on the sea can save you valuable land space for building,
and also opens up to you a wide area outside the confines of your land that
you can use to find a power source.

See also: Pipelines, Oil Refinery, Oil Store.

         -=- 49 -=-

OIL REFINERY
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
An oil refinery is the intermediate stage necessary in the production of
power from oil.  It takes the crude oil from an oil rig, and processes it
to a usable form.


Hints
~~~~~
This 'extra stage' in the production of power ma~es Pipeline an oil-fired
power source an expensive option to use.  However, oil fired power has its
advantages, notably that it can be mined off-shore.

See also:  Pipelines, Oil Rig, Oil Store, Oil-fired Power Station

         -=- 50 -=-

OIL FIRED POWER STATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
An oil fired power station, managing approximately 150 blocks, will provide
power to a fairly large city.  Its pollution level is lower than that of a
coal fired power station, but higher than that of a nuclear one.

Hints
~~~~~
Although oil based power supplies do generate pollution, it is at a level
considerably below that of coal fired supplies, so much so that it is
nearly an 'environmentally acceptable' way of generating power.  However,
you will be buming a fossil fuel, which does diminish the natural resources
of the planet.

         -=- 51 -=-


OIL STORE
~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Oil stores can be placed anywhere in the chain between the oil rig and and
an oil-fired power station.


Hints
~~~~~
Oil stores are quite important as a contingency against a problem with
piping oil from the sea to the refinery.  They allow you time to rebuild
your supply lines without removing power from your cities.

See also:  Pipelines, Oil Refinery, Oil-fired Power Station.

         -=- 52 -=-

URANIUM MINE
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Uranium is the most difficult mineral to find on the planet, but produces
by far the most power.  Mines are the first construction in the nuclear
chain.

Hints
~~~~~
Because of its relative rarity, you may find it useful to do a seismic
survey to find out whether there is a good chance of striking uranium in
the area that you are developing.

See also: Nuclear Power Station.

         -=- 53 -=-


NUCLEAR POWER STATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Nuclear power stations are by far the most powerful source of energy for
your planet:  it can power around twice the number of city blocks that a
coal- fired power station can.  In order to operate, a nuclear power
station needs to be connected to a uranium mine, and must be linked to the
sea via a pipeline.  Although they cost more to develop, they give you a
source of nearly pollution-free power.  You will need a nuclear power
station to produce re- processable waste for use in military applications.

Hints
~~~~~
Beware when using nuclear power:  although clean and efficient, it is very
dangerous if anything goes wrong.  It is a very good idea to check that you
are not building on seismic faults, where earthquakes can occur quite
often!

See also:  Uranium Mine, Ur-anium Store,Pipelines, Nuclear reprocessing
plant

         -=- 54 -=-

URANIUM STORE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
A uranium store will keep a supply of uranium going to your power station
if one of your mines gets cut off.  It must be placed within two squares of
the mine in order to be supplied, and within two squares of the power
station to supply that.

Hints
~~~~~
As you will be supplying very large cities with nuclear power, it is vital
to have a provision against a possible power cut, which would affect your
cities very badly.  Also, if you are engaging in nuclear conflict, your
supply of nuclear fuel to the reprocessing plant is very important.

See also:  Uranium Mine, Nuclear Power Station, Nuclear reprocessing plant.

         -=- 55 -=-

NUCLEAR REPROCESSING PLANT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
Nuclear reprocessing plants have two functions:  to cut down the waste
emanating from nuclear power stations, and to make that waste into a form
useable for military applications.  You will therefore require a nuclear
reprocessing plant to produce the plutonium you need to engage in nuclear
conflict.  Without it, your military forces remain entirely
conventional-based.

Hints
~~~~~
By reprocessing the waste nuclear fuel you cut down pollution from nuclear
power to virtually nothing, thus making nuclear power a very
environmentally acceptable option.  However, used in nuclear conflict, this
reprocessed fuel is anything but environmentally friendly!

BATTLE TOOL
~~~~~~~~~~~
Function
~~~~~~~~
This tool icon does not in fact cio anything.  It appears when you open the
battle menu, or engage in battle instructions.  It is simply there to show
your current status.

         -=- 57 -=-

INFORMATION REQUESTER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Function
~~~~~~~~
The information requester will give you data on whichever blocks you then
click on.  It will show you the following things:

Block examined: The icon of the block you clicked


Block name: The name of the block you clicked on

Block owner:  Who owns the block:  you, the serial player, or the computer
player.

Block data:  Information on the current status of the block.


BUILDING YOUR CITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How to go about it

A city is very complex, and there are many different ways in which to
create one.  In Global Effect you will find that you have considerable
choice as to how you do this.  You will be able to decide on which forms of
power to use, where they are placed, how you deal with sewage and supply
problems, and even defense.

Starting your city construction will be the hardest thing to do.  When you
start the game on a 'Create a world' scenario, you will be starting from
scratch, in other scenarios your cities may already be present.  Initially
we shall discuss starting a new city from scratch, showing how we could
build one up - which will be of benefit regardless of your choice of game
type.

It is a wise idea to start with a natural forrn of power, either solar or
wind power.  This way you will not have to sPend much of your energy, and

will start generating power immediately.  You can now either use cables to
separate your power station from your city, or just select city
construction from the tools menu and begin.  Either way, you will be
constructing your first settlements.  When you build them, they will be in
dark colors, but, once power has been supplied to them and they are
connected, (which can take a varying amount of time depending on the form
of power you are using and how complicated the cabling is) they will light
up, indicating that you have a powered and working city.

At this point, Global Effect comes to life.  Cities, given power and plenty
of clear land, expand all by themselves.  You will have to be careful of
this initially, as it is very easy for a city to expand beyond your control
at such a rate that you effectively bankrupt yourself.  It is a good idea
to start small, and keep things bordered in with trees, or city borders.


         -=- 59 -=-


If you do have a serious problem with city expansion, and you have little
power left, as a last ditch attempt, you can demolish a row of city blocks
around the edges; this will cost less than building a city border, trees or
a national park but will be at the expense of an area of city.

If you do demolish a city, or any other man made block, you will create
wasteland.  Wasteland is an area of land that cannot be used for
construction because it is full of industrial waste of various types, which
could be anything from pollution on a large scale, or a derelict city that
has been demolished.  Over a long period of time, wasteland turns back to
usable land - but if you have lots of power, and wish to accelerate this
process, then you can select the 'Convert waste to grasssland', a very
expensive method of creating useable land again.  Beware of having too much
wasteland.  When you have suffered a conventional attack, land will be
reduced to waste if it had man made blocks on it.  Only a very few man made
items do not revert to waste.

Pipes, cables, farms and natural power stations will revert to useable
grass land again if demolished.  Once your city gets to a reasonable size,
it will start to require some basic services.  These include a fresh water
supply, a sewage disposal system, a good farming network, and possibly some
effective usage of recycling plants.  You will have to supply all of these;
be careful where you build your sewage and water plants, as these require a
non-shared pipeline to the sea, which can only be finite in length.  As a
general rule, a service block, such as a farm for instance, is capable of
supplying to an area of 16 blocks square.

Natural power is very bad for supplying a reliable source of power to large
cities, and simply having large numbers of them may not help.  Sooner or
later, you will have to decide whether to invest in developing natural
power sources' efficiency decide which one of the other available forms of
power to use next.  These are, coal, oil and nuclear Coal is cheap, and is
usually the best way to start.


         -=- 60 -=-


but in order to power really large cities without suffering massive
pollution problems, you will have to consider oil and nuclear.

Once you have decided on one of these forms of power, unless you wish to
build mines and use pot luck, you will have to use seismic surveys.  These
are an expensive, but very reliable, way of telling you about the area of
land you are looking at.  Not only does it tell you the probability of
striking coal, oil or uranium, but it tells you how likely seismic
activity, such as volcanoes and earthquakes are to happen.

While building your city, be sure to keep a good eye on the information you
receive in the message area at the top of the screen.  They will be helpful
pieces of information telling you how you are getting on, and what is
happening.

THE BATTLE SYSTEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
War is the single most serious ecological event that can happen to your
world.  In a matter of seconds, you can undo tens of years of careful
environmental planning .  Your actions may even be fatal for both you and
the other player.  You can conduct your military gameplay as either
defensive, aggressive or both.

When you decide that you want to deal with the military aspects of a
civilization, you must select the Battle Menu option from your GovCon.  A
new menu will slide down, showing you the various military options you have
available to you.  Before you can perform any of these tasks, you will have
to build a HQ.  This is a very expensive item, and without it you cannot
defend yourself, or launch any kind of strike.  Once you have a HQ, you
will be able to select the battle map, and consider building up your
forces.


Airbase
~~~~~~~
An airbase takes a considerable amount of space (four blocks).  Once built,
you are able to launch planes.  Planes are reasonably expensive to
launch,but can carry multiple payloads.  In addition to this advantage,
after they have performed their missions, they can come home and land
again.


Seabase
~~~~~~~
This is the most expensive, but most versatile, option available to you.
In order to construct one of these you will need to find a suitable area of
coast.  A sea base takes up two sqaures of coastland.  Once you have this
you will be able to launch ships.  Ships are slow, but they are mobile
missile sites.  You are able to launch both conventional and nuclear
missiles from

         -=- 63 -=-

Early Warning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are essential if you wish to defend yourself effectively against
enemy attack.  They watch over an area of around 100 blocks and should
anything suspicious happen, you will get a warning message and the alert
will sound.  It is a good idea to defend your most important military and
economic targets.

HQ
~~
The HQ is the most expensive item that Global Effect has.  Once you have
this, you are deemed to posess the staff and control to actually oversee
and conduct a military campaign.  You need one to do any of the other
options listed here.

There are certain limitations as to where yo construct your HQ.  When you
first start yo you will be at your original home point.  Everything that
happens is centred around this point.  More importantly, your HQ must be
close to here.  If you try to build your HQ too far away from this point
you will be warned, and you can press on the centre button of the movement
control on the GovCon to go to your original siting point.

         -=- 64 -=-

Goto HQ
~~~~~~~
Pressing on this will take you to your HQ, power permitting.


Quit
~~~~
This quits the battle menu and returns you to the main GovCon panel.


Battle Stat Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have selected this option, a world map will be generated showing
just two colors, one for coastlines, and one for landmasses.  In addition
to this, all of your own military actions are plotted, including Early
Warning coverage areas, all of your bases, and current active units.

         -=- 65 -=-

Missile Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the cheapest of the military items to build .  You need one of
these before you can launch missiles, which are fast, and can carry nuclear
warheads.  Missiles, of course, do not return after their mission, so are
an expensive option, but the only option ifyou wish to conduct a rapid,
suprise, or nuclear strike.

Anti-Missile
~~~~~~~~~~~~
These work like missiles, but are very short range, and very fast.  They
carry conventional warheads, and, if within a short range of an Early
Warning Device, will automatically fire missiles, which will home into the
nearest logged item in the Early Warning device.  On impact they will
explode, and destroy the incoming attacker.  If there is no Early Warning
Device within a short range, then you will have to fire and target the
Anti-Missiles manually, which is done in the same way as launching normal
missiles.

         -=- 66 -=-


HQ Ranges
~~~~~~~~~
Military bases, that's air, missile, ports and early warning devices, must
be built within a certain range of your HQ.  This is so that the HQ can
communicate information to them to enable them to function.  This range is
actually quite a large distance, around thirty to forty seperate blocks
from the HQ's position, so there is a high degree of flexibility when it
comes to organizing your forces.


ACTIVE UNITS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have built your HQ and your first base capable of launching
something, you can engage your first active unit.  An active unit can be a
plane, a missile or a boat.  You have considerable control over your active
units, including selecting and aborting missions, manual control, and self
destruction.

To launch an active unit, you will need to bring up the military base menu.
To do this, hold the right mouse button down over the base (either Air, Sea
or Missile) and click briefly with the left button.  A small menu will
appear.  If you have done this operation over an HQ or an early warning
device, the menu will usually consist of only two options, KILL and CANCEL.
Select kill to destroy the base, or cancel to abort the operation.  If the
base you selected was capable of launching active units, then there will be
a third option, entitled NEW.  Select this to get the Mission Selector
Menu.

         -=- 67 -=-

Mission Selector Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mission targets can be selected on the Battle Status Map, simply by
clicking the mouse where you wish to target.  A small dot will light up to
show it has been selected.  Four targets can be active at any one time.
Any inactive targets are shown as blue on the map.  If you select targets
and launch to them, you can select a four new ones without affecting the
units already flying.  In fact, you can then adjust any unit to a new
mission.


Pressing on the RECALL button on the mission selector recalls the targets
one by one.  You can see the X and Y of these coordinates shown, and fine
adjust them yourself using the arrow buttons if you wish.  Planes and boats
require bombs to be loaded.  On boats, these are actually missiles.  You
can load up to six, power permitting.

until you take control of it, or until it runs out of fuel - with the
exception of boats or anti-missiles.  Boats simply sit in harbour and do
nothing, anti-missiles will try to lock onto a target, and if they fail to
strike, they will then just fly until they drop out of the sky.

Select LAUNCH to launch the unit, and CANCEL to cancel the operation.


If you do not select a mission, but still launch the unit, it will then fly
South East at the default speed If you choose to launch the unit, it will
then start off on its chosen mission.  If you selected missile, and you
have the capability to launch a nuclear strike, then you will get an
additional menu, allowing you to select either conventional or nuclear
warheads.  Nuclear warheads are very expensive.

         -= -68 -=-

CONTROLLING YOUR ACTIVE UNITS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have launched your active unit, you can the decide how involved in
the mission you wish to be.  It can be left to perform its task, or you may
find that you want to ta_k_e over and control it manually, or change its
mission.  You can select an active unit in the same way you bring up the
military base menu, by holding the right mouse button down and clicking on
the left, with the pointer selecting the unit you wish to control.

You now get the Active Unit Control Menu (AUCM).  From the AUCM, you have a
considerable array of options.  You can either destroy the unit immediately
(very rare) using KILL, take manual control by selecting COURSE, allowing
you to specify direction, and, for planes and boats, stop and start (planes
circle), change missions using MISSION, change its aggressiveness :~n(1
~h~.k itC Ct:~tll'i:  usin~2 STATUS.  Mean units will engage any enemy unit
along the way, nice ones wiLl not, BOMB to drop a bomb now, or simply
detonate immediately for a missile, HOME to make this unit retum home, or
CANCEL to abort the menu.

At any time, you can consult your Battle Status Map in order to see where
all of your units are.

         -=- 69 -=-

COLLISIONS BETWEEN ACTIVE UNITS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If two active units collide, then they may fight each other.  Should this
happen, then the most powerful of the units will probably win the battle.
In an emergency, you can use this facility as a form of defense - by simply
aiming a fleet of missiles into the middle of an oncoming attack, you can
reasonably hope to destroy some of the approaching force.

The most powerful active unit is the boat, as it carries a high degree of
defense, missiles, guns to ward of attackers, and it is very large - and is
therefore harder to eliminate.  A plane is next on the list, followed by
missiles.  The least powerful is an anti-missile, but that carries a
special warhead, and will automatically destroy attacking missiles, and
seriously damage, if not eliminate, oncoming planes.  It has little effect
against boats.


THE EFFECTS OF WAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
War is a dangerous thing to engage in if you are not totally ready for it.
Considerable planning may have to go into even the smallest conflict in
order to avoid potentially terrninal damage to your environment.

When a conventional bomb goes off, its effect is to cause minor pollution,
contamination and destroy an area consisting of five blocks.  Repeated
bombing, perhaps even carpet bombing (where you repeatedly bomb in the same
area with a small distance between each bomb, resulting in total
destruction of a strip of land) may cause additional contamination.

Nuclear conflict is where rapid damage is caused.  Be sure that the
environment can take the effects of a nuclear attack before engaging it.
You will also require quite a large amount of power in order to both launch
the missile, and to absorb the damage to the world and start a possible
clean up campaign.  A nuclear explosion causes a considerable amount of


         -=- 70 -=-


contamination, which may render land totally useless to work on.  More than
30% contamination will ensure that you carmot perform any action at all
until it has died down.  Contamination has a bad effect on anything in that
area:  it will cause cities to fall into disrepair, people will die, trees
will die, and considerable amounts of wasteland and maybe even desert can
form.

Repeated contamination will have serious effects on the environmental
balance, causing unpredicted effects (at worst, a nuclear winter) which you
may not be able to cope with.  You may therefore be able to win in the
short run, but could have committed suicide in the long run, so plan before
using!

         -=- 71 -=-

THE ENVIRONMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Global Effect simulates the environment around your cities and wars.
Things you do will affect it, and things it does will affect you.  It is a
very finely balanced system, which is easily upset by both natural and
man-made events.

The world around you consists of 64,000 locations which can be one of the
following basic land types:

Grassland
~~~~~~~~~
Grassland is clear, open, land which you can construct on.  Trees will only
grow on grassland.  It has a moderately positive effect on the environment,
absorbing very minor amounts of pollution and contamination over time.
Excessive pollution and contamination can cause grassland to deteriorate
into wasteland.


Desert
~~~~~~
Desert is sandy land, perhaps once grassland.  This is usually found in
warmer areas of the world, near the equator, but can happen near war-zones.
If deserts expand over your cities, they will absorb them and reduce them
to rubble (or perhaps wasteland) as they go.  Trees on grassland around
borders of deserts can go a long way to slowing the advancement of deserts,
but cannot prevent it totally.  Nothing can be built on deserts.


Mountains
~~~~~~~~~
Mountain areas can not be demolished.  They are the only permenent features
of the world.  You may find mountainous areas of land surrounding deserts.
You cannot build over them.


Swamp Land
~~~~~~~~~~
This is found in the tropics normally.  It is grassland that has become
waterlogged, and is usually found near the coast or at the foots of
mountains.  You

         -=- 72 -=-

cannot build on this land, and over time, if conditions are right it can be
made to dry up so you can work there.


Polar Caps
~~~~~~~~~~
They are the polar equivalents of deserts:  plain, inhospitable, areas of
land that are cold.  The world has two polar caps, and, if temperatures
rise, they will melt causing sea levels to rise slightly.  The inverse
effect will cause sea levels to fall, revealing new land.


Trees
~~~~~
There are two sorts of trees, coniferous, and deciduous.  Coniferous trees
will provide their effect all year round, but grow only in the cooler
regions of the world.  If you build them elsewhere, they will die quickly.
They take longer to grow, and therefore cost more.  Decidious trees are
quick to grow, and provide a more efficient way of reducing pollution and
contamination.  These grow best in the tropics and in the equatorial areas.
Be careful to plant the right trees in the right places:  bordering in a
city at the equator with coniferous trees may not be such a good idea, as
the trees will~die rapidly, and your city may suddenly expand rapidly and
beyond your control.


Wasteland
~~~~~~~~~
Although it has already been discussed elsewhere, its included here to make
this section more complete.  Wasteland cannot be built on, although you can
run cables and pipes over it.  It is dead land, but if conditions are
favourable it will revert to grassland over a period of time, or, if power
is sufficient you can do this yourself.


Sea
~~~
Sea, or water, is vital for your survival.  You will need your oceans for
lots of things:  for sewage, for fresh water and nuclear power, for
instance.  Your military actions with boats also depend on it.

         -=- 73 -=-

Contamination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the last of the basic land types.  Contaminated land is bad news:
it causes things around it to die, or fall into disrepair.  Over a period
of time it will revert to wasteland, and then grassland, but this takes a
long long time.  You can help this process by planting trees around
contaminated areas if radiation levels permit this.  Contamination can be
caused by serious over-pollution or combat.



ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This section is purposely scarse, in order for the game to be more
difficult.  Lots of the effects on the environment are obvious:  if you
chop all the trees down, then there is nothing to produce oxygen, absorb
pollution and C02, so effects on the temperature and sea levels will happen
accordingly.

In some conditions, it acts as a positive feedback, the effects will be
exaggerated along the same line as you go on and so forth, and these may
have to be stopped rapidly in order to avoid total doom.

Likewise it can work in a negative way - things you do can dampen these
effects further on in the game.

You will have too look at your environmental status graphs, such as C02,
temperature, and pollution, in order to gauge your next actions.  These
graphs will provide you with limited information on request, such as the
percentage growth since the last

         -=- 74 -=-

measurement for example.  This will allow you to see quickly and at little
cost what has happened as a result of your actions.


In addition to these coverage graphs, you also have a balance bar chart
which shows at a glance the rate of expansion or contraction of the various
land types (all of the above described land types will be listed except
sea, wasteland and contamination).  If you check this table around one game
year after a small nuclear conflict, you may have extreme cause for concem!



DISASTERS AND SEISMIC ACTIVITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are several things that can happen to your world that are beyond your
control.  These are the natural disasters, which in most cases are caused
by seismic activity.


Earthquakes
~~~~~~~~~~~
If an earthquake occurs you will recieve a warning message, and you can
then click on the button to the right of the message display to be
transported directly (power permitting) to the area in question.  The
effects of an earthquake are to reduce some cities to rubble, and to fell
trees.  The amount of damage done will depend on the strength of the
earthquake.  Earthquakes can be brought on artificially by conflict.


Volcanoes
~~~~~~~~~
These are rarer, but also happen in seizmically unstable areas of land.  If
they do occur, they simply cause a vast new mountain to appear, and lots of
air pollution will appear.  Surrounding land may be damaged, and there
could be an accompanying earthquake too.

      =-= 75 -=-

Other Effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are additional natural disasters that can potentially occur, but
these will remain hidden and you can discover yourself what they are.  Each
of them provides a different environmental problem.



CARING FOR YOUR ENVIRONMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You will have to take special care to keep pollution at a minimum.
Continual usage of coal fired power stations for example, coupled with bad
waste re- processing will result in bad environmental effects.

         -=- 76 -=-

THE COMPUTER PLAYER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have selected create a world against the computer player, or one of
the scenarios where it is active, then not only do you have to consider
your environmental problems, but you suddenly have his problems to deal
with also.  If the computer player engages in an industrial expansion
program, then you will have to clean up the aftermath unless you can stop
it from happening - which is where combat comes into play.

On the scenarios other than create a world, you will find that the computer
players statistics are already set up for you.  If you select create a
world you get to decide for yourself how the computer player will conduct
the game, whether in a military, environmental or industrial fashion, or
any combination of the three.

The computer player is very intelligent, and it may suprise you sometimes
in its actions.  Quite possibly you will learn lots of new tactics watching
it play against you!


         -=- 77 -=-

THE SERIAL PLAYER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With this option, you can link two machines together and play head to head.
So long as you have the correct cable, you can link any of the formats
available together.  For example, you can link an Amiga to a IBM-PC
compatible.  See the appendix on making a null modem cable for further
information.

You will get the option to decide on four speeds of operation.  The
transmission speed that you select will depend on the length of your cable,
and the speed of the machines that you are using.

If one of the machines is a normal unaccelerated Amiga 500, it is
recommended that you use 9600 baud, but, if the cable is very long, 4800
baud.  If you are using fast PC compatibles, such as 10 to 12Mhz, you can
try 14.4K or 19.2K.

If you are unsure of the speed to use, select 9600.  If you have problems
with the link, such as serial sync.  errors, or strange problems with the
game, try it again using 4800.

Although it is technically possible to play Global Effect using a Modem, it
is not recommended at all.  Because of the vast volumes of data that are
transferred between the two machines, it is not possible to use extensive
self-correcting error protocols, which means that unless the line is at
least 95% accurate then it will not work.  Many modem- based protocols
pause regularly to recalcuate line speeds.  This would crash a game of
Global Effect.

The modem facility is present, but use it with care.

         -=- 78 -=-

MAKING A NULL MODEM CABLE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A null modem cable is the cable that is required for you to link together
two machines (Amigas can be linked to IBM PC Compatibles without any
problem).  The cable is fairly simple to make, but it is recommended that
you buy one if you have no previous experience with a soldering iron.  Make
sure that if you do buy one, that you imperatively get a Null Modem Cable:
the cable linking your serial port to an existing printer, modem, or other
serial device will NOT function correctly, and one or both of the machines
might get damaged by it.

If you are constructing your own cable, be very careful that you connect up
the cable correctly.  Millennium can in no way accept responsibility for
any damage to your equipment due to your handiwork!

THE CABLE
~~~~~~~~~
If you take the appropriate care, the cable is in fact very simple to
construct.  You will require only:

2 of 25way D connectors, both female.  Connecting cable of a length
suitable for your needs.

The D connectors should be linked as follows:

2 <----> 3
3 <----> 2

4 <----> 5
5 <----> 4

7 <----> 7


To summarize, pin 2 of one goes to pin 3 of the other, and vice versa;
thesame goes for pins 4 and 5, and pin seven is connected directly across.
