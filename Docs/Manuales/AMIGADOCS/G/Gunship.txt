     using the GUNSHIP simulation with an Amiga. Your package should
     include one disk, an Operations Manual, two keyboard overlays, and this
     Technical Supplement.
     
     Computer Systesm
     This version of GUNSHIP will operate only with the following computer
     systems:
     
     	Amiga 500, Amiga 1000, Amiga 2000
     
     System Requirements:  Your system must include the following:  Color
     Monitor, Minimum 512K memory, One floppy disk drive.
     
     Other Support:  The following accessories are supported but not
     required:
     
     	Hard drive, Joystick (recommended), Mouse.
     
     QUICKSTART INSTRUCTIONS
     Caution:  GUNSHIP is an accurate-simulation of a combat helicopter. Do
     not attempt to jump in and fly by instinct.  Unless you've flown real
     helicopters, read Part 1 (Operating Instructions) in the Operations
     Manual and learn to fly using the tutorials.
     
     Load Disk:  To load GUNSHIP, read the appropriate section of this
     supplement. Place the overlay for your computer on your keyboard.
     
     Skim Operations Manual:  Skim the "Cockpit & Status Panels" and
     "Controls" sections of the Operations Manual to familarize yourself
     with the helicopter.  Also glance through "A Practical Guide to
     Helicopter Flying."  Specific controls for your machine are included
     in this supplement; detailed descriptions are found in the Operations
     Manual.
     
     Follow the tutorials:  Turn to "Beginner's Tutorial 1 - Learning to
     Fly a Helicopter."  Follow it step by step, referring to the "Cockpit"
     and "Controls" sections as needed.  Then follow "Beginners tutorial
     II".
     
     Being Combat Flying:  If you are still uncertain about flying after
     both tutorials, continue flying the USA training area. Refer to "A
     Practical Guide to Helicopter Flying" and "Aerodynamics" in the
     Operations Manual and try the tutorials again.
     
     Do Not Volunteer:  Don't volunteer for Western Europe. Watch the risk
     level as you select your options. Keep your risk low at first.  Above
     all, avoid the 1st line in Western Europe. The Warsaw Pact is the most
     formidable enemy on this planet.
     
     LOADING INSTRUCTIONS - FLOPPY DRIVE
     Loading:
     1. Plug the mouse into Port 0 of the computer.
     2.  If you are using a joystick, plug it into Port 1.

     GUNSHIP
     The Helicopter Simulation from MicroPose
     
     In the early 20th Centruy, the tank changed the nature of warfare. 
     Now, in the late 20th Centruy, warfare has entered another phase with
     the introduction of the helicopter.  The most potent of the new arrior
     helicopters -- virtually a flying tank -- is the "Gunship."
     
     GUNSHIP from MicroProse depicts the Western World's finest attack
     helicopter the AH-64A Apache.  This computer simulation faithfully
     recreates the weapons, flight systems and performance of the real
     machine.  You control a flying arsenal that includes laser-guided
     Hellfire missiles, a 30mm cannon controlled by helmet gunsights,
     clusters of unguided "bombardment" rockets -- even air-to-air missiles
     for duels with enemy helicopters.
     
     GUNSHIP starts with flight training at a base in the USA.  Simple,
     clear tutorials teach you to handle your own attack copter.  Once the
     controls and flying skills are mastered, there are escalating
     challenges and hundreds of missions in any one of four regions of the
     world.  These include guerilla warfare in Southeast Asia, conventional
     warfare gainst third-world powers in Central American, desert battles
     in the Middle East, and the ultimate test -- facing the USSR and its
     Warsaw Pact allies in Western Europe.

     INTRODUCTION
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~
     In the early days of flying "barnstormer" pilots flew by the seat of
     their pants -- following roads and rivers, even dipping down to read
     roadsigns!  That grand tradition of individual flying is found today
     among helicopter pilots.  They love getting down among the hills and
     trees to do some "interesting" flying.
     
     Just flying a helicopter is loads of fun, but here at MicroProse we
     wanted more.  We wanted to fly a combat helicopter in simulated battle
     conditions.  All kinds of battles from guerilla wars to a hypothetical
     USA-USSR war in Europe.  Pop over a hill, launch a Hellfire, dodge a
     SAM, jam a ZSU's radar, then duck behind cover again.  GUNSHIP is a
     simulation of everything we wanted.
     
     Now you can experience the danger, excitement, courage, and agony of
     real combat helicopter flying -- without the bloodshed and suffering
     that occur in real warfare.  GUNSHIP portrays actual ground scales,
     flight speeds and weapons systems.  The AH-64A is the "highest tech"
     helicopter flying today, replete with lasers, cameras, night viewers,
     infra red and radar warnings, jammers, computers, composite materials,
     engine signature suppressors, and a plethora of weapons. The TADS
     (Target Aquisition & Designation Sight) system is a computerized fire
     control system, also simlated within you computer!  Faithfully
     reproducing the AH-64A systems, capabilities, and limitations was an
     enormous undertanking.  Creating GUNSHIP took much longer than we
     expected.
     
     We're sure you'll agree our time was well spent GUNSHIP is the most
     detailed and realistic simulation of combat helicopter flying ever for
     home computer.  For us, it's the next best thing to joining the US
     Army and flying the real aircraft.  So grab your IHADSS helmet, jump
     into the cockpit, and swing into action with our AH-64A Apache
     gunship!
     
     PREPARING TO FLY THE AH-64A APACHE
     
     On most screens you'll see a small arrow pointer.  Your joystick,
     mouse, and cursor control keys (depending on your computer) move the
     arrow.  To make a selection, move the arrow onto the picture or box
     and then press the joystick fire button, mouse click button, or the
     return key on the keyboard.
     
     VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION:  Telling the good guys from the bad guys takes
     practice.  Examine the vehicle drawing and compare it to the drawings
     in the "Military Equipment" section of this manual.  Move the pointer
     to the box beside the correct name and press fire/click/return.
     
     DEFAULTS:  Here you see the last mission flown" the pilot, his duty
     assignment (region of the world), style of flying, and reality levels. 
     To change any of the defaults point to the appropriate box in the
     upper left and press fire/click/return.  If the defaults shown are
     fine, point to "Continue" and press fire/click/return.
     
     The combination of duty assignment (region), style, and reality
     determines the overall level of risk for your next mission.  The level
     of risk affects your scoring, promotion, and decorations.
     
     AH-64A PILOT ROSTER:  This summarizes the "service records" of pilots
     on the disk.  To select a name, point to the name itself and press
     fire/click/return.  This highlights the name.  Point to "Continue" and
     press fire/click/return to return to the defaults.
     
     To enter a new name (such as your own!), select a name you wish to
     replace, then point to "Erase Pilot" and press fire/click/return. 
     Type the new name and press RETURN/ENTER. This new name appears in the
     roster.  The old name is erased, permanently.
     
     Each pilot's service record includes a list of awards, decorations,
     and reprimands, followed by a number indicating the quantity of each. 
     The letter abbreviations are:  ACM-Army Commendation Medal.  AM-Air
     Medal, BSV- Bronze Star, CAC-Central America Campaign Ribbon,
     CMHO-Congressional Medal of Honor, DSC-Distinguished Service Cross,
     KIA-Killed in Action, MEC-Middle East Campaign Ribbon, MIA-Missing in
     Action, NDS-National Defense Service Medal, PH-Purple Heart,
     SEAC-Southeast Asia Campaign Ribbon, SR-Service Reprimand, SS-Silver
     Star, WEC-Western Europe Campaign Ribbon.
     
     DUTY ASSIGNMENT:  You can select five differenet areas of the world
     for combat flying Point to the badgerepresenting the area you desire
     and press fire/click/return.  Point to "Continue" and press
     fire/click/return to return to the defaults.
     
     Beginners should select Flight Training in the USA and follow the two
     tutorials.  combat regions are listed in order of difficultyl, from
     southeast Asia (the easiest) to Western Europe (the most difficult).
     Regions powerfully affect difficulty. Don't expect success in Western
     Europe until you do well in the other regions.
     
     STYLE OF FLING SELECTION:  Within a region, some areas and missions
     are more dangerous than others.  Here you select the level of danger
     you prefer.  Point to the appropriate face and press
     fire/click/return.
     
     Volunteer missions, especially hazardous duty, mean you're facing
     tougher, more accurate, and faster-reacting opponents.  Regular
     missions pit you against "garden variety" Russian-trained troops with
     lesser combat skills.This choice has a powerful effect on mission
     difficulty.
     
     ENEMY & REALITY SELECTION:  Wherever you fly, you can select between a
     "realistic" simulation and an "easy," simplified version.  Point to
     the box beside the option you prefer and press fire/click/return.
     
     "Easy" reality levels may help you learn to fly. Beginners often
     prefer "easy" landings and weather effects. However, use "realistic"
     flying as soon as possible, since experienced GUNSHIP pilots find the
     realistic levels is actually easier to fly in combat.
     
     Enemy quality determines the "newness" of enemy equipment.
     Soviet-equipped First Line troops have modern equipment (for that
     region).  The Second Line rear area and allied forces use older
     equipment.  The Third Line reservists have obsolete equipment.
     
     
     PREPARING TO FLY
     
     BRIEFING:  Here are your flight orders.  They include IMPORTANT
     information you should memorize or write down.  Above all, note the
     password, look up the countersign in this manual and write it down.
     Passwords and countersigns appear at the bottom of each page in
     alphabetical order, starting on page 12.
     
     Also make a note of your primary and secondary objectives.  You'll
     probably want to check the map to see where they are in relation to
     your bases.  It's also wise to note the wind speed and direction (only
     present if you picked realistic weather conditions).
     
     When you're through examining the orders and related information (map,
     intelligence reports, and/or sick call) point to "continue" and press
     fire/click/return.
     
     NOTE:  When flying "Training in the USA" duty the subsequent options
     are greatly abbreviated.  No intelligence report or sick call option
     exists, andno reminders are necessary.
     
     THE SECTOR MAP.  This shows the entire battle area, friendly bases and
     forces in white, your objectives are in violet.  It's purely for
     reference, and to help you plan your mission.
     
     The map coordinates are read military fashion, "right and up."  That
     means the first number is the horizontal scale, the second the
     vertical scale.  For example, 01-12 is the upper left corner.
     
     INTELLIGENCE REPORT:  This report gives additional details about enemy
     forces and equipment.  You may wish to read the "Military Equipment"
     section about these weapons, and/or the "Weapons & Tactics" section
     about how to deal with them.
     
     SICK CALL:  If you decide this mission is too difficult or dangerous,
     you can go on sick call to avoid it.  Read teh advice on the screen
     carefully.
     
     As a rule, pilots decide to be "on sick call" if the objectives are
     distant from friendly base and the enemies are truly formidable. 
     Objectives near a friendly base are always easier, since you spend
     less time in "hostile" airspace.
     
     REMINDERS:  It's important that you know the password, countersign,
     and both objectives (primary and secondary).  Check your notes to make
     sure you have the correct information.  Point to the appropriate box
     and press fire/click/return.
     
     ARMING:  A standard armament appears here for your region.  However,
     you can adjust the stores onyour helicopter to suit your preferences.
     
     To add or subtract cannon ammunition (30mm HEDP), fuel, chaff, and/or
     flares, point to the +" or "-" box and press fire/click/return. 
     You'll see the appropriate quantity change, along with your current
     weight.
     
     To remove armament from the weapons wings, point to the weapons on the
     wind itself and press fire/click/return.  To add a new or different
     armament to a wing, point to the box representing the weaponand press
     fire/click/return to "pick up" the weapon.  The weapon is now attached
     to your pointer.  Move it to the wing and fire/click/return to release
     it.  If there is already a weapon at that position, the new one
     replaces the previous one.
     
     Weapons must be balanced.  Whenever you add or subtract a weapon to
     one wing, the other automatically changes too.  The wingtips carry
     AIM-9L Sidewinders only (anything else is too heavy). The interior
     wing stations can carry any weapon.  The maximum weight figure near
     the bottom is the maximum takeoff weight for the region and weather. 
     You cannever add weapons that exceed this limit.
     
     Point to "Continue" and press fire/click/return to begin flying. 
     Select "Clear" to eliminate all stores from your helicopter.  Press
     "Sick Call" if you've got cold feet and want to back out of the
     mission.  Sometimes even experienced pilots do this if unfavorable
     weather causes an impossibly low maximum weight on a dangerous
     mission.
     
     IMPORTANT!  KNOW YOUR PASSWORD & COUNTERSIGN
     
     The briefing screen on page 8 tells you the password for this mission. 
     YOU MUST KNOW THE COUNTERSIGN.  At the page bottoms in this manual you
     will see a password followed by a countersign.  Find the page with the
     briefing's password, and then write down the countersign that follows.
     
     When you approach any friendly heli-base, you will get a radio message
     giving the password and asking for the countersign.  If you do not
     type in the proper countersign and press "RETURN/ENTER" base defenses
     will presume you are an enemy and shoot you down!

     COCKPIT & STATUS PANELS of the AH-64A Apache Simulator
     
     The cockpit* is the main control used in flight.  You "see" the
     landscape through the armored glass as you fly.  A fixed crosshairs
     sight aids in pitch orientation and firing FFAR unguided rockets. A
     moving box (reticle) represents your IHADSS helmet gunsight (TADS).
     This box changes from dark to light color, depending on the current
     accuracy of your selected weapon (dark is low accuracy, light is
     higher accuracy). Below the cockpit glass are the dials, gauges, and
     displays of the helicopter cockpit.
     
     *Cockpit layout differs on some computer systems.  See the appropriate
     section of the Technical Supplement for details.
     
     INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTIONS
     
     AIRSPEED:  This dial shows your horizontal speed through the air in
     knots.  A speed of 100 knots equals about 114 mph,or about 167
     feet/second.
     
     ALTIMETER:  This dial shows your altitude in feet.  The rotary needle
     is marked in tens of feet (i.e., if the needle points to "1", read it
     as 10 feet).  The digital readout in the center shows your altitude to
     thousands (left digit) and hundreds (right digit) of feet.  For
     example, a digital readout of 13 and needle at 6 means one thousand,
     three hundred, and sixty (1360) feet.
     
     ATITUDE & ARTIFICIAL HORIZON*:  This ball-gauge shows your pitch (nose
     up or down) and your roll (left or right). The blue part represents
     the sky, the black part the ground.
     
     CRT DISPLAY:  This small display screen has three separate modes of
     operation.  The TADS Target Mode shows a zoom-camera view of the
     target on which TADS is "locked".  The display also shows the range to
     target (in kilometers) in the upper left corner and the zoom
     magnification in the upper right.  For example, "1.2" and "x32"
     indicates the target is 1.2 kilometers (1200 meters) away and that
     your CRT view is magnified 32 times.
     
     The Map Mode shows a small detail of the large sector map.  This
     detail is centered on your helicopter.  The only exception is when
     your helicopter is flying near or along the edge of the combat area.
     
     The Radio Message Mode shows a radio message you just received.  Once
     a message is displayed, it disappears.  The display does not
     "remember" previous messages.
     
     CRT PROMPT:  This line prompts you whenever new information is
     available.  For example, when a radio message arrives, "RADIO MSG"
     appears here.  "TARGET" means a new potential target is present - you
     can use teh TADS to find the new target.  If your TADS is locked on a
     target and displaying its type, the "TARGET" message no longer
     appears, even if another target is available.
     
     ENGINE & ROTOR GAUGES*:  The left and right yellow strips show the
     RPMs of the port (left) and starboard (right) engines.  The center
     yellow strip shows the main rotor RPM (revolution per minute).
     
     FUEL GAUGE*:  The two yellow strips titled "F" show the amount offuel
     remaining in the forward and aft tanks.  The forward tank is the left
     gauge, the aft tank is the right gauge.
     
     HEADING & COURSE INDICATORS*:  The white arrow represents your current
     heading (facing), and always remains centered.  The green arrow
     represents your current course.  Normally it is aligned with the white
     arrow, but will shift left or right if you're skidding sideways.  The
     red arrow beneath represents the course to your current destination. 
     When the green, red and white arrows are superimposed, you are on
     course.
     
     *Colors may vary on some computer systems.  See the appropriate
     section of the Technical Supplement for details.
     
     INFRA RED (IR) WARNING & JAMMING LIGHTS*:  The "T" warning light turns
     red whenever an infra red (IR) signature weapon is approaching your
     helicopter.  If you turn on your IR jammer, the neighboring light
     turns green while the jammer is running.  If the jammer is successful,
     the red warning light turns off.
     
     There are no enemy IR searching devices, and therefore no flashing red
     IR warning.
     
     INS DESTINATION INDICATOR (INS = Inertial Navigation System):  This
     digital readout indicates the course to your current destination. 
     When the INS readout matches the digital compass readout, you are on
     course.
     
     RADAR WARNING & JAMMING LIGHTS*:  The "R" warning light flashes red
     whenever enemy search radar "sweeps" over your helicopter.  When enemy
     tracking (firing) radar for either guns ormissiles locks onto you, the
     light turns solid red. If you turn on your radar jammer, the
     neighboring light turns green while the jammer is running.  If the
     jammer is successful, the solid red warning light turns off.
     
     NOTE:  Your jammer cannot discourage radar searches, so flashing red
     warnings may continue even if your jammer is successful in stopping a
     tracking (firing) radar.
     
     ROTARY & DIGITAL COMPASS:  The needle on this compass indicates your
     current heading, with a digital readout directly below.  Note that the
     compass shows the heading your helicopter faces.  During a sideways
     skid or backwards flight your actual course is different.
     
     ROTOR DESENGAGED WARNING LIGHT*:  This light shows red if the rotor is
     desengaged (i.e., spinning freely, unconnected to the engines).  The
     light is off when the rotor is engaged.
     
     STORES SELECTION:  The AH-64 Apache can carry up to six different
     types of dispensable stores (offensive and defensive expendables).
     Each has a different colored light, with thenumber of "units of fire"
     shown beneath (a unit of fire is how often you can use that item
     before you run out).  Inactive stores are unlighted.
     
     Only one offensive weapon can be armed at a time.  The weapon
     currently ready is lighted.  Offensive weapons can include:
     
     	AIM-9L 'sidewinder air-to-air guided missiles.
     	2.75" FFAR unguided air-to-ground rockets.
     	AGM-114A Hellfire air-to-ground guided missiles.
     	30mm Chain Gun Cannon (in 20-round bursts).
     
     Defense stores light up when used.  the light remains on as long as
     the defense is functioning (about 10-20 seconds).  Defensive stores
     can include:
     
     	Flare decoys to use against IR-guided weapons
     	Chaff decoy to use against radar-guided weapons
     
     As a point of information, each defensive store unit of fire is a
     group of three cartridges.
     
     *Colors may vary on some computer systems.  See the appropriate
     section  of the Technical Supplement for details.
     
     
     SYSTEMS DAMAGE LIGHTS*:  These lights show the status of major systems
     on board your helicopter.  A green light means the system is
     functioning correctly, a colored light means the system is
     malfunctioning.  Reading from left to right the systems are:
     
     	R		main rotor
     	O		Nose optics (controls TADS)
     	A		formward avionics bay (gauges)
     	G		chain gun (30mm cannon)
     	F		forward fuel tank
     	W		port weapons wing
     	W		starboard weapons wing
     	E		port engine
     	E		starboard engine
     	F		aft fuel tank
     	A		Aft avionics bay (jammers)
     	L		chaff decoy launcher
     	L		flare decoy launcher
     	R		tail rotor (controls rotation)
     
     THREAT DISPLAY*: This screen shows nearby enemy weapons that threaten
     your helicopter.  Red dots are enemy guns and launchers tracking or
     firing on your helicopter.  White dots are missiles in flight. This
     includes both enemy missiles AND your missiles. A red-and-white
     flashing dot is an enemy helicopter.  The top of the threat display
     represents your heading (i.e, "ahead").
     
     The threat display operates at two ranges:  long and short.  Normally
     the display shows "long" range with two concentric circles.  The inner
     circle shows local enemies (closer than 3 kilometers), the outer
     circle distant enemies (who are generally beyond your maximum
     visibility).
     
     If an enemy missile or helicopter approaches within a few hundred
     meters, the threat display automatically switches to "short range"
     while the treat is close.  This aids you in manuevering against enemy
     helicopters, and/or to evade missiles.
     
     TORQUE GAUGE*:  The two yellow strips titled "T" show the amount of
     torque in the port (left) and starboard (right) jet turbine engines. 
     This is proportional to the collective control and rotor lift.  The
     higher you set the collective, the higher the torque, and the greater
     the lift.
     
     VSI (Vertical Speed Indicator):  This dial shows the rate you are
     changing altitude (ascending or descending). If the needle is
     horizontal, you are maintaining a constant altitude.  If the needle
     dips downward, you're descending toward the ground; if it points
     upward, you're ascending.  The dial is marked in thousands of feet per
     minute.  For example, if the needle points down at "1", then you are
     descending at 1000 feet per minute.
     
     *Colors may vary on some computer systems.  See the appropriate
     section of the Technical Supplement for details.
     
     SECTOR MAP
     You can "look away" from the cockpit view to a large sector map.  This
     map shows the local combat or training area, including all major
     terrain features, friendly troops, installations and your objective.
     Enemy troops and installations appear only as you spot them using the
     TADS gunsight Enemy helicopters never appear on the map. They move too
     quickly for accurate marking. Remember that maps are never 100%
     accurate.  Troop and base positions are especially prone to error.
     
     MAP TERRAIN SYMBOLS* Include the following:
     
     Straight Lines - Road
     Wavy Lines     - Stream
     Small Black rectangle - Building
     Mounds - hill
     Large rectangle - white - Cultivated Area (Field, Rice Paddy,
     Plantation, etc.)
     
     MAP TROOP SYMBOLS* are in white for friendly forces, red for enemy,
     and purple for objectives.
     
     X - Infantry on foot and/or in foxholes
     + - Armored vehicle (tank, personnel carrier, etc.)
     Med. Rectangle Black - Bunker (made of earth, steel and/or concrete)
     A  on its side - Anti-aircraft (AA) gun sites or vehicle
     Upside down T - Surface-to-air missile (SAM) vehicle
     White rectangle with small black box in upper right corner - 			
     		Helicopter base.
     Circle with black at base - Supply depot
     Flag - Headquarters
     *  Colors and symbols may vary on some computer systems.  See the
     appropriate section of the Technical Supplement for details.
     
     STILL IN FLIGHT:  You are still in flight while examining this map. 
     Be sure to look up periodicaly.  Otherwise you might fly into a
     mountain or come under attack.  It's wise to hover in a safe place if
     you spend long periods examining this map.
     
     INS CURSOR*:  (INS=Inertial Navigation System):  the white crosshairs
     on this map represent your current destination. Move the controller to
     move the crosshairs. When you return to the cockpit, the INS
     indicators will help you fly to this destination.
     
     GRID COORDINATES:  The map uses a military grid coordinate system.  To
     describe any position, read "right and up."  That is, the first two
     digits are from the horizontal scale, the last two from the vertical
     scale.  Therefore, 01-01 is the lower left corner, 01-12 is the upper
     left corner, 12-01 is the lower right corner, and 12-12 is the upper
     right corner.
     
     ACCELERATED TIME:  The accelerated time option is available only while
     viewing the sector map.  Time passes at double the normalrate, thus
     halving your flying time between points.
     
     STORES STATUS DISPLAY
     This console displays the stores on your helicopter. Status lights are
     green if the system is functioning correctly, yellow if damaged, red
     if destroyed.  The view of the helicopter on the left side of the
     console shows each system appropriately colored.
     
     STILL IN FLIGHT:  You are still in flight while examining this
     display. Be sure to look up periodically.  Other wise you might fly
     into a mountain or come under attack.  It's wise tohover in a safe
     place if you spend long periods examining this display.
     
     30mm HEDP:  Ammunition for the 30mm Chain Gun cannon.  It uses
     HEDP (high explosive dual puspose) ammunition that is effective
     against all targets except bunkers which it can destroy only
     occasionally. The number indicates the actual number of rounds left. 
     (Each cannon burst is 20 rounds, therefore with 1200 pounds you have
     60 units of fire.)
     
     FORE FUEL:  This is the 156-gallon forward fuel tank.
     
     AIM-9I:  These are air-to-air "Sidewinder" infra red guided missiles.
     
     AGM-114A:  These are air-to-ground "Hellfire" laser-guided missiles. 
     The Hellfire has an armor-piercing warhead for use against vehicles
     and bunkers.
     
     2.75 FFAR:  These are air-to-ground unguided rockets. the FFAR has a
     high explosive warhead for use against infantry.  AA gun sites and
     installations.
     
     AFT FUEL:  This is the 220-gallon rear fuel tank.
     
     CHAFF:  This is the number of chaff decoy cartridges in the tail-boom
     launchers.  Decoys are launched in groups of three.
     
     FLARES:  This is the number of lare decoy cartridges in the tail-boom
     launchers. Decoys are launched in groups of three.
     
     SYSTEMS DAMAGE*
     This console displays the major systems on your helicopter.  The
     indicator lights show green if the system is functioning correctly,
     yellow if damaged, red if destroyed.  the view of the helicopter on
     the left side of the console shows each system appropriately colored.
     
     STILL IN FLIGHT:  You are still in flight while examining this
     display.  Be sure to look up periodically.  Otherwise you might fly
     into a mountain or come under attack.  It's wise to hover in a safe
     place if you spend long periods examining this display.
     
     AFT AVIONICS BAY:  This compartment contains the INS navigation
     computers, and the IR and radar jammers.  Damage can make some of this
     equipment erratic or unreliable; destruction could eliminate it all.
     
     AFT FUE TANK:  This is the rear 220-gallon fuel tank. Damage often
     causes fuel leaks.  If the tank is destroyed all fuel is lost and the
     helicopter may explode.
     
     ANTI-TORQUE (TAIL) ROTOR:  This rotor keeps the helicopter from
     spinning uncontrollably. If the tail rotor is damaged the helicopter
     may wobble or rotate, making flight control difficult.  If the tail
     rotor is destroyed the helicopters spins out of control.
     
     CHAFF & FLARE LAUNCHERS:  The chaff and flare decoy launchers are
     housed in the tail boom.  If a launcher is damaged some or all decoy
     cartridges may not function corrently. If a launcher is destroyed all
     cartridges are lost.
     
     FORWARD AVIONICS BAY:  This compartment contains computers and
     monitoring equipment for flying the helicopter.  Damage or destruction
     can cause the strip gauges and/or round dials to disappear or freeze.
     
     FORWARD FUEL TANK:  This tank contains up to 156 gallons of fuel. 
     Damage often causes fuel leaks.  If the tank is destroyed all fuel is
     lost and the helicopter may explode.
     
     30mm CHAIN GUN:  This is the automatic cannon mounted beneath the
     nose.  If the cannon is damaged it may fire erratically, if destroyed
     it cannot fire at all.
     
     MAIN ROTOR:  This keeps your helicopter airborne.  Damage causes the
     helicopter to vibrate and wobble while flying.  If the rotor is
     destroyed, or a damaged rotor comes apart, the helicopter will crash.
     
     NOSE OPTICS:  This is the heart of the TADS gunsight system.  Damage
     can cause the TADS gunsight to work erraticaly.  Loss of the nose
     optics destroys TADS, making it impossible to fire accurately.
     
     STARBOARD & PORT WINGS:  All rockets and missiles are mounted on these
     weapons wings.  Damage causes the weapons to function erratically; if
     destroyed the weapons on the wing are lost.
     
     STARBOARD & PORT ENGINES:  Normally the rotor is powered by both
     engines combined.  However, the helicopter can fly with one engine
     out.  If an engine is damaged or destroyed it automatically shuts down
     and cannot be restarted until repaired (this minimizes the risk of
     fire or explosion).
     
     A PRACTICAL GUIDE to Flying helicopters
     
     AN INTRODUCTION TO HELICOPTER CONTROLS
     When learning to fly use this description in conjunction with the
     section "Beginner's tutorial 1 - Learning to Fly a Helicopter". See
     "Aerodynamics" for a more precise and detailed discussion of
     controlling helicopter flight.
     
     BASIC CONCEPTS:  the two main flight controls are the cyclic joystick
     and the collective.  The cyclic joystick controls the pitch ("nosing"
     up and down) and roll ("leaning" left or right) of the helicopter. 
     the collective changes the angle of attack of the rotor blades (see
     "Aerodynamics" for details).  This changes the lifting force of the
     blades.
     
     The cyclic joystick is controlled with your joystick except on
     computers using mouse control (where the mouse can move the cyclic
     joystick).  Keyboard control of the cyclic joystick is available on
     the IBM PC.
     
     The collective is controlled from the keyboard. On computers with a
     mouse, the mouse can be used to move the collective up and down as
     desired.
     
     Pushing the cyclic joystic forward pitches the helicopter downward
     ("nose down").  This causes the helictoper to gain forward speed.  The
     helicopter will NOT dive until it reaches a steeppitch downward, then
     it dives like anormal aircraft.
     
     Pulling the cyclic joystick back pitches the helicopter upward.  If
     thehelicopter's pitch is upwards (the crosshairs are above the
     horizon) the helicopter will go backwards.  Pitching upward does not
     necessarily mean you will climb!  A common mistake of novicesis to
     assume that the harder they pull back on the cyclic, the faster they
     will climb.  Instead of climbing fast, they end up flying backwards! 
     Watch the crosshair/horizon position to avoid this error.
     
     Pushing the cyclic joystick left or right rolls the helicopter in that
     direction.  At low speeds (under 40 knots) the helicopter skids
     sidewarys.  At faster speeds it performs a banking turn like an
     aircraft. In either case, the further you roll, the more your lift
     decreases.  Novices inlevel flight are often suprised by the loss in
     altitude as they roll left or right.
     
     Moving the collective up increases the amount of lift in the rotor. 
     If you are in level flight, thehigher collective causes you to ascend. 
     The torque will increase as you raise the collective.  When torque
     reaches the maximum vlaue on the gauge you are at maximum lift.
     
     Moving the collective down decreases the amount of lift in the rotor. 
     If you are in level flight, the lower collective causes you to
     descend. The torque decreases as you lower the collective.  Except in
     unusual conditions, you cannot maintain level flight,much less ascend,
     if torque is below 50%.
     
     Anti-torques (tail) Rotor Controls: these controls function only if
     the helicopter ismoving very slowly (just a few knots) or hovering. 
     Each tap on rotate left speeds up the tail rotor and causes the nose
     to swing left.  Each tap on rotate right slows down the rotor and
     causes the nose to swing right.  Tap stop rotation to return the tail
     rotor to normal speed, ending all rotation.
     
     EASY vs REALISTIC FLIGHT	
     
     When you start GUNSHIP, one of the reality options is a choice between
     "easy" simplified flight and "realistic" flight.  MicroProse
     recommends realistic flight because once you learn it controls are
     moreflexible and useful, expecially at high speeds. However if
     realistic flying is too frustrating, try easy flight instead.
     
     EASY FLIGHT:  Here neighter the pitch, roll, altitude nor airspeed of
     thehelicopter has any effect on lift.  This means that regardless of
     how you maneuver the cyclic joystick, lift is unaffected.  Power dives
     are prohibited.
     
     The collective is the only control that affects lift in easy flight. 
     Anytime you want to add lift (to climb, slow your descent, etc.) tap
     the collective up fast or slow, as appropriate. Anytime you want to
     reduce lift (to slow your ascent, begin or increase a descent, etc.)
     tap the collective down fast or slow, as appropriate.
     
     REALISTIC FLIGHT:  Here the pitch, roll, altitude, and airspeed
     affectlift asin a real helicopter. Ground cushion Effect: At altitudes
     of 25' orless you gain a little extra lift at low speeds. The lift
     gained varieswith altitude, and disappears entirely if you're flying
     too fast.  Translational Lift:  At speeds of 30 to 90 knots you gain
     considerable extra lift.  The amount varies with the speed.  Roll &
     Lift: With any significant amount to roll, the helicopter loses some
     lift.  The lift loss increases as the helicopter rolls further left or
     right.  Altitude:  At higher altitudes you have less lift due to the
     thinner air. The lift loss increases as you get higher and higher.
     This loss is only noticeable above 1,000 feet.
     
     Among other things, the use of realistic flight means that a high
     speed you canfly the helicopter not unlike an airplane.  A slight
     pitch up slows the helicopter and causes a climb (by reducing speed
     into the 30-90knot area for maximum translational lift), while a steep
     pitch down puts the helicopter into a fast power dive.
     
     INTRODUCTION TO HELICOPTER FLIGHT
     This section gives a rudimentary view of common concepts in helicopter
     flight. For a more complete and detailed description of how and why
     helictopers fly, see the "Aerodynamics" section.
     
     LEVEL FLIGHT FORWARD:  Inlevel flight the helicopter is pitched down
     ("nose down"). the greater the pitch, the faster the forward flight.
     Note that in forward flight the crosshairs are alwasy below the
     horizon line.  The VSI gauge is horizontal (reading zero), indicating
     flight is level. In combat flying, typical level flight speed is 100
     to 150 knots.
     
     POWER DIVE:  In a power dive the helicopter is pitched down steeply. 
     The crosshairs aresignificantly below the horizon line, and teh VSI
     gauge needle is pointing downward. Power dives usually require speeds
     greater than 160 knots.
     
     FORWARD CLIMB:  When climbing in forward flight, the helicopter is
     travelling slower than normal(pitch is still present, but smaller than
     normal), or the collective control (and engine torque) is higher than
     normal, or both.  The VSI gauge needle is pointing upward.  Forward
     climbs are easiest at speeds of 30 to 90 knots.
     
     HOVER:  Here the helicopter is truly level, with no pitch down or up. 
     Note that the crosshairs are on the horizon line and airspeed is zero
     (needle is vertical).  The collective is adjusted so the VSI gauge is
     horizontal (zero).  From a hover a helicopter can ascend straight
     upwards or descend straight downwards by changing the collective.
     
     BACKWARDS FLIGHT:  When flying backwards the helicopter is pitched
     upwards.  Note that the crosshairs are above the horizon - which only
     occurs when flying backwards.  The airspeed gauge shows the speed
     backwards.  Depending on the speed and amount of collective, the
     helicopter could be ascending, flying level,or descending while moving
     backwards.
     
     SKID SIDEWAYS:  This is only possible at low speeds (under 40 knots)
     or when hovering.  The cyclic joystick is moved left or right to roll
     the helicopter.  Due to a lack of airspeed, the heclicopter skids left
     or right without forward motion.  Unless the collective is adjusted
     appropriately, a skidding helicopter loses some lifting power.
     
     ROTATE LEFT OR RIGHT:  This is only possible at extrememly low speeds
     or when hovering.  The anti-torque (tail or "rudder" controls) rotates
     the helicopter left or right.  Rotation does not affect airspeed or
     VSI.  The cyclic joystick and collective are not used when rotating.
     
     CONTROLS on the AH-64A Apache Simulator
     
     FLIGHT CONTROLS
     This section defines how each control works.  Do not use this section
     as a guide to flying a helicopter.  To learn to fly, follow
     "Beginner's Tutorial #1 - Learning to Fly a Helicopter."
     
     THE KEYBOARD OVERLAY:  An overlay appropriate to your computer
     keyboard is included with the simulation.  The control placement is
     designed for use with this overlay - don't lose it!
     
     NOTE:  Computers sometimes misread multiple key inputs.  Unless
     otherwise indicated, do not press two keys simultaneously.  Do not
     push thejoystick while holding a key.  Pushing the joystick while
     holding a key may cause weird effects.
     
     CYCLIC JOYSTICK:  Pushing forward pitches down the helicopter ("drops
     the nose").  Pulling back pitches up the helicopter ("Raises the
     nose").  Pushing left or right rolls the helicopter in that direction
     ("tilts" the rotor and body left or right).
     
     A pitch below horizontal moves teh helicopter forward. A large pitch
     down causes a power dive.  Pitch up above horizontal moves the
     helicopter backward. Rolling left or right at low speed causes a skid
     (or "Sideslip") left or right.  At medium and high speeds it causes a
     banking turn left or right.
     
     The artificial attitude and horizon indicator shows the current pitch
     and roll of the helicopter.
     
     COLLECTIVE:  This control can be moved up fast (increases lift by
     large amounts) or down slowly (decreases lift by small amounts). When
     you raise or lower the collective, the engine torque changes
     appropriately.  To move the collective a large amount, tap it
     repeatedly and quickly.
     
     Lift keeps the helicopter airborne.  If you start in level flight or
     hover, thenincrease lift, the helicopter ascends.  If you start level
     and decrease lift, the helicopter descends.
     
     ANTI-TORQUE (TAIL) ROTOR:  These function only when hovering or moving
     extremely slow (just a few knots).  Tap rotate left to swing the nose
     left.  Tap rotate right to swing the nose right.  Multiple taps on the
     key increase the rate of rotation.  Tap stop rotation to eliminate all
     rotation.
     PORT or STARBOARD ENGING ON/OFF:  Tap the appropriate key to turn on
     (if currently off) or turn off (if currently on) each engine.  You
     must turn off the engines to finish your flight.
     
     If an engine is damaged or destroyed it turns off automatically.  You
     cannot restart the engine until it is repaired.
     
     ROTOR ENGAGE/DISENGAGE:  Tap this key to either engage the rotor(cause
     the engines to turn the rotor), or disengage the rotor (cause the
     rotor to spin freely, unconnected to the engines). When the rotor is
     disengaged, the collective is automatically "bottomed" (dropped to
     zero).
     
     VIEWING CONTROLS
     
     CHANGE CRT:  The CRT has three display modes.  Each tap on this key
     switches the CRT to the next mode.  These modes are:
     
     (1)  TADS target mode.
     (2)  Map mode.
     (3)  Radio message mode.
     
     If no target is ahead of the helicopter, the TADS target mode does not
     appear.  If no new radio message is available, the radio mode does not
     appear.  If neither a target nor a radio message is available, then
     the CRT is always in map mode.
     
     MAP:  Tap this key to see the full sector map.  You continue flying,
     so beware of flying into something while examining this display.  Tap
     this key again to return to the standard cockpit view.
     
     STORES:  Tap this key to see the stores display.  It shows the status
     of systems with stores, including the amounts remaining.  You continue
     flying, so beware of flying into something while examining this
     display.  Tap this key again to return to teh standard cockpit view.
     
     DAMAGE:  Tap this key to see the systems display.  It shows each
     system and whether it's functional, damaged, or destroyed.  You
     continue flying, so beware of flying into something while examining
     this display. Tap this key again to return to the standard cockpit
     view.
     
     VIEW:  The view center key shows your view directly ahead.  The view
     left key shows your view diagonally ahead to the left.  The view right
     key shows your view diagonally ahead to the right.  Due to the
     engines, transmission, and rotor shaft your rearward view is blocked. 
     Note that the crosshairs are present only on the center view.
     
     COMBAT CONTROLS
     
     GO TO TADS TARGET MODE:  If the CRT is not displaying a TADS target ,
     but the prompt "TARGET" is showing, tap the fire button to switch the
     CRT to TADS.  You can alos use the standard Change CRT control.
     
     NEW TADS TARGET:  Tap this key to move the TADS gunsight box from one
     target to another, showing the new target in the CRT.  If no other
     targets are present directly ahead TADS remains on the original
     target.
     
     WEAPONS:  Tap the appropriate key to select one of the four possible
     weapons:  AIM-9L, Sidewinder missiles, 2.75" FFAR rockets, AGM-114A
     Hellfire missiles, or the 30mm cannon.
     
     FIRE:  Tap the fire button to fire the weapon currently selected. 
     Each tap fires one missile (Sidewinder or Hellfire), a pair of
     rockets, or a burst of 20 cannon rounds.
     
     DROP CHAFF or FLARE DECOY:  Tap the appropriate key to release teh
     appropriate decoy.  The cockpit indicator remains lighted as longa s
     the decoy is functioning.
     
     RADAR or IR JAMMER ON/OFF:  Tap the appropriate key to turn on (if
     currently off) or off (if currently on) the jammer.  When the radar
     jammer is running you see a green light beside the "R" warning light. 
     When the IR Jammer is running you see a green lgiht beside the "I"
     warning light.
     
     JETTISON STORES: To jettison all ammunition for a particular weapon
     hold down the select weapon key and tap Jettison.  This dumps all the
     Sidewinders, rockets, or Hellfires, depending on which weapon you
     select.  For example, to jettison all your FFAR rockets in the C64/128
     version, hold down the "5" key and tap "RESTORE".
     
     SIMULATION CONTROLS
     
     ACCELERATED TIME:  This key doubles the speed of time, thus shortening
     flight time from one point to another.  This function works ONLY if
     you are viewing the sector map. It automatically turns off when you
     return to the standard cockpit view.
     
     PAUSE:  This key freezes the simulation. Tap any key to resume the
     simulation.
     
     RESET:  Hold down these keys to restart the simulation.  In effect you
     are "jettisoning" the entire mission.
     
     ANSWER THE RADIO!
     When you see the prompt "MESSAGE" above the CRT, tap the Change CRT
     once to read the incoming radio message.  Ignoring messages can be
     detrimental to your health!
     
     PASSWORD & COUNTERSIGN:  As you approach your friendly base, you will
     get a radio message.  It's VITAL that you read and answer this
     message!  Tap Change CRT to display the message on the CRT.  You will
     be radioed the password and asked for the countersign.  You must type
     the proper countersign at the keyboard and press "RETURN/ENTER".
     
     Passwords and corresponding countersigns are listed (alphabetically)
     at the bottom of selected pages in this manual.  Look up the
     countersign and type it onto the screen.  Press RETURN/ENTER when you
     are done.  If you don't, your base will assume you're hostile and
     shoot you down!
     
     BEGINNER'S TUTORIAL I
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Learning to Fly a Helicopter
     
     This tutorial teaches you how to take off, control the helicopter in
     basic flight maneuvers, and land again.  Refer to "Cockpit & Status
     Panels" to understand what's appearing on the screen.  Refer to
     "Controls" and the keyboard overlay to find the appropriate controls. 
     Glance over "A Practical Guide to Helicopter Flying" for additional
     insights and illustrations.
     
     This tutorial is for use with the "realistic" flight mode, not the
     "easy" flight mode.  MicroProse recommends that you learn and fly in
     the realistic mode from the start (you'll appreciate the advantages
     later).  You can always "fall back" on the easy mode if the realistic
     mode becomes too frustrating.
     
     The second tutorial will cover your weapons and defenses.  For more
     details about how a helicopter flies and how to perform advanced
     tactical maneuvers, see teh "Aerodynamics" and "Weapons & Tactics"
     sections.
     
     WARNING - DON'T OVERCONTROL:  Helicopter controls are SLUGGISH (ask
     any helicopter pilot!).  That is, they react slowly.  Even a frisky
     thoroughbred like the Apache takes one to two seconds to respond to
     your control movement.  Therefore, just tap a key and see what
     happens.  When using the joystick/mouse/keyboard move it a little,
     then let it go.  The most common error in flying is to overcontrol by
     pulling hard on the stick or pressing too long and hard on a key.
     
     In short, be gentle with the controls movement watch for the result
     before you do anything else.  Numerous fast, radical control movements
     will produce incomprehensible results and probably a crash!
     
     STARTING:  Take the vehicle identification test, enter your name on
     the pilot roster, and make sure the region is set to "Training in the
     USA" duty assignment Reality defaults should be set to "Realistic
     Flying", "Easy Landing" and "Easy Weather".  Read the briefings and
     armament options, but don't bother to change them.  See "Preparing to
     Fly" for details on how to control the starting options.
     
     PAUSE WHILE LEARNING:  As you work through the tutorial, tap the Pause
     key whenever you want to read about the next maneuver or explanation. 
     Then tap any key to resume, try the maneuver, then pause again as you
     read the next part of the tutorial, etc.
     
     ATTACKS:  Don't worry about enemy attacks and firing while learning to
     fly. In training situations the enemy always fires "blanks" - you
     cannot be damaged or destroyed by enemy fire.  On your first training
     flights you should ignore enemy activity. In the next tutorial you'll
     learn how to respond to enemy attacks, and how to hit targets.
     
     POWER UP:  Turn on the port and starboard engines by tapping Port
     Engine On/Off and Starboard Engine On/Off.  Wait until the engine RPM
     strip gauges climb to normal (about the 80% point).  Then tap Rotors
     Engage/Disengage once.
     
     The rotor engaged warning light, previously red, should turn off. 
     You'll hear the rotors come up to speed.  Wait until the middle strip
     gauge (rotor RPM) climbs to normal (slightly above the engine RPM
     levels).
     
     CLIMB TO HOVER:  Now repeatedly tap Collective Up Fast. Watch the
     torque rise as you "raise" the collective.  Note that if you "lower"
     the collective, the torque drops. Once the torque reaches 75% use the
     Collective Up Slow key until you rise off the ground (at about 85-90%
     torque, depending on how close your weight is to the maximum).  You
     should be hovering at about 12 feet altitude.
     
     ROTATING IN A HOVER:  Tap the Rotate Right once.  Your helicopter
     begins to rotate to the right.  Tap Stop Rotation once and you'll stop
     turning.  Tap the Rotate Left to rotate in that direction.  If you tap
     either rotation key repeatedly, the helicopter rotates faster in that
     direction.  You can only use rotation when you are moving just a few
     knots, or stationary.
     
     Now stop the rotation.  You're ready to begin flying.
     
     FORWARD FLIGHT:  Add a little more collective up slow.  As you begin
     climbing push forward lightly on the cyclic joystick to "pitch down"
     the helicopter.  You'll begin to move forward. At about 30 knots
     you'll begin to climb.  You can see this on your altimeter (upper
     right dial) and your VSI (lower right dial) gauges.  Thisis because
     forward motion in a helicopter adds extra lift (termed "translational
     lift"), especially at 30-90 knots.
     
     The further you pitch down, the more your speed increases.  As your
     speed exceeds 100 knots, translational lift decreases.  the VSI gauge
     will move toward the negative end of the scale.  More pitch downward
     will push you into a power dive at 160-200+ knot speeds.
     
     LEVEL FLIGHT:  Move the joystick forward or back until the airspeed
     gauge reads 100 to 150 knots.  Now look at teh VSI. If you're
     descending (the needle is below horizontal) add some Collective Up
     Slow until the needle is on "0" (horizontal).  Alternately, if you're
     ascending, put in some Collective Down Slow.  When the VSI needle is
     horizontal (reading zero), you are in level flight.
     
     Remember, due to the slow response of helicopter controls, it's easy
     to overcorrect and put too much collective.  This results in you
     "chasing the needle".  After each change in the collective, wait a
     second or two for the VSI needle to stablize.
     
     CHANGING ALTITUDE:  When flying level at 100-150 knots, the easiest
     way to descend is to push the cyclic joystick forward (pitch down)
     into a power dive.  As you approach the altitude you desire, gently
     pull the cyclic joystick back (pitch up) until the VSI again stablizes
     at zero (needle is horizontal). Similarly, the easiest way to ascend
     is to pitch up slightly, reducing your airspeed to 50-100 knots.  When
     you reach the desired altitude, pitch down again until the VSI
     stablizes.
     
     This technique of flying is not unlike an airplane.  You can change
     altitude without distrubing the collective.  A second way to change
     altitude, applicable at any speeds, is to raise or lower the
     collective. When you reach the new altitude, input an equal and
     opposite amount of collective to regain level flight (VSI of zero). 
     This technique is the only way to change altitude from a hover.
     
     Regardless of which techniques you use, don't try to control the
     helicopter by constant "fiddling" with the collective.  Learn to
     "feel" the right collective setting, then fly with your cyclic
     joystick.  Don't expect to gain this ability on the first flight.  Be
     patient.  After a number of flights and landings you'll find
     collective adjustments come naturally - just like a real helicopter
     pilot.
     
     LOW ALTITUDE TURBULENCE:  While flying under 100', you may feel air
     turbulence.  You will tend to bounce up and down, or sometimes roll
     from side to side.  Air turbulence and "wind shears" vary with your
     speed and your distance from the ground:  the faster and lower you
     fly, the more difficult it is to keep the craft under control.
     
     TURNING:  Return to level flight at 100-150 knots.  Next push the
     stick left slightly and release it.  Your helicopter rolls into a
     banking left turn.  As you turn, observe the change in your digital
     heading readout (in the lower left of the cockpit display, just under
     the compass). If you continue to push the stick left and bank into a
     steep turn, you'll lose some lift.  Notice that your altitude is
     dropping and the VSI is below horizontal.  If you roll back to the
     right and level out, you'll return to level flight.
     
     To maintain your altitude in a steep bank (important if you're flying
     low) add a bit of Collective Up Slow just before you start to turn,
     then put in a bit of Collective Down Slow just before you come out of
     it. Change the collective first because the collective controls react
     more slowly than the cyclic joystick.
     
     NAVIGATION:  Tap the Map key to see the full sector map.  Your
     objective is to find your way home to base!  Move the crosshair cursor
     to the central white helibase, then switch back to your cockpit view. 
     Quite probably your heading and the INS heading are different. Make a
     banking turn toward the INS heading until the two numbers match. 
     Notice that the INS arrowhead marker below our own course arrowhead
     will also match.  You're on course, flying back to base.  Descend
     until you're in level flight at 50-100 feet altitude.  It's easier to
     learn to land if you come in slow and low, although "officially" a
     constant descent is preferred by air controllers.
     
     LANDING:  As you approach the base it first appears as an outline on
     the horizon. Reduce your spped to 60 knots by pulling back slightly on
     the cyclic joystick.  You'll need to put in some collective down slow
     to maintain your 50' altitude.  Now wait until the detailed buildings
     and landing "T" come into view.  Your goal is to land directly on the
     "T", but anywhere within the larger rectangle is fine.
     
     Just before you cross the outside edge of the base, begin slowing down
     to a hover by pulling up on the cyclic joystick.  Be sure to put the
     crosshairs on the horizon - it's easy to pitch up too far and end up
     going backwards.  Note that as your speed falls from 70 to 0 knots,
     your lift will decrease. Use the collective up slow to stablizie your
     altitude with zero VSI. By the time you accomplish all this and are
     hovering at about 50' altitude, you should be near the center of the
     base.
     
     Finally, use the cyclic joystick carefully to move your helicopter
     toward the "T".  Come back to a hover, and tap the collective down
     slow once to begin your final descent. At about 20' and/or 10'
     altitude you may need another tap to continue descending to a
     touchdown.
     
     SHUT DOWN:  When you land (altitude is zero) turn off both engines. 
     This ends the flight your postflight options will appear.
     
     MISSION:  After this first flight, you debriefing will show mission
     not yet accomplished.  To satisfy your instructors, you must learn how
     to hit the target too.  Go to "Beginners Tutorial II" to finish your
     training.
     
     
     BEGINNER'S TUTORIAL II
     
     Defense & Gunnery
     This tutorial teaches you how to recognize and deal with various enemy
     missile (SAM) and gun (AA) attacks.  It also gives you practice in
     using your own weapons against appropriate targets.
     
     STARTING:  If you have just finished the first Tutorial, you can use
     the same defaults again (same region, style of flying, and reality
     levels).  The region should be "Training in the USA," style should be
     "Regular Missions", and reality should be "Realistic Flying",  "Easy
     Landing" and "Easy Weather."
     
     NOTE:  When training in the USA, all missiles and gun shells fired at
     you are "blanks."  You can never suffer damage from "enemy" fire while
     training.  However, don't forget that everywhere else the enemy plays
     "for keeps."
     
     MAKE A PLAN:  Before takeoff examine the sector map of the training
     area.  Pick one of the three dummy installations. (HQ, Russian
     Heli-base, or the Depot) as your objective.  Move the INS marker to
     that objective.  Notice the "enemy" forces along or near the line of
     flight from your base to the objective.  these are the "opponents" you
     will engage.
     
     TAKEOFF:  Take off and get into level flight at 100' altitude (digital
     readout on altimetere is "01").
     
     THREATS*:  As you fly, watch the threat display on the lower right.  A
     red dot means an enemy with AAA (anti-aircraft artilery) or SAMs
     (surface-to-air missiles) have detected you.  A flashing red and white
     dot means an enemy helicopter is approaching.  A white dot means a
     misssile from another).  Also watch your warning lights.  When the "I"
     turns red an IR homingmissile is being launched.  When the "R" is red
     radar-guided missiles or guns are either searching for or tracking
     you.
     
     When enemies appear on your threat display they are also plotted on
     the map.  If you have the time, you can look at the map to learn what
     typeof enemy is attacking you.  Though virtually every enemy has some
     sort of light guns or shoulder-launched missile (the SA-7, SA-7B or
     SA-14), the most dangerous are the AA gun sites and vehicles, or the
     SAM vehicles.
     
     USING A JAMMER*:  When a warning light comes on, the standard repose
     is to turn on the approporiate jammer (press the IR or Radar Jammer
     On/Off once).  A small green light beside the warning light turns on,
     showing your jammer is running.  If the warning light turns off, the
     jamming was successful. Now turn onto a new course.  Jammed missiles
     often continur flying on their old course, and will hit you unless you
     change your course.
     
     Keep your jammer running until you destroy or fly away from the enemy
     laucher or gun.  In concentrations of enemies some pilots will turn on
     both jammers and constantly fly a "jinking" zig-zag course to confuse
     missiles and enemy gunnery.
     
     USING A DECOY:  If the warning light does not turn off by jamming, try
     using a decoy. Tap Drop Chaff or Drop Flare to deploy decoys.  The
     decoys symbol below the CRT will light up.  While the symbol is
     lighted the decoy should be drawing the missile or gunnery control
     toward it.
     
     Decoys are launched in three-cartridge "units of fire".  Although your
     cockpit control panel shows units of fire for convenience, the
     pre-flight arming and stores readout displays show actual cartridges
     available.  If you check your stores display after launching a chaff
     or flare decoy, you'll see the amount remaining has decreased by
     three.
     
     EVASIVE FLYING:  Another way to avoid a threat is to dive to a lower
     altitude while turning parallel to or away from the threat.  If you
     get lower and avoid closing the range an enemy often loses sight of
     you.  Enemy weapons aimed by eyeball (many AA guns and a few SMAs)
     cannot be jammed or decoyed.  Against these threate evasive flying is
     your only defense.  Another evasive technique is to slow your speed
     once you're low.  Slow movement at low altitude is very hard to spot
     at a distance.  It is possible to "sneak up" on enemy positions with a
     helicopter.
     
     Evasive flying is also superior to jammers and decoys because it
     doesn't broadcast your position.  Both jammers and decoys, not to
     mention firing, reveal your presence to the enemy.
     
     DAMAGE:  If you don't respond in time to a threat, the gunfire or
     missile will hit you.  You'll see the flash of explosions around the
     edge of the cockpit.  In traingin that's all you'll see - your
     helicopter cannot be damaged. In real battle, the explosion may
     penetrate your armor.  If a system across the top of the cockpit is no
     longer green, someting is malfunctioning.  Check the damage display
     for details. Sometime you'll want to fly home for repairs before
     continuing your mission.
     
     If you suffer too many damaging hits, the structural integrity of your
     helicopter will fail, causing a general power failure.  The only way
     to survive this is to successfully "autorotate" to a landing (see
     "Aerodynamics" for details on autorotation).  The actual number of
     hits varies with the situation and enemy weaponry, but a good rule of
     thumb is expect the worst after you've suffered three or four damaging
     hits.
     
     USING TADS* (Target Acquisition & Designation System):  Look on your
     map and find a large concentration of red targest near your flight
     path.  Fly in that direction.  When you're close pull up into a hover.
     Now use the rotate right and rotate left keys to turn your nose left
     and right.  When the crosshair is close to a target, the prompt
     "TARGET" appears above the CRT.  Press the fire button on the
     joystick.  The TADS gunsight box will appear around the target while
     the zoom camera shows the target on your CRT.  The range to target in
     kilometers appears in the upper left (for example, if the range if
     "0.8", the target is 0.8 kilometers - 800 meters - away).
     
     Tap next TADS target to shift the TADS to another target near the
     crosshairs.  If there is no other target near the crosshairs.  TADS
     remains on the original target.  After TADS is locked onto a target
     you can rotate left or right and watch TADS track the target for you. 
     As the box gets near the edge of your cockpit view tap the View Right
     or View Left key as appropriate.  Your view switches to the side. 
     Notice that TADS continues to follow the target.  As long as you can
     see the target TADS will follow it.
     
     If the target leaves your field of view.  TADS loses it and
     automatically unlocks.  Unless there is another target near your
     crosshairs for TADS to lock onto, the CRT switches back to the map.
     
     TADS can only lock onto targets you can spot.  At low altitude (such
     as under 100') you can't see very far.  Targets appear at very short
     ranges (just a few hundred meters away).  The higher you are, the
     further you can see: TADS can lock onto targets at further and further
     ranges. Of course, the higher you are, the easier it is for enemies to
     spot you.  As a result, helicopter pilots tend to fly low and
     occasionally "oppo up" to locate enemies.  A favorite maneuver is to
     "pop up" from behind a hill.
     
     The 30mm Chaing Gun cannon and teh 2.75" FFAR rockets have varying
     accuracy, depending on range and whether the weapon faces ahead.  The
     TADS box changes color from dark (poor acuracy) to light (good
     accuracy) with these weapons.  The Sidewinder and Hellfire alwasy have
     goo accuracy, and therefore the TADS box is always light colored if
     one of these weapons is selected.
     
     RADIO MESSAGE & MAP VIEWS DURING BATTLE:  If the CRT target view
     interferes with your navigation, or you want to read a radio message,
     tap Change CRT, TADS turns off and the CRT switches the next available
     mode (see "Controls" for details).
     
     FIRING WEAPONS:  To fire you must first select a weapon.  When you
     press the appropriate Select Weapon key, that weapon lights up beneath
     the CRT and the ammo supply appears in white, CAnnon ammo is shown in
     20 round bursts.  Once a weapon is selected, to fire simply press the
     Fire Button on the joystick.
     
     The 30mm Chain Gun cannon is automatically aimed at the target
     designated by TADS (the AH-64A has a ballistic computer that aims the
     cannon for you). Howver, the cannon ismore accurate firing straight
     ahead.  The TADS box will turn a brighter color as accuracy improves. 
     Cannon maximum range is 1.5 kilometers, but the effective range is
     about 0.7 kilometers firing ahead, and only 0.3 to 0.4 kilometers in a
     "deflection shot" to the side.
     
     The AGM-114A Hellfire anti-tank missile is guided by laser at the TADS
     target.  As long as you keep TADS locked on target the Hellfire flies
     toward it.  The Hellfire has a minimum range of a few hundred meters -
     it takes time for the missile to lock onto the TADS laser. The maximum
     range of the Hellfire is 6 kilometers.  Furthermore, once beyond
     minimum range.  Hellfire accuracy is unaffected by range.
     
     The 2.75" FFAR rockets are completely unguided.  You must line up the
     crosshairs in the center of the TADS box, then fire.  The rockets fly
     straight ahead at whatever was in the center of the crosshair when you
     fired.  After the rockets are launched you need not keep the target in
     the crosshairs.  The maximum range of FFAR rockets is about 1.8
     kilometers, but accuracy improves at shorter ranges.  As with the
     cannon, the TADS box will become brighter as your accuracy improves.
     
     The AIM-9L Sidewinder is a "fire and forget" air-to-air homing
     missile.  Lock the TADS onto a flying target and make sure the target
     is generally ahead (fairly close to the crosshairs).  Then fire the
     missile.  Once your fire, you can switch the TADS to something else
     and/or fly away.  Enemy aircraft may have jammers or decoys that could
     cause a Sidewinder to miss.  Maximum range of the L-model Sidewinder
     is 18 kilometers.  Effective range against a helicopter is virtually
     equivalent to the maximum range.
     
     WEAPON RESTRICTIONS:  Certain weapons are only effective against
     certaintargets.  The 30mm cannon is effective against aything except
     bunkers which it can destroy only occasionally.  The AGM-114A Hellfire
     is effective against "hard" targets (all vehicles and bunkers, but not
     other installations). Teh 2.75" FFAR rockets are effective against
     "soft" targets (infantry.  AA gun sites, and installations - such as
     the HQ, Depot, and Russian Heli-base). The AIM-9L Sidewinder is
     effective only against flying targets.  It is useless against any
     ground target.
     
     RECOIL:  When you fire a cannon or guided missile the helicopter bucks
     and recoils upwards.  Be prepared to regain control quickly.
     
     HITTING THE OBJECTIVE:  Eventually you'll reach your objective.  Lock
     the TADS onto teh HQ.  Heli-base or Depot and select the 30mm cannon. 
     In actual combat, you'd fly straight in and open fire at 0.7
     kilometers (closer if you're short of ammo).  However, in training try
     "buzzing" over the target at 30' first.  This will show you what the
     target looks like.  Then circle around, lock on the TADS once more,
     and make a second pass with cannons blazing.  If you want a real test
     of skill, don't use the cannon.  Instead make a rocket attack at 1.5
     kilometers or so.  You'll probably need to fire lots of rockets.
     
     RETURNING TO BASE:  After destroying the objective go back to the
     sector map and set your INS for your home base.  Fly home, land, and
     shut down both engines.  You can either rearm and refuel for another
     round of target practice, or you can call it quits here.  A successful
     flight may qualify you for the National Defense Service Medal.
     
     * Colors may vary on some computer systems.  See the appropriate
     section of the Technical Supplement for details.
     
     AFTER THE MISSION: Succeeding as Gunship Pilot
     
     DEBRIEFING & SUBSEQUENT OPTIONS
     
     ENDING A MISSION:  You end a mission by landing, turning off both
     engines, and waiting for the rotor to stop.  You then are told your
     status, and if you crash as a Sergeant or Warrant Officer you get the
     option to "retry" the flight instead of continuing. If you retry, you
     fly the same mission again.  If you "continue" (this is automatic at
     higher ranks) you receive normal results.
     
     Next you can decide whether to examine your craft, leave it, or (if at
     a friendly base) ask for more fuel, armament and/or repairs.  If you
     select repairs the enemy will have time to bring up reinformements. 
     In some cases your situation or damage will prevent certian options.
     
     After landing you are "debriefed" and may receive promotions or
     decorations appropriate to your performance.  If you ignored your
     orders and failed to perform the mission assigned you could find
     yourself peeling potatoes for a while!  (Your commanding officer
     dislikes being ignored!).
     
     Finally, you'll see your current rank, decorations, and score compared
     to the two all-time scoring pilots of the game.  These all-time top
     scorers are saved on disk independently of the current roster, and con
     only be erased here.
     
     REPLAY OPTIONS:  If you decide to try another mission  you can either
     remain in the same region, flying the same type of missions, or you
     can change your style of flying, or you can request a transfer to a
     new region.  Alternately, you can put your career on "hold" and go on
     R&R (rest and recuperation).  Pilots on R&R remain on the roster until
     you deliberately erase them.
     
     ENDING THE SIMULATION:  On the replay options screen you can end the
     simulation by removing the disk and turning off your computer.  To
     ensure accuracy in your pilot roster and records, you should turn off
     the computer only when the replay options are showing.
     
     SUCCESS
     
     THE MISSION:  If you leave the helicopter somewhere other than a
     friendly base, you could be captured by enemy troops.  Naturally the
     chances increase if you're deep in enemy territory.
     
     As a good solider, your duty is to complete the assigned mission. 
     This means destroying the primary target.  Destroying the secondary
     target as well is a definite plus.   Sometimes your commander will
     change his mind during a mission and reassign the secondary target as
     your new primary target.  Many missions have multipl targets spread
     over a range of map coordinates.
     
     If you finish the mission without achieving either objective your
     command will not be pleased, no matter how many other targets you hit. 
     Flying around blasting the closes enemy does NOT guarantee promotions
     and decorations.  On the other hand, targets hit in addition to the
     assigned objectives defineitely help toward decorations and faster
     promotion.
     
     Your commander will rate your performance based on time elapsed.  If
     you are flying over 20 minutes, he will reduce the credit given for
     your achievements.  If you accomplish both primary and secondary
     missions, he will automatically insist the missionis over when you
     return to base.
     
     RANKS:  Successful completion of your assigned mission improves your
     record. A good record leads to promotions.  Even on the battlefield
     promotions take time.  Don't expect a promotion after every mission.
     
     You start with the rank of Sergeant - just like real helicopter pilots
     entering flight training.  When you successfully complete a mission
     (usually flight training) you'll be promoted to Warrant Officer (WO1). 
     After that success leads to 2nd Lieutenant, 1st Lieutenant, Captina,
     Major, Lieutenant Colonel and finally Colonel.  Although higher ranks
     exist in the U.S. Army, the highest conceivable rank where an officer
     could still perform combat flying is Colonel.
     
     Each reprimand you "earn" goes into your record and makes promotion
     more difficult.  Reprimands occur when  you use "Sick Call" to evade a
     mission, or when you achieve no assigned objectives.  On the other
     hand, each heroism decoration (the Army Commendation Medal, Bronze or
     Silver Star, Distinguished Service Cross, or Medal of Honor) makes
     promotion easier.
     
     DECORATIONS:  If you do exceptionally well on a mission, you may be
     awarded a medl for heroism and bravery above and beyond the call of
     duty.  Unlike rank, these decorations are based purely on your
     performance during a single mission.  Your rank and prior record have
     no effect on your chance of getting a decoration (just like the real
     army).
     
     The decorations for heroism and valor are (from least difficutl to
     achieve upwards):  Army Commednation Medal, Bronze Star, Silver Star,
     Distinguished Service Cross, and the Congressional Medal of Honor
     (America's highest military award).
     
     In addition to decorations for heroism, additional medals and ribbons
     are awarded for egions of service, wounds, etc.  The National Defense
     Service Medal is traditionally given for successfully completing
     training.  The Purple Heat is awarded for wounds in combat. Campaign
     Ribbons for a particular region are awarded for completing a tour of
     duty (multiple successful missions) in that region.  After a campaign
     ribbon, additional tours give you the Air Medal, which recognizes
     exceptional flying time.
     
     WORLD'S GREATEST GUNSHIP PILOT:  The ultimate Apache pilot is a
     Colonel with ribbons and air medals for every region.  In addition, he
     holds the Congressional Medal of Honor along with a one or more lesser
     decorations for heroism and gallantry. Can you meet this challenge
     once?  How many such Colonels can you have on your pilot roster?
     
     
     PART II - APACHE PILOT'S MANUAL
     
     AERODYNAMICS and the AH-64A Apache
     
     HELICOPTER AERODYNAMICS
     This discussion of lift and flight is not intended to be rigorous or
     precise in a scientific sense.  Its purpose is to provide a
     rudimentary understanding of thephysics involved in helicopterflight. 
     For a more detailed and accurate discussion of flight and lift,
     consult a textbook.
     
     LIFT:  Helicopters fly because the individual blades of the rotor are
     airfoils - objects that produce lift (force upwards) as they pass
     through the air.  On normal planes the wings are airfoils. 
     Helicopters rotate their "wings" (the rotor blades) to generate lift.
     
     Lift is caused by the flow of the air OVER the blades.  NOT the
     downwash of air from the rotor.  The air flowing over the blade
     travels a shorter distance on the underside and a longer distance over
     the top.  Bernoulli's Principle states that there is less pressure on
     the upper side of the blade, more pressure on the lower side.  The
     result is a force upwards from the high pressure to the low pressure
     region.
     
     The amount of lift a moving blade generates depends on its angle of
     attack.  This is the angle between the relative wind in the blade
     system and the blade's pitch.  Pulling up (increasing) the collective
     increases blade ptich (the angle of attack), which increases the
     pressure differential, and thus gives more lift.  In the GUNSHIP an
     automatic delimiter exists that prevents you from increasing the pitch
     too far.  However, in many helicopters you can raise the collective
     too high, causing the blades to "stall."
     
     In addition to the lift created by blade pitch, helicopters also gain
     lift from forward motion.  This lift is called "translational lift." 
     In forward flight the rotor system as a whole acts like a fived wing. 
     The effect is increased lift, and therefore increased performance.  On
     teh AH-64A this increase is most notable in the 30-90 knot spped
     range, and includes some small extra lift generated by the weapons
     wings on the fuselage.
     
     A helicopter hovering or moving very slowly at extremely low altitude
     creates a "ground cushion" of air beneath the rotor.  this improves
     lift slightly.  For the AH-64A Apache the ground cushion effect is
     strongest at roughly 12 feet off the ground.  When you take off into a
     low-altitude hover, you are rising onto the ground cushion.  However,
     at speeds beyond a few knots the helicopter out-distances the ground
     cushion effect.  Pilots often refer to this as "sliding off the
     cushion."
     
     CONTROLLING FLIGHT:  When hovering, the lifting force of a helicopter
     rotor is directed staright upwards (counteracting the downward force
     of gravity).  To move forward, you tilt the rotor so that the lifting
     force is now diagonally upwards - a combination of vertical and
     horizontal forces.  The horizontal component of the force produces
     forward motion.  Of course, the vertical component is now somewhat
     less, so you'd expect the helicopter to descend.  This is exactly what
     happens - until the craft gains enough speed for translational lift to
     make up the difference.
     
     Similarly, to turn left or right, or to fly backwards, the pilot tilts
     the rotor in the appropriate direction.  In the case of left or right
     turns, at very low speeds tilting the rotor causes the helicopter to
     sideslip ("skid") without turning.  At higher speeds the entire craft
     turns left or right, like the banking turn of an airplane.
     
     Once a helicopter picks up speed, the flow of air into the rotor
     system has an effect on lift.  The blade moving backwards toward the
     rear of the craft (the "retreating" blade) is moving with the wind,
     and therefore is generating less lift than the blade moving forwards
     ("advancing") into the wind.  To compensate, the rotor blades
     automatically change their pitch as they go around, maintaining an
     equal lifting force.
     
     VDL (Velocity Design Limit):  As a helicopter moves faster and faster,
     the retreating blade needs more and more pitch to generate its share
     of the lift.  Eventually the amount of pitch required becomes too
     great and the blades begin to stall (cause air turbulence instead of
     lift)  as they retreat.  In short, helicopters have a maximum forward
     speed - beyond that speed the retreating blade ceases to be an airfoil
     and the helicopter loses lift.  As lift decreases, so does the force
     creating forward motion.
     
     The theoretical maximum speed of a helicopter is normally achieved in
     a sloping dive.  In forward flight helicopters typically lack the
     power to get beyond 75-80% of their VDL.  The maximum horizontal speed
     possible for teh AH-64A is 162 knots.  Officially the "never-exceed"
     VDL is 197 knots.
     
     ANTI-TORQUE CONTROL:  Newton's Third Law of Motion states.  "To every
     action there is an equal and opposite reaction."  In helicopters, as
     the rotor turns in one direction, the fuselage housing the engine(s)
     and transmission wants to rotate in the other direction.  The tail
     ("anti-torque") rotor exists to counteract this tendency.  It produces
     just enough horizontal force to prevent unwanted fuselage rotation.
     
     On the AH-64A the blades rotate counterclockwise.  The tail rotor
     produces force counteracting the clockwise torque on the fuselage.  In
     a hover, or at very low speeds, a pilot can safely vary the pitch of
     the anti-torque tail rotor.  The foot pedals (often called "rudders")
     are used to change the tail rotor pitch, thus changing its thrust. 
     reducing the pitch and thrust (Pressing the right pedal) causes the
     fuselage to rotate clockwise (the nose swings to the right), while
     adding pitch (pressing the left pedal) causes the fuselage to rotate
     counteclockwise.  On GUNSHIP the rotate right and rotate left simulate
     these foot pedals.
     
     FLYING TECHNIQUES AND ADVANCED MANEUVERS
     
     FANCY TURNS:  A high speed banking turn is easy.  However, in such
     turns your lift decreases, causing you to lose altitude.  If you don't
     want to lose altitude, pull your nose up slightly in a turn, then drop
     it back down to normal as you come out of the turn.  With practice you
     can make a fast, banking turn without changing altitude or fooling
     with the collective.
     
     Very tight turns require that you stop in midair, spin, and then
     accelerate away in the new direction.  To do this move the collective
     down fast, pull back hard on the stick until you're level, hit the
     tail rotor to rotate right or left, then raise the collective back to
     normal and pitch down your nose.  With practice you can even skid
     sideways while the tail rotor is turning your craft (a helpful
     maneuver if you're trying to avoid an enemy helicopter or missile).
     
     AUTOROTATION:  Helicopter crewmen don't have parachutes.  You can't
     bail out.  Fortunately, teh AH-64A is an exceptionally crashworthy
     machine with the good probability of crew survival.  However, the loss
     of both engines does not mean you must crash.  Helicopters have an
     equivalent of an airplane's "dead stick" (or "flameout") landing. 
     This unpowered descent is called "autorotation."
     
     To begin an autorotation, disengage the rotors from the engine. 
     Usually the pilot must bottom the collective, but in GUNSHIP the
     collective is automatically bottomed when the rotors are disengaged.
     In an emergency where you have both engines out, do this immediately.
     If you don't, the rotor will slow to a stop (it'sstill engeaged to the
     now-dead engines).  If the rotor stops turning before you're safely
     down, you're a dead duck.
     
     Now pitch the noxe so you're travelling at about 75 to 90 knots (for
     maximum translational lift).  The rotor is spinning freely becasue teh
     airflowkeeps the blades turning.  The descent becomes quite fast and a
     little frightening to the inexperienced.  As you get close to the
     ground, raise the nose and pull up on the collective.  The blades will
     "bite" into the air, giving you lift and slowing the descent.
     Unfortunately, as the blades bite, air resistance slows them down and
     the rotor RPM drops.
     
     You must time the "up collective" so that the helicopter lands gently
     before the rotor slows too much.  If you raise the collective too
     soon, the rotor will get below airfoil speed while you're still above
     the ground.  Without the lift from the blades, you'll fall like a
     rock!  If you raise the collective too late, you won't slow your
     descent fast enough and the machine will crash land.
     
     UNSAFE FLYING:  It takes time to disengage the rotors, get the craft
     under control, and teh "up collective" to land.  As a result, there
     are speed-altitude situations where an engine failure results in the
     craft hitting the ground before you can perform an autorotation. 
     hovering at altitudes above 25 feet up to about 500 feet is unsafe, as
     is high-speed flying under an altitude of 20-30 feet.
     
     "Unsafe" as described above applies to civilian and non-combat flying. 
     In combat situations unsafe flying may be "safer" than taking a
     missile or cannon hit!  In the AH-64A normally unsafe flight prcatices
     aren't quite so dangeroud.  If one engine dies, the other can keep the
     helicopter aloft.  In single-engine flight, the surviving engine can
     run at 100% power continuously (this power increase is automatic in
     GUNSHIP), or at 115% for six minutes.  The engines and rotor can keep
     turning for at least 30 minutes even if the lubrication wystem fails. 
     In comparison, oil lubrication system failures and fires are a major
     weak point of the Russian-built Mi-24 HIND helicopter.  Overall, the
     Apache is a forgiving machine designed for daredevil pilots, unlike
     the less forgiving single-engine UH-1 and AH-1 helicopters of the
     Vietnam war.
     
     OPEN FIELD LANDINGS:  The nice thing about helicopters is their
     ability to land without a paved airstrip.  However, helicopters cannot
     land on sloping ground. Any slope greater than 5 degrees causes so
     much rotor tilt that the helicopter flies, skids or turns away from
     the slope, making a landing imnpossible.  Never try to land on a
     hillside - you'll crash.
     
     WIND & WEATHER:  Ideally, all takeoffs and landings should be into the
     wind.  However, a helicopter can take off and land in crosswinds or
     tailwinds.  As the helicopter rises to a hover (in takeoff), or slows
     doen to hover (in a landing), the cyclic joystick should be moved
     slightly toward the wind, producing just enough-skid to counteract the
     wind velocity. This maintains the hover against the wind.
     
     When flying in windy conditions, the same considerations apply as
     flying a normal airplane.  Namely, the wind will increase your speed,
     slow you down, and/or push you sideways, depending on your flight path
     in relation to the wind direction.  This is not noticeable on
     long-distance flights.
     
     Temperature also affects helicopter flight. As air gets warmer, it
     expands and becomes thinne, providing less lift.  It the air gets too
     cold, icing on the rotor becomes a problem. Similarly, in humid
     conditions the air is composed increasingly of water, reducing lift. 
     Finally, as altitude above sea level increases, air gets thinner,
     reducing lift. For the AH-64A, ideal flying conditions are 76 degrees
     Farenheit (24.4 degrees centigrade) on a dry day at sea level.
     
     AH-64A APACHE SPECIFICATIONS
     
     The AH-64A Apache was designed and built by Huges Helicopter, Inc. a
     subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Phase I development in
     competition against Bell Helicopter began in 1972. After a "fly-off"
     Huges was awarded the Phase II full-scale contract in 1976. Final
     prototypes were approved and manufacturing begain in 1982.  The first
     of over one thousand AH64-A's rolled off the production line on
     September 30, 1983.  It will serve in most major U.S. Army units, as
     well as selected Army Reserve and National Guard units. Its primary
     function is close ground support especially against enemy front-line
     armored vehicles and anti-aircraft weapons.  The craft is armored to
     withstand hits from 23mm cannon.  Cost per machine is based on a price
     quoted to West Germany in spring of 1986.

     WEAPONS & TACTICS of the AH-64A Apache
     
     AH-64A WEAPONRY
     
     THE TARGET ACQUISITION & DESIGNATION SYSTEM (TADS):  The AH-64A uses a
     novel and very effective gunsight system called TADS.  Both teh pilot
     and gunner wear an IHADSS helmet which includes a monocle in front of
     the right eye.  The cockpit and helmet have IR diode sensors that
     track the helmet's position in three dimensions. When the crewman
     turns his head and looks through themonocle at a target, the TADS
     computers "know" what direction he is looking.  The nose TV camera,
     laser, FLIR optics (forward-looking infra red for vision in low
     visibility) and Chain Gun all point in the direction he looks.
     
     In GUNSHIP the TADS gunsight is a small box that appears in the upper
     cockpit glass.  When you lock it onto a target, a zoom TV camera view
     appears on teh CRT below, including the range in Kilometers and
     magnification of the camera.  Once TADS is locked ont a target, it
     tracks while you maneuver and fly the helicopter. As long as the
     target remains in your field of view  TADS will track it.
     
     TADS includes a laser rangefinder and ballistic computer that
     automatically aim the 30mm Chain Gun cannon at the target.  In
     addition, when the AGM-114A Hellfire is armed for firing, the laser
     acts as a designator that "calls out" the target for the missile.
     
     The 2.75" FFAR rockets and the AIM-9L Sidewinder operate independently
     of the TADS.  The rockets are unguided ("Dumb") weapons that fly
     straight ahead.  Teh AIM-9L, Sidewinder has its own built-in IR
     seeker.  If you aim it toward an enemy aircraft or helicopter and then
     fire, it should find its own way to the target.
     
     Note that TADS is a "line of sight" system built into the nose of the
     helicopter.  As a result, the greater your altitude, the further TADS
     can see.  Conversely, as you descend, TADS range is reduced. It's not
     uncommon to lose targets in a power dive. If another target is
     available, TADS switches to that. Otherwise it switches off.
     
     The 30mm CHAIN GUN:  This automatic cannon is beneath the nose on a
     mount that swivels and elevates under control of the TADS ballistic
     computer. It is NOT aimed manually. The computer aims the gun at
     whatever target is designated by the wearer of th IHADSS helmet, and
     then computes deflection using the laser rangefinder.
     
     The cannon fires 625 rounds per minute.  Traditional machineguns and
     automatic cannons use the recoil of one shot to load the next.  If a
     shot misfires or the belt jams there is no more recoil and the gun is
     useless until a mechanic disassembles the weapon and clears it.  since
     1916 jamming in aircraft machineguns and cannons has been a serious
     problem.  The "Chain Gun" does not use this principle. Instead an
     electric motor pulls the ammo belt through the gun (hence the term
     "chain gun").
     
     Even if a shell misfires or is a dud the motor continues pulling the
     ammo belt. This greatly reduces the probability of a disabling jam.
     
     The 30mm Chain Gun cannon normally fires HEDP (high explosive dual
     purpose) rounds that are effective against both unarmored and armored
     targets.  The rounds are not powerful enough to pierce the thick
     frontal armor of a main battle tank. They are effective against the
     thinner top and rear armor of tanks.  The cannon can use European 30mm
     DEFA ammunition if American-made HEDP is unavailable.
     
     The main disadvantage of theChain Gun is its enormous recoil, despite
     the relatively low muzzle velocity.  Not other helicopter carries such
     a heavy weapon. As a result, although the cannon may be aimed "on
     target", after a few rounds it could be off target again.  This
     problem is especially serious when the cannon is firing left or right,
     and minimized if the cannon is firing ahead.
     
     The cannon's maximum range is approximately 1.5 kilometers.  However,
     its low muzzle velocity and recoil problems suggest that effective
     range for reasonable accurate shooting (i.e., at least a 50% change of
     hitting a target dead ahead) is perhaps half that, or about 0.7
     kilometers.
     
     On the "plus" side, the 30mm cannon is an enormously valuable weapon
     against enemy helicopters and slow-flying aircraft.  The IHADSS and
     TADS system allows it to "track" and engage enemy targets to either
     side and below the helicopter - the pilot need not point his
     helicopter at the target to fire. Helicopters with manually controlled
     turrets (such as the Mi-24 HIND-D) or fixed weapons (such as the Mi-24
     HIND-E) lack this advantage.   However the slow rate of fire makes the
     cannon ineffetive against fast jets, which can literally fly between
     the shells.
     
     AGM-114A HELLFIRE ANTI-TANK MISSILES:  The Hellfire is a semi-active
     laser-homingmissile with a HEAT armor-piercing warhead.
     
     The missile's guidance system homes on the scattering frequency of a
     laser hitting a target. In other words, the missile does not "see" the
     laser beam.  Instead, when the laser beam hits a target and breaks up
     the missile "sees" the beam breakup. If the laser beam is switched
     from one target to another, the missile will "see" the target spot
     change, and fly toward the new target.  This allows "ripple fire"
     tactics where the Apache launches two ormore missiles, one behind
     another. When the first missile hits, the laser is switched to another
     target, and the second missile (already in flight) homes on the new
     target.
     
     Laser designators are not as effective in rain, snow, fog, or smoke.
     The beam breakup "spot" cannot be "seen" as easily.  A favorite
     defense against laser designated weapons is a quick smoke screen. 
     Many tanks now carry multiple smoke projectors for just this purpose. 
     In bad weather conditions aircraft are often grounded, making the
     laser designation problem moot.
     
     The disadvantage of the laser system is that the helicopter must
     remain exposed, laser shining, to guide the missile to target. 
     Fortunately, the Hellfire can be guided by standard U.S. Army laser
     designators, carried on various scout helicopters and by ground
     troops.  They can designate a target for amissile launched by the
     Apache. This means the Apache could fire from a hidden position, just
     like an artillery piece.  Of course, such tactics require excellent
     radio communication and superb timing.  The more common "scenario",
     portrayed in GUNSHIP, is the Apache designating its own targets "on
     the fly".
     
     The Hellfire's warhead is a 177.8mm diameter HEAT design:  High
     Explosive Anti-Tank. this bursn through virtually any steel armor as
     well as most modern composites and spaced armor.  The
     armor-penetrating ability of HEAT is proportional to the warhead
     diameter.  The Hellfire has a 177.8mm diameter warhead; American's
     previous top-quality and anit-tank missile (the TOW), still greatly
     respected, has a 152mm warhead.
     
     Unfortunately, this warhead design is ineffective against "soft"
     targets such as groups of men, building complexes, or AA gun sites. In
     the simulation, this means a Hellfire cannot destory a Headquarters,
     Depot, Helibase, or a AA gun site (such as the 23mm ZU-23 or the 57mm
     S-60). However, it is extrememly effetive against vehicles.  It can
     also penetrate and destroy bunkers.
     
     The Hellfire is an extrememly long-ranged missile.  Most ATGMs
     (anti-tank guided missiles) have a range of three kilometers.  The
     Hellfire can fly up to six!  Range doe not affect accuracy:  as long
     as the Hellfire can find the spot designated by laser, it will hit it.
     
     2.75" FOLDING FIN AERIAL ROCKETS (FFAR):  The 2.75" FFAR rockets, in
     pods of varying sizes and weights, are a venerable weapon dating back
     to the 1950's.  The rockets themselves are completely unguided, with a
     reputation for erratic flight, and sometimes not firing at all! 
     Maximum range is about 1.8 kilometeres, but a wise gunner waits until
     he's much closer before firing.  The 7- and 19-rocket pods for the
     AH-64 are a new lightweight design that minimizes the "dead weight" of
     the launcher pod.
     
     The standard rocket warehead is a typical "HE" high
     explosive/fragmentation type that is quite effectve against ground
     troops, AA gun sites, and installations.  Men on the receiving end of
     a full pod volley can feel the ground shake and buch beneath them,
     like an earthquake, while deadly metal fragments fill the air.  The
     shick effect alone can daze men for minutes.  Near-misses and shock
     effect is not enough to desable an armored vehicle or bunder, although
     a lucky explosion could immobilize a vehicle.
     Depite their drawbacks, the FFAR rockets are a good compliment to the
     Hellfire missiles.  They are most effective against targets the
     Hellfire can't really hurt.  They can be fired at a longer range than
     the cannon.  Even if the rockets miss they often "supress" soft
     targets.  The helicopter can then close for the kill using cannon
     fire.  FFAR rockets are also extrememly cheap to build and a common
     item of resuplly throughout the Western world.
     
     It is relatively easy to build FFAR rockets with special warheads,
     such as White Phosphorous (WP), which burns intensely and gives off a
     cloud of smoke, or even various chemicals such as tear gas.  Although
     such weapons are rare today, there is considerable fear that the
     Warsaw Pact plans heavy use of chemical warfare if involved in a
     European conflict.
     
     AIM-9L SIDEWINDER AIR-TO-AIR MISSILES:  The AIM-9L is an all-aspect
     infra red homing air-to-air missile.  It was combat-proven in the
     Falkland Islands, where most of the "kills" accomplished by British
     Harriers against Argetinte jets were with "Niner Limas".  The British
     pilots were quite satisfied with the performance of this weapon.
     
     The Sidewinder was originally created in the early 1950's by a small
     team on a shoestring budget.  The early models proved difficult to use
     in the Vietnam air war.  The Sidewinder homes on heat early models
     homed on the heat of a jet exhaust.  They would also home on the sun,
     common distress flares, or even hot ground or rocks during a summer
     day!  In the 1970's the seeker was dramatically redesigned to be much
     more sensitive (through cryogenic colling) and less vulnerable to
     suprious heat sources (Through the use of filters).  The missile's
     spped, maneuverability and range (now almost 18 kilometers) were all
     improved.  The warhead was redesigned to explode into destructive
     spinning rods, and gaind a new ultr-high-tech proximity fuse.
     
     The "L" model combines all of these improvements and is being
     manufactured in gigantic quaitites by various American and Europend
     firms.  Many older versions are being rebuilt to "L" standards.  The
     "L" model can home on surfaces heated by air deflected acorss metal
     (such as the upper surfaces of aircraft wings or rotor blades). This
     means the missile does not need to "fly up the tailpipe" of a jet to
     hit the target, but can instead attack from a variety of angles.  This
     dramatic new capability is termed "all aspect" attack.  The AIM-9L, is
     probably the best missile for air-to-air dogfighting in the world
     today.
     
     The missile is only effective against aircraft targets, especially
     unarmored jets. It is reasonabl effective against helicopters,
     especially since warhead rods can break rotor blades (an immediately
     fatal event for any helicopter).  Sidewinders are generally unable to
     home on ground targets, and even if they could, would only damage
     small, soft targets.
     
     Currently no U.S. Army AH-64A Apaches carry Sidewinders.  According to
     "the book" Apaches are intended for ground attacks, not air-to-air
     combat.  Reluctantly the Army is recognizing the threat of opposing
     helicopters.   However, due to a bad case of interservice myopia, it
     is considering arming the AH-64A with the designed-for-the-Army
     FIM-92A Stinger, a much smaller and less destructive missile intended
     by use by infantrymen.
     
     Fortunately American servicemen in combat conditions often ignore "the
     book" and acquire whatever weapon does the job best.  In this case,
     the plentiful and effective AIM-9L Sidewinder, despite being an Air
     Force weapon, is likely to find its way into the arsenals of Apache
     attack helicopter squadrons. Wiring up Apache weapons wings for
     Sidewinders is easily done "in the field". For all of these reasons,
     the AH-64A portrayed in this simulation is armed with Sidewinders, not
     Stingers.
     
     ATTACK TACTICS
     THE APPROACH:  The vast majority of AH-64 flights are ground-attack
     missions.  You are to knock out hard or soft targets in a certain area
     - often an area protected by SAMs and AA guns.
     
     Your first task is to make sure you know where on the sector map to
     find the primary and secondary targets!  Setting your INS on the
     sector map to the primary target and flying full speed at a few
     hundred feet of altitude toward the target may work on training
     missions or in Southeast Asia, but it's pure suicide against
     well-equipped enemies in the Middle East or Western Europe.
     
     The standard U.S. Army technique is to fly in quick dashes ("bounds"). 
     Fly from the base of one hill to another.  Before making a dash, hover
     and pop up briefly to 100-200".  Scan around and use TADS to identify
     potential enemies.  Drop low again and examine your sector map.  It
     shows all enemies you sighted, or who sighted you.  Pick your next
     dash, set the INS, rotate to face that direction, then pitch down and
     zoom forward.  Stay as low as possible in a dash.  When selecting
     routes, use hills to screen yourself from enemy fire.
     
     FIRING:  Use the right weapon for the job.  At longer ranges (over 0.7
     kilometers) use the Hellfires against vehicles and bunkers, the FFARs
     against infantry  AA gun sites, and buildings, and the Sidewinder
     against enemy helicopters.  If you are brave enough to get in close
     your best all-around weapon is the 30mm cannon.  Beyond 700 meters or
     when making side shots the cannon consumes large amounts of ammunition
     for each hit (due to its poor accracy at longer ranges).
     
     "POP UP" ATTACKS:  The "pop-up" technique is simple.  Hover behind a
     hill that screens you from suspected enemy positions.  Climb up onver
     the hill until you're just above the crest.  Scan around and watch
     your threat display.  If you recognize an important target
     immediately, open fire.  If not, drop down behind the hill again and
     examine your sector map.  You can now consider your situation and
     decide if you want to pop up again and attack those targets, or
     whether you should bound on, avoiding them. If you decide to attack,
     pop up again just long enought to knock out your selected target, then
     drop down again.
     
     FLAK & SAM BUSTING:  Because a helipcoter can sneak up on targets,
     taking full advantage of terrain cover, it is much better suied to
     attacking AAA and SAM batteries than traditional fixed-wing aircraft. 
     Army/Air Force cooperation tactics plan on Apaches attacking
     anti-aircraft weapons while A-10 "Thunderbolt II" jets bombard ground
     targets.
     
     The key to eliminating enemy SAMs and ZSU AA tanks is engaging them
     quickly.  Enemy anti-aircraft defenses have a 5 to 20 second reaction
     time, depending on the quality of the equipment and skill of the crew. 
     You must destroy them during this time.  Enemy SAMs give you a little
     extra time and warning because you can see the missile coming on the
     threat display.  Enemy AA guns are tougher because you can't see the
     shells coming (they fly too fast), and because guns can use optical
     gunsights you can't jam or decoy!  Unfortunately, some of the newest
     Soviet-built SAMs also have optical guidance systems for missiles. 
     However, night gives you an advantage against optical systems because
     Soviet-made night-vision aids are much inferior to your high-tech FLIR
     viewers.
     
     TANK HUNTING:  The Apache was designed to kill tanks. It's just a
     matter of loading up with Hellfires and heading out to the happy
     hunting grounds.  At a kilometer or two it's like shooting fish in a
     barrel. If you prefer, you can come closer and cut them apart with the
     30mm cannon. The U.S.Army expects a 14-1 kill ration (i.e., when you
     kill your 14th tank, the helicopter has paid for itself as a
     cost-effective weapon).  In your eagerness to create scrap metal, mkae
     sure you don't blast friendly tanks by accident!
     
     Russian tanks don't carry an AA weapon larger than a 14.5mm
     machinegun.  The BMP mechanized infantry vehicles are nastier because
     most carry as SA-7, SA-7B or SA-14 "Grail" missile inside.  However,
     these are lightweight IR homing missiles.  The SA-7 and SA-7B are
     easily confused by jamming or decoys.  Warheads are small:  even if
     one hits you, you'll probably survive it.  The brand new SA-14s are
     believed to be more potent and less easy to fool.  The biggest problem
     in tank hunting is that Russian AA tanks and SAM carriers have a nasty
     habit of traveling with the tanks and BMP's. Whenever you see a large
     concentration of T-74's or BMP's, keep any eye out for a ZSU-23-4 (or
     ZSU-30-2) AA tank, or the SAM carriers, such as the SA-9 and SA-13 IR
     missile carriers, or the more formidable SA-8 and SA-11 radar missiles
     carriers.
     
     INFANTRY TARGETS:  Infantrymen is open ground are difficult to see
     with the naked eye.  TADS has similar problems - on the CRT an
     infantry position doesn't look like much.  Infantry may carry
     machineguns and other light weapons, or sometimes the SA-7, SA-7B or
     SA-14 "Grail" IR homingmissiles.  You can attack infantry with FFARs
     or the 30mm cannon.  If you charge in fast and low you might get them
     before they're ready to get you!
     
     Infantry are tricky because it's hard to tell the good guys from the
     bad guys.  Again, check your map to avoid making costly and painful
     mistakes.  On the plus side, bunders are easy.  They don't have Grails
     and can be destroyed using the Hellfire. However, most bunkers have
     thick roofs nearly impervious to cannon fire.
     
     STRUCTURE:  Rear area structures, such as headquarters, heli-base, or
     supply depot, pose problems similar to infantry. Although bigger and
     easier to see, most have "Grail" IR homing missiles sited for air
     defense.  In addition, extra AA gun sites are often emplaced in the
     area.  Try to locate these defenses aswell as the base itself before
     you charge in.  The AA gun sites are a nuisance becasue Hellfires are
     ineffective against them.
     When attacking structures, be sure you have the right one.  It's
     embarrassing to wipe out your own heli-base.  In guerilla warefare
     enviroments such as Central American or Southeast Asia, your TADS will
     lock onto local fram buildings as well as military bases.  Unless you
     actually see enemies firing from the building don't destroy it. 
     Remember, you're trying to win the people's hearts and minds.
     
     DEFENSIVE TACTICS
     
     The most common problem you'll have is surviving enemy ground fire. 
     This includes enemy anti-aircraft artillery (AAA or "flak") and
     surface-to-air missiles (SAMs).  From a pilot's point of view, some of
     these are radar-guided threats, some are IR threats, and some are
     optically guided (and therefore don't warn you at all!).
     
     WHEN THEY SEE YOU:  Only the higher quality AAA and SAMs use
     radar-guided systems. Among AAA weapons this includes the ZSU-30-2 and
     ZSU-23-4 vehicles, plus more advanced version of the S-60 57mm gun.
     Among SAMs it includes all except the hand-carried SA-7, 7B, 14 series
     and the early SA-9 Gaskin.
     
     These weapons have "search" radars which can "see" you at long ranges
     in day or night.  If you see a distant red dot on the threat display,
     it's probably a search radar looking at you.  Most search radar
     "sweeps," causing the radar warning light to flash on and off.  Since
     the purpose of search radar is to detect your presence, jammers and
     decoys are counter-productive, as both announce your presence!
     
     All other enemies lack long-range search radar.  Many use eyesight and
     binoculars to search.  They can't "see" you until you are much closer. 
     At ngiht their eyesight is especially limited.  However, if you open
     fire, you'll certainly attract their attention, causing many
     additional enemies to "notice" you.
     
     TRACKING:  Radar, like normal eyesight, is blocked by objects on the
     ground.  As a result, ground-based radar has a "dead zone" it cannot
     see.  Above this dead zone the radar "eyes" will find you.  The dead
     zone becomes smaller and lower as you approach the radar.
     
     HOW THEY TRACK YOU:  If an enemy search is successful, they switch to
     a "tracking" mode.  If using radar, they constantly illuminate you
     with a beam.  This sets off your radar warning and causes the light to
     shine solidly "on".  As with searching, tracking radar as well as
     eyesight has a "dead zone" near the ground that varies with distance. 
     Therefore, if you're being tracked by radar, or suspect you're being
     tracked visually, fly lower and away from the enemy to break the
     track.  Ducking behind a hill will also break a track - enemy eyes and
     radars cannot look through hills!
     
     Another way to break the radar tracking is to use your radar jammer or
     drop a load of chaff.  If jamming is successful the radar warning
     light turns off.  If it fails, the warning light remains on - you
     should definitely use chaff or try evasive flying.  Using chaff decoys
     the enemy radar into locking on the chaff - as long as the chaff cloud
     persists.  The chaff light on the cockpit turns off when the chaff
     cloud disperses.
     
     A few advanced enemy weapons have visual backups for tracking systems.
     These may be TV cameras, lasers, or simply optics.  Therefore, even
     with the best jamming or decoys, they could still open fire.  The only
     way to defeat these is evasive flying.  All AA guns and probably the
     new SA-11 fall into this category.
     
     SURVIVING AA GUNFIRE:  After tracking you for sufficient time, enemy
     AA guns will open fire, and continue firing until they knock you down. 
     You must either break the track or destroy the weapon. There are no
     other options.  If the gunfire is radar controlled (your radar warning
     light will be on) you could temporarily break the track with radar
     jamming or chaff.  However, all guns have optical backup systems, and
     some only have optics.  The best way to survive gunfire is skillful
     evasive flying.
     
     SURVIVING SAMS:  After a SAM battery has tracked you for a few
     seconds, they launch a missile.  Missiles come in three flavors: 
     IR-guided, radar-guided, and visually-guided. When the enemy fires a
     missile, you'll see a white dot moving toward you on the threat
     display.  Bear in mind that IR-guided missiles have their "seeker" on
     board the missile, while radar and visual guidance missiles are
     controlled from the launcher vehicle.
     
     IF-guided missiles are the most frequent threat.  Your IR warning
     light will turn on when they approach.  If youturn on the jammer, and
     it succeeds in jamming the missile, the missile's "brain" becomes
     confused and it flies mindlessly straight ahead.  You should change
     course to avoid colliding with it!  If the IR jammer fails, try
     dropping a flare decoy instead.  The missile will aim for the decoy
     instead of you. It's important to wait a bit before launching decoys,
     since they burn out after a while and the missile will home on you
     again.  "Poor" IR guidance systems are vulnerable to either decoys or
     jammers.  "Fair" systems are vulnerable to decoys, and sometimes to
     jammers.  "Good" systems are vulnerable to either decoys or jammers,
     but almost never both, and sometimes are vulnerable to neither! 
     Finaly, very modern and sophisticated IR missiles may have a visual or
     laser backup system.  Don't assume that defeating the IR guidance will
     always confuse a missile.
     
     Radar-guided missiles are primarily designed for use against jet
     aircraft, but could threaten you too. A radar beam shining on your
     craft guides the missile at you. Using your jammer will break the
     beam, causing the missile to fly straight (therefore you should
     dodge). Using a chaff decoy will cuase the missile to fly toward teh
     chaff instead of toward you.  The problem with radar-guided missiles
     is that they have back up systems.  Teh SA-8 and SA-8B become IR
     guided missiles if their radar fails.  The SA-11 has an unknown but
     probably visual-type backup system if the radar is jammed or decoyed. 
     Therefore, defeating the radar is just the first step in defeating the
     missile.
     
     Visually- or laser-guided missiles are the worst threat.  You have no
     jammer or decoy defenses against these. Your only weapon is evasive
     flying.  Putting a hill between you and the missile is the best bet. 
     Getting low enough to become invisible to the launcher (and therefore
     breaking the visual or laser track) is the only other hope.  Remember,
     successful evasive flying requires that you fly lower AND away from
     the enemy.  If you continue flying toward the launcher, flying lower
     may not help.
     
     All missiles have a universal weak point they have a huge truning
     raduis.  If you let one get close, then dart off perpendicular to its
     flight path, it will be unable to turn fast enough to hit you.  This
     tactic is fairly easy in a high-speed jet aircraft, but far more
     difficult to acomplish in a relatively slow helicopter trying to avoid
     amissile flying at 1,000mph or faster!  It takes enormous skill,
     split-second timing, and steady nerves to "turn inside" a missile with
     a helicopter.

     AIR-TO-AIR-COMBAT
     Russian-built mi-24 HIND helicopters are  your air-to-air combat
     problem.  They are somewhat faster than your AH-64 (you'll never
     outrun them!), but much less maneuverable. The "E" model with four
     23mm cannons is the most common threat.  HINDs are unable to fire
     accurately sideways in a dogfight, although some do have rotating
     turrets able to hit stationary targets.  You, however, don't suffer
     that restriction.  Therefore, your goal is to prevent them from
     heading toward you.  The worst possible situation is to have a HIND
     approaching from the rear.  They can fire at you, but you can't even
     see them!
     
     A typical HIND tactic is to sit behind a hill waiting for you, then
     charge forward, guns blazing. They also tend to circle around, trying
     to get on your tail.
     
     If you have a HIND charging you, you can either nail him at long range
     with a Sidewinder, or evade him until you're ready to use your cannon. 
     The best evasion technique is hiding behind a hill.  Failing in that,
     fly off to the left or right.  As he turns toward you and lines you up
     in his sights again, turn the other way fast.  Take advantage of his
     slow turning rate.  As he gets closer, circle around him.  Keep your
     TADS on him throughout this process (you'll probably need to use the
     left or right view while circling around).  When the reticle box
     brightens, show him what a 30mm cannon can do.
     
     If you have a HIND on your tail, you'll take rapid and heavy damage as
     his cannons pound you.  You've got to shake him off, fast.  Break
     right or left hard.  Pitch up to cut your speed.  "UP" collective to
     "elevator up" or "down" the collective to "elevator down."  If your
     speed drops below 50 knots use the tail rotor to spin you around while
     skidding sideways, then pitch down and bank away. HINDs are poor
     dogfighters, so once you shake him, he'll probably fly past to the
     right or left and start circling around.  Getting on his tail and
     teaching him a lesson should be easy.
     
     A new model Russian helicopter with air-to-air IR homingmissiles is
     believed to exist.  Whether you call it an "F" model HIND or the Mi-28
     Havoc, it's still a serious threat.  Keep an eye out for
     missile-firing helicopters when facing first line units in Western 
     Europe.
     
     MILITARY EQUIPMENT - ON THE MODERN BATTLEFIELD
     
     The notes on Soviet AA guns and SAMs are especially useful in
     understanding the strong and weak points of enemy weaponry.
     
     WESTERN BLOC EQUIPMENT
     M1 and M1A1 "Abrams
     Main Battle Tank - USA
     
     Weight:  62.9 tons
     Main Weapon:  105mm Rifled or 120mm Smoothbore Cannon
     Secondary Weapon: three machine guns
     Armor:  Heavy (Chobham)
     Crew:  4
     Hull Length:  7.9 meters
     Hull Width:  3.7 meters
     Height 2.9 meters
     Engine:  1500 hp gas turbine
     Maximum Road Speed: 41.5 mph
     
     This is the new standard tank of the U.S.Army, with the latest engine,
     armor, and in the A1 model, a new West German-made smoothbore gun, not
     to mention lots of high-tech hardware.  It is considerably superior to
     all know Russian Tanks, but suffers from having a novel engine design
     that needs to work more reliably.  Unlike the Soviet T-74, the M1
     Abrams is an entirely new design that actually works.  It's a curious
     twist that the Soviets, generally viewed as creative and innovative
     tank designers, have been "one-upped" by the U.S.Army, who formerly
     lacked a reputation for "state-of-the-art" tank design.
     
     M2A1 "Bradley"
     Infantry Fighting Vehicle - USA
     
     Weight 24.8 tons
     Main Weapon:  25mm Auto-Cannon
     Secondary Weapon:  two TOW missiles
     Armor:  Light (aluminum laminate)
     Crew:  3 + 7 passengers
     Hull Length:  6.5 meters
     Hull Width:  3.2 meters
     Height 3.0 meters
     Engine:  500 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed:  41.0 mph
     
     This is the new armored personnel carrier of the U.S.Army, designed to
     compete with the Russian BMP while keeping pace with speedy M1 tanks. 
     It is heavily armed, lightly armored and crowded inside.  Although
     superior to the M113A3, it must be cautious when engaging enemy tanks. 
     The TOW missile is no longer an invincible tank-killer.
     
     M113A3
     Armored Personnel Carrier - USA
     
     Weight:  12.5 tons
     Main Weapon:  one or two machine guns
     Secondary Weapon:  none
     Armor:  Light (aluminum/steel)
     Crew:  2 + 11 passengers
     Hull Length:  4.9 meters
     Hull Width:  2.7 meters
     Height:  2.5 meters
     Engine:  275 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed:  42.0 mph
     
     This is the latest variant of the U.S. Army's venerable "battle taxi"
     for infantry.  It can carry and protect infantry from incidental fire,
     and is fairly useful against poorly armed Third World troops.  Against
     well-outfitted opponents it should stay out of the line of fire.
     
     
     
     M163 Vulcan PIVADS
     Self-Propelled AA Gun - USA
     
     Weight:  13.5 tons
     Main Weapon:  20mm Gatling Gun
     Secondary Weapon:  none
     Armor:  Light (aluminum/steel)
     Crew:  4
     Hull Length:  4.9 meters
     Hull Width:  2.9 meters
     Hight: 2.8 meters
     Engine:  215 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed:  40.5 mph
     
     The Product Improved Vulcan Air Defense System married a six-barrel
     20mm Vulcan cannon with teh ubiquitous M113 chassis.  The gun is aimed
     by a gunner, who is aided by a radar range finder and tracking
     fire-control computer.  Although useful against unarmored helicopters
     and slow-moving planes, it is ineffective against distant or
     high-speed targets (such as low-flying jets).
     
     M247 Sergeant York DIVAD
     Self-Propelled AA Gun - USA
     
     Weight 60 tons
     Main Weapon:  twin 40mm Cannon
     Secondary Weapon: one machine gun
     Armor:  Light (steel)
     Crew:  3
     Hull Length:  7.1 meters
     Hull Width:  4.6 meters (including antennae)
     Height: 4.6 meters (including antennae)
     Engine:  750 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed: 29.8 mph
     
     The Sergeant York gun was designed to provide medium range rapid-fire
     AA gun defenses for US troops.  The U.S.Army has lacked a long-range,
     effective AA gun for decades.  This design was cobbled together from
     an old M48 tank chassis, standard 40mm AA guns, and a fighter plane's
     radar system.
     
     Unfortunately, the Sgt. York repeatedly failed combat trials.  Only
     after 146 had been produced was the U.S. Congress able to close down
     production of this remarkabley expensive boondoggle.
     
     M48A1 Chaparral
     Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) System - USA
     
     Weight:  12.7 tons
     Main Weapon:  four MIM-72C IR homing missiles.
     Secondary Weapon: none
     Armor:  Light (steel) for crew only
     Crew: 4-5
     Hull Length:  6.1 meters
     Hull Width:  2.7 meters
     Height:  2.7 meters (including antennae)
     Engine:  202 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed:  38.0 mph
     
     The Chaparral combined a modified Sidewinder air-to-air missile with
     the U.S. Army M548 carrier.  It is designed to work as a team with the
     Vulcan AA vehicle.  The Chaparral uses its IR homing missiles at
     targets too fast for the Vulcan.  Like the Vulcan, it has no integral
     search radar.  Therefore it cannot engage targets until the gunner
     sees them.
     
     Merkava Mk2
     Main Battle Tank - Israel
     
     Weight:  66.0 tons
     Main Weapon:  105mm Rifled Cannon
     Secondary Weapon:  three machine guns
     Armor:  Heavy (stte/composite)
     Crew:  4
     Hull Length:  7.5 meters
     Hull Width:  3.7 meters
     Height:  2.8 meters
     Engine:  900 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed:  28.6 mph
     
     The Merkava is Israel"s first "Home grown" battle tank, and a very
     original design.  It is heavily armored, slow and carries the
     traditional 105mm NATO cannon designed 25 years ago.  This philosophy
     is directly contrary to USSR design concepts, and fairly different
     from most western nations. However, Israel is designing from the
     greatest successful tank battle experience of any nation in the
     post-WWII world.  Perhaps they know something we're ignoring?
     
     UH-60 Blackhawk
     Transport Helicopter - USA
     
     Weight:  8.1 tons
     Main Weapon:  varies (often none)
     Secondary Weapon:  none
     Armor:  Light (Kevlar & composites)
     Crew:  3 + 11-14 troops
     Length:  15.3 meters (excluding rotor)
     Width:  5.5 meters (excluding rotor)
     Height:  3.8 meters
     Engine:  two turboshaft jets, 2828 total shp
     Maximum Level Speed:  184 mph
     
     The Blackhawk is the U.S. Army's new general-purpose helicopter and a
     worthy successor to the classic but aging UH-1 "Huey".  The
     twin-engine design, light armor, and high crashworthiness make it a
     safe, reliable machine in combat conditions.  Ground attack, night
     flying and ECM/ESM variants exist, as well as many other
     special-purpose designs.  However, the Blackhawk lacks sophisticated
     fire control systems, so even the armed versions are nowhere near as
     potent in combat as the AH-64 Apache.
     
     Hughes 500MD Defender
     Attack Helicopter - USA
     
     Weight: 1.6 tons
     Main Weapon:  four TOW missiles
     Secondary Weapon:  vaires
     Armor:  none
     Crew:  2
     Length:  7.6 meters (excluding rotor)
     Width:  3.2 meters (excluding rotor)
     Height:  2.7 meters
     Engine:  one turboshaft engine, 425 total shp
     Maximum Level Speed:  140 mph
     
     The Defender is not used by the U.S.Army.  It is an inexpensive attack
     helicopter for export to smaller Western nations.  It currently serves
     in the Israeli, Kenyan, and South Korean air forces.  Instead of the
     TOW anti-tank missiles as shown it can carry a three-barrel 7.62mm
     minigun (a gatling machine gun), 40mm grenade launcher, or 2.75" FFAR
     rocket pods.  Options include a mast-top sight for the TOW (instead of
     the nose sight shown).  FLIR night vision for the pilot, air-to-air
     missiles, and various computerized flying and combat aids.
     
     EASTERN BLOC EQUIPMENT
     
     T-74
     Main Battle Tank - USSR
     
     Weight 45.1 tons
     Main Weapon:  125mm Smoothbore Cannon
     Secondary Weapon:  two machine guns
     Armor:  Medium (steel & laminate/composite)
     Crew:  3
     Hull Length:  7.0 meters
     Hull Width:  4.8 meters
     Height:  2.4 meters
     Engine:  780 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed:  approx. 37 mph
     
     This vehicle is still called the T-80 by the U.S. Defense Department,
     even though most other nations and sources (including Jane's) indicate
     the Soviet designation is T-74.  Like all Soviet post-WWII MBT's is is
     low, rounded, and fast ("drives like a sports car" according to
     Israeli tankers).  The 125mm cannon has a mechanical loader that
     eliminates the need for a fourth crewman.  Sights and night-fighting
     equipment aren't up to Western standards.  The armor is predominantly
     traditional steel plate, since the Soviets haven't discovered the
     secret of Chobham armor.  The T-74 is an evolutionary improvement in a
     family that reaches back through the T-72 to T-64, T-62 and ultimately
     to the ancient T-55 of the 1950's
     
     BMP-2
     Infantry Combat Vehicle - USSR
     
     Weight:  16.1 tons
     Main Weapon:  30mm Rifled Cannon
     Secondary Weapon:  AT-5 Spandrel Missile
     Armor:  Light (steel)
     Crew:  3 + 7 passengers
     Hull Length:  6.7 meters
     Hull Width:  3.1 meters
     Height:  2.1 meters
     Engine:  approx 350 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed:  approx. 37 mph
     
     The BMP-1 was a seminal concept in AFVs:  an amphibious armored
     vechicle with a light cannon and anti-tank missile that carried an
     infantry squad.  The BMP-2 is an improvement on the original.  I has a
     new 30mm high-velocity gun and better anti-tank missile, but reduced
     infantry space (normally only six infantrymen are carried).  According
     to Soviet doctrine, each BMP should carry a "Grail" (SA-7, SA-7B, or
     SA-14 surface-to-air missile) for defense against air attack.  In
     action one of the infantrymen opens a top hatch on the rear deck,
     stands up, aims the Grail from his shoulder, and fires.
     
     BTS-70
     Armored Personnel Carrier - USSR
     
     Weight:  12.7 tons
     Main Weapon:  two machine guns
     Secondary Weapon:  30mm grenade launcher
     Armor:  Light (steel)
     Crew: 2 + 9 passengers
     Hull Length:  7.8 meters
     Hull Width: 2.8 meters
     Height:  2.5 meters
     Engine:  two 115 hp gas reciprocating
     Maximum Road Speed:  approx.  37 mph
     
     This 8-wheeled carrier is an upgrade of the ancient BTR-60, designed
     prior to the BMP.  Although a useful troop carrier, especially on
     roads or flat, firm ground, it has trivial armament, very weak armor,
     and an extrememly poor transmission (due to the twin engines). 
     Infantry must enter and exit the passenger compartment through two
     small roof hatches (most APCs use large rear doors).  If the USSR had
     a Congress and/or a free press, ridiculous vehicles like this would be
     taken out of production (see the M247 Sergeant York DIVAD).
     
     MT-LB
     Armored Carrier - USSR
     
     Weight:  13.1 tons
     Main Weapon:  one machine gun
     Secondary Weapon:  none
     Armor:  Light (steel)
     Crew:  2 + 11 passengers
     Hull Length:  6.5 meters
     Hull Width:  2.9 meters
     Height:  1.9 meters
     Engine: 240 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed:  38 mph
     
     This general-purpose carrier was based on an unarmored tractor
     designed for use in swamps and arctic areas.  It is an excellent cheap
     transporter with superior cross-country mobility.  It has both roof
     hatches and rear doors for easy loading and unloading.  Unlike the
     BMP, the MT-LB is not designed for fighting in the front lines.
     
     ZSU-23-4 "Shilka"
     Self Propelled AA Gun - USSR
     
     Weight:  20.9 tons
     Main Weapon: four 23mm Auto-Cannons
     Secondary Weapon:  none
     Armor:  Light (steel)
     Crew: 4
     Hull Length: 6.5 meters
     Hull Width:  3.0 meters
     Height:  3.0 meters
     Engine:  280 hp dieseel
     Maximum Road Speed:  27 mph
     
     The "Zoo" is anohter seminal design integrating powerful, rapid-fire
     AA guns with computerized radar fire control on a light tank chassis. 
     The guns overheat quickly, and so are fired in 3 to 5 second bursts. 
     Still, each burst puts 200 shells into the air!  The original ZSU-23-4
     design had mediocre radar that had trouble finding targets below 200'
     altitude.  The newer ZSU-23-4M has a much imporved radar system with
     better search and resolution capabilities.  The guns can fire using
     optical sights if the radar is jammed.  The ZSU-23--4 has been greatly
     feared by Western pilots.
     
     ZSU-3-2
     Self Propelled AA Gun - USSR
     
     Weight:  probably 20-30 tons
     Main Weapon:  two 30mm Auto-Cannons
     Secondary Weapon:  probably none
     Armor:  probably Light (steel)
     Crew:  probably 3-4
     Hull Length:  probably 6.2-6.7 meters
     Hull Width:  probably 3.0 meters
     Height: unknown
     Engine:  probably a diesel
     Maximum Road Speed: probably 27-37 mph
     
     Although it has not been displayed on parade, diverse sources suggest
     that the Soviet Union has a new and improved AA tank with twin 30mm
     guns. Details are not yet available.  This design replaces the
     ZSU-23-4, now more than 20 years old.  The heavier caliber 30mm guns
     should be able to do more damage at longer ranges against armored
     helicopters such as the AH-64.
     
     ZSU-57-2
     Self Propelled AA Gun - USSR
     
     Weight:  30.9 tons
     Main Weapon:  two 57mm Auto-Cannons
     Secondary Weapon: none
     Armor:  Light (steel)
     Crew:  6
     Hull Length: 6.2 meters
     Hull Width: 3.0 meters
     Height:  3.0 meters
     Engine: 280 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed: 31 mph
     
     This obsolete AA weapon uses an early 1950's tank hull and two late
     1950's AA guns.  The guns track slowly and lack radar ranging or
     control (everything is done optically or manually).  However, the
     shells are quite powerful - a direct hit can seriously damage a plane
     or helicopter, even the armored A-10's and AH-64's.  Large numbers
     were supplied to Soviet client states, who now use it primarily
     against ground targets.
     
     S-60
     57mm AA Gun - USSR
     
     Weight: 5.0 tons
     Main Weapons:  one 57mm Auto-Cannon
     Secondary Weapon: none
     Armor: none
     Crew:  7
     Length:  8.5 meters traveling
     Width:  2.1 meters traveling
     Height:  2.6 meters traveling
     Engine:  none
     Maximum Road Speed: towed
     
     This old but effetive medium AA gun is still used worldwide by
     Soviet-equipped states.  The gun can be fired using optical control. 
     For greater accuracy a SON-9A fire control radar with a PUAZO-6/60
     director can be attached.  One or more guns can be tied into a search
     radar system for long-range accuracy. During the Vietnam War this
     syste is believed to have been the single most effective destroyer of
     American aircraft.
     
     ZU-23
     23mm AA Gun - USSR
     
     Weight: 1.1 tons
     Main Weapon:  two 23mm Auto-Cannons
     Secondary Weapon: none
     Armor:  none
     Crew: 2-3
     Length: 4.6 meters traveling
     Width: 1.8 meters traveling
     Height:  1.9 meters traveling
     Engine: none
     Maximum Road Speed: towed
     
     This cheap, rapid-fire, short-range AA gun is used extensively by
     Soviet-supplied armies. It is relatively light for easy transportation
     and sets up quickly.  The gun is considerably superior to machineguns
     and other ad hoc AA defenses, but is not designed for use with radar. 
     Therefore its range is low and its accuracy against fast-moving
     targets is totally dependent on the gunner's skill.
     
     SA-7, SA-7B or SA-14
     Portabel Surface-to-Air Missile - USSR
     
     Weight: 20.3 lb. missile (tube extra)
     Main Weapon: 5.5 lb. fragmentation warhead
     Secondary Weapon: none
     Armor: none
     Crew: 1
     Length: 1.35 meter missile
     Width: 70mm missile diameter
     Height: (shoulder launched)
     Engine: Mach 1.5 solid fuel
     Maximum Road Speed: manpack
     
     This IR-homing missile has been popular among Soviet-supplied armies
     and terrorists for years.  The original SA-7 had an IR homing head
     that needed to fly up a jet exhaust, and was easily decoyed by flares
     and jammers. The SA-7B has an improved seeker that is less easily
     jammed, but still uses a small 5.5 lb. warhead.  The new SA-14 is
     believed to have an even better seeker and larger warhead.  the
     maximum range and altitude of these missiles is consistently
     underestimated in the West.  For example, although an altitude limit
     of 1,500' is widely quoted, an SA-7 hit an Omani jet (in 1974) at
     11,500 feet!
     
     The SA-7, -7B or -14 is carried by infantry units, used to defend
     ground installations, and carried inside BMP vehicles as their
     aircraft defense.
     
     SA-6 "Gainful"
     Self Propelled Surface-to-Air Missile Launcher - USSR
     
     Weight: 15.4 tons
     Main Weapon:  three SA-6 missiles
     Secondary Weapon: none
     Armor:  Light (for crew only)
     Crew: 3
     Hull Length: 6.8 meters
     Hull Width: 3.2 meters
     Height: 3.5 meters
     Engine:  280 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed: 27 mph
     
     This medium-range SAM system is commonly used by poorer
     Soviet-supplied nations against aircraft at low tomedium altitude. 
     The launcher vehicles travel and fire in cooperation with separate
     radar vehicles. One radar system searches for targets, then hands them
     off to a second fire-control radar that tracks the target, plus
     themissile once it is fired.  The fire-control radar then sends
     commands to the missile that guide it to the target. If the radar
     control is jammed or destroyed the missile flies "blind" and is
     unlikely to hit anything.  The SA-6 system is popular because the
     missiles and radar can move forward with combat troop, or be
     positioned where threats are greatest.  However the radar and control
     technology are 1960's vintage and easily jammed.  The missiles
     themselves are slow (Mach 1.5) and not very maneuverable.
     
     SA-8 "Gecko"
     Self Propelled Surface-to-Air Missile Launcher - USSR
     
     Weight:  approx. 25 tons
     Main Weapon:  four or six SA-8 missiles
     Secondary Weapon: none
     Armor: Light (for crew only)
     Crew: 3
     Hull Length: 9.0 meters
     Hull Width: 2.9 meters
     Height 4.1 + meters
     Engine: no reliable data
     Maximum Road Speed: approx. 37 mph
     
     This sophisticated system was front-line equipment in the Warsaw Pact
     forces until recently. Exports have begun to select Soviet client
     states (including Syria and Iraq).  The vehicle mounts its own
     tracking radars, but can work with separate search radar systems to
     acquire targets beyond visual range.  The target is normally tracked
     with radar, but optical TV tracking is available if the radar is
     jammed.  In early flight the missile is guided toward the target by
     the controller.  As it closes in an IR homing warhead switches on,
     providing another backup in case the radar guidance system fails.  The
     missile can reach speeds over Mach 2 and is fairly maneuverable, but
     burns out rather quickly (maximum range is 12 kilometers).  The vehicl
     can launch and control two missiles simultaneously and on different
     frequencies.  The SA-8B system has six improved and more sensitive
     missiles cased in protective boxes.
     
     SA-9 "Gaskin"
     Self Propelled Surface-to-Air Missile Launcher - USSR
     
     Weight:  approx. 8 tons
     Main Weapon: four SA-9 missiles
     Secondary Weapon: none
     Armor:  Light (steel)
     Crew: 2-3
     Hull Length:  5.8 meters
     Hull Width:  2.4 meters
     Height:  2.2 + meters
     Engine:  140 hp gas reciprocating
     Maximum Road Speed:  approx. 60 mph
     
     This light armored vehicle is armed with short-range IR homing
     missiles.  The missiles are aimed by the gunner using visual sights. 
     The SA-9B has a simple radar to aid the gunner in locating targets. 
     The missile itself is barely equal to the SA-7.  It has an even
     smaller warhead, but a larger minimum range and minimum altitude.  The
     questionable value of this system was deomonstrated int he 1981- 1982
     Israeli air raids over Lebanon, where Israeli planes inflicted massive
     losses on entire Syrian batteries of these vehicles.
     
     SA-11 "Gadfly"
     Self Propelled Surface-to-Air Missile Launcher - USSR
     
     Weight:  aprox. 20 tons
     Main Weapon:  four SA-11 missiles
     Secondary Weapon: none
     Armor: Light
     Crew: 3-4
     Hull Length: 6.5 meters
     Hull Width: 3.0 meters
     Height: 3.0 meters
     Engine: 280 hp diesel (probably)
     Maximum Road Speed:  approx. 17 mph
     
     This is the latest Soviet medium-range missile, designed to replace
     the SA-6 system.  It can use the same or improved search and tracking
     radars.  The missile homes on reflected radar signals, flies very fast
     (Mach 3) and is reasonably maneuverable.  Because this system is quite
     recent, some sources believe it has a backup TV or laser tracking
     system as well as IR homing for terminal guidance.
     
     SA-13 "Gopher"
     Self Propelled Surface-to-Air Missile Launcher - USSR
     
     Weight 13.8 tons
     Main Weapon: four SA-9 or SA-13 missiles
     Secondary Weapon: one machine gun
     Armor: Light (for crew only)
     Crew: 3-4
     Hull Length: 6.6 meters
     Hull Width: 2.9 meters
     Height: 2.3 meters (traveling)
     Engine: 240 hp diesel
     Maximum Road Speed: approx. 34 mph
     
     This is a completely redesigned successor to the SA-9 Gaskin.  It has
     a small search radar and fires IR homingmissiles from a converted
     MT-LB vehicle.  These missiles arenew, improved designs that jump
     between tow IR frequencies to counteract jamming and flares.  The
     homer is sensitive enough to find "hot spots" on aircraft skin caused
     by air friction, rather than simply chasing the exhaust.  Introduced
     in 1980, the SA-13 missile is the USSR's best ground-launched IR
     homing weapon now in active service.  Versions of the vehicle have
     been supplied to the Warsaw Pact and selected Soviet allies, but often
     the actual missiles are the poor SA-9s, rather than the
     state-of-the-art SA-13s!
     
     Mi-24 "Hind"
     Attack Helicopter - USSR
     
     Weight 12.1 tons
     Main Weapon: Varies
     Secondary Weapon: 2,800 lbs. of bombs, rockets, etc.
     Armor:  Light (titanium?)
     Crew: 3
     Length: 33.7 meters (excluding rotor)
     Width: approx. 16 meters (excluding rotor)
     Height: 3.2 meters
     Engine: two Lotarev D-136 turboshaft jets, 11,400 total shp
     Maximum Level Speed: 183 mph
     
     This large, fast, heavy, armored helicopter is literally a "flying
     battlecruiser."  The D model has a 12.7mm gatling gun turret beneath
     the nose as its main weapon.  The E model has four fixed 23mm cannons
     while the turret houses laser guidance for AT-6 "Spiral" anti-tank
     missiles. An F model carrying IR homing missiles for air-to-air combat
     may exist (the U.S. Defense Department calls it the Mi-28 Havoc).  The
     "Hind" is faster than any western helicopter, but much less
     maneuverable.  Although teh D model (illustrated above) has a nowe
     turret, it lacks an equivalent to IHADSS and TADS. Therefore, in
     swirling air-to-air combat it is limited to forward firing, like the E
     model.  No information exists on the guns and cannons of the "F"
     model, much less the fire control system used.
     
     REGIONAL DEPLOYMENTS of the AH-64A Apache
     
     SELECTING REGIONS
     
     The five flying regions are listed in order of difficulty, from the
     easiest (Training in the USA) to the most difficult (Western Europe). 
     U.S. Army regulations require that all new pilots first report to the
     training area in the USA.  This is only sensible.  If you're new,
     follow those order and work through both "Beginner's Tutorials."  Only
     Then are you ready for combat duty.  Southeast Asia or Central America
     should be first, then the Middle East or Western Europe.
     
     TRAINING IN THE US
     
     Background:  This area is designed to help teach you flying, how to
     use weapons, and how to use defenses.  All enemies fire "blanks".  You
     can experiment and learn without worrying about damage.  LEARN TO FLY
     HERE FIRST.  Even experienced combat fliers occasionally return here
     to experiment with new tactics or try out new flight maneuvers.
     
     The Apache flight training area has a central heliport with various
     dummy targets surrounding it.  A comprehensive combat simulation
     environment exists to give pilots realistic practice flying in battle
     conditions, but without suffering any battle damage.  This area is
     ideal for learning to fly, learning to identify Soviet-built equipment
     and installations, and to gain skill on both the attack and defense.
     
     Mission Profiles:  Use the "Beginner's Tutorials" on your first
     flights.  then continue to practice until flying, attacking and
     avoiding threats is second nature.  The heliport does not use
     passwords and countersigns.
     
     Opposing Euipment:  This training area includes dummies and
     simulations of most Soviet-made equipment. It has SA-7, SA-8, and SA-9
     missile launchers, ZSU-23-4 AA tanks and S-60 57mm anti-aircraft guns,
     T-74 and BMP tank targets, infantry and bunker targets, and three
     typical Soviet installations:  An HQ, a supply depot and a forward
     heli-base. None of these have active weapons.  You cannot be shot
     down.
     
     Advice from the Sergeant Major:  "I've seen many good pilots go to war
     too soon.  It's like labms to the slaughter.  Take my advice, sir, and
     get lots of practice hours.  Flyin' a gunship is a tricky job at best,
     and downright difficult when a dozen bad guys are tyrin" to toast you. 
     No disrespect intended, sir, but the better you are on the practice
     range, the better your chance of living through your first battle."
     
     "Don't be too upset if your first flight ends badly.  Everybody has
     trouble with choppers at first.  Give it time and you'll get the hang
     of it.
     
     SOUTHEAST ASIA
     
     1st Air Cavalry Division
     
     Background:  In 1965 U.S. combat troops are sent on active duty to
     fight communist guerilla forces in Southeast Asia.  The first
     heliborne unit in history swings into action in the la Drang Valley. 
     helicopter transports and gunships are invaluable in finding the
     elusive enemy.  Communist regula and guerilla forces lack
     sophisticated weapons, but the early UH-1 and Ah-1 choppers lack armor
     protection - a stray bullet could and did disable a million-dollar
     flying machine.  Fortunately, the AH-64A Apache is armored.
     
     Misison Profiles:  Your main problem is finding the enemy.  Only
     occasionally will you encounter strong AA guns and SAM defenses. 
     Mission targets are mostly enemy troops and installations, sometimes a
     bunker complex.  Hellfires are only needed against the bunkers. 
     Otherwise cannon and rockets are perfectly adequate.
     
     Opposing Equipment:  Enemy AA weapons are primarily 23mm and 57mm gun
     sites. Third line guerilla forces have no radar, while second and
     first line NVA troops have radar for their 57mm S-60 sites.  The only
     SAMs in use against helicopters are outmoded SA-7s. Most of these are
     used to defend enemy bases.  Intelligence reports no enemy helicopters
     in the region, and will update you if the situation changes.
     
     Advice from the Sergeant Major:  "Be glad you've got an armored
     chopper - baddies in the bush aren't a serious danger.  On the other
     hand those 23's and 57' can be nasty.  The ones without radar are
     especially irritating - they don't trip your warning lights. If you
     start collecting flak, get low quick and dodge.  Then decide whether
     you want to hunt them down or take another route.
     
     CENTRAL AMERICA
     
     82nd Airborne Division
     
     Background:  In Ociber, 1983 American mounted an air-land-sea invasion
     of Grenada to eliminate a gradul communist takeover.  The government
     of El Salvador, an American ally, is struggling to remain coherent. 
     Haiti has just eliminated a hated dictator but has huge internal
     troubles.  The anti-American government of Nicaragua is under
     guerrilla attack by "Contras" based in Honduras and Costa Rica. 
     Border clashes with U.S. allies could lead to calls for American
     miliatry assistance.  Cuba, a strong Soviet client-state for decades,
     still fears an American invasion.  In all cases, the unit ready to
     move fastest is the 82nd Airborne Division.  Men and supplies can be
     parachuted into action while mobile fires support (the AH-64A Apache)
     files to freshly-cleared firebases and heli-pads.
     
     Mission Profiles:  Here the enemy has a conventional army, but the
     battlefield is irregular and confused.  You won't find a well-defined
     front line, but you will find orgainzed goups of regular enemy troops,
     supported by AA guns, SAMs, and Hind Helicopters.  Beware the high
     daytime temperatures and humidity, which greatly reduce carrying
     capacity.
     
     Opposing Equipment:  The enemy forces are primarily infantry,
     supported by a few BMP armored vehicles and ZSU-23-4 or ZSU-57-2 AA
     tanks.  The SA-9 Gaskin missile carrier is the standard "heavy" SAM
     vehicle, with a few improved SA-9B's available to first grade troops. 
     Virtually all enemy infantry and installations have SA-7 Grails, some
     have the improved SA-7B.  Both 23mm and 57mm guns are commonlyused for
     air defense.  All 57mm guns use search radars, and all but the
     worst-equipped have fire control radar too.  None of the 23mm guns
     have radar. Mi-24 Hind helicopters are available in small numbers to
     most communist armies, and will probably make an appearance on the
     battlefield.
     
     Advice from the Sergeant Major:  "Sir, these guys are not primitive
     villagers from the boondocks.  They've got decent weapons and know how
     to use them.  If you get a radar warning, it's probably a ZSU-23-4 or
     a 57mm AA gun. Don't just jam them, hit them before the switch to
     optical and hit you!  Like Souteast Asia, beware of the 23mm's and
     older ZSU's that use optical control - they don't warn you before they
     fire!  When loading up, carry lots of 30mm. Hellfires are useful at
     time,s but don't go crazy with them."
     
     101st Air Assualt Division
     
     Background:  The Middle East is still the world's trouble spot. Israel
     and Syria duel in desultory fashion over southern Lebanon and their
     common border, the Golan Heights.  The Iran-Iraq war continues to hold
     the danger of a losing Iran seeking revenge by closing the Straits of
     Hormuz to oil traffic.  Worse, Iranian-style religious radicalism
     might surface in any nearby Moslem state, triggering a civil war.  If
     an American friend calls for aid, or international straits need to be
     cleared, in America'a "Central Command" reaction force the key unit is
     the 101st Air Assault Division.  Formerly a parachute division, it's
     now an experimental hybrid practicing the "Air-Land 2000" mobile
     warfare of the future.  Naturally, the AH-64A Apache is a key player
     on this new team.
     
     Mission Profiles:  Here you face modern armored forces lavishly
     equipped by the Soviet Union.  Fortunately, this is the enemy the
     Apache was designed to destroy.  Careful weapons loading is paramount
     because high ground level and very high temperatures conspire to
     reduce your carrying capacity. The majority of enemy targets will be
     armored vehicles, making the Hellfire an extremely important weapon.
     
     Opposing Equipment:  Most opponents have numerous tanks and personnel
     carriers, protected by ZSU's, SA-8's and SA-9's. Enemy first line
     forces use the ZSU-23-4M AA tank, SA-8B and SA-9B SAM vehicles, S-60
     57mm guns with full radar, and outfit their infantry with SA-7B
     improved Grails.  Enemy second line forces have the older ZSU-23-4
     with poorer radar, the older SA-8 and SA-9 SAMs, no firec control
     radar on the 57mm gun sites, but still have the SA-7B improved Grails.
     Enemy third line forces are lucky to field the ancient ZSU-57-2 (with
     no radar), only have the SA-9 SAM vehicle, use older SA-7 Grails, and
     also lack fire control radar for the 57mm guns. Enemy air forces have
     a few Mi-24 Hind helicopters, so you may see some occasionally.
     
     
     Advice from the Sergeant Major:  "Sir, these fellows can be nasty,
     especially the first and second line troops with those SA-8 Geckos. 
     only the third line ZSU-57-2 and occasional 57mm gun site relies on
     optical control. However, their modern equipment does set off your
     warning lights.  So the enemy's better weaponry works in your favor
     too.  Probably the tough part is the weight limit, especially on a hot
     day.  Therefore, I advise against Sidewinders.  If you meet a Hind,
     gethimwith the trusty 30mm.  Hellfires will be useful against all
     those armored vehicles.  Some guys I know don't carry FFARs, but that
     may be going too far....Sorry, sir, humor ain't my strong point."
     
     3rd Armored Division
     
     Background:  For over 40 years NATO forces across Germany have faced
     the Warsaw Pact. Both sides are armed to the teeth, ready for war.  A
     number of U.S. Army divisions are stationed on this line, including
     the 3rd Armored of the U.S. V Corps.  Trouble anywhere could lead to
     escalating tensions.  When tensions are high, one itchy trigger finger
     could start a conventional war between the two superpower alliances. 
     It is imperative that NATO stop the Russian steamroller without using
     nukes.  Otherwise the President could be reduced to a choice between
     Russians in Paris, or nuclear winter for all!
     
     Mission Profiles: Anything and everything can and will happen in this
     desperate free-for-all.  The only sure thing is that the enemy is fuly
     armored and moving fast under an unbrella of sophisticated flak, SAMs,
     and helicopter gunships.  Soviet military forces may not be very
     creative, but they are numerous and brave.  They will keep coming
     until you stop them!
     
     Opposing Equipment:  The Warsaw Pact 1st Line Soviet Disions have the
     very latest equipment ZSU-30-2 AA tanks, SA-11 and SA-13 SAMs and
     SA-14s for all the infantry and BMPs. The 2nd Line allied troops from
     East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia have the best of the previous
     generation:  the ZSU-23-4M, SA-8B, and SA-9B, and the SA-7B improved
     Grails for BMPs and infantry.  Third line troops are mainly found in
     quiet areas, since they've Soviet reserve divisions or hastily
     organized allied troops.  They have older ZSU-23-4's, unimproved
     SA-8s, SA-9's, and SA-7s.  A few S-60 57mm guns can be found near
     important installations in all cases, and all but the third line
     troops have both search and fire control radar for these gun sites.
     
     Advice from the Sergeant Major:  "Well, sir, this is the big time. 
     We're up against the first team here.  They've got everything
     including the kitchen sink, and they'll use it. Anywhere else is a
     piece of cake compared to this.  But our boys on the ground are badly
     outnumbered and need us to even up the odds.  Your best chance is at
     night, since their night vision stuff isn't as hot as ours.  Load up
     on Hellfires - the Pact has hordes of armored vehicles out there.  On
     a good night ou might bag your fourteen in one sortie!  Don't forget
     Sidewinders either.  Hinds are as thick as flies around here."

     NOTES
     
     At MicroProse GUNSHIP was an enormously long and complex project that
     took triple the estimated time and quadruple the original number of
     people.  Simulating low-level helicopter combat, especially on 8-bit
     computers such as the C-64 or Apple II, was an outrageously complex
     job.  Each member of the design team played a crucial role in
     developing this amazing simulation.  Andy Hollis worked his optimizing
     magic to create a 3-D graphics system that made hills "solid" and yet
     ran fast enough for smooth real-time flight, not to mention his
     realistic handling of helicopter flight mechanics.  Expert artists
     Michael Haire and Michele Mahan worked with programmer Gregg Tavares
     to conjured up a superb cockpit and the many attractive starting and
     ending screens.  Gregg also contributted the missile flight logic. Sid
     Meier pulled his usual rabbits out of hats when it came to handling
     weapons logic and the "artifical intelligence" ofthe enemy.  Credit
     (or balme) for the concepts,research, game scenarios, and overall
     coordination goes to Arnold Hendrick.
     
     MicroProse could have taken the easy way out, like most software
     publishers now jumping onto the "Flight simulator" bandwagon. However,
     we didn't want GUNSHIP to be another unrealistic arcade-style "shoot
     'em up" that bears little resemblance to actual planes or helicopters.
     For example, one "helicopter simulation" from a well know firm even
     has the cyclic and collective controls reversed!
     
     Instead, we spent the time and effort to make GUNSHIP a faithful and
     realistic representation of the actual AH-64A, the most sophisticated
     combat helicopter in the world.  Unfortunately, this means GUNSHIP
     cannot be played like an arcade game.  Don't expect to immediately fly
     around Western Europe blasting top quality Soviet troops off the map.
     
     This simulation includes all the major systems and capabilities of the
     actual AH-64A.  The only major concession to playability we added was
     the INS mapping system. The current AH-64A only has a simplified INS
     system.  On the actual machine the pilot does not have a computerized
     map.  He keeps a paper map in his lap, looks up coordinates on it, and
     punches them into his digital unit.  However, the latest AH-1 variants
     have a more sophisticated INS system similar to one shown here.  It's
     not unlikely that this will be added to the Apache too.  As you can
     see, it's extremely convenient!
     
     In GUNSHIP the tasks of pilot and gunner are combined into one
     activity and a single cockpit layout.  The battle area is about 80
     square miles in size. In addition to showing the major terrain
     features, such as hills, roads, and streams, the visibility logic
     includes incidental ground cover such as bushes, trees, small rolls in
     the ground, etc. in its internal calculations.
     
     The actual AH-64A helicopter is quite new.  Parts of it are still
     secret.  MicroProse does not wish to compromise military security and
     needlessly endanger the lives of gunship crews.  We were careful to
     research all information from unclassified sources.  Although we
     talked to real helicopter pilots, we did not solicit or use any
     classified information.  If some cases this forced us to make educated
     guesses, rather than using hard data.  However, a vast array of
     material about modern weaponry and warfare has been published in the
     USA and abroad, especially in England.  In some cases our conclusions
     differ with the public position of the United States Department of
     Defense and/or the U.S. Army.
     
     We're sure you'll enjoy the challenge of flying GUNSHIP, a "real"
     combat simulation.  Spread the word if you prefer the authenticity of
     GUNSHIP, rather than unrealistic fast-action games.  Let us know and
