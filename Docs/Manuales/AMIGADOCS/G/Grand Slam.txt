                        Grand Slam Tennis



 Hi!......

    Tennis anyone? 

 You know there is something that is more 'FUN' then playing a 'GAME',
 that is, how to find a way to "Crack The Copy Protection', or simply
 how to copy the sucker. Now a days 'Copy Protection' are getting
 tougher, and tougher, and some make it to 'EASY'..(?) Ever get fustrated
 when the 'GAME' tell's you to go to 'PAGE 13', 'LINE 1', 'WORD 5' ???

 Well I did!....So instead of following it's 'RULES' I decided to make my
 'OWN'!!!

 What is the point to all of this...(?) Well to make this short, here are
 the 'CODES' for the game 'Grand Slam Tennis".....I'll explain how I
 found the 'CODES', and what's even more 'FUNNY', the game it self will
 tell me what the 'CODES' are, and on what page, and line....

 Here's what I did...

  First boot the system with 'KICKSTART 1.1', and insert 'WorkBench 1.1',
  NOT THE GAME. Insert 'Grand Slam Tennis' into df1:, and click the disk,
  rename 'Grand Slam' to 'GrandSlam'....Now click on the 'WorkBench Disk',
  and click on 'CLI'. From  cli enter 'CD DF1:GrandSlam/tx', once there
  list the directory, it's a bit long so be ready to hit the 'SPACE BAR'
  to pause it for awhile, and press the 'RETURN' key to resume. As you 
  watch the file being listed you will see a file called 'rt', and another
  called 'tt', I believe the 'tt' stand's for 'Transmitt Text', and the
  'rt' for 'Recieve Text'...(Just A Guess...) Anyway's rename 'rt' to 'rrt',
  and rename 'tt' to 'rt', and then rename 'rrt' to 'tt', Do you see the 
  point? OK!.....The screen will come up with the requester asking for the
  'CODE(s)' that is needed, **** NOTE **** the area should be blank, except
  for the 'Code Window', and the 'OK' gadget, just click on the 'OK', the
  game should say '                ', if you made it this far the game will
  play normally. Now if you wish to see those 'CODES' press the 'LEFT' mouse
  button go to the menus, and select 'RULES'......WOW!!!! It will list the
  wording, and location of the 'CODE(s)', and the 'CODE(s)' itself, write
  then down if you wish just in case there are different then the one's I
  will be listing later on. But what if the 'CODE' requester comes back with
  a bunch of 'GARBAGE', well that garbage is the 'RULES' that you where
  suppose to have seen instead of the 'CODE(s)', if this happens reset the
  Amiga by pressing the CTRL, Amiga, Amiga.... It should work this time, but
  if it doesn't then you'll just have to use the manual. (SOL)....

  Nuff Said.....

      Enjoy!!!!!
