This game is a new version from a old gambling hall-legend from the 80's.

After your machine has loaded the game, you could choose between a ONE
 PLAYER or a TWO PLAYER game. At the TWO PLAYER version, the players will
 be changed after a level got solved and not when a Spaceship get destroyed

The aim of the game is, to destroy as many enemies as possible and to solve
 much levels! After different levels, you are able to play a bonus-round,
 where the enemy-spaceships does not fire at you!

If a little spaceship comes in the near of your own ship, then just grab
 it. So you will get another(second one) spaceship at your side and with
 that the double fire-power.
