As all movements are mathematically calculated, elements in the equations
can be removed to produce an individualistic playing senario.  Generally
the more elements that are removed on this screen the quicker the football
action.

However, the more elements that are left in the more impressive the screen
display, especailly when viewed through the different camera angles.

TACTICS SCREEN!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

At the start of all participating Matches, the Tactics screen is 
displayed.  These screens are essential to set up the basic positioning
of players during the match.

Tactic positioning is done against the clock at the bginning of the First
and second half of each game.  Both players are able to alter their tactics
at the same time.

There are THREE tactical set ups.

PLAYER ONE       Uses keyboard numbers  1,2 and 3.
PLAYER TWO       Uses Keyboard numbers  1,2 and 3.

The players are presented on the tactic screens in a basic formation.  The
joystick should be positioned over the player to be moved, and pressing 
FIRE button allows the player to be picked up and re-positioned.  This
process is repeated until the players are in their desired position
position One has now been set-up.

Postion one.  The process is repeated by pressing "3" for position 3.

Although individual tactics will differ, a Defensive, Midfield and 
Attacking set-up should cover initial Match positions.

The Tactical Screens are aborted by Pressing SPACE.

THE MATCH
-=-=-=-=-

The Artifical Intelligence system used in Vector Soccer gives the players
the ability to "think" about the Match as it happens, contemplating all 
ball movements.  The players do not all chase the ball, but stay in their
approximate tactical set-up locations until they can contribute to the 
game.

Players not under direct Joystick control will mark opposing team players,
look for goal scoring developments, and postion themselves in the most 
advantageous sections of the pitch.

The player under direct Joystick control is indicated by a dark shadow at
their feet.  On the passing of the ball, the player in the nearest direct 
line of the shot will automatically come under Joystick control.  This 
control will vary according to the swerve, speed, and direction, of the
shot.

Joystick control is directional from the joystick to the pitch, whilst
pressing FIRE allows a shot to be taken.

Pushing the Joystick in the direction of the shot will kick the ball along
the ground at pace.  Holding the fire button down for longer periods 
increases the force of the shot.

Pressing fire when no direction is indicated by the joystick chips the 
ball into the air.  Goal kicks have an automatically higher kick velocity.

Greame Souness Vecotr Soccer is played to International Football rules.
All referee interactions are indicated by a whistle and the ref's voice
giving his decision.  The team who wins the ref's decision automatically
have their players positioned to take the shot.
