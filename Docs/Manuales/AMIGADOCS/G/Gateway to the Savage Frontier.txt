                          Complete Game Manual


                 INTRODUCTION: The First Night In Yartar
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  "We had thought this was going to be a routine mission, guarding a caravan
 of mithril travelling from Citadel Abdar in the far north.  But no sooner did
 we sign on to provide protection than the dwarves' King Harbromm himself
 called us to the top of the tallest tower in the fortress.

  "Now Harbromm, he talks through his great whiskers and it sounds like a
 bellows blowing, but this particular morning he didn't have to say much to
 get our attention.

  "He pointed to the northeast and we looked towards a brown cloud floating
 above one of the mountain valleys. 'Do you see that? It is dust,' he said,
 his voice rising. 'It is the dust of tens of thousands of the Ice Mountain
 Orcs as they march from their caves towards the cities of the south.'

  "But that always happens this time of the year,' someone replied. 'Orc
 raiding parties are always attacking Sundabar or ambushing caravans from
 SilveryMoon.'

  "The old dwarf nodded. 'Aye that's true.  But turn your eyes to that dark
 cloud once more.  Is that the dust of a thousand raiders?  I think not.  Two
 thousand? By no means. If we are lucky, perhaps only two thousand times ten.'

  "'Gaurd well this caravan, adventurers,' he told us. 'Evil is again awakened
 in the Realms,and its eyes and hands - and daggers - will be all around you.'

  "Well, after that speech you could imagine how horrified we were. Every step
 of the way we scanned the horizon, looking for those dark brown clouds.  We
 didn't see any, but we sure heard alot of stories. Seems like everyone in the
 northern Realms knows someone who's seen at least a dozen trolls or a hundred
 orcs skulking across their fields."

  A burly fighter by the bar called out, "So you came all this way with such a
 fine looking sword and never had a chance to quench it with orcish blood?"
 His voice dripping with sarcasm, he mimicked a dancer tiptoeing across a
 stage. "Perhaps you didn't want a fight. Perhaps it's just a child's toy with
 a fine golden handle attached to it for show!"

  Before his words had even crossed the room the sword in question was drawn,
 its gleaming blade flashing even in the dim light of the tavern. The room
 went silent as everyone waited to see if we would attack the the blustering
 fool. After a moment of hesitation the sword was sheathed again.  "This sword
 is saved for orcish blood", we called back to the drunken fighter. "We do not
 care to soil it with yours."

  The man looked at us, thought for a minute, realized he had been insulted
 and started to cross the room. Hesitating, he looked around. To his surprise,
 none of his companions were crossing with him. He started to admonish them,
 call them to battle, but the words were stilled in his throat.

  A tall, thin, black-caped man was sitting in the corner, and he shook his
 head one time.  The drunken fighter dropped his eyes to the floor, muttered
 something, then turned and left the tavern.  Several others followed.

  There was another moment of awkward silence.  The man in the corner nodded,
 and the waitress appeared with a heaping tray,crying,"More for everyone, it's
 on the house!"

  We all surged forward for our share, and the rest of the evening was full of
 great fun and storytelling.


IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THE SAVAGE FRONTIER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gateway to the Savage Frontier covers a wide geographical area, ranging from
the coast of the Trackless see in the west, to the edge of the Great Desert in
the east.  Most of the population of this area lives in the towns and cities,
with farming communities clustered around the built-up areas.


TOWNS AND CITIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
YARTAR is where you start the game and will serve as a convenient home base. A
trading town located on the River Surbrin, just north of where it joins the
Dessarin,it lies at the junction of the river and the Evermoor Way, one of the
two primary east-west trading routes in the region.

ASCORE is no longer a city at all.  Once a thriving dwarven seaport when the
Great Desert was the Narrow Sea, it shrank to nothingness when the waters
receded and the land dried and turned to dust.  Travel here is very perilous
and not recommended for any but the most experienced parties.

EVERLUND is located on the overland route between Silverymoon and Yartar and
prospers as a trading town due to its location.

LLORKH lies on the ancient trade routes that follow the long path along the
edge of the Great Desert.  Long a Dwarven stronghold, the town has recently
come under the rule of a human magic-user, Lord Geildarr.  The stories of
what is going on in this mining and trading center are jumbled and
contradictory but none are good.

LOUDWATER,with a population that includes many half-elves,lies in the southern
part of the region.  Its fields are so green, and its walls so overgrown with
vines that it almost seems to be part of the High Forest, which lies just to
the north.

LUSKAN,located on the northwest coast,is a city ruled by Northman see captains
who retired here years ago.  There are stories that its leaders are actually
former pirates who continue to sponser attacks on shipping,and that other evil
forces have allied with them to enforce their rule in the city.  Luskan is
hostile to many of the other cities in the region - especially Neverwinter -
and rumors of impending war surface periodically.

NESME, on the river Surbrin,at the western edge of the Trollmoors,is a trading
town.  Its old wooden stockade has seen more than one troll assault, and Nesme
riders patrol to keep the area near the city clear of monsters.

NEVERWINTER lies west of Neverwinter Wood, and is famed for its indoor gardens
and fine craftsman who can even craft magical weapons. Its people are friendly
to outsiders. The Neverwinter River, which runs through the area, is warm even
in the snows of winter, and no one knows why.  A magic shop - a rarity in the
Savage Frontier - is also located here.

PORT LLAST is a small town on the central coast.  Once a major seaport, the
centuries have seen its decline until now stonecutting is its most important
trade.

SECOMBER, a quiet town to the southwest is ssaid to be home to an eccentric
magic-user who continually creates clever new items and devices.

SILVERYMOON,in the northeast area of the region, is a large city known for its
magicians. An invisible magic bridge spans the River Rauvin as it flows
through the city.  A magic college and items shop is located here as well.

SUNDABAR, in the far northeastern area, is a former dwarven stronghold now
rebuilt by humans into one of the largest towns in the northern Realms.  It
trades with dwarven miners to the north and with Silverymoon and Everlund to
the west.


FORESTS
~~~~~~~
THE HIGH FOREST dominates the center of the region.  Although its vast expanse
is known to harbor peaceful as well as hostile creatures, traversing it is
dangerous and should not be attempted until your party has grown very strong.

NEVERWINTER WOOD is likewise dangerous for travel.  Local legend has it that
even raiding orc parties choose to go around the Wood rather than through it.


THE TROLLMOORS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Trollmoors,located in the north central area of the region,are a dangerous
expanse of low, windswept, blighted hills.  As their name indicates, the local
inhabitatants are both unfriendly and dangerous.


THE GREAT DESERT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Great Desert of Anauroch is a hostile area filled with vile monsters and
weather that swings from bitter heat to biting cold in moments and is a place
to avoid at all costs.


ISLANDS
~~~~~~~
GUNDARLUN, and its capital GUNDBARG are inhabited by Northmen. The island lies
almost due west of Neverwinter, two days away by boat.  Their status as an
important shipping and resupply port, however, has made the inhabitants far
more tolerant of other peoples, and you will usually find a warm welcome when
you visit.

THE PURPLE ROCKS are a group of small, rocky islands to the west of Gundarlun.
Little is known about them, but outsiders are not welcome there.

TUERN is also inhabited by Northmen. Its capitol of Uttersea is built into the
side of a collapsed, extinct volcano.  Other volcanos on the island still spew
out molten lava. Its people tolerate outsiders but are by no means glad to see
them.  There are reports of a recent meteorite strike on Tuern, and meteorite
ore is a key ingredient in some kinds of magical weapons.


CHARACTERS AND PARTIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You must have a party of adventurer players (PCs) to play Gateway to the
Savage Frontier. For each character you must choose the following:  a Race, a
Class, and an Alignment. After you select these, the computer generates a set
of Ability Scores that define your new character's natural strengths and
weakness. To build a party you must make a mix of characters that have the
range of skill needed for success, and then band them together.


PLAYER RACES
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are six races from which you may construct player characters, each with
different talents and limitations.  Tables are included in this HumbleDox
Presentation which summerize the racial class limitations and ability score
modifiers.  The following describes each race and tells you which classes are
open to them.

  DWARVES are a cunning race of sturdy workers and craftsmen.  They are
  especially resistant to magic and poison.  Dwarves receive bonuses when
  attacking man-sized giant-class creatures and are adept at dodging the
  attacks of larger giant-class creatures.  Dwarves can be fighters, thieves,
  and fighter/thieves.

  ELVES are a tall, long-lived race. They are nearly immune to sleep and charm
  spells and are adept at finding hidden objects such as secret doors.  Elves
  also receive bonuses whenattacking with swords and bows,although they cannot
  be raised from the dead.  Elves can be fighters, magic-users, thieves,
  fighter/magic-users, fighter/thieves, magic-user/thieves, and fighter/magic-
  user/thieves.

  HALF-ELVES are hybrids, with many of the virtues of both humans and elves.
  Like their elve ancestors, they are resistant to Sleep and Charm spells and
  are adept at finding hidden objects. Half-elves can be fighters,magic-users,
  clerics, thieves, rangers, cleric/fighters, cleric/rangers, cleric/magic-
  users, fighter/magic-users, fighter/thieves, magic-user/thieves, cleric/
  fighter/magic-users, or fighter/magic-user/thieves.

  GNOMES are shorter and slimmer than their dwarf cousins. They are especially
  resistant to magic.  Gnomes receive bonuses when attacking man-sized giant-
  class creatures.  Gnomes can be fighters, thieves and fighter/thieves.

  HALFLINGS are about the size of a human, hence their name.  They are
  especially resisitant to magic and poison.  They can be fighters, thieves,
  and fighter/thieves.

  HUMANS are the most common player-race in the forgotten Realms.  They suffer
  no level racial limitations or ability score modifiers.  Humans do have the
  disability of shorter life spans than the other races. This may be a problem
  when subjected to many Haste spells, which age the target one year.  They
  can be fighters, magic-users, clerics, thieves, rangers, paladins, and dual
  class characters.


  ABILITY SCORES
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Every character has six randomly generated ability scored as explained
  below.  These scores fall within a range determined by the race and class
  of the character.  The basic values range from 3 (low) to 18 (high) and
  there are tables of limitations, modifiers and bonuses included in this
  HumbleDox Presentation.

  Depending on the character class, one or more of these abilities will be a
  Prime Requisite.  A prime requisite is an ability especially valuable to a
  given class.For example,strength is key for fighters and wisdom for clerics.
  Most characters receive bonus experience points when their prime requisite
  scores are 16 or greater.

  Non-human characters may receive modifiers to the basic ability scores to
  reflect differences between the races.  Dwarves for instance, get a +1
  constitution bonus and may have a maximum constitution of 19 instead of 18.
  When a character is generated, all racial modifiers are calculated
  automatically.

  STRENGTH (STR) is the measure of a character's physical power, muscle mass
  and stamina.  Fighter-type characters may have exceptional strengths
  greater than 18 which are indicated by a percent value (01,02,03...98,99,00)
  following the base strength.  High strength increases a character's combat
  ability with melee weapons.  Strength also determines how much a character
  can carry without becoming encumbered and slowed in combat.

  INTELLIGENCE (INT) is the measure of how well a character can learn.

  WISDOM (WIS) is the measure of a character's ability to understand the ways
  of the world and to interact with the world.  Clerics receive bonus spells
  for high wisdom.

  DEXTERITY (DEX) is the measure of a character's manual dexterity and
  agility.  Thieves especially benefit from high dexterity.  Dexterity
  affects how well a character can use ranged weapons (bows, dart, etc.) when
  he moves in a combat round and how difficult he is to hit in combat.

  CONSTITUTION (CON) is the measure of a character's overall health.
  Characters receive one extra hit point if their constitution is 15 or two
  points if it is 16.  Fighter-types (fighters, rangers and paladins) receive
  additional bonuses for constitutions of 17 or 18. A character's constitution
  also determines the maximum number of times that character can be raised
  from the dead and the chance of a resurection attempt being successful.
  Every time a character is successfully resurrected, he loses 1 point of
  constitution.

  CHARISMA (CHA) is the measure of how others react to a character.


  CHARACTER CLASSES
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A character must belong to at least one character class.  Non-human
  characters can have more than one class at the same time.  A non-human
  character with multiple classes has more playing options, but he increases
  in level more slowly because his experience points are divided evenly among
  all his classes.

  CLERICS have spells bestowed on them by their deities and can fight wearing
  armor and using crushing (not edged or pointed) weapons.  Clerics must
  memorize their spells just as magic users, but they do not use spell books.
  When Clerics gain a new spell level, they can automatically use any of the
  available spells for the new level.  The prime requisite for clerics is
  wisdom.

  FIGHTERS can fight with any armor or weapons but they cannot cast magic
  spells.  The prime requisite for fighters is strength.

  RANGERS can fight with any armor or weapons.  They do additional damage
  when fighting giant-class creatures, but must be of good alignment and have
  ability scores of at least 13 in strength and intelligence and at least
  14 in wisdom and constitution.The prime requisites for rangers are strength,
  intelligence and wisdom.

  PALADINS can fight with any armor or weapons.  They are resistant to spells
  and poison,and can turn undead creatures as if they were a cleric two levels
  below their current level.  Paladins are also always surrounded by the
  equivalent of a Protection from Evil spell.  A Paladin may heal two HP of
  damage per level once a day and may Cure Disease once a week at 1st-5th
  levels and twice a week a 6th-8th levels.  Paladins will not adventure with
  any evil characters.  Paladins must be of lawful good alignment and have
  ability scores of at least 9 in intelligence and constitution,at least 12 in
  strength, at least 13 in wisdom and at least 17 in charisma.  The prime
  requisites for paladins are strength and wisdom.

  MAGIC-USERS have powerful spells, but can use no armor and few weapons. They
  can only memorize those spells available in their magical spell books or use
  scrolls.  Magic-users may add spells into their spell books whenever they go
  up in level or find scrolls with spells they can scribe. The prime requisite
  for magic-users is intelligence.

  THIEVES can fight with swords and slings, but are limited to leather
  armor.  In combat they do additional damage 'back stabbing', which is
  described in the Combat section.  Thieves also have special skills for
  opening locks and removing traps.  The prime requisite for thieves is
  dexterity.

  MULTI-CLASS are non-human characters who belong to two or more classes at
  the same time.  The character's experience points are divided among each of
  the classes, even after the character can no longer advance in one or more
  of those classes.  The character's hit points per level are averaged among
  the classes.  The multi-class character gains all the benefits of all their
  classes with regard to weapons and equipment.

  DUAL-CLASS are human characters who had one class for the first part of
  their career, and then changed to a new class for the remainder.  Once a
  changes classes, he cannot advance in his old class.  Dual-class characters
  do not gain hit points and cannot use the abilities of the old class while
  their new class level is less than or equal to the old class level.  Once
  the character's level in his new class is greater than his level in his
  old class, he gains hit points according to his new class and may use
  abilities from both classes.  Human dual-class magic-users may not cast
  magic-user spells while they are wearing armor.


  ALIGNMENT
  ~~~~~~~~~
  Alignment is the philosophy a character lives by and can affect how NPCs
  and some magic items in the game react to the character.  The possibilities
  range from believing strongly in society and altruism (lawful good) to being
  anarchistic and actively unpleasant (chaotic evil).  Alignment is presented
  in two parts:  World View and Ethics.

  WORLD VIEW:
  ~~~~~~~~~~
  LAWFUL indicates that the character values the structure and rules of
  society.

  NEUTRAL indicates that the character values both the individual and the
  society.

  CHAOTIC indicatesthat the character values the individual over the society.

  ETHICS:
  ~~~~~~
  GOOD indicates that the character tries to act in  moral and upstanding
  manner.

  NEUTRAL indicates that the character leans towards "situational ethics",
  evaluation each set of circumstances.

  EVIL indicates that the character acts without regard for others, or in an
  overtly malignant manner.


  OTHER ATTRIBUTES
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Each character also has three other important values that change as the
  game goes on: Hit Points, Experience Points and Levels.

  HIT POINTS (HP) represent the amount of damage a character can take before
  he goes unconscious.  To calculate a character's maximum HP, the computer
  rolls the character's hit dice and adds any adjustments for level or
  constitution.

     NOTE:
     Dice (d) is the term used to describe the range for a randomly generated
     number.  Dice are referred to by the range they represent.  A d6 has a
     range from 1 through 6, a d10 has a range from 1 through 10.  HIT DICE
     refers to the base range of hit points a character class may have.  For
     example a 3rd level fighter has a base of 3 d10 hit dice, or 3-30 hit
     points.

  A character gains a HP bonus to each hit die if his constitution is over
  14.  When a character takes enough damage that his HP reach 0, he is
  unconscious.  If the character's HP drop to anything from -1 to -9, he will
  lose 1 HP per turn from bleeding until he is bandaged or dies.  A character
  is dead if he has -10 HP or less.  When you view a character, his HP on the
  screen will never be displayed as less than 0.

  EXPERIENCE POINTS (EXP) are a measure of what the character has learned
  while adventuring. Characters receive experience points for action such as
  fighting monsters, finding treasures and successfully completing quests.
  The computer keeps tract of experience and when characters earn enough they
  may advance in levels.  See the Level Advancement Tables for each class's
  experience requirements.

  All characters start the game with 3,000 experience points.  This means that
  single-class characters start at 2nd or 3rd level.
  
  LEVELS are a measure of how much a character has advanced in his class.
  When they have enough experience, characters may go to a training hall and
  receive the training required to increase in level.  Characters may only
  advance one level at a time. If a character has gained enough experience to
  go up two or more levels since the last time he has trained, he will go up
  one level and lose all experience in excess of one point below the next
  level.

      Example:
            A 4th level thief enters a training hall with 20,521
            experience points (enough for 6th-level).  He will leave
            as a 5th-level thief with 20,000 experience points--
            one point below 6th level.  Characters cannot train for new
            levels once they have reached their maximum levels allowed in
            Gateway to the Savage Frontier


  BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL PARTY
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Forming a strong and adaptable party is a key to success in Gateway to the
  Savage Frontier.  Up to six Player Characters (PC's) may be in a party - A
  party with fewer is less powerful and more likely to be eliminated by
  opponents.

  Include a variety of classes in a party to get a good mix of skills.  Here
  are two sample parties as examples:

  Sample party 1 - Single Class Characters:

   1 Elf Magic-User
   1 Human Paladin
   1 Dwarf Fighter/Thief
   1 Half-elf Ranger
   2 Human Clerics

  This party is balanced for combat, and will advance quickly because most
  characters are a single class.  The magic-user can cast offensive spells and
  use wands.  The Paladin has the benefit of Protection from Evin in a 10'
  radius.  All characters in range of the effect get an AC improvement of
  two.  The dwarv fighter/thief offers the advantages of a thief (lock picking
  and disarming traps) with the better armor and hit points of a fighter.
  Rangers do extra damage against giant type creatures and start with extra
  hit points.  Clerics are absolutely essential for valuable healing spells.

  Sample party 2 - Multi-Class Characters:

   2 Half-elf Cleric/Magic-users
   2 Elf Fighter/Magic Users
   1 Dwarf Fighter/Thief
   1 Human Paladin

  This party is much more flexible than the first, but will advance much more
  slowly because of the multi-class characters.


  OUTFITTING THE PARTY
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The following are some suggestions for outfitting your party in Yartar:

  * Fighter Classes:  Buy shields, splint mail, broad swords, long bows and
                      arrows.

  * Magic-users:  Buy quarterstaffs and darts.

  * Clerics:  Buy splint mail, shields, staff slings, and maces.

  * Thieves:  Buy leather armor, short swords, short bows, and arrows.
  

  PREPARATION TIPS
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Once your party has been outfitted, encamp at an Inn and ready your weapons,
  armor, and shields.  Then have all spellcasters memorize spells.  Finally
  save the game before continuing.


  COMBAT
  ~~~~~~
  Adventurers must battle their way through many dangerous foes to complete
  the adventure.  The following sections offer some more information and tips
  for combat.

  Battle takes place on a tactical combat map that is more detailed view of
  the terrain that the party was on when the combat began.  This map is set
  up with an invisible square grid.


  INITIATIVE
  ~~~~~~~~~~
  Each round of combat is divided into 10 segments.  Every character and foe
  acts on a specific segment based on initiative.  Initiative is generated
  at the start of each combat round, and is modified by dexterity and random
  factors such as surprise.  Casting spells may take extra time to perform,
  so often a spell-caster will begin his spell on his segment and have it go
  off a few segments later.


  COMPUTER CONTROL
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In Combat, the players controls the actions of PCs.  The computer controls
  the actions of monsters, NPCs and PCs set to computer control with the
  QUICK command.


  COMBAT ABILITY
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Each characters ability in combat is defined by his AC, THAC0 and Damage.

  AC
  ~~
  A character or monster's difficulty to be hit is represented by his armor
  class or AC.  The lower the AC, the harder it is to hit the target.  AC is
  based on armor and a dexterity bonus.  Some magic items such as some bracers
  also help improve a character's AC.

  THAC0
  ~~~~~
  The character's THAC0 represents his ability to hit enemies in melee or
  with missile fire.  THAC0 stands for To Hit Armor Class 0.  This is the
  number a character must 'roll' equal or greater than to do damage on a
  target with an AC of 0.  The lower the THAC0, the better the chance to hit
  the target.

            Note: The generation of a random number is often referred
                  to as a 'roll'.  In determining if an attack hit, the
                  number generated is from 1 through 20.


  An attack is successful if the random number is greater than or equal to
  the attacker's THAC0 minus the target's AC.  THAC0 may be modified by
  range, attacking from the rear, magic weapons and magic spells among other
  things.

  DAMAGE
  ~~~~~~
  When a hit is scored, the attacker does damage.  Damage is the range of HP
  loss the attacker inflicts when he hits an opponent in combat and it
  depends on the attacker's strength and weapon type.  The damage each weapon
  can do is summarized in the Weapon Table, refer to the tables.

  Some monsters take only partial or no damage from certain weapon types.
  Skeletons, e.g., take only half damage from sharp or edged weapons, while
  some other monsters only take damage from magical weapons.


  ATTACKING
  ~~~~~~~~~
  There are two basic types of combat:  Melee and Ranged (or Missle).  The
  following describes each type and other rules governing combat:

  Melee Combat
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Melee combat is face-to-face fighting with weapons such as swords and maces.
  Only when using melee weapons can characters receive strength bonuses.
  During melee combat fighters can sometimes overpower several small foes,
  and thieves have opportunities to back stab.
  
  Ranged Combat
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Ranged combat is firing at distant enemies with weapons such as bows or
  darts. A character with a missile weapon (bow, sling, etc.) may not attack
  when adjacent to an enemy. Two arrows or three darts can be fired per turn.
  When opponents get too close for ranged combat, characters must switch to
  melee weapons.
  
  Multiple Attacks
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  When fighting small creatuers,fighter-types (fighters, rangers and paladins)
  may 'sweep' through several weak opponents in one combat round.  When a
  character sweeps, he automatically attacks all of the weak opponents.

  Back Stabbing
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A thief back stabs if he attacks a target from exactly opposite the first
  character to attack the target.  The thief may not back stab if he has
  readied armor heavier than leather.  A back stab has a better chance of
  hitting the defender and does additional damage.

  Saving Throws
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Attacks such as poison or spells do not automatically have their full effect
  on a target.  Victims may get a Saving Throw to avoid some or all of the
  effect.  If the saving throw is successful, generally the target suffers
  either no effect or only half damage.  As characters gain levels, saving
  throws improve.

      Note:
      ~~~~
      Some monsters have magical resistance which decreases their chance
      of being affected by spells.


  COMBAT MOVEMENT
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The number of squares a character can move is affected by the weight he's
  carrying, his strength and the kind of armor he has readied.  A character's
  movement range is displayed on the view screen and during the character's
  segment in combat.  Combat movement is important for both closing quickly
  with opponents (and stopping missle fire) and fleeing from battles that
  are too tough.

  Running Away
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A character may flee from the battlefield if he can move faster than all
  enemies, but not if he moves slower than any enemies.  A character has a
  50% chance to move off the battlefield if he can move as fast as the
  fastest monster.  Exception: if a monster or character can reach the edge
  of the combat map without any of his opponents being able to see him, he
  may then flee successfully even though he is slower than his opponents.

  Returning To The Party
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A character that moves off the battlefield returns to the party after the
  fight is over.  If all active characters flee combat, any dead or
  unconscious characters are lost.  If a whole party flees, it will not
  receive any experience points for monsters killed before retreating.


  COMBAT STRATEGIES
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  To succeed in combat, a skilled player deploys his party well, casts
  effective spells before and during combat, maneuvers his characters into
  advantageous positions and attacks using his most powerful characters and
  weapons.

  Deploying the Party
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  When a battle begins, your party is automatically positioned based on the
  order list of the characters. Characters near the top of the order will be
  in front lines and vulnerable to attack.  To change the starting
  deployment, change the order from the Alter menu while encamped.  Shift the
  heavily-armored fighters up the list and the vulnerable magic-users and
  thieves towards the bottom of the list.  Party order cannot be changed while
  in combat, although they are free to move.

  When battle begins, your party may be placed in a bad position.  Get an
  idea of the situation, and move characters into position.  Sometimes the
  best strategy is offensive:  Charginf with fighters to close ground and
  stop enemy missle fire.  Other times the best strategy is defensive:
  Moving your characters to anchor their flanks on an obstacle such as a
  wall or tree.  Setting up behind a doorway that your enemies have to move
  through makes for a very strong defensive position.  Always keep magic-users
  and missle weapons safe behind the front line.

  Wounded Characters
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Characters who are seriously injured should be moved out of the front lines
  if possible.  Remember: if you move away from an adjacent enemy, he gets a
  free attack at your back and has an improved chance to hit.

  Stopping Ranged Attacks
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Missile weapons cannot be fired if there is an adjacent opponent.  If you
  want to fire missiles, make sure you keep away from the enemy.  To stop
  enemy missile fire, move someone next to the opponent.

  Exploiting Enemies Weaknesses
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Exploit your opponents' weaknesses by directing attacks against helpless,
  wounded or isolated foes.  Concentrate your attacks to eliminate one
  opponent rather than injure many (Exception: enemy spell casters).  A foe
  with one hit point remaining attacks as powerful as an uninjured one.

  Spell casters cannot fire spells after they have taken damage in a round
  and they will lose any spells they are in the process of casting when they
  are hit.  Try to keep enemy spell casters under attack every round while
  protecting your own.


  AFTER COMBAT
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  If one or more characters survive on the battlefield at the end of combat,
  the bodies of unconscious or dead party members stay with the party.  If
  the entire party flees from combat, all unconscious and dead party members
  are permanently lost.  If ALL the party members are slain, go back to your
  last Saved Game and try again from that point.


  MAGIC
  ~~~~~
  Magic is integral to the survival of the party.  Magic-users cast many
  powerful offensive and defensive spells.  Clerics cast healing spells to
  revive wounded characters as well as both defensive and offensive spells.
  A spell can exist in one of four forms: in a character's memory, in a
  character's spell book, in a scroll or in a wand.  A spell-caster with a
  memorized spell can cast it using the CAST command.  Spells are memorized
  during rest while encamped.  Spells in scrolls or wands are cast with the
  USE command.
  
  Memorizing a spell takes 15 minutes of game time per spell level, plus a
  minimum period of preparation of four hours, plus two hours for 3rd level
  spells.  For example, first and second level spells take a minimum
  preparation of four hours, while third level spells take six hours.
  
            Example:
            To memorize (2) first-level spells, (1) second level
            spell and (1) third-level spell would take:
            (6 hours preparation) + (2*15min) + (1*30min) +
            (1*45min) = 7 hours 45 min.


  MAGIC-USERS
  ~~~~~~~~~~~
  When a magic-user trains for a new level, he selects a new spell to add to
  his spell book.  A magic-user can also scribe spells from identified scrolls
  if he is of high enough level to cast them.  A magic-user must cast the Read
  Magic spell or have a scroll identified in a shop before he can scribe or
  cast from it.  The scroll disappears after it has been scribed or cast.


  CLERICS
  ~~~~~~~
  Clerical magic requires no spell books.  All clerical spells of the
  appropriate level are always available to a cleric, the character need only
  memorize them.  Unlike magic-users, clerics can cast spells from scrolls
  without any preparation, but clerical scrolls also disappear after being
  cast.

  TIPS ON MAGIC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Both clerics and magic-users may cast spells which assist the party in
  combat. Preparatory spells cast just before a battle can protect and
  strengthen characters. Spells can be cast to damage foes during combat or to
  protect or heal comrades.  Healing spells can be cast either during or after
  combat to revive wounded comrades.
  
  Spells should be rememorized as soon as possible after they are used.  This
  is most likely to happen after combat.  When in camp, have your spell-
  casters memorize spells and select REST to allow them to imprint the spells
  for later use.  Selecting REST without choosing new spells has the spell-
  casters rememorize the spells they have cast since last resting.

       Note: Before resting, it is a good idea to save your game. We
             recommend that you save your game after every tough
             combat and that you keep at least two separate saved
             games at all times and alternate between them.  This will
             allow you to go back to a save before that fatal
             battle.



  MAGICAL TREASURES
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  As you travel about and encounter the monsters and puzzles that stand
  between you and finishing your various quests, you will also find magical
  items to help you on your way.  You can find out if there is a magic item
  in a treasure by doing a Detect Magic spell using the DETECT command.  To
  find out specifically what an item is, you must take it to a shop and have
  it identified.

  Some Magic items are in reality cursed and can do great harm.  When a
  character readies a cursed item, a Remove Curse spell must be cast before
  the item can be dropped.  Some magic items may only be used by certain
  classes.  Others may not work at all if certain other magic items are also
  in use.

  Here are the descriptions of some items that you may find.  Remember: Some
  items are very rare, and you may not find all of them in your adventure.
  

  Wands
  ~~~~~
  Wands are the traditional objects of enchantment.  Wands generally will
  cast a set number of a given spell (for example 10 Fire Balls or 15 Magic
  Missles).  Only experimentation or paying to have them identified will tell
  what a wand does.  The USE command allows a character to cast spells with a
  readied wand.
  
  Potions
  ~~~~~~~
  Potions are the most common sort of magical treasure.  Potions may heal
  wounded characters, cause them to become hastened or invisible or cause any
  number of other effects.  The USE command allows a character to drink a
  readied potion.

  Scrolls
  ~~~~~~~
  Scrolls carry either for clerical or magic-user spells.  A magic-user may
  use SCRIBE to transfer a scroll into his spell book if the spell is of a
  level he can memorize. Magic-users and clerics can both cast spells directly
  from scrolls with USE command, even if they could not otherwise memorize the
  spells.  Scrolls disappear after they have been used or scribed.
  
  Enchanted Armor and Shields
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Sometimes you may run across armor or shields that have been created by
  skilled craftsmen and then enchanted with protective spells.  The power
  of the magic on these items may vary a great deal.  Enchanted armor has
  the great advantage of offering improved protection with less encumbrance
  than the same type of mundane armor.  To use these items, ready them from
  the Items Menu.

  Enchanted Weapons
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Enchanted weapons come in many sizes and shapes and potencies.  Sometimes a
  weapon will add between one and four to your THAC0 and damage. Other weapons
  may have other magical properties including extra bonuses against specific
  types of creatures.  Once a magic weapon has been readied from the Items
  Menu, the character will have it for all combats.
  
  Enchanted Adornments
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Bracers, necklaces, periapts and especially rings are favorite objects for
  magical enchantment. These items may have any number of magical properties.
  Some items will help you AC, others may fire Magic Missiles, or offer
  protection from fire-based attacks. Once one of these items has been readied
  from the Items Menu, a character will automatically gain all effects.  The
  exception to this rule is that certain magical necklaces require the USE
  command to work.

  Enchanted Clothing
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Wizards will sometimes cast enchantments on commonplace items of clothing
  such as gauntlets or cloaks.  A wide variety of these items are know to
  exist.  To use these items, READY them from the Items Menu.


  CREATURES OF THE SAVAGE FRONTIER
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The denizens of these regions are many and varied.  Here is a list of
  monsters you may encounter in your adventures.  Some of these creatures
  are extremely rare, and you may never cross pathes with them at all.

  are powerful warriors.

  DISPLACER BEASTS resemble a six-legged puma with two ebony tentacles growing
  from behind its shoulders. These beasts have the magical ability to displace
  their image about three feet from their actual body, making them especially
  tricky opponents.

  DRAGONS are some of the most powerful and dangerous monsters a party can
  encounter.  The older and larger the dragon, the more damage it can do and
  the harder it is to kill.

  EFREET are genies from the elemental plane of fire.  These creatures are
  immune to all forms of fire, but can be hit by other magical attacks.

  ETTIN look like giant two-headed orcs.  They have great strength and can
  wield two spiked clubs that inflict terrible damage in combat.

  FROG (GIANT) resemble their smaller kin in everything but size.  Giant
  frogs have been known to swallow adventurers up whole.

  GHOULS are undead creatures who feed on the flesh of the still living.
  Their attack can paralyze all races of characters except elves.

  GIANTS vary greatly in power, intelligence, and tastes.  Below are some
  of the types of giants you are likely to encounter.

  FIRE GIANTS are brutal and ruthless warriors who resemble huge dwarves and
  have flaming red or orange hair and coal black skin.

  HILL GIANTS are one of the smaller of the giant races,they are brutish hulks
  possessing low intelligence and tremendous strength.

  GNOLLS are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam in loosely organized
  packs.  They attack by overwhelming unwary victims with their numbers.

  prefer the flesh of humans and demihumans.

  HELL HOUNDS are other-planar creatures resembling wolves, but they can
  breathe fire and detect invisible enemies.

  HOBGOBLINS are fierce humanoid warriors.  They are intelligent, organized,
  and aggressive.  Many times lesser humanoids will band together under a
  hobgoblin leader.

  LIZARDS (GIANT) are similar to their smaller kin in appearance and habit,
  although instead of eating insects, they prefer something more man-sized.

  MANTICORES are a strange mix with lions' torso and legs, bats' wings, spike
  tipped tains, and human heads.  They can fire volleys of spikes from their
  tails and have a great appetite for human flesh.

  MARGOYLES are stoney monsters that are immune to normal weapons and can

  They have the body of a large bear, and the head and slashing beak of a
  giant owl.  Owlbears are vicious, evil tempered, and ravenous.

  SALAMANDERS are natives of the elemental plane of Fire and so are immune to
  all fire-based attacks.  They are dangerous foes because of their evil
  nature and the fact that they can only be hit by magical weapons.

  SCRAGS also called river trolls,live in waterways and are related to trolls.
  They perhaps are the most feared of all troll-kind.

  SKELETAL WARRIORS are a more powerful type of skeleton.

  SKELETONS are one of the weaker types of undead.  These creatures are
  animated by evil wizards or clerics and are often used as guardians or
  warriors.

  SLUGS (GIANT) are huge, omnivorous mutations of the common garden pest.
  They attack by biting and can spit a highly corrosive acid.

  level of the caster to targets along its path.  If the target makes its
  saving throw, the damage is halved.  A lightning bolt is four or eight

We backed up against the stone buttress at the end of the bridge, waiting to
see what frightened everyone so badly.

A moment later they appeared, two riders in long, black robes with hoods that
hid their faces.  The came around the corner behind the temple of Tymora,
crossed the town square and ponded past us at the gallop.  We turned and
watched the guards stand back as the two raced through the gates and out of
the city.

Slowly, the people in the square resumed their activities.  Only now, they
were all in a hurry to be somewhere else.


JOURNAL ENTRY 3
The Boat Repairman's Story:

"Well funny you should ask.  See these three boats over here?  I found them
just last week, one by one, washed up on the sand bar outside town."

"See those holes in the sides?  I patched 'em up.  There were arrows in them,
lots of 'em.  Plenty of blood on the floorboards, too, but I cleaned that all
up."

"Haven't found any boats like that north of town, but I've been looking.
Maybe going north on the river's safer than going east."

"I'll fix 'em up and sell 'em.  It gives me the shivers thinking about what
happened to the people that were in 'em, but... The people who buy 'em will
never know.  What they don't know won't hurt 'em."


JOURNAL ENTRY 4
The Fisherman's Story:

The large fish market was almost empty, although the lingering smell of the
place told of better days.

"How'd you like my sign?" the fisherman asked us, proudly.  "Carved it m'self,
y'know! 'Course, could do it better.  Maybe now'd be a good time t'try.  What
with all the talk o'trolls and orcs and all, fisherman ain't goin' far up
river.  Ain't bringin' back much, neither"

"Good time for wood carvin'," he sighed sadly. "Bad time for sellin' fish."


JOURNAL ENTRY 5
The Stolen Rewards:

A curse upon their filthy heads!  They've taken all we had, stolen everything
save the clothes on our backs!

"More! More for everyone!: the waitress cried out at the tavern last night.
We looked at eachother, shame-faced at having fallen for so old a trick.
Someone slipped a little something in our food and we slept like contented
babies while the bandits stole us blind!

All the gold earned on our last mission is gone.  We endured those dangers,
did our jobs and now are left with empty pockets!  Our heads could have
festooned the end of an orcsish pike... all for nothing!

They even took my fine magical sword with the gold braided handle, the one I
used to slay the griffon at Longsaddle last winter.  What I would give to have
it one more time, if only to skewer the slime who committed this atrocity!

We still have the tiny purse of coins I kept beneath my pillow.  There isn't
much, but it will be enough to buy new weapons and a few supplies.  We need to
find a new sponser or a new mission quickly, to earn the money we need to
live.

Whatever mission we next accept, we will have a second quest to complete as
well: to catch these thieves and exact payment for last night!

JOURNAL ENTRY 6
The Guards At Yartar:

"We've been ordered that no one be allowed to leave the city for the rest of
the day.  Travellers from the north report that many bands of trolls have been
seen there, and some have been observed close to Yartar."

"These alerts normallt don't last very long.  If there's anything you need to
buy at any of the stores here in town, this is a good time to do it."

JOURNAL ENTRY 8
The Story Of The Priestess Of Waukeen:

"I never knew that a secret door led into the back of the temple like this!
I'm only glad that you are friends instead of enemies!"

"I'm sure the people who attacked you in the outer room were going to use the
secret door to enter the temple and kill us all!  As sure as the market
hawkers gather in the morning, they were sent here by the barbarians, and
Longtresses hereself.  All she wants is control of the city, and she doesn't
care with whom she allies herself to get it!"


JOURNAL ENTRY 9
The Waterbaron's Welcome:

"Welcome adventurers!  I regret that all of your treasure and possessions have
been stolen.  If the City Guards should recover any of your items they will be
returned to you."

"I also understand that you are in need of a commission, but I have nothing
for you at this time.  However, Yartar is a busy town filled with many people
from all corners of the Realms.  Perhaps in the streets you will find someone
in need of help during these troubled times."


JOURNAL ENTRY 10
Mielikki's Festival:

All around us there was activity, with music of many lutes and the snap of a
hundred banners flapping in the breeze.

In the heart of the glade a chorus of young girls sang a blessing of the
trees, and the birds seemed to echo back a happy, chirping refrain.

People everywhere were walking hand in hand, talking softly and revelling in
the beauty around them.  It was almost enough to make us forget the worries
and dangers that had brought us here to Silverymoon.


JOURNAL ENTRY 11
The Bargebuilder's Story:

"I hope this panic about armies of orcs and trolls ends soon.  We usually
build two barges a month here.  Now no one wants to send goods up river unless
they have to, and we have no new orders.

"The river going east was always dangerous, but now going south is bad, too.
Of course, the high forest is still far more dangerous than any other place in
this part of the Realms.


JOURNAL ENTRY 12
The Council Member's Story:

"You may not care to listen to our sad tales, with your own horrid stories of
orcish armies on the march, but here in Everlund strange things have been
happening as well.

"Many undead have appeared in the old part of the city to the north, livestock
have been disappearing from the pens near the river, and even stirges have
been so bold as to attack people in the streets.

"What has our peaceful little town done to deserve such misery?"


JOURNAL ENTRY 13
The Harbormaster's Story:

"I tell ye, young 'uns, the only reason that the Gallant Prince still be
anchored here in Port Llast Harbor is we ain't got no one who's darned fool
enough t'board'er and tow'er out t'sea.

"We'd all heard she wa' missin', then Simon Hempwright the fisherman says he
spied 'er adrift a mile off the coast, worm eat'n like she'd been a' sea a
hundred years.  The young idiot towed 'er in an' tied 'er up, an' then he
goes traipsing down below decks like she wa' some pleasure barge out o'
Waterdeep.

"Course we never seen 'um no more after that, 'cept some say you can hear 'is
screams a' night way back in town."


JOURNAL ENTRY 14
Longtresses Alaraun's Story:

"Please let me welcome you to Nesme.  We have just completed a very unhappy
task.  I had to seize the city by force of arms to save it from the corrupt
priests of Waukeen.

"By necessity, I enlisted the aid of some of the local... well, barbarians.
And I do admit that now some of them are out of control.  Take care as you
travel through our streets, for my comrades are dangerous and love to fight."


JOURNAL ENTRY 15
The Search Of The Mage's Bedroom:

In the debris you find a scrap of paper with the inscription:

ENWNWN.  Go Straight between turns until you must turn again.  Use the knock
on hidden door to the right.


JOURNAL ENTRY 16
The Mage Librarian's Story:

"Oh my, oh my, it's good to see you!  Yes, Amanitas and his assistant were
indeed here, but look!  Their room has been torn to pieces, and look at all
this blood on the floor!  Oh my, oh my!

"I fear something terrible has befallen them.  May Mystra guide you to his
aid!"


JOURNAL ENTRY 17
Lord Nasher's Story:

"I'm afraid you've come to Neverwinter in a time of great troubles.  Many
people were moving to the outskirts of the city to escape the troubles.  The
older, inner areas were becoming havens for criminals and all forms of
monsters.

"We converted several blocks of the old city to indoor gardens to help bring
people back to Neverwinter.  But now monsters have invaded the indoor gardens.
Instead of bringing people in and helping the city, the gardens are scaring
them away!"


JOURNAL ENTRY 18
The Nesme Harbormaster's Story:

"It's not my fault!  The story's the same in many towns on the river, not just
here in Nesme!  They can't blame me for this no, no, they can't!"

"The warehouses on the eastern side of the river have been beset by a plague
of giant frogs, and lizard men have been feasting on the herds in the stock
pens to the west of shore.  Now the shipping companies won't stop here because
of the danger!"

JOURNAL ENTRY 21
Krevish's Story:

"You know, I'd sure love to do something for you guys!  If you're looking for
work I have some friends here in Yartar who hire adventures all the time and
maybe they have something you could do and that way you could get back on your
feet again and I would've helped you and I would've repaid you for saving my
life and we'd be friends and wouldn't that be great?!"


JOURNAL ENTRY 22
Vaalgamon's Taunts:

"You pathetic little simpletons!  Did you think that a puny group of
snivelling would-be-heroes like yourselves could change one iota of my plan?!"

"Vaalgamon does not deal with your kind!  Hah!  I can snuff out your lives
with the heel of my boot as I would the tiniest of carrion-crawling insects!
I will leave the trivial task of killing you to my Kraken hosts."

He turned and swept out of the room, as the heavy door slammed shut behind
him.


JOURNAL ENTRY 23
The Sailor Turned To Stone:

Beside the statue we found a crumpled note:

"They wanted the sea lanes clear between Luskan and the Purple rocks, and any
ship they found there they took over or destroyed.  We were the only one of
the sad vessels in their path.

"One bye one the undead the commanded have killed our crew, transforming them
into lonely wanderers themselves.  Soon it will be my turn.  I only hope that
the tall one turns me to stone, as he did the Captain, so I may be spared such
eternal torture.

"Some are Krakens, but the magic-user is from a great tower somewhere to the
north.  He kept taunting the Krakens, saying they needed to go to all this
trouble because they were not clever.  He said that the wizards of the tower
had great power, but that they were clever too.  He said their treasure was
hidden in the opposite direction from where anyone would ever look."


JOURNAL ENTRY 24
Into The Hidden Complex:

We followed Krevish around several corners and down an alley, where he pressed
a hidden panel in a wall.  A door swung open, and after some hesitation we let
him lead us into a dark corridor.  Our weapons and armor clanked loudly as we
walked cautiously down the passageway, finally arriving before a heavy wooden
door.

Krevish knocked on the wood in complex patterns of beats with both knuckles
and palm, and in a moment it was opened by and angry looking man in well-
crafted armor.


JOURNAL ENTRY 25
The Meeting Beneath Yartar:

The man looked us over for a moment, not at all sure whether he liked the idea
that Krevish had brought our party to his secret lair.

"It's all right, Captain!" Krevish piped up enthusiastically.  "They saved my
life!  They didn't have to do i, they could have just kept walking, but they
stopped and risked their lives to save mine and that was really nice of them
and that's why you really ought to give them a chance to carry out a mission
for us because they've really earned a chance I think, don't you?"

The Captain rolled his eyes.  "All right Krevish, all right," he sighed.  "If
you'll just be quiet I'll give them a chance."

"As you know," he told us, "the Temples of Bane are dedicated to the
advancement of the Evin in the Realms.  Once cleric of Bane in the town of
Nesme, up the river to the North of here, has been causing great disruptions
in that city.

"We believe that to save Nesme from civil war he must be stopped.  If you
can find the Banite Cleric, and carry out this mission, you will have proven
yourselves to be as valuable as Krevish here says you are.  Well... almost as
valuable, anyway."


JOURNAL ENTRY 26
The College Dean's Story:

"It's really been quite terrible, quite awful here.  The areas near the docks
on the north bank of the river are full of lizard men and other monsters.
Here! In Silverymoon! It's unheard of!"

"It's as if someone was trying to keep the good law-abiding folk away from the
river.  Perhaps the orcs plan a great offensive and are trying to deprive us
of supplies.

"What will become of us?  Silverymoon was such a peaceful town.  I just don't
know..."


JOURNAL ENTRY 27
The Captain of the Riders of Nesme's Story:

"Yes, we too have heard the stories of the trolls gathering in a great army to
the east in the Trollmoors, and now small groups of them have been seen in the
ruins to the east of the city.

"We should be going out to drive them back!  We should be scouting the moors
to see what's going on!  But are we?  No!  We're confined to barracks because
Longtresses Alarun has taken over.  If we go near the city now, the crazy
barbarians will start a full-scale ware!"


JOURNAL ENTRY 28
Erek's Story:

"Don't just stand there! Amelior Amanitas, the brilliant magic user for whom
I work, is in great danger!  They said they were taking him up the river to
Everlund, and from there overland to Llorkh and on to Zhentil Keep!  They
were furious that he'd discovered their plan, and there's no telling what
they'll do to him once he's there!"

"If we don't find him before they leave Everlund we'll never have a chance --
there are so many routes they could take towards Llorkh... we have to find him
quickly!"


JOURNAL ENTRY 29
The Challenge Of Amanitas:

We quickly summarized for Amanitas what we had learned thus far.  We also told
how some Banites believed that only he could stop the forces of Zhentil Keep
from conquering the lands of the Savage Frontier.

"What was revealed to you by the Banites is correct," he said when we'd
finished.  "I learned much of the tale from an escaped slave who had been a
servant to the Zhentarim general Vaalgamon, and my investigators since have
only served to confirm how great the danger truly is.

"Although most of their story has been lost in time, I know now that four
statuettes were created in ancient Ascore.  They were powerful magical items
used in the defense of the city, although precisely how they worked is still
a mystery.  One was crafted to focus on each direction of the compass,
protecting Ascore from the enemies to the North, East, West and South.

"When the city fell into ruins the statuettes passed from owner to owner
throughout the Savage Frontier for many centuries.  They travelled in
directions very different from their names.  For example the stauette of the
East has for many years been hidden somewhere in the west.

"Now the Zhentarium have dispatched Vaalgamon to collect the statuettes.  They
believe that by returning the statuettes to Ascore they can open a safe path
through the great desert.  Throught that path they intend to send armies to
conquer the entire Savage Fronteir.

"We must find and seize the statuettes before Vaalgamon can collect them, or
a pall of darkness will fall across the north.

"My magical investigations cannot tell me exactly where they are located, but
I have a sense of the place where each statuette now lies.  To find them you
cannot follow a map of the road beneath your feet -- I can lead you to your
goals only by revealing the pathways you must trace within your own souls.

"First you must lift your eyes with hope, even if the vision which fills them
is one of evil.  The statuette of the east is located in a great tower, and
when you look up at its many spires you shall know that you have found it.

"Next you must seek the small truths within the large, unfathomable world, for
these are the only truths you will ever truly know.  The stauette of the west
lies in a small chest carved from the pearl of a great oyster, in a small
room carved from the rock of a great mountain, which is itself made small by
the greatness of the sea.

"You must then travel to the place to which people do not wish to go, because
we never truly covet that which we can easily attain.  The Statuette of the
North lies nowhere close by, but on the long way that many travellers
nonetheless must pass.

"Then you must soar where even the birds cannot fly, and have faith that even
without wings you can reach great heights.  The Statuette of the South lies
both high and above and far below the surface of the land.

"If you gain the four statuettes, take them to Ascore.  I have created one
more special item, which when combined withe the four ancient images, will
turn the Zhentarim's planned triumph into total and irreversible defeat.  But
this can only be accomplished in the ancient plaza at Ascore."

He reached into his robes and drew out a small, square card that looked like
it was made of a thin layer of metal.  Runes were embossed upon it.

"This isn't it!"  He exclaimed, annoyed.  "But I suppose you should take it
anyway.  It's one of my latest inventions.  I call it the Card of Counting.
If you carry it to the vaults in Yartar, Neverwinter and silverymoon will all
save and exchange your valuables as if they were really just one place.  Could
be quite handy, yes quite handy.  Don't leave here without it."

"Well that's it!  Good luck to you, ans may you find the path easy to follow.
You can come and visit me any time at my house in Secomber, and if I've
learned more about any of the statuettes, I'll be happy to share the
information with you.  Good bye!"

"The magic item?" we asked.  "There was an important magic item you were going
to give us?"

"Oh yes, yes, yes.  Musn't forget it.  Very important."  He searched through
his robes once more...


JOURNAL ENTRY 30
Brinshaar's Story:

"My name is Brinshaar, and I am a magic-user from Neverwinter.  They kidnapped
me there and were torturing me to learn of Lord Nashar's magical defenses.
Thanks to you they learned nothing, and Neverwinter remains safe!"

"As it turns out, I can repay you for your kindness without delay. I have seen
this statuette you tell me that you seek.  It is not secreted in the
Hosttower, but somewhere in the dungeouns where we now stand."


JOURNAL ENTRY 31
The Banite Cleric's Letter Fragment:

"... that you found the explanation for the gatherings of trolls and orcish
armies in the north.  I had suspected it was the work of the Zhentarium, and
if we had not discovered it in time they might have conquered this entire
region."

"The fools believe that it is their cunning and their might that brings them
such awesome power.  Have they forgotten so quickly about the temples of Bane,
and the power that even our own leaders cannot abdicate?  That we, the clerics
who carry out Bane's will, are the ones who have made the name of the
Zhentarium feared throughout the Realms?

"I agree with your letter, and although we have never met I feel closely
bound to you.  By destroying this plan before it starts we shall ensure that
never again will the Banite clerics be taken for granted in Zhentil Keep!"

"I will meet you during the festival of Mielikki in the hidden temple behind
your shop in Silverymoon.  We shall find the magic-user from the south who
cal turn the power of the Zhentarim against itself.  Then we shall see how
brilliant the Zhentarim prove to be!"

"We must not think that because we know about their plans to cross the desert
it will be simple to stop them.  I am confident we will be successful within
days only because... "

The remainder of the letter was destroyed, and the ashes crumble to
nothingness in my hands.


JOURNAL ENTRY 32
The Waterbaron's Warning:

"I must ask you to leave this place immediately!  Great forces here seek your
destruction.  I will not help them but neither can I stand in their way.  Go
now!"


JOURNAL ENTRY 33
Broadhand's Story:

Broadhand led us into a small, hidden room decorated with images and statues
of Bane.  He obviously believed us to be fellow Banites from the temple at
Nesme.

"I was worried when I sent my letter and no messenger came bearing a reply.
I'm glad to see you've arrived during the Festival as I suggested."

"Once the Zhentarim would have been content with having found a way to open
this safe caravan route through the Great Desert.  They would have let time
pass, allowing towns and villages to become dependent on a supply route that
only the Zhentarim controlled.  Then, quietly but inexorably, the hidden
reins of power would be pulled into their grasp."

"Now their greed to seize the northern Realms is unbounded and impatient.
Sending armies across the Great Desert!  Who would ever have believed it?!
They have forgotten that a single dagger at midnight may sow a greater terror
than 10,000 swords at dawn!"

"Even now they are completing their complex on the eastern edge of the desert,
and are reclaiming the dead city of Ascore on the Western edge as well.  They
have forged alliances with the Krakens and with other forces in the north.  I
also hear tales that something big is going on in Llorkh.  Magic items of
great power are being collected for the task, and I have been assured that
they do indeed have the power to allow the safe crossing of the desert!"

"We must strike now!  Controlling the Realms from the Moonsea to the Sea of
Swords will greatly strengthen the Zhentarim and the Banites will be lost!"

"Visiting here in Silverymoon at the Vault of the Sages is the wizard I wrote
you about, Amelior Amanitas from Secomber.  He learned much of this plot from
a slave who had escaped from a Zhentarium caravan, and is convinced he can
stop it with his magical powers."

"He sent a message to a fellow wizard here in Silverymoon, but one of my
acolytes waylaid the courier and we learned the plan.  Since Amanitas has now
come here himself, he must have received word of the messenger's death and is
willing to take great risks to defeat the Zhentarim."

"You must find Amanitas quickly, help him on his task, but do not tell him
you are Banites or he will never listen to you.  For all his brilliance he
refuses to accept the beauty of pure Evil, and will never know the joy we
find in Bane."

"Hurry now!  As we speak our enemies make progress on their path!"

He slipped out of the room, motioning for us the wait a short time before
leaving to complete our "mission".


JOURNAL ENTRY 34
The Escape Of The Prisoners:

Three men rushed from the tiny cell, their clothes in tatters, eyes drawn from
lack of food and sleep.

One stopped to look down at the dead Banite, and a broad smile spread across
his hollow face.  "Looks like you've done the job we were sent to do!" he said
laughing unnaturally.  "Now we can go home and take the credit!"  We of the
Zhentarim salute you!"

His companions blanched as he said the forbidden word -- only others dare to
use that name, never the Zhentarim themselvers.  They cursed in hushed voices,
pulled him from the room, and were instantly out of sight.

We looked at each other helplessly.  Because we knew the Banite to be evilm
we had slain him -- the one man who could stop Zhentarim's plan for the
conquest of the Savage Frontier.  There was no choice.  We had been searching
for a mission.  Now, by accident, we had found one.  We would have to save the
Northern Realms ourselves.

JOURNAL ENTRY 35
The Kraken Stronghold:

The castle that rose above us was so great in size that it dominated the
entire island, as if it were a statue and the whole of Trisk were only its
base.

The front of the building was carved in the image of a massive squid that rose
a hundred feet above the island, its huge eyes glowing from some frightful,
hidden light.  Behind it the building had gradually transformed into a heavily
fortified castle, with high parapets that seemed to go on and on and on until
they merged into the cliffsides of the coast.

JOURNAL ENTRY 37
The Arena Beneath Llorkh:

The arena in which we stood was broad and spacious, surrounded by seats for
several thousand spectators.

Most of those seats were already filled.  Several hundred black-robed men sat
in one section, beside and equal number of other humans and a few strange-
looking beings in the shadows -- they may have been drow elves.  Seperated
from the humans by a respectfully wide zone of empty seats, the remainder of
the arena was filled by orcsm with a scattering of goblens and even bugbears.

The great bowl was filled with the din of a thousand conversations, but every
voice was silenced at once when a guard called out, "All rise for Lord
Vaalgamon!"

The familiar figure of the Zhentarim general strode onto a dais on the western
side of the arena and motioned for his followers to be seated.

"Well my friends!" he told us, a hideous smile distorting his already twisted
features, "I see we have the pleasure of meeting again!"

"I must say that I admire the courage and cunning that have brought you this
far.  You have defeated forces that should have defeated you.  Their deaths
at your hands are appropriate punishment for their failure."

"As a reward for your achievements, I will give you all a chance.  Defeat
three sets of opponents in my arena and I shall let you live."

"Let the combat begin!"

Across the arena a stell grating opened, and we turned to face our first
opponent...


JOURNAL ENTRY 38
King Threlked Ironfist's Story:

"Ever since the reports of the meteorite strike on the north end of the
island, many adventurers have come here seeking ore for magical swords.
However, no one on this island can craft such fine weapons.

"I warn all adventurers, but few listen.  There are many canyons that cut
across the island, and some have networks of great volcanic caves filled with
fearsome monsters.  Only parties of veteran adventureres should dare to enter
them."

The Utheraal Villager's Story:

"The headquarters of the Kraken Society is on Trisk, the other island just
accross the strait.  They also have fortresses here on Utheraal, on the
western coast, where they force us to pay tribute.

"They take almost everything we have, but if we don't pay they will take us
away as slaves.  I don't know if you can defeat them, but whatever you do can
only make our lives better."


JOURNAL ENTRY 41
The Zhentarim Ship Arrives:

Rounding a rocky point far below us was a ship with a single, huge, red sail.
A large black "M" filled its billowing expanse, which we could only speculate
was the symbol of Lord Manshoon, the leader of the Zhentil Keep.

A single man stood at the railing near the bow, his black cape flowing behind
him in the stiff sea breeze.  could it be Vaalgamon himself?

The ship swung to the northwest, its sail dropping as it entered the lee of
the island and started to approach a large dock.  Men ran accross the decks
and scrambled up the rigging as they prepared for their arrival.

If this ship was coming for the statuette, our time was running out!


JOURNAL ENTRY 42
The Story Of Phintarn Redblade:

The flowers were left in beautifully woven baskets beside the street, and had
delicate hand-embroidered ribbons on them.  One said simply "In memory of
Phintarn Redblade, Last Ruler of Llorkh."

Another read:

"Tonight thy killers sit within thy keep, But soon they'll lien beneath it...
six feet deep."

A guard wandered by and saw us looking at the flowers.  Drawing his sword, he
knocked them from hy hand and crushed them with his boot.  "If you're a dwarf-
lover," he warned us, "Llorkh is no place for you!"


JOURNAL ENTRY 43
Muthtur's Story:

As if he'd read our thoughts, the creature said, "Yess I'm a half-orc and to
you I'm ugly as an otyugh.  I'm also the hideous inhuman thing that saved your
lives."

We all looked at each other, embarrassed and several of us murmured our
thanks.

"I lived with a small colony of other outcasts in the High Forest, until
raiding parties from Llorkh captured me and brought me here.  They call me a
'novelty fighter' and said it'd be fun to watch something different in the
arena for a change.

"I'm no novelty, I'm a person.  And I killed the man who said it.  My name is
Muthtur and all I want to do is go home."

"When they brought me here I saw them use a secret door in the north alcove
of the arena.  I don't know where it leads, but it may help us all get out
of here."


JOURNAL ENTRY 44
The Potter's Story:

"I overheard our captors saying that fire giants have been preying on any
adventurers who were lucky enough to find meteorites.  The giants sell the
stolen ore to pirates in exchange for gems, grain or even some of us as
slaves."

She shivered visibly and thanked us once again for saving them.


JOURNAL ENTRY 45
The Dying Zhentarim's Defiance:

"You may have gotten this far, but even if you could get all the statuettes
you'd never make it to Ascore... Vaalgamon is far too clever for you, and our
power is too great...

"Enjoy your triumph for tonight, for it will rot into disaster by tomorrow!"


JOURNAL ENTRY 46
The Story Of The Hidden Dwarves:

"We have been prisoners in our own city ever since Lord Redblade was killed.
They say it was an accident, but we all know it was the Zhentarim that killed
him, and that it is they who control Llorkh.  Geildarr is only a puppet, an
outsider brought here by them to control the town.

"Just a few days ago a Zhentarim column came through Llorkh, and they murdered
any dwarf they could find.  That's why we're now in hiding -- this is the lair
of a medusa, but even with her hell hound guards we are safer here than on the
city's streets.:


JOURNAL ENTRY 47
Kestutis' Story:

"My name is Kestutis, and I was once a knight who served the kings of Tuern
and Gundarlun.  In those days the two islands were friends, not the tense
rivals they have come to be."

"Here on Tuern I dared to enter the hottest volcanic vents in search of evil
fire giants who terrorized Uttersea, and the old King gave me this ancient
fortress as a reward for my service."

"I am impressed by your valor and your skill in taking on the mission you
have described.  Just as I risked my life in service to the people of the
north, so you are risking yours.  Take this, the Armor of the Glacier that
I wore during my service -- it will give you the protection against fire and
against the monsters which it spawns."

The Signs At Secomber:

"The road and river to the east have become very dangerous.  Go only if you
need to, and try to travel with a strong group of experienced adventurers."

The Aarakocra's Story:

"High atop the Star Mounts the birds cannot go.  Our homes are there, and only
we and the dragons can brave the fierce winds that blow through the mountain
tops.  We have seen black dragons fly to an aerie on one of the highest peaks,
and saw it to be that a human female rode upon the back of one such dragon.

"We have heard that the chambers within the mountain be crafted as a maze.  It
has been told that the corridors be in the form of the first initial of their
owner in three different runic alphabets, each superimposed upon the other
and on their own inverses, so that the letters are entwined in many layers."

The Guilty Citizen's Story:

"I didn't want to help them, really I didn't.  I haven't taken a share of
pirate booty in years.  They said if I didn't report on Jagaerda's movements
they'd turn me over to the King!"

"I don't know where they have her!  I took my reports to a house hidden away
among the cliffs on the southern coast.  Please spare me!  I've told you
everything I know!"

An Ounce Of Justice:

Several weapons were stacked in one corner of the room, and suddenly cried out
in delight.

My magical long sword, the gold braid on its handle tarnished but undamaged,
lay amidst the pile of crudely crafted weapons!  I ran over, pulled it from
its sheath and examined the blade -- still sharp and true as any arrow fired
from Helm's bow!

Whatever evils might stalk the Realms, I knew that for this one moment justice
had been done.  The gold they'd stolen from us at the Inn was gone forever,
but with this sword our honor was restored!


JOURNAL ENTRY 54
Ceptienne's Welcome:

"Welcome to my home", the image said, smiling.  "My name is Ceptienne, and I
know that you are here to steal the Statuette of the South from me."  She
waited for the effect of this proclamation to take hold.

"You have proven yourselves worthy adversaries to have gotten this far, and I
enjoy the challenge of a clever enemy.  I shall kill you... yes, that much is
certain.  But I shall give you a chance to find the object you seek."

A great crystal globe beside here flickered to life, and the statuette
appeared within it.  "My fortress here has many portals.  Twelve now stand
between you and your objective.  I shall follow your movements with interest."

She smiled once more and the image faded from view.


JOURNAL ENTRY 55
King Redaxe Tells Of The Purple Rocks:

"The Purple Rocks may be the isles you seek," said the King. "They have become
a sad place.  Their people were like other island folk, hardworking, many of
them seafarers.  A few generations ago something strange occurred, and many
gathered in a secret cult which has become very powerful, called the Kraken
Society.  They worship the symbol of the Kraken, a huge squid that can easily
destroy great ships."

"There are two islands in the Purple Rocks, Utheraal and Trisk.  The people of
Utheraal are impoverished, but continue to live as before. The people of Trisk
however, have been completely consumed by the Krakens and are controlled by
them."

"I know you have been to Tuern already, but it is there that you have the best
chance of finding someone who will take you to the Purple Rocks.  May Selune
guide you on your journey."

The Man Of Mirrors' Story:

"I search and research... I fing the hidden... I solve the unsolvable.  I find
reason within chaos and harmony from the stars."

"Vaalgamon has entrusted to me the riddle of the mirror-maps and they shall
not defeat me!  Already I have confirmed much of what they tell, and soon
I shall give the general everything he seeks and more!"


JOURNAL ENTRY 57
The Magic Mouth's Story:

"You have done well, adventurers," the stone face said. Its voice was deep and
its features expressionless, but the tone of its words was warm, almost
friendly."

"It is time for you to reap your reward. Look within the waters of my fountain
and discern what riches can await you!"

Everyone looked at the spraying wather as an image began to form there.  The
vision showed a pool filled not with water, but with gold.  Each member of the
party was swimming in it, leaping about and laughing and tossing coins in the
air.

The image faded.  "That was a dream, my friends, but it is a dream that you
can make real.  Drop the statuettes in my warm waters and this ocean of gold
shall be yours!"

The Old Thief's Story:

"I was once an adventurer like you, in service to the Lords' Alliance, and a
fine pickpocket when it came to relieving our enemies of their documents...
and perhaps an occasional jewel to compensate me for my trouble!"

"He was a contemptuous buffoon, Vaalgamon was, pushed me down in the street
as he passed by, for no good reason.  I may be an old man, but I still have
the touch!  I saw to it that Vaalgamon didn't leave Sundbar with everything
he'd brough!"  He held out an aged but steady hand, presenting an envelope
with a broken wax seal.

We opened the envelope and removed what seemed to be a hastily scribbled note:

"Fool!  You allow me one tiny band of mongrels to threaten everything our
legions now pursue!"

Get to the pyramids at Ascore without delay!  Let no one pass through the
stronghold!  Guard every pathway -- I care not to hear tour tales of how many
there are.  If the Road fails you will pay for your carelessness!"

The note was signed with a large, scrawled letter "M".

Notes From A Prison Cell:

As I sit and write my journal the unrelenting cold spreads deep within my
bones.  The stone floor and thick walls of my cell here in Zhentil Keep drain
every last ounce of warmth from my body.

We never understood the significance of the statuettes, nor their power.  With
all four in his possession, Vaalgamon achieved his goals, and all the northern
Realms fell under the Zhentarim shadow.

Our riches have availed us nothing. We were hunted down, captured, and brought
to this prison, where they keep us alive only out of a desire for revenge.  If
only we had the chance to live the past over once again...

JOURNAL ENTRY 62
A Lonely Lament:

I hear the sounds of many footsteps approaching.  I'm sure that they will find
us soon.

If we had known of Ceptienne's true role as an opponent of the Zhentarim, the
real statuettes would have been ours instead of the false ones we now hold.

We must assume that Vaalgamon's boastful speech was correct, and that the High
Forrest holds the spot where the magical path across the desert ends.

But to know this now is useless.  We have fallen into his trap and we are his
to play with, as a cat plays with the mouse it is about to devour.

Perhaps others will follow us on this path and find that victory awaits them
instead of death.
