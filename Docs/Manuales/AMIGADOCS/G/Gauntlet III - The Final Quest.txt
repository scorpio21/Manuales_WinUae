THE FINAL QUEST
---------------
THE ANCIENT WORLD OF GAUNTLET HAS MANY MYSTERIES AND DANGERS. AMIDST ITS
STORM TOSSED OCEANS,LEGENDS SPEAK OF ONE LAND WHICH SURPASSES ALL OTHERS.
CAPRA,HOME OF THE 8 KINGDOMS,ISLAND OF MAGNUS THE WIZARD KEEPER.

CAPRA HAS SEEN MANY WARS IN ITS HISTORY,FOUGHT BETWEEN THE DENIZENS OF ITS
LANDS,MOUNTAINS AND FORESTS. DEATH AN D MISERY WROUGHT THEIR HARVESTS, AND
THERE APPEARED TO BE NO END IN SIGHT TO THE SUFFERING AND AGONY.THEN, SEVERAL
CENTURIES AGO, A WIZARD CAME, TO COUNSEL THE RULERS OF THE KINGDOMS WHICH
REMAINED, AND BRING THEM TO PEACE. WHEN ALL OF THOSE DISPUTES WERE SOLVED,
AND THE BORDERS RE-DRAWN, THE WIZARD SAID THUS;

`I HAVE BROUGHT PEACE,AND PEACE THERE SHALL REMAIN,FROM EACH OF THE REMAINING
KINGDOMS, I SHALL TAKE A SMALL PORTION,AND THEREOF MAKE MY OWN KINGDOM,THE
KINGDOM OF MAGIC. I SHALL BUILD GATES THERE,BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE DARK
DIMENSIONS  WHICH WOULD DEVOUR IT.THEN LET THIS BE MY LAW,THE LAW OF MAGNUS 
THE WIZARD-ETERNAL,THE WIZARD PEACE-KEEPER.SHOULD THERE BE WAR AGAIN BETWEEN
THE KINGDOMS OF THIS  LAND,THEN SHALL THOSE GATES BE OPENED,AND ALL FOUL
CREATURES OF DARKNESS LET FORTH. THIS BE THE FINAL PEACE;FOR IF IT IS
BROCKEN,ALL CAPRA SHALL BE AT THE MERCY OF THE DEVOURERS.

THE KINGDONS RULERS HAD LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THIS TRUCE,AND SO IT WAS
AGREED- SEVEN KINGDOMS SHOULD BECOME EIGHT.IN THE WAKE OF THIS AGREEMENT,PEACE
CAME AT LAST TO CAPRA.IT PROSPERED,AND CREATURES WHO WERE ONCE ENEMIES BECAME
FRIENDS.FOR THREE CENTURIES,ALL WAS WELL.THEN THE VELCRONS CAME.

LEGENDS SPOKE OF SLEEK WAR GALLEYS THAT SKIMMED THE BOILING OCEANS AND OTHERS
OF VAST CAVES THAT BROKE OPEN ON THE SURFACE OF THE LAND. WHATEVER THEIR
ORIGIN, THE VELCRONS WERE THE SERVANTS OF THOSE GRIM ENTITIES WHO CHAFFED
BEHIND THE GATES. THEIR PURPOSE WAS SINGULAR TO BRING THE EIGHT KINGDOMS TO
WAR ONCE MORE,AND CAUSE ALL TO BE EXTINGUESHED.

INSIDIOUS AND LORE-WISE, THE VELCRONS SOWED SEEDS OF DOUBT AND MISTRUST IN THE
PEOPLE OF CAPRA. THEY BROUGHT THE SPECTRE OF VIOLENT DEATH BACK TO THE LAND,
AND GAVE FALSE COUNSEL TO KINGS AND NOBLES. FINALLY, THEY ACHIEVED THEIR AIM.
FOR ONE BRIEF WEEK - BEFORE FEAR AND REASON COMBINED CRIED HOLD - THE ARMIES 
OF THE TREE KINGDOM MARCHED AGAINST THOSE OF THE SWAMPLANDS. QUICKLY, THE 
OTHER KINGS RUSHED TO ESTABLISH PEACE ONCE MORE,CASTING ANXIOUS EYES TOWARDS
THE MAGIC KINGDOM,FEARING THE WORST. WHEN, FOR A WHILE, THERE WAS NO SIGN OF
THE HORRORS FORETOLD, ALL GAVE THANKS TO THE GODS FOR THEIR DELIVERANCE.

BUT, AS THE MONTHS WENT BY, A CURSE DESCENDED ON THE LAND. THE RIVERS WHICH
FLOWED OUT OF THE MAGIC KINGDOM BECAME FOUL, POLLUTED, AND LIFELESS. NEW
COURSES EVOLVED, SPREADING MORE OF THE KILLING OOZE. AND THE WIND, WHEREVER IT
BLEW, CARRIED THE STENCH OF DEATH AND DECAY.

THOSE BRAVE ENOUGH TO VENTURE WITHIN THE MAGIC KINGDOM - AT LEAST THOSE FEW 
WHO RETURNED - SPOKE OF A NEW KING THERE, A BEING WHOSE FLESH WAS STUDDED
WITH THE FEATURES OF THOSE HE DEVOURED, A BEING OF CORRUPTION. HE WAS KNOWN AS
CAPRICORN, AND - SOMEHOW - HE HAS MADE MAGNUS HIS CAPTIVE, AND TAKEN HIS
THRONE. WISE MEN DELIBERATED AND CAME TO THEIR CONCLUSIONS. DURING THE BRIEF
HOURS OF MADNESS THAT HAD ALMOST BROUGHT 2 KINGDOMS TO WAR, THIS BEING HAD
PASSED THE GATES. CAPRICORN WAS A HARBRINGER OF DOOM.

THUS CAPRA ENCOMPASSED ITS RUIN. CROPS FAILED. PESTILENCE ENSUED. THE POOR
WERE STRUCK DOWN BY DISEASE AND PLAGUE. WORSE, THOUGH, THE PEOPLES OF THE 8
KINGDOMS BEGAN TO WHISPER HATRED AGAINST EACH OTHER ONCE MORE, AND PLOTS WERE
HATCHED FOR WAR!!

SO THE CALL HAS COME TO THE BRAVEST CHAMPIONS OF CAPRA. EIGHT ARE NOW GATHERED
FOR THIS, THE GREATEST CHALLENGE IN THE GAUNTLET SAGA. WILL THEY PREVAIL
AGAINST CAPRICORN, AND DRIVE BACK HIS HORDES BEYOND THE GATES? CAN THEY
PREVAIL, EVEN THOUGH THE VERY FOOD THEY EAT MAY BE POISONED, EVEN THOUGH THERE
ARE FEW THEY DARE TRUST? FOR THE SAKE OF ALL CAPRA, WE MUST HOPE SO...

PURSUED THOSE WHO WOULD FRACTURE THE FRAGILE PEACE OF THE ISLAND ENJOYS.

TREASURE. OF ALL THE VALKRYIES THERE HAVE EVER BEEN, NONE ARE MORE VAUNTED

COULD TEACH HIM. HE ALSO CAME TO UNDESTAND THAT MAGIC COULD NOT MASTER EVERY
SITUATION, AND LEFT HIS STUDIES AT THE LAST TO TRAVEL THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF
OTHER SECRETS. NOW, ADDED TO HIS ARCANE KNOWLEDGE ARE GREAT FIGHTING SKILLS 
AND VAST COURAGE.

QUESTOR THE ELF
---------------
ONCE THE ELVES WERE A RACE APART, LIVING IN WHAT IS NOW THE FOREST KINGDOM AND
ALONG THE SHORES OF THE SEA KINGDOM, BUT THE ANCIENT WARS DESTROYED THIS PROUD
PEOPLE, AND SCATTERED THEM THROUGH-OUT CAPRA. SLOWLY, THEIR ISOLATED VILLAGES
DIED OFF, AND BY THE TIME TIME PEACE CAME, THEY WERE ALREADY BEYOND ALL HOPE.
QUESTOR BECAME THE LAST OF HIS PEOPLE A DECADE AGO, WHEN HE BURNED HIS HOME
IN THE FOREST ALONG WITH THE BODIES OF HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS,KILLED IN
AMBUSH.

PETRAS THE ROCKMAN

AS THE FIRST MEN WERE SAIDS TO BE MADE OUT OF CLAY, SO CAME TO CAPRA A RACE
OF LIVING ROCK, WHO MADE THEIR HOME IN MOUNTAIN EYRES, AND LIVED THEIR
MILLENIA LONG LIVES IN PEACE. BUT DURING THE WARS THAT SHOOK THE ISLAND, EVEN
THEIR REMOTE HOMES WERE NOT SAFE, AND THEY WERE FORCED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.
NOW, THEIR WARRIORS ARE AMONG THE MOST FEARED OF THEM ALL, AND PETRAS IS FIRST
AMONGST THEM, A GIANT OF LIVING ROCK.

DRACOLIS THE LIZARD MAN
-----------------------
ONCE, DRACOLIS WAS A THIEF AND RENEGADE, DESPISED FOR HIS SLY WAYS, AS ARE 
MANY OF HIS SWAMP-DWELLING PEOPLE. AFTER ESCAPING FROM PRISON, DRACOLIS TURNED
OVER A NEW LEAF, AND HAS BEEN A FRIEND TO THE POOR EVER SINCE. SOME SAY HE
CAN AFFORD TO BE, SINCE HE ALWAYS SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE THERE IS TREASURE TO
BE FOUND, AND HIS GREATEST ACTS OF BRAVERY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOLLOWED BY A
HEALTHY INCREASE IN HIS BANK BALANCE.

ARMOUR..........CHAIN (GOOD)

BLIZZARD THE ICE MAN
--------------------
WHAT MOTIVATES THIS REDOUBTABLE WARRIOR, WHO CAN SAY? HIS CRYSTALLINE FACE
BETRAYS NO EMOTION, NOE DOES HE EVER SHOW FEAR OR DOUBT. INSTEAD, HE IS ALWAYS
IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE FIGHT AGAINST EVIL, A WARRIOR DEDICATED TO DESTROYING
THOSE WHO WOULD BREAK MAGNUS`D PEACE. HIS GREATEST WEAPON IS THE LONG KNIFE HE
CARRIES PERMANTLY, THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF WHICH CHILLS AN ENEMY TO THE BONE.

ARMOUR..........ICE HARD FROST (EXCELLENT)

NEPTUNE THE MERMAN
------------------
THE MERMEN OF THE SEA KINGDOM, A PROUD AND HAUGTHY PEOPLE WERE INVOLDED IN
MANY OF THE WARS BEFORE MAGNUS CAME.SINCE THE PEACE, HOWEVER, THEY HAVE
REGONISED THEIR FAULTS. IT IS NOW PART OF THEIR TRADITION THAT EACH PRINCE
OF THE BLOOD SHOULD JOURNEY AMONG OTHER LANDS, TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PEOPLES
AND BRING THEM AID WHERE HE CAN. NEPTUNE, THE GREATEST OF ALL PRINCES, MADE
SUCH A JOURNEY AND NEVER RETURNED FROM IT. TO HIM, THE BEST WAY HE CAN SERVE
HIS PEOPLE IS TO DESTROY THEIR  ENEMIES FAR FROM THE WIND-SWEPT WATERS OF HOME

-------------------------==========================--------------------------
                                  THE KINGDOMS

THE TREE KINGDOM
----------------
THE TREE KINGDOM WAS FOUNDED BY THE TREE DWELLERS OF GREAT FORESTS. THESE
CREATURES ARE NORMALLY PEACEFUL, KEEPING SMALL HERD ANIMALS IN PENS ON THE
GROUND, AND GATHERING FRUIT AND NUTS, BUT THE CONTAGION FROM THE MAGIC KINGDOM
HAS SPREAD AMONGST THEM. EVEN SOME OF THE NEW PLANTS HAVE NOW TAKEN A SINISTER
FORM, AND THE EMERALD CRAWLERS WHICH INFEST THE LAND ARE DEADSLY.
THE CENTRE OF CAPRICORNS MALICE IN THIS LAND IS A VAST GRAVEYARD, WITHIN WHICH
THERE IS AN ANCIENT TEMPLE. SOMEWHERE WITHIN LIES THE MEANS TO DEFEAT
CAPRICORN`S MINIONS IN THE FORESTS, IT CAN ONLY BE FOUND...

-------------------------==========================--------------------------

THE MOUNTAIN KINGDOM
--------------------
HIGH ABOVE A YAWNING ABYSS, FRAGILE PATHWAYS WIND THEIR WAY TO THE HEART OF 
THE MOUNTAIN KINGDOM. THERE, IT IS SAID, LIES A GREAT TREASURE. FOR MANY WHO
HAVE WALKED THOSE PATHS BEFORE, THAT TREASURE WAS A PASSPORT TO DEATH. FOR THE
HEROES OF GAUNTLET, IT LEADS TO THE DEFEAT OF CAPRICORN IN THIS PART OF CAPRA.
BUT IT IS A DANGEROUS ROAD. STIRRED BY NECROMANCERS AND THE ACCURSED VELCRONS,
GHOSTS, ZOMBIES AND MUMMIES WILL RISE TO ATTACK. THIS IS A LAND TO BE HURRIED
THROUGH, FOR THOSE WHO STAY FOR BUT A WHILE WILL REMAIN FORVER.

-------------------------==========================--------------------------

THE SWAMP KINGDOM
-----------------
THE SWAMP KINGDOM IS AN INHOSPITABLE REGION ONLY THOSE WHO KNOW ITS ALL
INTRICATE PATHS AND ITS SECRTE WAYS CAN HOPE TO SURVIVE LONG, FOR ITS MARSHES
ARE DEADLY, AND INHABITED BY FOUL, PESTILENCE-INFECTED CREATURES. WORMS,
EMERALD CRAWLERS, PLAGUE DOGS AND OTHERS PREY ON THOSE WHO STRAY FROM THE
ISLANDS.
DEEP WITHIN THE SWAMP IS A PALACE, WHERIN THE PEOPLE OF THIS DARK PLACE HAVE
STORED THEIR GREATEST TREASURES.AMONG THEM, IT IS SAID, IS THE THIRD PART OF
THE KEY TO CAPRICORNS DEFEAT. HOWEVER, THERE IS ALSO MUCH DANGER HERE, 
PARTICULARLY WHERE DEATH STALKS THE CORRIDORS.

-------------------------==========================--------------------------

THE VOLCANIC KINGDOM
--------------------
OF ALL THE TERRORS UNLEASHED UPON CAPRA, THE GREATEST OF THEM ALL ARE THE FIRE
DRAGONS. IN THIS LAND ABOVE ALL THEY HAVE MADE THEIR HOME, AND BAR THE WAY TO
SUCCESS.
THE VOLCANIC KINGDOM IS A VIOLENT PLACE, WHERE THE MAGMA FROM THE WORLDS CORE
ERUPTS ONTO THE FACE OF THE PLANET, KILLING EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES. THE LIZARD
MEN WHO DWELL HERE MADE THEIR LIVING BY HUNTING FOR PRECIOUS STONES AMONG THE
COLLING MAGMA, AND THE RICHES ARE THERE FOR THE TAKING. BUT THE FIRE DRAGONS
COVET THE TREASURES OF THE VOLCANIC KINGDOM FOR THEMSELVES, AND WILL NOT BE
EASILY PARTED FROM IT.

-------------------------==========================--------------------------

THE SEA KINGDOM
---------------
THIS KINGDOMS TREACHEROUS COASTS AND SAND-BARS HAVE BROUGHT MANY SHIPS TO
GRIEF. WRECKS DOMINATE THE LANDSCAPE. EQUALLY TRAGIC IS THE SIGHT OF THE GREAT
RUINED CITY OF THE MERMEN, WHO RULED THE SEAS ABOUT CAPRA DURING THE AGE OF
WARS, BUT SUFFERED GREATLY AT THE HANDS OF THE VELCRONS.
THROUGH-UT THE REALM, THE INFLUENCE OF CAPRICORNS MINIONS CAN BE FELT. BENEATH
THE SAND LURKS THE MUTATED SEA WEED KNOWN AS QUICKVINE. JELLYFISH STALK ALONG
THE BEACHES, AND THE SHARK MEN, THE MOST DEADLY OF ALL THE CREATURES OF THE
DEEP, HAVE BROUGHT HAVOC TO THE LAND.

-------------------------==========================--------------------------

THE LOST CITY
-------------
THE LOST CITY STANDS ABANDONED AND SHUNNED BY ALL. ONLY FOOL HARDY TREASURE-
SEEKERS HAVE DARED ENTER, AND FEW OF THEM RETURNED.
THOSE THAT DID SPOKE OF ITS GUARDIAN STATUES, THE MANY TRAPS AND SNARES FOR 
THE UNWARY, AND ITS NEW CITIZENS - ROCK VINES, SORCERERS. PLAGUE DOGS AND
THE MUMMIES.
ONCE THIS CITY WAS A SHINGING JEWEL, AND ITS MEN OF SCIENCE AND LEARNING
RULED SUPREME. THAT IS WHY IT WAS DESTROYED. SURELY THE LOST CITY WILL PROVIDE
SOME PART OF WHAT IS NEEDED FOR THE FINAL VICTORY.

-------------------------==========================--------------------------

THE ICE KINGDOM
---------------
THE BLEAK STEPPES AND SNOW FIELDS OF THE ICE KINGDOM ARE TREACHEROUS AND
DEADLY. THE INHABITANTS OF THESE WASTELANDS ARE EQUALLY HARMFUL. EMERALD
CRAWLERS SCUTTLE FROM ROCK TO ROCK, LOOKING FOR FOOD. AND FIERCE DRAGONS USE
THEIR POWERFUL FREEZING BREATH TO TRAP FOOD. GREAT SORCERERS LIVE HERE TOO,
SEEKING THE ISOLATION THEY NEED TO PREPARE THEIR GRIM NECROMANCIES AND
WIZARDRY.
THE CONDITIONS ARE ALWAYS COLD AND DIFFICULT, BUT THE HAZARDS OF SNOW, ICE AND
SUDDEN ICE-SLIDES CAN MAKE EVEN SIMPLE TRAVEL A NIGHTMARE. WHATEVER CLUE TO
THE DEFEAT OF CAPRICORN LIES HERE WILL BE DEARLY EARNED.

-------------------------==========================--------------------------

THE MAGIC KINGDOM
-----------------
THE KINGDOM OF MAGNUS, THE WIZARD ETERNAL, IS STRANGE INDEED. ITS PEOPLE LIVE
IN GINGERBREAD COTTAGES, AND YELLOW BRICK ROADS LEAD TO AN ENDLESS GALLERY OF
ENTERTAINMENTS. FINALLY, HE BUILT A FANTASTIC CASTLE, BOTH AS MONUMENT TO THE
PEACE, AND AS HIS HOME.
THERE HE PLACED THE GREAT BAR TO THE DARK DIMENSIONS, AND SEALED IT WITH A
BRONZE KEY AND A PROMISE. SHOULD THERE EVER BE A WAR ON CAPRA AGAIN, THE BAR
WOULD BE REMOVED, AND ALL THE EVIL BEYOND WOULD SPILL OUT TO CONSUME CAPRA.
SOMEHOW THIS DREADFUL FATE HAS COME TO PASS, AND CAPRICORN NOW SITS UPON
MAGNUS`S THRONE, PROTECTED BY SORCERERS, ZOMBIES, WORMS, SHARKMEN AND OTHER
EVILS, THE FINAL QUEST ENDS HERE, IN EITHER GLORIOUS SUCCESS OR SHATTERING
DEFEAT....

-------------------------==========================--------------------------
                                  THE MONSTERS

GHOSTS
------
WHEREVER THE GAUNTLET ADVENTURERS ROAM, THEY WILL FIND THE HAUNTS OF THE
UNDEAD. GHOSTS WILL RISE FROM THEIR GRAVES SEEKING VENGEANCE ON ANYTHING THAT
STILL LIVES!. EVEN THOUGH THEY DISAPPEAR AFTER DRAINING ENERGY FROM THEIR
VICTIMS, GHOSTA ARE BEST AVOIDED, OR SHOT FROM A DISTANCE.

POLTERGEISTS
------------
MINOR SPIRITS HAVE BEEN ANIMATED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD OF DECAY.
POLTERGEISTS HAVE MANY WAYS OF ATTACKING THE LIVING, BUT IT IS PART OF THEIR
WICKED SENSE OF HUMOUR THAT THEY ENOY INHABITING LARGE BOOTS, AND DRIVING
THEM TO KICK OUT AT THEIR VICTIMS...

EMERALD CRAWLERS
----------------
THESE BEASTS ONCE LIVED IN THE FORESTS OF THE TREE KINGDOM. NOW THEY HUNGER 
FOR FLESH, AND CAN BE FOUND IN MANY OTHER PLACES AS WELL. THE SMALLER ONES ARE 
BAD ENOUGH, HAVING A DANGEROUS BITE. THE LARGER ONES, ON THE OTHER HAND, WALK
VIRTUALLY UPRIGHT, AND HAVE BEEN GIVEN ARMOUR AND WEAPONS BY THE VELCRONS. 
THEY ARE SLIGHTLY MORE INTELLIGENT, AND HAVE PROVED THEIR COURAGE IN BATTLE.
ONLY ONE THING STILL SHOWS THEIR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH SMALLER CRAWLERS -
THEIR POWERFUL MANDIBLES, WITH WHICH THEY STRIP THROUGH THE ARMOUR OF FALLEN
OPPONENTS, TO FEAST ON THE FLESH BENEATH.

SORCERERS
---------
LEGIONS OF SORCERES HAVE DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO SERVE THE LORD OF DECAY, AND
THEY HAVE BROUGHT MUCH MISERY TO CAPRAS INNOCENT PEOPLES. THEIR FIRE SPELLS 
ARE DEADLY, EVEN TO A WELL ARMOURED OPPONENT.
APPRENTICE SORCERERS WEAR A HOODED COWL, AND LEARN THE ART OF WALKING THROUGH
WALLS. ONCE THEY HAVE MASTERED THIS ART, THEY BECOME MAGES, AND WEAR A POINTED
HAT IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR RANK. SORCERER MAGES CAN TELEPORT SEEMING TO 
APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR AT WILL, FIRING PLASMA BOLTS AND THEN VANISHING AGAIN.
WHEN THEY ATTACK EN MASSE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO BE SURE HOW MANY THERE ARE, 
AS THEY SHIFT FROM FROM PLACE TO PLACE FASTER THAN A MAN CAN BLINK.

KILLER PLANTS
-------------
THROUGH-OUT CAPRA, THERE ARE HUGE PLANTS WHICH FEED ON UNWARY TRAVELLERS. THE
GAUNTLET HEROES ARE HIGH ON THEIR LIST OF FAVOURITE FOODS!. THE VENUS MAN TRAP
WAITS FOR ITS VICTIM TO COME CLOSE ENOUGH, THEN STRIKES WITH GREAT SPEED.
SEVERAL TYPES OF DEADLY VINES CAN ACTUALLY MOVE ACROSS - OR THROUGH THE GROUND
AND COIL AROUND THEIR PREY. QUICKVINE ACTUALLY KILLS ITS VICTIMS BY PULLING
THEM UNDER THE SAND OF THE SEA KINGDOM AND DROWNS THEM THERE. ICE VINES, ON
THE OTHER HAND, STRIKE BY SUDDENLY THRUSTING ICEICLE LIKE FRONDS THROUGH THE
GROUND WHEN THEY SENSE THE WARM PRESENCE OF PREY. OTHER TYPES OF VINE ARE
EQUALLY DEADLY...

ZOMBIES AND MUMMIES
-------------------
CAPRICORN HAS AWAKENED MANY RE-ANIMATED BODIES TO PLAGUE CAPRA. ZOMBIES ARE
PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SINCE THEY FEEL NO PAIN, AND HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY
DESTROYED BEFORE THEY ARE DEFEATED. EVEN MORE GRISLY ARE THOSE WHO NEVER RISE
FROM THE GROUND, BUT WHO REACH UP WITH CLAWING HANDS, TRYING TO DRAG THE 
LIVING INTO A GRAVE...THERE ARE MANY ZOMBIES IN THE MOUNTAIN AND SWAMP
KINGDOMS, AND IN MAGIC KINGDOM, CLOSE TO THE SOURCE OF CAPRICORNS POWER.

IN THE MOUNTAIN KINGDOM, CAPRICORN HAS ALSO RAISED THE MOST VILLAINOUS
CRIMINALS OF BYGONE AGES, WHO RETURN TO THIS DIMENSION FILLED WITH DEEP HATRED
FOR ALL LIVING THINGS. THE TOUCH OF DEATH REMAINS ON ALL MUMMIES AND THEIR
TALONS CAUSE TERRIBLE WOUNDS.

MUD MONSTERS
------------
FOUL CREATURES HAVE RISEN UP FROM THE EARTH OF CAPRA, MADE OF SNOW OR MUD, 
WHAT MOTIVATES SUCH BEINGS, WHAT DRIVES THEM TO ATTACK CREATURES OF NORMAL
FLESH AND BLOOD NO-ONE KNOWS. NOTHING DISSUADED THEM FROM THEIR PURPOSE, AND
THEY CAN TAKE TREMENDOUS PUNISHMENT BEFORE THEY FINALLY CRUMBLE.
THEY ATTACK IN A BIZARRE FASHION BY FIRING SMALL, LIVING PARTS OF THEMSELVES,
WHICH ATTACK THE VICTIM AND FEED ON HIS FLESH UNTIL THEY ARE GORGED, AND
RETURN TO THE HOST BODY.

DRAGONS
-------
WHEN THE FIRST HUMANS CAME TO CAPRA, THE DRAGONS WERE HUNTED TO NEAR
EXTINCTION. ONLY TWO TYPES REMAIN. FIERY DRAGONS LIVE AMIDST THE FIRE AND 
MAGMA OF THE VOLCANIC KINGDOM, AND THEIR FIERY BREATH CAN TURN A HERO INTO 
ASHES IN SECONDS. THE ICE DRAGONS DWELL IN THE REMOTEST PARTS OF THE
KINGDOM OF ICE, AND THEIR BREATH IS SO COLD IT TURNS FLESH AND BLOOD INTO
FRAGILE CRYSTAL. IN THE EARLIER GAUNTLET QUESTS, DRAGONS WERE OFTEN FOUND
BLOCKING VITAL PASSAGES, THEIR AWESOME POWER CAPABLE OF SLAYING THE GREATEST
HERO IN A SINGLE MOMENT.NOW, IN THE OPEN AIR, THEY ARE EVEN MORE FEARSOME. WHO
CAN STAND AGAINST SUCH BEASTS.

WORMS
-----
SPAWNED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE WORLD, WORMS ARE HIDEOUS CREATURES WITH A 
RAVENOUS APPETITE. WORMS RELISH THE PROSPECT OF A COMPLETE SNACK ON TWO LEGS,
AND MANY MEN HAVE TURNED TO JELLY WHEN FACED WITH SUCH A GRIM DEATH.
AND, IF THE ORDINARY WORM EVOKES SUCH FEAR, IMAGINE THE TERRIFYING ASPECT OF
THE SEMI LIQUID LAVA WORM, AS MUCH MAGMA AS FLESH, THEIR HOT CLUTCHES ARE
SOMETHING NO SANE MAN WOULD EVER WISH TO FALL INTO.

BARBARIANS
----------
ARMED WITH CRUDE SPEARS, THESE POOR WRETCHES HAVE BEEN POSSESSED BY CAPRICORN.
NOTHING HUMAN REMAINS WITHIN THEM, AND THEY FIGHT LIKE AUTOMATONS, CAPABLE
ONLY OF KILLING OR BEING KILLED.

CRABS
-----
THE GIANT CRAB HAS BEEN GIVEN A NEW LEASE OF LIFE BY THE POLLUTION CAPRICORN
HAS UNLEASHED INTO THE SEAS AROUND CAPRA. BOLDER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE, THEY
HAVE BEEN SIGHTED FURTHER AND FURTHER INSHORE, SCUTTLING IN TO ATTACK WITH
THEIR DEADLY CLAWS.

JELLYFISH
---------
ANOTHER SEA CREATURE WHICH HAS BECOME MORE DANGEROUS SINCE THE ADVENT OF
CAPRICORN IS THE JELLYFISH, ITS DEADLY STING HAS ALWAYS BEEN FEARED - IT CAN
PIERCE EVEN THE TOUGHEST ARMOUR. HOWEVER, JELLYFISH HAVE NEVER EXISTED IN SUCH
NUMBERS BEFORE NOW, AND HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HATEFUL TOWARDS MANKIND.

PLAGUE DOGS
-----------
THESE ARE HUGE MASTIFFS. WITH MATTED PATCHY GREEN FUR, AND THEY CARRY A HOST 
OF VILE CONTAGIONS. IMMUNE TO ALL DISEASE THEMSELVES, THEY ARE STILL VICTIM TO
A PARTICULAR MADNESS, AND BECOME FRENZIED WITH BLOODLUST WHEN THEY ATTACK.

PIXIES
------
PIXIES HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED TAUNTING THE INHABITANTS OF THE EIGHT KINGDOMS
BEING KEENLY FOND OF TRICKS AND SENSELESS PRANKS. SMALL AND FAST MOVING,
PIXIES ARE HARD TO DEFEAT, THEY AVOID DIRECT COMBAT PREFERRING TO AMBUSH
THEIR VICTIMS. WOE BETIDE THOSE WHO FALL HELPLESS IN THEIR HANDS, FOR THE
PIXIE TAKES  GREATEST DELIGHT IN TORTURING THEIR CAPTIVES BEFORE THEY FIND
RELEASE IN DEATH...

SHARKMEN
--------
SHARKMEN ARE THE CRUELEST, MOST SENSELESS KILLERS IN THE WORLD. THEY FOUGHT
MANY WARS UNTIL THEY WERE FINALLY DEFEATED, AND THE SHARKMEN HAVE NOT 
FORGOTTEN THEIR SHAME OF THAT DEFEAT. CAPRICORN HAS OFFERED THEM THE CHANCE TO
BE GREAT AGAIN. SOME SERVE HIM DIRECTLY IN THE MAGIC KINGDOM, OTHERS HAVE MADE
THEIR WAY TO THE SEA KINGDOM, TO RENEW THEIR STRUGGLE.
THEY KNOW THE ART OF MANY WEAPONS, BUT THE TRUE KILLING PLEASURE FOR A 
SHARKMAN COMES ONLY WHEN HE CAN BRING THOSE ENDLESS ROWS OF RAZOR SHARP TEETH 
INTO ACTION. THE BLOOD KISS OD A SHARKMAN IS SOMETHING FEW SURVIVE.

DEATH
-----
THE VELCRONS ARE A RACE ACCURSED. THEIR MEDDLINGS IN BEST-FORGOTTEN ARCANE
RITUALS HAVE BROUGHT MISERY TO MILLIONS, BUT IN MANY WAYS, THEY THEMSELVES
SUFFERED THE WORST. ONCE THEY WERE TALL WARRIORS, BUT THEIR EXPERIMENTS WITH
DARK MAGIC EXTINGUISHED THEIR STRENGTH.THEN, ONE FINAL MAD EXPERIMENT TAUGHT
THEM HOW TO SUCK THE VERY LIFE FORCE FROM OTHER BEINGS.AND HOW TO TELEPORT TO
THE DARK DIMENSIONS INSTANTLY, TO REST AND FEED ON THAT WHICH THEY HAD STOLEN.
THE VELCRONS ARE CAPRICORNS GREATEST ALLIES. THEY ARE IMMUNE TO ALL PHYSICAL
CHALLENGE. ONLY MAGIC CAN DISOLVE THEM. THEIR TOUCH IS DEATH AND BY THAT NAME
THEY ARE ALSO KNOWN. IT IS ONLY TO BE EXPECTED CAPRICORN WILL HAVE MANY
VELCRONS GUARDING THE MOST PRECIOUS OF HIS POSSESSIONS.

-------------------------==========================--------------------------
                                  THE TREASURES

THOUGH THE FINAL QUEST IS FILLED WITH DANGERS, SOME AID CAN BE FOUND ALONG THE
WAY, CHIEFLY OF COURSE, THE HEROES MUST HAVE FOOD TO SURVIVE, BUT THE PATH TO
VICTORY IS MADE ALL THE EASIER IF THEY CAN FIND THE MAGICAL AIDS WHICH ASSIST
IN PROFUSION ON CAPRA.

CAPRAN MAGIC DEPENDS FOR ITS POTENCY ON DISTILLED ESSENCE FROM THE DARK
DIMENSIONS, PROPERLY CONCOTED THIS ESSENCE LOSES ITS EVIL POWER, AND BECOMES A
TOOL OF A PURER MAGIC.

ALCHEMISTS BREW THE ESSENCE INTO POTIONS, AND THESE GRANT THE POWER TO CAST
GREAT MAGICS.OF COURSE, ONE TRAINED IN THE LORE OF MAGIC WILL MAKE A BETTER 
USEOF THIS POWER THAN ONE UNTRAINED. THE POTION CAN EITHER BE DRUNK, FOR 
MAXIMUM,OR JUST DESTROYED, SO THAT THAT THE DISTILLED ESSENCE ACTS IMMEDIATELY
ON WHATEVER CREATURES ARE WITHIN RANGE.

CAPRICORNS MAD GENIUS HAS FOUND A WAY TO CORRUPT SOME POTIONS, SO THAT THEY
DISABLE ANYONE WHO DRINKS THEM. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE POTIONS WHICH
GRANT GREATER POWERS THAN NORMAL. BY COMBINING ARCANE ESSENCE WITH OTHER
INCREDIENTS. SUCH AS DRAGONS WING,ALCHEMISTS HAVE CREATED POTIONS WHICH
IMPROVE A HEROES FIGHTING POWERS. A POTION CONCOCTED FROM ESSENCE OF EAGLES
FEATHERS FOR EXAMPLE, GRANTS THE USER LIGHTNING FAST SHOT-SPEED. WHILE ANOTHER
DISTILLED FROM THE ESSENCE OF LIONS BLOOD AND TURTLES SHELLS, CAN MAKE EVEN A
WEAK MAN A MIGHTY WARRIOR.

OTHER POTIONS GRANT THE POWER TO MANIPULATE EVEN GREATER SUMS OF MAGICAL
ENERGY, OR TO FIRE MASSIVE MISSILES AT THE FOE...THESE SPECIAL POTIONS GRANT
THEIR POWERS FOR ONLY A LITTLE WHILE, BUT THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT AID IN THE
FIGHT AGAINST CAPRICORN, WHOSE AGENTS WILL SEEK TO DESTROY THEM WHEN THEY CAN.

SOME OTHER POWERFUL MAGICAL DEVICES CAN BE FOUND,ALTHOUGH THE LORE ABOUT THEM
IS NOT WELL KNOWN.ONCE, MAGICAL ITEMS OF GREAT POWER WERE COMMON PLACE, BUT
THEY HAVE DWINDLED OVER THE YEARS. A FEW MAY REMAIN TO BE DISCOVERED DURING 
THEQUEST.THE MOST LIKELY TO BE FOUND ARE AMULETS INSCRIBED WITH POWERFUL RUNES
CARVED WITH STYLUS DIPPED IN ESSENCE. THESE AMULETS HAVE GREAT POWER SUCH
AS INVISIBILTY. HANDLE THEM WITH CARE.

OF COURSE NO GAUNTLET HERO COULD SURVIVE LONG WITHOUT REGULAR MEALS. ENDLESS
CONFLICT WITH THE FORCES OF EVIL WEAR DOWN EVEN THE STRONGEST FRAME, AND THEN
ONLY A FLASK OF CIDER OR A HUNK OF MEAT CAN REVIVE THE MIGHTY. CAPRAS WEALTH
ENSURES THERE IS ALWAYS PLENTY OF FOOD TO REVITALISE THE HEROES.HOWEVER, IT 
CANVERY EASILY BE DESTROYED IN A FIGHT.ALSO, CAPRICORN HAS ALSO ADDED A NEW 
ANDSINISTER WEAPON TO THE ARMOURY OF THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE HEROES...
SOME OF THE MOST ENTICING MEALS HAVE BEEN POISONED..

FINALLY ONE THING GUARANTEED TO GENERATE INTEREST IS THE SIGHT OF A TREASURE
CHEST. AS THEY HAVE LOOTED CAPRA, MUCH OF THIS TREASURE HAS FOUND ITS WAY INTO
THE HANDS OF THE MONSTERS. IT IS SOLEMN DUTY OF ALL HEROES TO LIBERATE AS MUCH
AS THEY CAN.

MANY CHESTS ARE LEFT WIDE OPEN, AND THEIR WEALTH IS FREE TO TAKE. OTHERS ARE
LOCKED, AND REQUIRE THE SAME KEYS THAT OPEN SO MUCH ELSE ON THE ISLAND. A
LOCKED CHEST CAN CONTAIN, FOOD, POTIONS, TREASURE...AND A GREAT MANYOTHER
THINGS WHICH WILL BE OF VALUE. THEY CAN ALSO CONCEAL CUNNING TRAPS - SO BE
WARNED. THE VELCRONS THEMSELVES TAKE PARTICULAR DELIGHT IN HIDING WITHIN SOME
CHESTS.
