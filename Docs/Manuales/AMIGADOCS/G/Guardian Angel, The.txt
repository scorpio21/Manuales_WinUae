Plunged into the depths of the criminal underworld in downtown Manhattan.
One thug after another assaults you.  Often they gang up in brutal waves!
These evil killers are armed to the teeth with FLICK KNIVES, BASEBALL BATS,
IRON BARS AND EVEN CHAIN SAWS!  Protect the citizens because it's only you
that can stand up to the MURDEROUS SCUM!


PLAYING THE GAME
----------------
Plug your joystick into port 1 if you have an Atari ST; port 2 if you have
an Amiga.  Or use keys:

Left	F6
Right	F7
Up	F8
Down	F9
Fire	F10

Press F1 if you want to redefine these keys.
Press F4 to start game.
During the game press F3 to pause the game then F2 to continue playing.
Press ESC to QUIT the game.

Use left and right to run.
Use up for a high kick.
Use down for a low kick.
Use fire for a punch.

Punch the sailors.  Low kick the rats.  High kick everything else.

Hint:  Learn how many kicks it takes to kill each enemy.  Then hold up
while you count the kicks.  Then press left/right to turn around to get an
enemy on the other side just as you begin the final kick at the first
enemy.  You will be able to make a very quick turn.
