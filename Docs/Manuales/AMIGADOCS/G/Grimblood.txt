STARTING OFF
The start screen greets you once grimblood has loaded;it allows a new
game to be started, or a game position to be saved or loaded.
Clicking on start initiates a new game,and passes control to the main
castle screen.

To save a game,insert a blank formatted disc in the drive before clicking
on save.  Each saved game requires its own disc: the filename is
identical for all saved games-so take care when labelling discs.

To load a saved game ,put the appropriate disc into the drive and click
load; once a game has loaded;control is passed to the main castle screen.

If you come to this screen from the middle of a game, perhaps to save the
current game position, game time is suspended while you remain here.
Clicking start returns you to the game in play.

A FEW HINTS ON PLAY
The murderer will continue killing people until everyone is dead or your
detective work puts an end to the reign of terror.  The occupants of the
castle bustle about, moving objects and weapons around the place
according to pre-determined ritual patterns.  In order to kill again, the
murderer has to find an unattended weapon.  Once a weapon has been
secured,the murderer picks a victim and starts moving through the castle.
When the murderer finds the murderee alone in a room-then another crime
is comitted.  A number of variables affect how often the murderer can
kill-for instance,its possible to delay the next murder by following the
murderer around the castle.  On the other hand,game time can be speeded
up if you dont want to wait too long for the next death.

THE INTERROGATION SCREEN.
Game time pauses while you use this control screen to talk to the people
you meet,ask questions and give orders.  The people in the same room as

click on a tombstone to recap on a murder that has already taken place.
