GETTING STARTED
     DO NOT write-protect your GBA Championship  Basketball:  Two-
on-Two disk.

     You   must   use  a  joystick  to   play   GBA   Championship
Basketball:  Two-on-Two.   For a one-player game,  plug a joystick
into  port 2 on your computer;  you may leave your  mouse  plugged
into port 1.   For a two-player game,  plugh another joystick into
port 1.

     To  bypass the introductory music and credit  screens,  press
your joystick button while the game loads.

SELECTING OPTIONS AND DRAFTING PLAYERS
     Moving the joystic will will highlight the various options on
the screen when you're making selections from the chalkboard menus
and player draft pool.

PRACTICE OPTIONS
     GBA  Championship  Basketball:  Two-on-Two keeps  score  when
you're playing in either of the two practice modes.

THE SCOUTING REPORT
     When  you're  rating your abilities on  The  Scouting  Report
screen, the ratings categories are grouped as follows:

          INSIDE         OUTSIDE
          DRIBBLING      QUICKNESS
          STEALING       JUMPING

     You also select the RACE of your player.

UNIFORM COLORS
     Player One and his teamate are always in blue; Player Two and
his teammate are always in red.

THE PLAYCALLING SCREEN
     On  the PLAYCALLING SCREEN,  the home team is always  on  the
left and the visiting team on the right.

TO PLAY ANOTHER GAME
     When a game ends, press your joystick button to return to the
chalkboard menus.

KING OF THE COURT
     Basketball.   The  lightning-paced sport for  super-athletes.
The  game  of strategy,  guts,  stamina,  and -- most  of  all  --
teamwork.

     It's all here, in GBA Championship Basketball: Two-on-Two.

     Two-on-Two  helps  you develop the strategies and  skills  to
make you play like a pro.   You can play with a teammate and  lear
teamwork.   You  can  pick your offensive  allignment  while  your
opponent sets his defense.   And when your opponent has the  ball,
you can choose among several defensive strategies.

     Two-on-Two  gives  you lots of ways to  compete:  one  player
against  the computer,  two players against a  computer  tea,  two
players against each other,  practice sessions, and even a 23-team
league competition climaxing in the GBA Championship Game.

     This Player's Guide includes all the information you'll  need
to play Two-on-Two.   The first section,  "Getting Started", tells
you how to load the program into your computer.

     "The Chalkboard Menus" describes all your options for playing
the  game,  from  the two practice modes to the four  game  modes.
This  section also tells you how to use the joystick  and  command
keys.   "The  Scouting Report" shows you how to rate your  playing
skills  from inside and  outside  shooting,  dribbling,  stealing,
quickness,  and jumping.   In addition, you'll get your first look
at your computer opponents -- all the teams you'll have to beat to
make it to the GBA Championship game.

     In "How to Pass and Shoot",  you'll find all the  information
you  need to develop your passing game and become a  team  player.
And  you'll learn all about jump shots,  hook shots,  slam  dunks,
tip-ins, and rebounds.

     "The  Player  Draft"  tells  you  all  about  your  superstar
computer teammates -- 10 players in all,  each one patterned after
a real professional basketball star.

     "Calling   Plays"  describes  the  offensive  and   defensive
strategies you'll need to outsmart and outplay your opponents.

     The  "Penalties" section explains fouls and other  violations
and  describes  how  you can use the clock to  your  advantage  by
calling time-outs.

     "After  the Game" tells you how to read the box  scores  from
the game you just played and how to start a new game.

THE CHALKBOARD MENUS
     Following the introductory music and credit screens,  a green
chalkboard  appears  on  your screen with  two  choices;  GAME  or
PRACTICE.   You make your selection by joystick; the chosen option
will become backlit.

     Once  you  have made the above selection,  a  new  chalkboard
appears,  allowing you to select ONE PLAYER or TWO PLAYER  action.
(If you select the two-player optionm,  joystick number 2  becomes
active when the top of the screen displays PLAYER TWO.

     When  prompted  for your TEAM NAME or  YOUR  NAME,  type  the
letters on the keyboard (use the DELETE key to erase any  mistakes
you make),  then press RETURN.   Names must be at least one letter
and no more than twelve letters.

PRACTICE OPTION
     No  one  wants  to hit the courts  cold.   Just  as  in  real
basketball,  it's a good idea to warm up a little before playing a
game.  Two-on-Two offers you two different practice modes.

ONE PLAYER (one player on the court by himself)
     Make sure that your joystick is plugged into port 1.  You can
practice shooting inside and outside and work on your hook  shots,
jump shots, slam dunks, tip-ins, and rebounds.  Although there's a
scoreboard above the basket,  in the practice mode the  scoreboard
doesn't work.   There are no penalties or time clock either.  When
you  make  a basket or the gol goes out of bounds,   the  ball  is
automatically returned to you.   Press F7 when you want to  return
to the chalkboard menus.

TWO PLAYER (two players on the court)
     Player  Two  should  plug his or her joystick  into  port  2.
Notice that Player One is always in the blue jersey and Player Two
is  in green.   You can practice different shots,  from  hooks  to
dunks,  as weel as dribbling,  rebounding,  and tip-ins.   You can
play  straight one-on-one,  or you can play other "pick-up"  games
like "Around the World" or "Horse".

     How to play "Around the World".  Player one tries a shot from
the baseline -- say,  at the edge of the key (the key is the  area
between  the  inner white line and the  basket.   Every  time  the
player makes a basket,  he or she moves further along the edge  of
the key,  working around the key to the baseline on the other side
of  the basket.   If Player One misses a shot,  Player Two gets  a
turn.   When a player misses a shot,  he must shoot again from the
same spot on his or her next turn,  and stay in that spot until he
or she makes a basket.   The first player to go "Around the World"
wins.

     How to play "Horse".   Player One makes a shot from  anywhere
on the court.   Player Two must then make the same shot or he will
het an "H".   When Player One misses,  Player Two can make a  shot
from wherever he or she wants, and Player One has to make the same
shot.   Every time a player misses,  he gets another letter  until
the  word HORSE is spelled.   Whoever gets all the letters  first,
loses.   (Note:  The letters in HORSE do not appear on the screen.
You must keep track of the "score" yourself).

     As with the ONE PLAYER practice option,  there are no scores,
penalties, or time clock.

     To  leave  the  practice mode and return  to  the  chalkboard
menus, press F7.

THE SCOUTING REPORT
     Once you're warmed up and ready to play ball,  you still have
to  rate  your playing abilities on a screen called  The  Scouting
Report.  It might look like this:

          INSIDE     2        OUTSIDE   6
          DRIBBLING  3        STEALING  5
          QUICKNESS  4        JUMPING   4

     INSIDE refers to your shooting accuracy inside the key.

     OUTSIDE refers to your shooting accuracty outside the key.

     DRIBBLING rates your maneuverability with the ball.

     STEALING rates your ability to outmaneuver the ball handler
     and steal the ball.

     QUICKNESS rates your maneuverability both on defense and when
     you're not handling the ball on offense.

     JUMPING rates your ability to block shots and come down with
     rebounds.

     The highest rating you can give yourself is 6 (very skilled),
and  lowest  is  2 (minimally skilled).   Notice  the  INSIDE  and
OUTSIDE  are grouped together,  as are DRIBBLING and STEALING  and
QUICKNESS and JUMPING.   Within each of these three groupings, the
total always equal 8.

     So  if you choose to rate yourself 3 as an  outside  shooter,
you  must be a 5 inside.   If you choose a 6 rating  at  stealing,
you'll only be a 2 at dribbling.  After all, you can't be great at
everything.   Remember,  too, that in a game situation you'll want
to  select your offensive and defensive strategies  accourding  to
your strengths and weaknesses.

     Use  your  joystick  to  move among  the  categories  on  The
Scouting  Report,  and  press the joystick button  to  change  the
numbers.   As  the number on the left goes up,  the number on  the
right automatically goes down.

     NOTE: In the practice modes, all palyers are given a 4 rating
in all categories.

GAME OPTIONS

TWO PLAYER HEAD-TO-HEAD
     Each player has a computer teammate.   Each player names  his
team, then types in his own name and rates himself.  He also picks
a  computer  teammate from the Player Draft,  which  includes  ten
pros, each one patterned after a real-life basketball superstar.

     Player  One and his teammate are always in blue;  Player  Two
and his teammate are always in green.   On yhr dvtrrn, yhr plsyrtd
you vonytol str trptrdrnyrf in yhr lighter uniforms;  the  players
the computer controls are in darker uniforms.  For example, if you
are Player One,  you'll wear a light blue jersey and your computer
teammate will wear dark blue.

TWO PLAYER TEAMMATES
     When you select this option, you and a friend team up against
a hard-driving computer team.  You first type in a TEAM NAME of 12
letters or less,  then pick a DIVISION to play in.   The  division
you  choose  determines the caliber of  your  computer  opponents.
NORTH is the easiest division,  SOUTH is tougher,  EAST is tougher
still, and WEST is the toughest of all.

     Take  a look at your COMPUTER OPPONENTS CHART  (coming  along
shortly).   It  gives  you a breakdown of all the teams  in  every
division.   Notice that the rating tools are higher in the tougher
divisions.  For example, in the easy North, the INSIDE and OUTSIDE
ratings total 7;  but in the tough West, they total 10.  Since the
players  in  the  West are better,  the  West  teams  have  higher
ratings.

     When  Player One types in his name (12 letters or  less)  and
presses RETURN,  the Player One Scouting Report allows Player  One
to  rate  his abilities.   Then Player Two types in his  name  and
rates  himself.   In  this mode,  Player One has  the  light  blue
jersey, Player Two the dark blue jersey.

ONE PLAYER EXHIBITION GAME
     You   and  your  computer-controlled  teammate  challenge   a
computer  team.   Type in your TEAM NAME and YOUR NAME and pick  a
DIVISION.   Again,  the  division you select determines how  tough
your opponents will be.  Next, rate yourself on inside and outside
shooting, dribbling, stealing, quickness, and jumping.

     Finally,  you  select your computer-controlled teammate  from
the Player Draft.  Do you want the great outside shooting of Larry
Berg  or the dynamite inside moves of Kareem Ugrin?   Strategy  is
important,  because  you'll  want  a  player  whose  talents  will
complement your own,  someone who's going to be effective  against
your opponents.   (Again,  use the chart "Your Computer Opponents"
to scope out your opponents' strengths and weaknesses).

     Your team will always be the HOME team,  with the player  you
control in the light blue uniform.

ONE PLAYER LEAGUE PLAY
     This game mode allows you and a computer teammate to play  in
league  competition  that  can take you all the  way  to  the  GBA
Championship.

     You first choose a division to play in (NORTH,  SOUTH,  EAST,
or  WEST),  then  play a five-game season against the  other  five
teams in that division.

     Once  you've selected League Play,  the computer screen  will
ask if you want to GET TEAM or assemble a NEW TEAM.  If you select
GET  TEAM,  you'll  continue to play with a  team  you're  already
created -- tha is, your current team.  Select NEW TEAM to create a
new  team;  your old team (if you had one) and its  league  record
will be erased from the game disk.   In other words,  you can have
only  one team at a time.   (If you try to create a new  team  and
there's  already a team on the disk,  the screen will display  the
message  "WARNING:  SELECTING  NEW TEAM WILL  ERASE  YOUR  CURRENT
TEAM.")  However,  you can go from League Play to Exhibition  Play
without erasing your League Team from the game disk.

     You'll play a five-game schedule.   The computer will  select
your opponents within your chosen division until you've played all
five.   Playing in the easier division will of course mean  easier
games -- until you get to the playoffs.  At the end of the season,
the computer will compare your win/loss record with the records of
the other teams in your division.  If you have the best divisional
record,  or  if you're tied for the division lead and have  beaten
your  co-leader,  you'll  advance to the  playoffs.   The  playoff
schedule is set up so that the easiest division (NORTH) plays  the
hardest  divison (WEST) in Game 1;  in Game 2,  SOUTH meets  EAST.
The  winners  from  Game  1  and Game  2  then  meet  in  the  GBA
Championship Game.

HOW TO PASS AND SHOOT
     Naturally,  good  teamwork  means getting the  ball  to  your
teammate  when he's in the open.   And to do that,  you've got  to
become a good passer.

     To  pass  to your teammate when you have  the  ball,  quickly
press  and  immediately  release the  joystick  button.   If  your
teammate  has the ball and you want him to pass  to  you,  quickly
press the button.   Your teammate will usually pass you the  ball,
but not always -- after all,  any player can become a ball hog now
and then.   Your teammate may also pass the ball to you if he sees
that you're open,  even if you don't press the joystick button  --
unless you're moving, in which case he'll never pass to you unless
you  press  the joystick button.   If you pass  to  your  computer
teammate while he's moving, he'll stop to try to catch the ball.

     In order to catch the ball you must be directly in line  with
it.   Otherwise  the ball will go out of bounds or will be  stolen
by your opponents.

SHOOTING

SHOOTING BASICS
     When  you have the ball and want to make a shot,  first  hold
down  the  joystick button.   Your player will begin his  shot  by
jumping and will release the ball at the same time you release the
button.   You must time the release to the jump.   If you  release
the  ball  at the top of the jump,  you have a  better  chance  of
scoring.

     So  your  success  in shooting depends  on  your  ability  to
release the joystick button at just the right moment.  If you look
very closely,  you'll notice that at the very top of his jump your
player will cock his wrist slightly, preparing to shoot.  It is at
this  moment that you should release the button.   If you  release
the button too early or too late, you will still make some of your
shots,  but  a smaller percentage than if you time  it  perfectly.
You  should also be aware that if you fail to release  the  button
before your player comes back to the floor, you'll be charged with
traveling  (See "Penalties").   In addition to  your  timing,  the
other factor that will determine your shooting percentage is  your
Player  Scoring Report -- that is,  your rating as an  inside  and
outside shooter.

HOOK SHOTS
     To  make  a  hook shot,  you  must  be  downcourt,  near  the
baseline, with your back to the basket (as you look at your player
on the screen,  he must be facing 9 o'clock or 3 o'clock).  With a
hook shot,  the ball is released as the player's arm "hooks"  over
his head.  The advantage of this type of shot is that is cannot be
blocked.

SLAM DUNKS
     A  slam ducnk may be the most satisfying shot in  basketball.
What  could be better than actually stuffing the ball through  the
hoop?  To slam dunk, you must have a 4, 5, or 6 rating as a inside
shooter.  You must be at the baseline, as far downcourt as you can
go,  and you must shoot when you're in one of three  areas:  under
the  basket,  half a step left or low post left (LPL),  or half  a
step right of low post right (LPR) (See "Zones on the Court" chart
that will follow shortly).   Finally,  there must be NO  DEFENDERS
under the basket.  If all of these conditions are met, a slam dunk
will always be successful.

TIP-INS
     If an offensive player grabs a rebound while directly  facing
the  basket (as you look at him on the screen,  facing 12  o'clock
with  his back to you),  he'll tip the ball in for a  basket.   As
long  as the player is facing the basket and  underneath  it,  the
tip-in  will be automatic if you make your  player  jump.   Again,
only  an offensive player can tip the ball in.   (In the  practice
mode, either player can tip the ball in).

REBOUNDS
     A  player can rebound only when he's in the area  immediately
surrounding the basket.   To rebound, press the joystick button in
the  same way you do to make a shot -- your player will  jump  for
the ball.  Timing your jump is the key to successful rebounding.

SHOOTING PERCENTAGES
     Nobody can make every kind of shot every time.   But you  can
increase your shooting percentage by working on the timing of your
release.   (Of course,  it also helps to have a high rating).  The
following  charts show the percentage of outside and inside  shots
you'll  make based on the timing of your release and your  outside
shooting ability.

OUTSIDE SHOOTING PERCENTAGES

Outside Rating:          6       5      4      3      2

When release is:

very early...............10%     10     10     10     10

early....................30%     20     10     10     10

a little early...........50%     40     30     20     10

perfect..................70%     60     50     40     30

a little late............60%     50     40     30     20

late.....................40%     30     20     10     10

very late................20%     10     10     10     10

INSIDE SHOOTING PERCENTAGES

Inside rating:           6       5      4      3      2

very early...............30%     20     10     10     10

a little early...........70%     60     50     40     30

perfect..................90%     80     70     60     50

a little late............80%     70     60     50     40

late.....................60%     50     40     30     20

very late................40%     30     20     10     10


3-POINT SHOTS
     If  a player shoots a basket from outside the  white  3-point
line  (See court illustration to follow shortly),  that basket  is
good  for  3 points instead of the usual  2.   Successful  3-point
shots  are  based on a player's outside shooting  rating  and  the
timing of his release.   However,  if a player shoots from outside
the  white 3-point line,  the odds of that shot's being  good  are
only half the odds of a regular outside shot.   For example,  if a
6-rated  outside shooter releases the ball perfectly  from  beyond
the 3-point line, he has only a 35% chance of making that shot.

SHOOTING FROM UNDER THE BASKET
     Whenever a player shoots from directly under the basket,  his
chance of scoring is based only on his inside rating,  not on  his
timing.   As  long as he releases the ball before he's called  for
traveling, it's assumed that his timing is perfect.

NOTES ON DEFENSE: STEALING THE BALL AND BLOCKING SHOTS
     To  steal  the ball from the offense,  you  must  "bump"  the
ballhandler  on  the side on which he's dribbling or  holding  the
ball.   Any player's success at stealing the ball will be based on
his  rating  at STEALING (See "The  Scouting  Report",  previously
shown).

     To block a shot,  move in close to the ball handler and press
your joystick button to jump just as he goes up for a shot.   Your
success  in blocking the shot will depend on how close you are  to
the  ballhandler  and your rating at JUMPING --  (Also  see,  "The
Scouting Report" previously shown).

YOUR COMPUTER TEAMMATE
     Your  computer teammate is an intelligent  player.   If  he's
under the basket,  he'll shoot.  If he sees that you're open under
the basket,  he'll pass the ball to you.  If the clock is about to
run  out (either the 24-second shot clock or the  quarter  clock),
he'll  shoot  if he has the ball.   If he's being covered  and  he
realizes  he can't drive to the basket,  he'll pull up  and  shoot
from as close as he can get.

     Remember, just as in real basketball, the key element in Two-
on-Two  is teamwork.   Your computer teammate is designed to  work
with you to beat your opponents.  No matter how good you are as an
individual  player,  you'll never make it to the GBA  Championship
unless you learn to play as a team.

THE PLAYER DRAFT
     After  you've  rated  your abilities,  you  get  to  draft  a
computer-controlled teammate.  In the two-player mode, each player
gets  to draft a computer teammate unless you're playing  the  TWO
PLAYER  TEAMMATES  option.   You have ten players  from  which  to
choose, each patterned after a real basketball superstar.

     When the player draft screen appears, you'll see ten names in
white letters,  with the two "pointer" basketballs on either  side
of a name.   Use your joystick to line up the basketballs next  to
the  name of the player you want,  then release the  joystick  and
press  the joystick button.   This will highlight your  choice  in
yellow.   Finally,  move  the balls down to the word CONTINUE  and
press the joystick button to go to the next screen.

YOUR SUPERSTAR TEAMATES
     Here are the computer stars you can play with:

     Magic Lyndon.   One of the best players in the  game,  famous
for his sleight-of-hand passing.   Now you see it,  now you don't.
Magic  provides that extra magic that can take you all the way  to
the GBA Championship.

     Jerry Orr.  A consistently high scorer, Orr has been known to
score  over 50 points in a game.   He know how to draw fouls  from
opponents and almost never misses from the free throw line.

     Elgin Cutter.   Some say he's the best pressure player in the
game.  He once scored 61 points in a GBA playoff game -- a record.
Cutter has some dealy inside moves.

     Joh Madland.   An excellent defensive player.  When Madland's
on the court,  expect lots of turnovers.   Also a dynamite outside
shooter.

     Larry Berg.  If you want a teammate who can do it all, Berg's
your man.   A real team player who knows how to win.   Great  all-
around abilities.   Berg can shoot and pass with either hand.   He
received the GBA Most Valuable Player Award two years in a row.

     Walt  Barnett.   A  superb  rebounder and  one  of  the  best
defensive players around.

     Julius Keith.   Dr. K. When he's not selling basketball shoes
or soft drinks on TV,  Keith can be found driving defenders  crazy
on the court.   He averages over 30 points a game and has some  of
the best moves in the game.

     Oscar Dunbar.   A player with all the right moves,  Dunbar is
considered  the  best guard of all time.   A great player  at  any
position, he's equally adept at inside and outside shooting.

     Wilt Dulmage.   a.k.a.  Wilt the Tilt.   This man is great at
blocking shots and coming down with the ball.  Also one of the few
unstopable inside shooters.

     The  Super Teammate Player Draft chart rates the  talents  of
your  computer teammates.   The numbers indicate their  skills  at
inside and outside shooting,  dribbling,  stealing, quickness, and
jumping.   Unlike  the  ratings for  yourself,  these  are  fixed.
Because all these stars are excellent players,  they rate no lower
than 4.  A 6 is the highest rating a player can have.

     Notice  that  the  total within  each  grouping  (Inside  and
Outside, Dribbling and Stealing, and Quickness and Jumping) totals
10  for your superstar teammate,  as opposed to 8 for  your  other
player.

CALLING PLAYS
     In all the game modes except two-player teammates,  you  must
choose  an offensive and defensive alighment every time you're  on
offense  or defense.   The PLYACALLING SCREEN comes up  when  ever
there's  a  change  of possession  because  of  a  basket,  steal,
defensive rebound, or penalty.

     Although the game is actually played on a full court, you see
only  half the court at a time.   Every time there's a  change  of
possession or a basket is good, the players run down the court and
the offensive brings the ball up from mid-court.

     The  playcalling  screen replaces the  scoreboard  for  about
seven  seconds while the players automatically run down the  court
and  bring  the  ball back  into  play.   The  playcalling  screen
disappears when the ball handler crosses the center court.  So you
have  seven  seconds to select a play.   If you fail to  select  a
play,  the  computer  will automatically pick one  for  you.   (On
defense  the computer will pick LOW ZONE (LZN) and on  offense  it
will pick BASKET (BKT).

     As you can see in the screen below (Well, you can't because I
can't  put  a  picture into the  middle  of  this  document),  the
playcalling screen is divided into OFFENSE on the left and DEFENSE
on  the  right.   For offense the screen shows a picture  of  your
joystick surrounded by the abreviations BKT,  RHT,  TOP,  LFT, and
SCRN,  which  stand  for the five offensive plays you  can  choose
from.   For  defense the screen shows a picture of  your  joystick
surrounded by the abbreviations LZN,  HZN,  MMD,  and  MML,  which
stand for the four defensive alignments you can choose from.

     You  select  a play by moving your  joystick  forward,  back,
right, or left to "point to" the play you want: forward for BKT or
LZN,  back for TOP or HZN,  right for RHT or MMD, and left for LFT
or  MML.   On offense you can also use the joystick button if  you
want to select the SCRN play.

     When you're going to be on offense,  the word OFFENSE on  the
playcalling screen will be in green; once you select your offense,
the  word  will turn blue.   On defense the wordDEFENSE  is  first
highlighted  in yellow;  once you select your  defense,  it  turns
blue.  Note that these colors have nothing to do with the player's
blue  and  green  jerseys or the  teams  themselves;  they  merely
indicate when a play has been selected.

     If  you've  called a play,  but change your  mind  while  the
playcalling screen is still visible,  simply push the joystick  in
the direction of the new play you want.  Whenever you call a play,
you'll  hear a tone at the same time the word OFFENSE  or  DEFENSE
turns blue.

     Whanever you call a play,  whether on offense or defense, you
are telling your computer teammate what to do.

     Following is a complete rundown of the plays.   It will  help
you  to  understand  the plays if you also  study  "Zones  on  the
Court".

     +----------------------------------------------------------+

OFFENSIVE PLAYS
     You have five offensive plays from which to choose:

         Left Wing      LFT
         Right Wing     RHT
         Top of Key     TOP
         Basket         BKT
         Screen         SCRN

     LEFT WING (LFT).  Your teammate runs to the high post left or
high post right (HPL or HPR) and stays there for one second.  Then
he  runs  to  the left wing (LFT),  stays there for  two  to  four
seconds, and runs a random pattern on the left side of the court.

     RIGHT  WING (RHT).   Your teammate begins by running  to  the
high post left or high post right (HPL or HPR) and waits there for
one second.   Then he runs to the right wing (RHT) and waits there
for  two  to four seconds before running a random pattern  on  the
right side of the court.

     TOP.   Your  teammate runs to either the right or  left  high
post (HPR or HPL),  waits there for a second, and then runs to the
top.   He  stays  there for two to four seconds and  then  runs  a
random pattern at the top of the key.

     SCREEN  (SCRN).   You use your teammate as a screen to  block
out any defenders trying to cover you.   Your teammate runs to HPL
or  HPR and stays there for six seconds,  allowing you to  dribble
around  him as he blocks the defender.   Then he runs  a  two-step
pattern between the high posts.

     BASKET  (BKT).   Your teammate runs to the high post left  or
right (HPL or HPR),  then drive under the basket.   He waits there
for  two seconds and then runs a random three-step  pattern  under
the basket.

DEFENSIVE PLAYS
     You have four defensive plays to choose from:

         Low Zone           LZN
         High Zone          HZN
         Man-to-Man Zone    MML
         Man-to-Man Dark    MMD

     LOW ZONE.  When you call low zone, your teammate will stay in
the  key  (between  the basket and the inner  white  line  on  the
court).   When an offensive player enters his zone,  he covers him
man-to-man.   If the offense floods the low zone (which means both
offensive  players enter the key),  your teammate will  cover  the
ball handler.  In this case, you should cover the offensive player
withou  the ball.   When your opponents are not flooding  the  low
zone,  your teammate always take the man in the low zone,  and you
take the man outside the key in the high zone.

     HIGH ZONE.   If you assign your teammate to the high zone, he
cover the ball handler when that player is in the high zone.  When
the ball handler enters the low zone area around the key, you must
cover him, and your teammate covers the player without the ball.

     MAN-TO-MAN LIGHT.   Your teammate covers the opposing  player
who  wears the light-colored uniform.   He stays with that  player
everwhere on the court.  You cover the player in the dark uniform.
The goal in man-to-man coverage is to stay between the man  you're
guarding and the basket, trying to keep him from getting under the
basket and making an easy shot.

     MAN-TO-MAN-DARK.   This  is the reverse of man-to-man  light.
Your  teammate covers the man in the dark uniform,  and you  cover
the man in the light uniform.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF ZONE DEFENSE
     The  zone defense is very effective against inside  shooters.
If  the  ball handler breaks away from the man  playing  the  high
zone,  the  man  playing the low zone can usually cover  the  ball
handler  before  he can get into position near  the  basket.   The
weakness of the zone defense is that one defender is always in the
key,  resulting in a two-on-one situation outside the  key.   This
sometimes means that one of the offensive players can take an easy
outside shot.

     If you're playing against the computer,  it's easier to  beat
the  computer when you play a zone defense.   If you want  a  more
challenging game, play man-to-man.

PLAYCALLING AND LOOSE BALL
     If nobody grabs a rebound and the ball is loose, the computer
will sometimes allow you to regroup your offense and call  another
play.   You'll  know this is happening if the  playcalling  screen
appears.

PENALTIES

FOULS
     Bumping  into an opposing player continuously for  more  than
one second results in a foul in the following situationa:

     A  defensive  foul occurs when one of the  defensive  players
bumps  into the ball handler.   The penalty is either ball out  of
bounds to the offense or free throws.

     Chargin  occurs when the ball handler bumps into a  defensive
player.  The penalty is change of possession or free throws.

     Fouls and other penalties are displayed on the scoreboard  in
flashing letters right after they occur.   However, if a player is
fouled  while  shooting,  the  foul  won't  be  displayed  on  the
scoreboard  until  after the shot has either gone in for  a  field
goal or missed.   Fouling the shooter results in one free throw if
the basket is good and two free throws if he misses his shot.

     The number of TEAM FOULS is also displayed on the scoreboard.
Teams  get  five fouls per half;  the count is reset  to  zero  at
halftime.   If a team accumulates more than five fouls in a  half,
this results in bonus free throws for the other team.

OTHER VIOLATIONS
     TRAVELING  is called if you jump to shoot but  don't  release
the ball in time.   It won't be called if your shot is blocked  by
an opponent and you come down with the ball.  Traveling results in
a change of possession.

     THE THREE-SECOND RULE is invoked if an offensive player stays
inside  the key for more than three seconds at a  time.   However,
when the ball is in the air or up for grabs,  all players can stay
in the key for as long as they like,  until someone comes up  with
the  ball.   Staying  in  the key too long results  in  change  of
possession.

     THE 24-SECOND SHOT CLOCK gives the offensive team 24  seconds
to  make  a  shot  after they  bring  the  ball  into  play.   The
scoreboard  has  a  SHOT  CLOCK which  counts  down  the  seconds.
Failure to make a shot in time results in change of possession.

     Here's a summary of all violations and penalties:

     With five or fewer team fouls:
     Fouling the Shooter:
         if ball goes in.........1 free throw
         if ball misses..........2 free throws
     Fouling the Ball
         Handler.................Ball out of bounds to the offense
     Charging....................Change of possession
     Three Seconds in Key........Change of possession
     24-Second Clock.............Change of possession

     With more than five team fouls:
     Fouling the Shooter:
         if ball goes in.........1 free throw
         if ball misses..........2 free throws
     Fouling the Ball
         Handler.................2 free throws
     Charging....................2 free throws
     Three Seconds in Key........Change of possession
     24-Second Clock.............Change of possession

      A WORD ABOUT FREE THROWS.   Players don't have control  over
free throw accuracy.   It's based on the outside shooting  rating.
To  make a free throw,  just push the joystick button and  release
it.  All players can rebound after the last free throw attempt.

THE QUARTER CLOCK AND OVERTIME
     You'll  play  four 6-minute quarters in each  game.   If  the
teams  are  tied  at  the  end  of  the  fourth  quarter,   you'll
automatically go into overtime, which is another 6-minute quarter.
The  amount of time left in each quarter is shown on the clock  in
the  middle  of the scoreboard.   At the end of  each  quarter,  a
buzzer  rings and the screen displays which quarter has just  been
played.  You then go immediately into the next quarter.

     At the start of the game, the home team always takes the ball
out  (Player  One is always the home  team).   The  visiting  team
brings  the ball into play in the second quarter.   The home  team
again  takes the ball out when the third quarter begins,  and  the
visiting team starts off the fourth quarter.

CALLING TIMEOUTS AND PAUSING THE GAME
     To pause the game,  simply press the F7 key on your keyboard;
TIMEOUT  OR F5 TO RESUME wil be displayed on the  scoreboard.   If
you  merely want to pause the game,  press the F5 key when  you're
ready to resume.

     You can call a timeout only when you're on offense.   If  you
want  to call a timeout,  first press the F7 key,  then press  the
joystick button.  Each team is allowed five timeouts per half.  On
the  scoreboard  you'll notice five little yellow  lights  on  the
HOME  and  VISITOR  sides of the board.   Each  time  you  call  a
timeout, one of the yellow lights will go out.

     Calling  timeouts  saves precious seconds at the end  of  the
game.   If your team is behind and the clock is about to run  out,
you should call a timeout right after you've called a play.   When
you  call a timeout,  your players don't have to take the time  to
run  down court and set up the play;  they'll just appear  on  the
court, in position, when play resumes.

     To  quit a game inprogress and start over,  you must run  off
your  computer and load GBA  Championship  Basketball:  Two-on-Two
again -- see "Getting Started", previous discussed.

AFTER THE GAME
     At  the end of every game,  you can read all about  it.   The
sports page of the Gamestar Gazette appears on the screen with the
following boxscore writeups:  the team names, the final score, the
total field goals for each team,  shooting percentages,  rebounds,
steals, blocked shots, and the name of the leading scorer.

     Here's what the numbers mean:

     FIELD GOALS.   This is the total number of baskets that  each
team made.   Each basket is worth either 2 or 3 points,  depending
on where the player was on the court when he made the shot.   Free
throws do not count as field goals.

     PERCENTAGE.   The  field  goal percentage  is  calculated  by
taking  the total number of actual field goals and dividing it  by
the total number of field goal attempts.   This number is the team
percentage.

     REBOUNDS.   Every time your team pulls down a  rebound,  it's
recorded here.

     STEALS.   This  number records the number of times your  team
stole the ball from the opposition.

     BLOCKED SHOTS.   There are two type of blocked shots.   After
the shot is blocked,  either the defender comes down with the ball
or the offensive player retain possession.  Blocked shots are only
recorded here when the defender gains possession of the ball.

     LEADING SCORER.  The top scorer's name will be displayed with
the number of points he scored.

TO PLAY ANOTHER GAME

     When a game ends, press F7 to return to the chalkboard menus.
If you've just played any game (except in league play) and want to
play  the  same game again,  you don't have to type in  your  name
again or select a new computer teammate unless you want to.   Just
press  RETURN  or move the basketballs to CONTINUE and  press  the
joystick button as you move quickly through the menus.
