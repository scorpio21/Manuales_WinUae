- When choosing your team, each team has eight different skill categories:
  (QB) - Quarterback
  (RB) - Running Back
  (OL) - Offensive Line
  (RC) - Receivers
  (DL) - Defensive Line
  (LB) - Linebackers
  (DB) - Defensive Backs
  (CH) - Coach

   The ratings are based on a 1 to 3 point system, with 3 being the
highest, and 1 the lowest ranking.

-  To make a ball carrier run faster, push and release the
joystick button rapidly as you move him left or right.

-  To have the ball carrier throw a stiffarm, jerk the joystick rapidly in
the direction from which the defender is approaching.  You must time this
movement to match exactly the start of the defender's leap or he'll tackle
you.
