Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the near-future, five superpowers will fight for complete control of the
planet.  Each leader will use their skills in resource management, military
tacticts, espionage and diplomacy to turn the global situation to their
advantage.  Minor governments will fall as the superpowers expand their
borders towards the swirn enemies.  A final peace will only exist when four
leaders have been eliminated, and one stands alone.

You are one of these five leaders, and this war is about to begin.  Your
opponents are some of the most skilled and devious rulers that history has
ever known, brought to life in the future using sophisticated DNA retrieval
and cloning techniques.  Against the toughest opposition imaginble, you
must struggle to achieve nothing less than GLOBAL DOMINATION.

Opponents
~~~~~~~~~
Julius Caesar, General Custer, Genghis Khan, Henry V, Adolf Hitler,
Adbraham Lincoln, Napoleon, Queen Victoria, and Caveman.  You can only play
against four of these opponents at a time.  Each leader has his own style
of leadership, strong points, and weaknesses, which becomes clear in
strategic styles and diplomatic methods.

Overview
~~~~~~~~
The world is divided into territories.  Your goal is to conquer all of
them.  Territories provide you with resources (money) you need to use to
keep fighting, build new armies, etc.  Defending your territories and
conquering enemy territories is the key to winning the game.

There are three levels of complexity to play this game:

Simple - you fight by building and moving armies.  You build armies with
ten types of fighting units, from infantry soldiers to combat jets; a key
to success is finding the best army structure to beat the enemy's armies.

Reduced - with this complexity you can also use Diplomacy to ally yourself
with like-minded enemies.  You also can create a Intelligence bureau which
will gather information on each enemy, and assemble special forces which
can perform covert operations in anyone's territories.

Full - conflicts between armies take place over months (instead of being
resolved instantly), which lets you retreat from losing fights.  You can
also choose to fight a conflict as a Satellite battle, where you give
tactical orders to individual fighting units on a scrolling "satellite"
battle map.

The game proceeds in turns, where each player is allowed to make their
moves for the current month (thus each turn contains two to five months,
one for each player - plus an additional turn for revolutionary forces).
During your game turn you can build armies, move them, and deploy special
forces.  All other tasks can be performed at any time.

Interface
~~~~~~~~~
Click, left-click, press, or select mean to use the left mouse button.

To exit most screens, use the right mouse button.

Gray-and-red square buttons in the interface toggle options on and off, or

setting or scroll up and down a list of possible options.

On certain panels you will find large "checkmark" and "X" buttons.  These

the Icon Bar.  There are fourteen Icons, each with a different command
associated with them.

At the bottom left is the Message Bar.  You can change the message bar
height using the arrow buttons on the left side of the Message Bar.  Here
is where messages about what is going on are displayed.  Purple messages

message bar by clicking within the top and bottom edges of the message bar.
(Note - you cannot change the message bar height when displaying the World
Map).

Intelligence
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each section has a percentage rating hat measures how Complete your
intelligence is for that enemy.  This completeness rating determines what
kinds of information you can access on a particular enemy.

Info panel (TERRITORIES): depending on the completeness rating for a leader,
the unrest ratings for his territories will be at one of four levels of
detail:

        Completeness                  Unrest Information
            0%                          nothing
            1-19%                       nothing/some
            20-39%                      none/less than 50%/more than 50%
            40-100%                     exact percentage

Info panel (ARMIES):

        Completeness                  Army Information
            1-9%                        nothing
            10-29%                      number of units in army
            30-39%                      number of units in army, morale,
                                        obsolescence
            50-100%                     exact composition

World Map:

        Completeness                  Unrest Information
            0%                          dark green = unknown
            1-39%                       dark green = none
                                        light blue = some
            40-100%                     dark green = none
                                        green = low
                                        bright green = high

Leader Report:


        Completeness                  Information ADDED to Report
            0-4%                        nothing
            5-14%                       is leader stable, unstable,
                                        deranged?
            15-19%                      chance of destabilizing leader
            20-24%                      mood of leader
            25-29%                      amount on intelligence he has
                                        gathered on you
            30-39%                      stored resources
            40-49%                      unused special forces units
            50-100%                     treaties with other enemies

        Stability: stable, unstable, deranged
        Mood: aggressive, defensive, expansionist (go after neutrals),
              desperate (stockpile resources), vengeful (go after one person)
        Chance of Madness: madness (gaga), paranoid (ultra-defensive),
                fanatical (ultra-offensive).

Special Forces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Special forces are used to raise/lower unrest and to destabilize other
leaders.  You can have up to 20 total special forces units.  Your ability
to use special forces on an enemy depends on how much intelligence you
have on that enemy.  Deploying one unit of special forces for raising
unrest will raise unrest on that territory by 5% plus the amount of
intelligence you have on that enemy.  If you have 35% intelligence on an
enemy, a unit of special forces could raise unrest by 40%.
It takes 5 special forces to destabilize a leader.  You chance of success
depends on your intelligence on that leader.  If you have 50% intelligence,
then you have a 50% chance of being successful.  A successful
destabilization will raise the leader's chance of madness by 15%; if it
goes above 99% the leader will become deranged.

Satellite Battles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can only fight one satellite battle at a time.  You cannot resume other
aspects of the game until that satellite battle is resolved.
In a battle, the attacker's goal is to destroy the enemy's Command
Headquarters (icon looks like a base).  The defender's goal is to defend
the Command Headquarters until the attacker runs out of supplies or units,
while attacking the enemy's Supply Bases (looks like a depot icon).  A clock
measures how long the attacker's supplies will last.  If it reaches zero
and the Command Headquarters is not destroyed, the defender wins the
battle.  Destroying a supply base takes more time off of the clock.

Terrain:  sea       inaccessible    (aircraft are unaffected by terrain)
          woods     accessible only to infantry
          city, hills, farmland, scrub, grassland - effect speeds of
                        movement differently.
          road - fastest terrain for all land based units

Satellite battle is really cool... I suggest you practice a few battles
before using this in a real game.
