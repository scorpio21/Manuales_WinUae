                                  SCENARIO
				  --------

In this distant Galaxy exist many systems harbouring life. Trade and
communication have arisen between these star systems, as has a great, dark
force threataning these distant civilizations. To fight this dark menace
the Space Federation was formed, but has met with little success.

The enemy calls itself THE FORTH EMPIRE and has now attaked JUNOS, jewel of
the Galaxy. The JUNOS star system, once so beautiful... is only ashes now.
And on these ashes THE FORTH EMPIRE is building the strongest fortress of
all time, from which to complete their conquest of the galaxy.

The Space Federation must end this evil menace! Thus is launched Galaxy
Force, to strike a hammer blow against the forces threataning civilization.

Fortunately, having done this duty of saving JUNOS people and destroying
THE FORTH EMPIRE, a combatant of Galaxy Force returned to the ship.

                              JUNOS STAR SYSTEM
			      -----------------

The JUNOS star system comprises of five planets, the jewel of the Galaxy is
JUNOS, with VELTEOR, MALKLAND, ORTHEA, and ASHUTAR.

                                  YOUR AIM
				  --------

You have to fight THE FORTH EMPIRE through five levels, travelling through
space, over land and sea, through caverns, and ultimately destroying the
fortress at the end of each level. You will come across many different life
forms, as well as the more conventional fighter craft. But their aim is the
same to destroy YOU. Lock-on to the enemy and destroy them with the use of
your MISSILES or LASER GUN.

The sixth mission is on the way to THE FORTH EMPIRE'S fortress, you travel
through never ending tunnels, through construction sites, and ultimately to
the fortress itself. Destroy this with everything you have.
