				GOLDRUNNER

			       INTRODUCTION

The earth is dying. Man has so polluted his environment, it can no longer
sustain him. New worlds have been found. Ships are ready for a mass migration.
But...between the old legacy and the new hopes, lie-the Ring Worlds of Triton.
Artificial world, of unknown composition and built by an unconceivable
technology, the Ring Worlds are inhabited by the most hostile race in the
universe. They will destroy anything within range of their awesome weapons.

Yet their great power may be their weakness. They never considered that small
one-manned fighters -- agaionst which they have only the most rudimentary
defenses, would dare to invade their inviolable space. Only the most skillful
and the most daring of space pilots have any chance of success. You are chosen.
An ex-space pirate, once the scourge of the authorities, you carry the
desperate hopes of a ravaged Earth. You are - The GOLDRUNNER.

			PLAYING THE GAME

To destroy a ring, you must fly on the inside of it destroying anything which
can be shot. Each ring has a certain amount of energy in it. Any machinery or
building destroyed will reduce this energy. When the ring energy has been
reduced to zero the ring is dead and you may leave by the exit building. Flying
defenses will not hurt you but their disrupter bombs will. Most ground objects
can be flown over but the taller ones (those which cast longer shadows) will
destroy you - avoid them, they cannot be destroyed. Each of your Sacecraft
initially has wing lasers, turbo boosters and an armour strength of 5 units. As
it is hit by disrupter bombs, both armour and craft ability are reduced. Bonus
points can be scored when traveling between rings. Your high score will be
saved during game play but will not be saved to disk.

			STATUS

The right hand side of the screen is a status display, showing the high score
at the top and your present score at the bottom. Also shown is the current
player number and ring number. The center icons represent ring energy, wing
lasers and auxiliary boosters. Current armour strength is shown below the
status area and number of spacecraft remaining is shown above the status area.
