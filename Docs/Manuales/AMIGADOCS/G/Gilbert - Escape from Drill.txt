THE GAME

 Gilbert is feeling very pleased with himself. A jolly spiffing summer
zipping about all over the Earth has left him feeling like a Super
Hero. Unfortunately, the rest of his fellow Drillians are not quite as
happy. In fact, they are green (and slimy) with envy.
Talk, talk, talk. Rabbit, rabbit, will Gilbert never shut up about his
time on Earth?
Luckily, even Gilberthas to stop for breath and just as things are
getting back to normal a telly-gram (!) arrives from earth to invite
Gilbertback to do a new series. That's done it. The Drillians can take
no more. They decide that the only way to avoid another winter of
Gilbert's bragging is to stop him from getting to the Tyne Tees
Television Studios and signing his contract.
The Millienium Dustbin has certain importent parts removed (well
wouldn't you class the tollet as important?)and spread about the planet
of Drill. The Drillians remain tight lipped about it (not easy when you
have a mouth the size of Gilbert's!) but being jolly sporting types,
they give him a chance of finding some clues to the where abouts of the
missing pieces. All Drillians love a good video game so they decide
that if Gilbert can beat their favorite arcade game they will give him
a clue.
 It all sounds very easy to a being with a brainbox the size of
Gilbert's until he realises that he must reach Earth within 24 hours
otherwise the contract will be given to another Superstar.

PLAYING THE GAME

 You are in control of Gilbert (most unusual, you had better make the
most of it!)
He can walk, jump, float and swim around Drill (but not all at the same
time, I hasten to add) and can protect himself from the various weirdo
creatures that will try to stop him by snotting at them (YUK!).
(NOTE: snotting has no effect underwater).
If he snots away enough creatures on one screen he will see the
HOVERJELLY which may drop an item of food when snotted which can be
picked up by running Gilbert over it. These food items are:

TIN OF BEAN - used by Gilbert to give himself a bad attack of wind so
that he canfloat over the landscape.

PIECE OF CAKE - eating this while floating will cancel the effect of
the floating (how, we will leave to your imagination).

 He can carry up to 4 items and use them by pressing keys 1-4.

 Gilberts supply of snot is limited but can be replenished by entering
a Milk Bar in the city.

 In the corner of every Milk Bar you will find one of the video
machines which he can play by walking over to it. Once he has attempted
a game he must find and play another before returning to the previous
game.

THE GAMES ARE:

BRAIN DRAIN - play against a Drillian opponent in a test of memory.
Select two tiles with the cursor and try to match them.

SPROUT WARS - save the sweet, innocent little sprouts against the big
bad buggy boo that has attacked them. Shoot him with your leek!

GREED - collect the bags of dosh in the correct order but don't cross
your path.

SNOT FIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL - snot them varmits, partner old bean.

EARTH INVADERS - the aliens revenge.

 Winning an arcade game will give a clue to where Gilbert can find the
missing piece of Millenium Dustbin.
