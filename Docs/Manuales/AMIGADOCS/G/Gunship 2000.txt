CONTENTS
~~~~~~~~
Your Gunship 2000 should contain a manual, this technical supplement, a quick
key guide, four disks and a registration card.


REQUIRED EQUIPMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Computer:

This Simulation requires a Commodore Amiga with at least 1 Mb of RAM. If you
intend to install the simulation onto a hard disk, 1.5 Mb of RAM is required.

Controls:

Gunship 2000 can be run entirely from the keyboard, with mouse and keyboard,
or with joystick and keyboard. An analog joystick greatly improves the "feel"
and realism, and is therefore strongly recommended.

Disk Drives:

Gunship 2000 can be installed onto 3.5" floppy disks. You will need a set of
four blank disks for this. However, it works best if installed onto a hard 
disk drive.


INSTALLATION CONCEPTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Important: Gunship 2000 should not be played from the disks enclosed. You must
either copy the original disks onto backup floppy disks or use the install
program to create a subdirectory on your hard disk. If you attempt to play
from the disks enclosed the will become permanently altered as they are
updated as the simulation runs. Please do not use any commercially 
(or otherwise) available copy program - use the one provided for you on the
disk. No other copy program will work, and MicroProse will not accept
responsibility for any damage caused by copying programs except the one
provided.

Installing on Floppy Disks:

Gunship 2000 has no disk copy protection. Insert your original Gunship 2000
Disk 1 and switch on your computer. A screen will appear which allows you to
copy your original disks. Please follow any on-screen prompts. You will need
a set of blank disks.

Installing on Hard Disk: 

Boot up your hard disk as normal and insert Gunship 2000 Disk 1. Open this
disk and double-click on the "INSTALL" icon. Please follow any on-screen
prompts. A drawer labelled "GS2000" will be created on your hard disk, 
containing all necessary files.


RUNNING GUNSHIP 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Loading from Floppy Disk:

If your computer has KickStart in ROM, turn off your computer and insert your
backup Disk 1. Power up the computer, and the program will auto-load. If your
computer does not have KickStart in ROM, load the KickStart as normal, insert
your backup Disk 1 at the Workbench prompt, and the program will auto-load.
Please follow any on-screen prompts requesting disk changes.

Hard Disk:

Boot up your hard disk as normal. Open the "GS2000" drawer and double-click on
the "Gunship" icon.


SAVING GAMES
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hard Disk:

Your games will be saved to the drawer containing Gunship 2000.

Floppy Disk: Your games are saved onto your "backup" game disks. You don't
need an additional save-game disk.


MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROGRAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Replays:

In programming the Amiga version of Gunship 2000, we were faced with difficult
choices; we knew that it would be very difficult to include all the features
from the IBM PC version and maintain the 'speed' of the 3D and include all the
features. We are pleased to say that we have kept the screen update rate very
high; unfortunately, memory restrictions have meant the loss of the "Replay"
facility.

Page 81 of the Manual explains events after the completion of a mission. After
receiving any decorations you have earned you will return to the brigade
headquarters. Please ignore references to "Mission Replays" in the manual.

Configuration Screen:

When in flight, Pause the game and press the "C" keys to access the 
configuration screen. This allows you to alter yoru method of control, and to
set the detail level. Increasing detail may delay screen updates, and is 
initially set on 'medium detail', which is fine for basic Amigas. If you have
a powerful machine, increase the detail level. If you want a faster game,
reduce the detail level.

Version Updates:

The latest notes regarding this program, additions, revisions etc. can be
found on Disk 1, in an ASCII file named "READ.ME". You can read the file using
standard AmigaDOS commands e.g. "Type", "More" (These utilities can be found
on the WorkBench disk).


PROBLEMS?
~~~~~~~~~
In the vast majority of cases a loading problem is not due to faulty software,
but either an incorrect loading procedure or a hardware fault.

Please ensure that the loading instructions have been correctly executed. The
most common hardware failures are due to a misalignment of the heads in the
disk drive. Such faults may be detected by loading the game on another
computer. (Either use a friend's machine or ask the software store from which
the game was purchased to test it).

Alternatively, a virus may have been transferred into your hardware from
another piece of software. Pirated copies of games are an incredibly common
source of viruses. It always pays to own original software.

In the unlikely event of a software fault, please return the complete package,
with your receipt, to the place of purchase. MicroProse regret that goods
cannot be replaced unless bought from the company directly.

If you have any difficult whilst loading Gunship 2000, or need help whilst
running the Simulation, MicroProse will be happy to help you on the Customer
Services Helpline. Please ring UK (0666) 504399, Mon-Fri 0900-1700 hrs. Have a
pen and paper handy when you call.


CONTROLS
~~~~~~~~
A note about Selectors:

Throughout the manual and technical supplement you will find references to
selectors. A selector is a button or key which you must press to make a choice
or initiate an action, and vary according to the method of control being used.

                          KEYBOARD         JOYSTICK         MOUSE
                          ~~~~~~~~         ~~~~~~~~         ~~~~~

Selector #2               Backspace Key    Backspace Key    Right Button

A note about keyboards:

If you need to hold down the "alt" or "shift" key with another key, make sure
to press the "alt" or "shift" key first. Keep it down while pressing the other
key, the release the "alt" or "shift" key last. Otherwise, you may get erratic
keyboard results.

                                 INTRODUCTION


THE MISSION

All around you in the TOC sit the other squadron flight commanders; tension
covers the area like a blanket. As you rip open your orders, the anticipation
grabs at your gut, but you already know the score. No breaks here; your flight
always pulls the tough assignments. Another SEAD mission deep into enemy
territory. Those fast movers need you to clear the way again. Doesn't the TF
know that your luck can't hold out forever? Sure, your success rate is the
highest in the squadron, but...

You gaze at the mission map. The Primary is 20 klicks behind enemy lines -
they must be kidding. Your boys best be sharp tonight. Better get over to the
armorer's tent. At least you'll get first choice on ordnance; being number one
does have benefits. Apaches and Kiowa Warriors are on tap tonight. Plenty of
Hellfires and Mark 261 MPSM rockets to go 'round. No need for any AA loads
this trip. Is the opposition the only ones smart enough not to fly during
these conditions? The S2 better be right on this one.

You climb into the rear seat of your Apache. You've never quite understood the
feeling, but the closeness and tight fit is somehow comforting. You pre-flight
the cockpit switches. You could run through this in your sleep, but SOP says
otherwise - everything must be by the book. As you light off the APU your
CP/G gives the thumbs-up. The other four pilots in the flight are looking to
you for the sign. Although it's pitch black, you can still read the concern on
their faces; but, they're good to go. Time to get these birds airborne. You
key the commo switch, "Wind'em up!"

Three-quarters of the way there and no sightings. Just a milk run so far; lady
luck must still be along for the ride. This is too good to last. You're
getting a bit green-eyed from the glow of the FLIR's eyepiece, but without it
you'd quickly get close and personal with some unforeseen hillside. Skimming
the tree tops at 120 knots is quite a rush, but any kind of altitude spells
nothing but bad news.
                                                                  [Page   8]

The MFD indicates that waypoint 3 is just ahead; time to assume attack
positions. Captain Arthur in Zulu-4 will lead the light section; as usual, the
heavy section is with you - Zulu-1. Your call goes out, "Light section break
right, heavy section left on me, weapons free." "Roger, breaking now," replies
Zulu-4.

The APR-39 is starting to chirp, and those blips on the threat display
difinitely aren't friendlies. "Jack, select MPSM," you call to your front-
seater over the ICS. "All units, prepare to unmask. Engage as they Bear."

As you come up, the TADS paints a pretty picture of the target. There they are
big as you please - Sa-13's and 'Zoos'. But this is no time to admire the
scenery, there's work to be done. "Targets bearing 335!", calls Jack not all
too calmly. "Weapons in constraints, MPSM away!" you respond with equal gusto.

The rocket sub-munitions burst on the target with a tremendous white flash,
followed by a series of secondary explosions. "Those guys are toast!" you hear
Jack call out to no one in particular. So much for radio integrity.

You've certainly got their attention now. The threat display is going wild;
enemy units are popping up at every clock position. The APR's radar warning
indicator light turns a solid, glaring red as the klaxon blares in your
headset. You're being tracked!

"Jammer active, chaff out! Peg him, Jack!" you call out while quickly pushing
the Apache down and to the right. You glance over just as the enemy missile
explodes harmlessly in the chaff cloud. "I'm on him. Switching to Hellfire,"
Jack responds.  A short flash, and the Hellfire reaches out to find its
taarget. Jack's head is glued to his display. He'll keep the target locked in
the sight until the Hellfire impacts. A bright light blooms off to the left as
the target evaporates from view. Scratch another one!

The ground explodes as rockets and Hellfires slam into the hapless targets.
You know that it's only a matter of time. There's no hope for those guys; the
surprise was too perfect.

Minutes later, not a sigle target is active. And, a good thing too as you've
expended most of your ordnance. Its time to pull pitch and head for home.
"Zulu's, form on me. Let's get out of here. Well done!"

                                                                  [Page   9]

Back at the TOC you and the other flight commanders are preparing for the
debrief. As you sit and wait your turn, a smile slowly cracks across your face
- just another successful mission.

You knew it all the time.

                                                                  [Page  10]


OVERVIEW

Gunship 2000 is a detailed presentation of the art of present and near future
helicopter combat operations. You can control just one or up to five distinct
helicopters. The current and planned versions of the most prevalent U.S. Army
helicopters are available for the choosing. Not just a bystander, you actually
pilot on of the Army's top helicopters.

You start out as a Warrant Officer Candidate (WOC) at the Army Aviation Center
Fort Rucker, Alabama. Here you select your squadron and provide its nickname.
More importantly, you get the necessary training to prepare you for the
difficult challenge of helicopter combat. You determine the reality or
difficulty of the training. It can be as simple or as hard as you desire; the
advantage here, you can take your time and can't be damaged. Plus, you can
return to training at any time to brush up on your skills.

Upon completion, you are promoted to Warrant Officer (W01), and move on to
Single Helicopter Missions. here you command and fly a single helicopter, in
one of two theaters, against opposing forces in a variety of missions. The
rank of a commissioned officer awaits your success; and upon receiving your
commision, the door opens to the endless variety and challenge of Flight and
Campaign Missions.

In the Flight Missions you are not only an active member of, but command a
flight of five helicopters. You determine the mix of helicopters and ordnance
necessary to complete the mission. How well you employ your own helicopter,
plus command the other four helicopters determines the success or failure of
the missions.

The Campaign Mission places you in a situation of continous combat where
mission after mission is thrown at you and your flight. While you can't win
the campaign on your own, your success (or failure) does have an impact on its
ultimate outcome.

                                                                  [Page  11]

Gunship 2000 offers all the thrill and excitement of modern helicopter combat
in a visually accurate world of Topographical 3-D. Promotion, decorations and
glory await you!


                                                                  [Page  12]

HOW TO START


Sorting the Materials

This Manual provides a tutorial for beginners, in-depth operating instructions
and a wide variety of tactical, historical and technical background.

The Technical Supplement provides specific instructions for the installation
and/or loading of this simulation on your computer. It also acts as a complete
reference guide for all of the graphics and keys used in the simulation.

The Keyboard Overlay(s) visually represents all of the controls and orders
necessary for the operation of your helicopter and the computer itself.


Installation/Loading

The Technical Supplement provides complete instructions about how to install
Gunship 2000 onto either a hard disk (strongly recommended) or floppy disks.
See the "Installation" section for details.

In addition, the "Loading" section provides instructions for starting up the
simulation. You'll be provided the opportunity to tailor the software to your
system, specifically the controller type and sound options. If you have a
joystick, we strongly recommend its use. However, it's not required - the
entire simulation can be controlled from the keyboard.


Learning the Simulation

The first step is to become acquainted with actual helicopter flight systems.
Read through "The Helicopter" (pages 85-114). In this section, the theory and
practical application of helicopter flight is discussed. Those unfamiliar with
any type of flight or familiar only with fixed-wing flight will find the
information quite beneficial. With this information in hand, you are ready to
proceed to the tutorial.


                                                                  [Page  13]

                                                                  [Page  14]

Page 14 contains an illustration/picture, some people sitting on a helicopter.

                                                                  [Page  15]

                                  1. TUTORIAL


This tutorial enables you to strap on the seat of a helicopter and begin
flying without digesting the entire manual. However, it neither provides you
with the necessary insight to skillfully utilize the various weapon systems
available, nor details the multiple helicopter operations. It familiarizes you
with the basic controls and systems of the AH-64A Apache Gunship in a simple
training flight against simulated opposing forces.

GETTING STARTED


Installation/Loading

See the Technical Supplement for Specific instructions for the installation,
loading and configuration of this simulation on your computer.

Where You Start

After the title squence, you'll find yourself at brigade headquarters. Various
"action areas" are placed at position around this screen. These "action areas"
are accessed to select the various options available at brigade headquarters.

To select an option, use the controller to position the cursor over the
desired "action area". When an "action area" is accessed, the cursor changed
shape to a bull's-eye and the option's title is displayed at the bottom of the
screen. Pressing Selector #1 selects that option.

Duty Roster

As a new pilot, your first step is to get your name up on the Duty Roster. As
part of this process, you also have the opportunity to select your squadron
unit insignia and its nickname. 

Position the cursor over the duty roster hanging on the back wall and press

                                                                  [Page  16]

Selector #1. The "Duty Roster" screen now appears.

By Positioning the cursor over any one of the six pilots, a detailed
accounting of the flight commander and flight members, if any, is displayed in
the top section. For now, you just want to get your name on the Duty Roster
(for a detailed description of the Duty Roster, see pages 24-27).

Position the cursor over the "Erase Me" pilot and press Selector #2; then
follow the instructions to enter your name and select your squadron and its
nickname. Leave the cursor positioned over your new pilot (the corresponding
data should be displayed in the top section) and press Selector #1. This
selects that pilot and returns you to the brigade headquarters screen.

Notice that your pilot's name and unit are now listed at the top of the Duty
Roster.


Type of Flight

Now position the cursor over the duty officer's desk (he is sitting in the
foreground) and press Selector #1. The "Type of Flight" screen now appears.

Since you're in training, position the cursor over the "Training" and press
Selector #1. This places you in the training mode and returns you to the 
brigade headquarters screen.

Notice that the duty officer is now holding an envelope marked "Training";
this envelope contains your orders for this training mission.


Theater of Duty

Now position the cursor over the world map located on the right wall and
press Selector #1. The "Theater of Duty" screen now appears.

There are simulated training sites available for either of the two theaters -
The Persian Gulf and Central Europe. Select the Persian Gulf (you will
eventually want to fly training missions in both theaters) by positioning the
cursor in the box outlining the theater and pressing Selector #1. You now
return to the brigade headquarters screen; notice that the Persian Gulf
theater is outlined on the world map.


Mission Briefing

You are now ready to start the training flight. Position the cursor over the
door marked "Exit" and press Selector #1. The Briefing screen now appears.

It's time to familiarize yourself with the Mission Orders. As you look out at
the TF Commander, the top page of your Mission Orders is just visible at the
bottom of the screen. Position the cursor on the page and press Selector #1.
You are now looking down at the top page.

Since this is a training mission, some of the data is in abbreviated form;

                                                                  [Page  17]

however note two important areas.

First, are the "Primary Mission" and "Secondary Missions". Review the type or
nature of the missions. Additionally, the position of your base, FARP are also
indicated.

Position the cursor anywhere on the page and press Selector #1. The next page
appears. This lists the support data about the position of your base, FARP, 
flight conditions and the S2's intelligence report.

Please note that the map coordinates are read military fashion, "right & up".
The first number listed is on the horizontal scale, and the second on the
vertical scale. For example, 00/16 is in the upper left corner. Remember that
maps are never 100% accurate. This is especially true when sighting mobile
units.

Position the cursor anywhere on the page and press Selector #1. The mission
map appears. This map indicates the relative positions of the different
Primary Missions (P), your base (B) and FARP (F). Additionally, the map
details the major terrain features and other areas of interest (for a 
detailed description of the mission map, see pages 41-42).

To review the Mission Orders, you may sequentially leaf through the pages any
number of times. After review, position the cursor over the envelope and press
Selector #1. The briefing Screen now appears.

For this flight let's go with the armorer's recommended weapon load and begin
the mission. Position the cursor over the map and press Selector #1. The
Cockpit Switches now appear.


Cockpit Switches

When Gunship 2000 is first installed, all of the switches are set at the
lowest difficulty levels. Let's leave them that way for this flight. By
positioning the cursor over a switch, a brief description of its function
appears in the "Data Display" at the upper right (for a detailed description
of the cockpit switches, see pages 34-39).

Located in the center of the screen is the "GPS Consol". Position the cursor
over this area; the Data Display describes the Console's function and then
displays the GPS Cipher as it appeared in your Mission Orders.

You're shown a Squadron Insignia along with a five digit number. These
insignia and numbers are found between pages 21 & 60 of this manual. Find

                                                                  [Page  18]

the corresponding five digit Authenticator Code, and enter this number by
pressing the appropriate numeric keys.

If the correct code is entered, the GPS Console displays "Signal Locked".
You're now ready to start the mission.

If you can't find the correct code, you can still fly the mission, but the
on-board GPS Map is disabled along with your weapons. Basically, you're on a
sighseeing tour, but at least the view is breathtaking.

Now position the cursor over the "Aux Power Unit" switch. This switch starts
the helicopter's engines, which begins the mission. It has a safety cover so
that it won't be inadvertently activated. Press Selector #1, and the safety
cover flips up. Press Selector #1 again, and the power winds up - your mission
begins.


AT THE CONTROLS


Now you're on the ground at your base, at the controls of an AH-64A Apache.
You have a pilot's eye view of the world as you look out over the cockpit
gagues and indicators. The following is an abridged version of the flight
controls; it'll get you started in your first helicopter flight (for a
detailed description of the flight and cockpit controls, see pages 47-51)

You start the training mission by taking off from your base, and end it by
landing back at your base.

Getting Airborne

At this point, it's a good idea to locate the pause (alt p) key. The 
frustration factor is much reduced if you pause the flight, read a section,
perform the actions, pause again and read on further. 

Your engines are already on line (the APU provided the necessary power to fire
them up). Now engage the rotor; press the Rotor Engage/Disengage (9) key. The
rotor indicator light turns from red to green, and the rotor starts to rotate.

Vertical movement is controlled by the Collective. Press the Collective Up (=)
key a few times util the Apache starts to gain lift. When the altitude reaches
approximately 200 feet, press the Collective Down (-) key to stabilize the
lift.

Horizontal movement is controlled by the Cyclic. To move forward, push the
Joystick (up arrow) forward. You now start to gain speed. By pushing the
Joystick fully forward, the maximum speed for that altitude is attained. The
Joystick need not be kept in a forward position to maintain forward flight;
it's self trimming when centered.

                                                                  [Page  19]

Next push the Joystick (right arrow) slightly to the right. You bank and turn
to the right. If you do the opposite, you bank and turn to the left.


Map View

Press the Map View (F10) key; the GPS map now appears. Don't worry, your
Apache doesn't crash while you're viewing the map - the action is suspended.

The GPS map displays the entire world in which you're flying. Notice that it
matches the map you reviewed in your Mission Orders. Your Apache is positioned
in the center of the map, and the first Primary Objective is just to the
North.

Let's use the Apache's INS System to navigate to the target (for more
information on the INS System, see page 57).

Press the F key to select the Fly To command. Position the cursor over the 
first Primary Objective, and press Selector #1 followed by the Selector #2.
This enters that position into the INS System.

You can check the map at any time during a flight to verify positions. For
now, press the Selector #1 to return to the cockpit view.

The heading for the Primary Mission is displayed in the INS Indicator. More
than likely, your true heading is different from the INS heading. Bank the
Apache towards the INS heading indicator until the two heading numbers match.
This new heading will take you to the first Primary Mission for gunnery
practice. 


Weapon Selection

Your Weapons Indicator (located at the lower left) should display "Cannon"; if
not, press the Weapon Select (space bar) key until it displays "Cannon",
You've now selected the Apache's M230 30mm Chaingun. It has a max range of
1,500 meters, but its optimum range is 700 meters dead ahead and half that for
a "deflection shot" to the side.


Targeting

Before you can fire at an opposing unit, the TADS must be locked onto the
target. Look at the Threat Display (it's located in the lower right hand 
corner). If you're flying in the correct direction, there should be a red dot
directly ahead. If not, adjust your flight path. Check the map to verify the
placement of your waypoint. 

The TADS should be locked onto the target, a BTR-60 APC (the First Primary
Mission). It's displayed, along with its identification, true heading and
range data, in the MFD (located in the center of the cockpit). If the TADS
isn't locked onto the target, press the Acquire/Next Target (selector #2) key.

                                                                  [Page  20]

When locked, a Target Diamond appears in your view along with the Reticle
Ring. The Target Box indicates the exact position and heading to the BTR-60.
The Reticle Ring is the aiming point of the cannon. To hit the target, the
Reticle Ring must be superimposed over the Target Diamond. Adjust your flight
path if necessary.


Taking the Shot

When the BTR-60 enters maximum range for the cannon, the Target Box changes
from a broken box to a solid. This indicates that the selected weapon
(the M230 cannon in this case) is now "in constraints".

Keep the Target Box centered in the Reticle Ring, and let the range decrease.
As the range decreases the Reticle Ring increases in size, indicating an
increase in weaon accuracy. As you gain experience, you will eventually be
able to determine weaon accuracy just from the size of the Reticle Ring.

When the range reaches about 700 meters, open fire by pressing Selector #1.
You don't have to aim the M230 as it automatically tracks the target as long
as the Reticle Ring is superimposed over the Target Box. After a few rounds,
the BTR-60 is knocked out; you'll see its telltale explosion in the distance.


Return to Base

Well that's probably enough action for this flight; let's return to base.
Select the Map View and set the INS System for a heading to the base.

Fly the Apache to a position directly over the base. When in position, pull
back on the cyclic and allow your speed to drop to zero. Now press the
Collective Down (-) key to start a slow descent on to the base. It's of no
consequence if your descent is too fast, you can't crash on this flight.
Perfect landings only come with practice.

Upon touchdown, press the Rotor Engage/Disengage (9) key (the indicator light
now changes from green to red), and the rotor slows to a stop. This training
flight is now at an end.

Good luck on your future flights!

PREPARE FOR FLIGHT


Installation/Loading

See the Technical Supplement for specific instructions for the installation,
loading and configuration of this simulation on your computer.


Making Selections

Gunship 2000 provides for a large number of game options. These are presented
in various screens in the form of "action areas" or in a menu format.

When a screen first appears, the cursor will be positioned on the screen or
over a menu selection. You move the cursor or change the menu selection by
using the Controller. Once positioned over the desired option, it's selected
by pressing Selector #1. 


Using a Joystick

If your controller is a joystick, moving the stick up or down moves the cursor
vertically; moving the stick left or right moves the cursor horizontally. 
Vertical and horizontal movement can be combined.


Using the keyboard

If your controller is the keyboard, then any Arrow key moves the cursor to the
nearest option; the tab key moves the cursor to the next option; the shift Tab
key moves the cursor to the previous option; the Home key moves the cursor to
the top of menus; and the End key moves the cursor to the bottom of menu
listings. The keyboard can be utilized in conjunction with a joystick.


Action Areas

Most options are accessed via "action areas". These are placed at various
positions around the different screens. However, in some cases, menus are 

                                                                  [Page  24]

utilized where lists of data optios are more functional.

To select an option, use the controller to position the cursor over the 
desired "action area". When an "action area" is accessed, the cursor changes
shape from an arrow to a bull's-eye and the option's title displays at the
bottom of the screen. Pressing Selector #1 then selects that option. Menu
options are selected in a similar manner; the selected option is highlighted.

Whenever an option is selected in error, pressing the esc key cancels the
selection.


Brigade HQ

All action beings at Brigade Headquarters, located at your home base. From
this screen, the selections are made the determine the nature of your
upcoming mission(s). 

There are five "action areas" located at various positions around the screen,
and these are accessed to make the various mission selections.


Duty Roster

Position the cursor over the Duty Roster hanging on the back wall and press
Selector #1.

The duty roster is utilized to post the name of an active pilot, and flight
members, if any, for the upcoming mission. The name of the posted, or active
pilot always displays at the top of the Duty Roster.

What does it all mean; The Duty Roster is a detailed summary of a pilot's
career and the careers of his flight members, if he is also a flight
commander. By positioning the cursor over any one of the six pilots, that 
pilot is posted and a detailed accounting of the pilot and flight members then
displays in the top section.

The pilot's name, rank, squadron insignia, squadron nickname, decorations
awarded (numerals indicate multiple awards), missions flown and career
score(s) display. If the pilot is a flight commander, the flight members are
also listed along with their name, rank and decorations.

                                                                  [Page  25]

Ranks: Throughout a career, a pilot, including flight members, can advance
through the ranks from Warrant Officer Candidate all the way up to Brigadier
General. Ranks are indicated by a military abbrevation or by the actual rank
insignia.

The military abbreviations correspond to the following ranks in order of 
achievement:

 WOC: Warrant Officer Candidate
 WO1: Warrant Officer, W-1
 CW2: Chief Warrant Officer, W-2
 CW3: Chief Warrant Officer, W-3
 CW4: Chief Warrant Officer, W-4
 2LT: Second Lieutenant
 1LT: First Liutenant
 CAP: Captain
 MAJ: Major
 LTC: Lieutenant Colonel
 COL: Colonel
  BG: Brigadier General
 RYG: Rygar

Decorations: For examplary service, a pilot, including flight members, are
awarded decorations up to and including the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Decorations are displayed by an abbreviation and the actual medal.

The abbreviations correspond to the following decorations:

 NDS: The National Defense Service Medal - awarded for successfully completing
      training.

  PH: The Purple Heart - awarded for wounds received in combat.

The following decorations are awarded for heroism and valor, and are listed
from least difficult to achieve to the highest:

 ACV: The Army Commendation Medal for Valor
 AMV: The Air Medal for Valor
 BSV: The Bronze Star for Valor
  SS: The Silver Star

                                                                  [Page  26]

 DSC: The Distinguished Service Cross
CMOH: The Congressional Medal of Honor

Career Records: There are three numerical values that summarize a pilot's
career records. They represent, from left to right, last mission, best mission
and total career.

Status: Pilots, and consequently their flight members, are classified by the
current flight status. Only "Active" pilots can be posted for duty.

Active: Currently on active duty and good to go. You can have up to six
"Active" pilots on the Duty Roster.

Retired: If you are successful enough to acieve the rank of Brigadier General,
your country will ask no more of you. There's no more flying for you, and 
you'll be posted to a cushy desk job at the pentago.

However, if you've flown 99 missions without acieveing the rank of Brigadier
General, and very few do, you'll be retired from combat and posted to the Army
Aviation Center at Ft. Rucker, Alabama as a pilot instructor.

MIA: If you helicopter goes down behind enemy lines, there's a chance you'll
be lost or captured. As a result, you'll be classified as "Missing in Action".

KIA: If your helicopter suffers a catastrophic crash there's a change you
won't walk away from it. As a result, you'll be classified as "Killed in
Action".

Campaigns: If your pilot and flight are currently engaged in a campaign, that
information is displayed. Campaigns must be resolved before any other mission
(except training) can be flown.

New Pilot: If you are creating a new pilot, you must permanently erase an
existing pilot from the Duty Roster; so be careful who you select for erasure.
An "Erase Me" pilot has been provided for your first entry.

Position the cursor over the "Erase Me" pilot and press Selector #2; follow
the instructions to enter your name and select your squadron insignia and its
nickname. Notice that your pilot's name and unit are now listed at the top of
the Duty Roster. All new pilots start out at the rank of WOC.

Leave the cursor positioned over your new pilot (the corresponding data is
displayed in the top section) and press Selector #1.

                                                                  [Page  27]

Existing Pilot: If you don't want to create a new pilot and want to continue
the career of an "Active" pilot, position the cursor over that pilot and press
Selector #1.


Type of Flight

Position the cursor over the duty officer's desk (he is sitting in the
foreground) and press Selector #1.

The open folder displays the available mission options:

Traingin: These missions are conducted at the training center, and are
constructed to simulate the Theaters of Duty. The opposing forces are always
positioned in the same manner so that various weapons and tactics can be
tested.

Training missions simulate all helicopter operations with the following
exceptions:

No Damage: You can't be hurt, as all of the opposing shots are simulated, and
you walk away from all crash landings. However, the opposing weaons do behave
normally, so you can still practice defensive measures.

Career Record: The Training mission does not count as a mission flown; you
don't receive any score, promotion or decorations for heroism and valor.

Training missions can be flown at any time during a pilot's career, and, in
fact, are the only alternative mission type that can be selected if a pilot is
currently engaged in a Campaign. New pilots are not required to select
Training, but if you do, at least you'll receive quick promotion to W01 and
the NDS medal.

Single Helicopter: These missions send you out in a single helicopter against
a real opposing force. While any pilot can fly these missions, pilots of any
Warrant Officer rank are limited to Single Helicopter Missions.

During Single Helicopter missions, you're assigned a Primary, and more than
likely, a Secondary mission. These missions can either be Point Attack or
Search & Destroy.

Point Attack: You're directed to a specific target or targets with the
objective to eliminate the targets.

Search & Destroy: The specific location of the targets is unknown or the
targets are moving. You need to search the area described in your orders to

                                                                  [Page  28]

find the target units with the objective to eliminate them.

Flight: Once you have received your commission (ranks of Second Liutenant and
above), you are then eligible to command a multiple-helicopter flight. The
other pilots in your flight are assigned to you from the force pool, and stay
with you for the duration.

As with Single Helicopter missions, you're assigned overall missions. The
missions include the two described above plus Deep Strike, Tactical Support,
Search & Rescue and Recon.

Deep Strike: You're directed to a target or targets deep in enemy territory,
far from your home base. We take care of getting you to the "passage point",
but you must take it from there.

Tactical Support: You're called upon to pick-up or deliver troops or supplies
to the battle area. There may also be wounded in need of immediate evacuation.
While these "beans and bullets" missions may seem less sexy, they are none the
less important. Besides, you may have to fight your way in and out. A UH-60K/L
Blackhawk must be on tap to successfully complete these missions.

Search & Rescue: Friendly forces are in need of extraction, but must first be
located. Not unlike Search & Destroy missions, but don't take any shots at
these guys. The UH-60K/L Blackhawk must be on tap to successfully complete
these missions.

Recon: The scouts lead the way here, as you're ordered to see what's out
there. The OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, AH-66A Comanche or AH-6G Defender must be on
tap to successfully complete these missions.

Campaign: This is a theatre-wide commitment for the long haul. You're placed
in a situation of continous combat where mission after mission is thrown at
you and your flight.

Who knows how long it will last; there's no set schedule in combat. While you
can't win the campaign on your own, your success (or failure) does have an
impact on its ultimate outcome.

                                                                  [Page  29]

Theater of Duty

If you are a new pilot, it's best to choose Training as your first flight. In
any case, position the cursor over the desired mission type and press
Selector #1.

Position the cursor over the world map located on the right wall and press
Selector #1.

At this time, there are two theaters of operation available:

Persian Gulf: No pushovers here. The Iraqis are a well equipped foe. They
possess a high degree of commitment and won't easily waiver. Additionally,
flying in desert conditions presents a whole different set of factors.

As an added attraction, you and your flight may be call upon to stage from
Amphibious Assault Ships located in the nearby waters. Your skill and special
training aptly qualify you for this duty.

Central Europe: This reagion is the greatest challenge since you are up
against the best the Soviet Union has to offer. They may be down, but they're
not yet out. The region remains very unstable; the history books are yet to be
written on what could transpire.

Additional Theaters: Gunship 2000 supports add-on theaters and their related
forces and equipment. A number of potential areas are currently under
consideration.

Make your selection by positioning the cursor in the box outlining the theater
and press Selector #1.


Squadron Archives

While not an integral component of the mission selection process, the Squadron
Archives certainly come into play over the course of a pilot's career. These
records are kept in the filing cabinet located just beneath the Theater Map.

Mission Films: Position the cursor over the top drawer and press Selector #1;
this drawer contains the saved mission replay films. During mission debriefing
you're given the opportunity to save the mission replay for later viewing.

Positioning the cursor over a film title and pressing Selector #1, selects the
film - press play to replay the film.

                                                                  [Page  30]

You may also exchange mission films with your friends - this way you can show
them what real pilots do in their spare time.

Duty Roster: Position the cursor over the bottom drawer and press Selector #1;
this drawer contains the pre-mission Duty Roster.

We've all been in the situation where a single mistake has resulted in a life
ending crash, or at the very least fast-tracked our careers to oblivion. This
always seems to happen when we're just on the verge of a major promotion.

In the past, quick reboots or DOS copies of the roster were the only
alternatives around this dilemma. Now you can use this option to restory the
Duty Roster to its state just prior to the last mission flown. Its like the
mission never happened - we all need a few breaks once in a while.

One warning - you must actually fly the mission before you can restore the
Duty Roster; this doesn't save you from the stigma of refusing to fly a
mission.


Exiting Brigade HQ

You're now ready to attend the mission briefing. Before you leave, make one
last scan of the screen to verify your selections; once you leave, you're 
committed.

When ready, position the cursor over the door marked "Exit" and press Selector
#1.


Mission Briefing

Depending upon the Theater selected, you now find yourself in simple
surroundings among the lush green hills of Central Europe or on the stark
sands of the Persian Gulf. As a matter of course in the Persian Gulf, you may
also find yourself in the ready room of an Amphibious Assault Ship.

There are three "action areas" located at various positions around the screen.


Mission Orders

The top page of your Mission Orders is just visible at the bottom of the
screen. Position the cursor on the page and press Selector #1.

These four pages not only detail the upcoming mission, but also provide
important intelligence data about the opposing forces. It's very important to
read your orders carefully. Press Selector #1 to leaf through the paes.

                                                                  [Page  31]

Call Sign: It's based on the phonetic military alphabet; you're always number
"1".

Primary Mission: This is the "primary" reason this mission exists, and why
you're being sent out. Make sure that you understand the components of the
primary and its requirements for completion. Its general location is indicated
on the mission map with a "P".

Secondary Mission: More than likely, a "secondary" is also assigned; its
presentation is the same as your Primary. Although classified a Secondary
Mission, it's still important. You can complete it first, but don't forget the
primary. The Secondary Mission's general location is indicated on the mission
map with an "S".

Base: This is where you will start and finish the mission. Its location is
indicated on the mission map with a "B".

Note that on Deep Strike missions, your base is somewhere off the mission map.
You start on the edge of the world at the "Passage Point"; this is expressed
as two coordinate values. This is the only safe exit from the mission.

FARP: If a "FARP" is available, its location is indicated on the mission map
with an "F". You may land at a FARP to replenish fuel and weapons.

S-2 Report: The S-2 gives you his best estimate (guess?) about the opposing
force's equipment. Pay special attention to the availability of opposing
helicopters.

Conditions: The meteorological section gives you a brief report on the
expected weather conditions in the flight area. How these conditions affect
flying is dependent upon the flight switch settings.

Mission Map: This is the flight area for the current mission. All of the key
points of interest are indicated on the map.

Please note that the map coordinates are read military fashion, "right & up".
The first number listed is on the horizontal scale, and the second on the
vertical scale. For example, 00/16 is in the upper left corner. Remember that
maps are never 100% accurate. This is especially true of ground unit and
mobile base sightings.

                                                                  [Page  32]

Decline Mission: In the event you really don't want to fly this mission, you
can opt to pass it along to someone else and request new orders. If currently
engaged in a campaign, this page provides the mechanism to suspend or abort
the campaign and return to Brigade HQ.

To review the Mission Orders, you may sequentially leaf through the pages any
number of times. After review, position the cursor over the envelope and press
Selector #1.


Outfit Helicopters

The squadron armorer routinely places the recommended helicopters, with
ordnance, on the flightline. You can accept his recommendations or change
any or all of the helicopters and ordnance. To review, position the cursor
over the helicopters in the background and press Selector #1.

This provides a complete overview of the pilot assignments, helicopters and
their respective ordnance. From this screen, you may shift the pilots and/or
helicopters to other positions and also assign sectioon leaders.


Outfit Summary

Swap Pilots: Position the cursor anywhere in the first pilot's summary section
and press the p (Swap Pilots) key; the pilot's outline now starts to flash.
Position the cursor in the second pilot's summary section and again press the
p (Swap Pilots) key. There's just one restriction, you must occupy the #1
position. After all, you're the flight leader.

Swap Helicopters: Position the cursor anywhere in the first helicopter's
summary section and press the h (Swap Helicopters) key; the helicopter's
outline now starts to flash. Position the cursor in the second helicopter's
summary section and again press the h (Swap Helicopters) key.

Duplicate Helicopters: Position the cursor anywhere in the first helicopter's
summary section and press the d (duplicate helicopters) key; the helicopter's
outline now starts to flash. Position the cursor in the second helicopter's
summary section and again press the d (duplicate helicopters) key.

Section Leaders: Your flight may be organized or "sectioned" into one section
of five or into two smaller sections. The section of three is the "Heavy

                                                                  [Page  33]

Section"; the other section of two is the "Light Section". Sections fly as a
single group, which greatly facilitates flight commands.

You're always a section leader; the pilots occupying positions #3 and #4 may
alternately be assigned as a section leader. Position the cursor anywhere in
the pilot's summary section and press the l (Assign Section Leader) key.

The Heavy Section is identified by a blue band and the Light Section by a grey
band.

Return to the Mission Briefing screen when satisfied with the mix, but first,
read on.

If you want to change a helicopter's ordnance, or change the actual
helicopter, position the cursor anywhere in the helicopter's summary section
and press Selector #1. The Arming Screen displays the current helicopter along
with its ordnance.


Arming

Weapons: A brief description of each weapon displays at the upper right; for a
more complete description see pages 67-68.

To select a weapon, highlight it and press Selector #1; then select the
appropriate option among those available. Existing weapons can be directly
replaced; the existing weapon doesn't need to be first removed.

Most helicopter weapons are balance loaded; whenever you add or subtract a
weapon to one position, its twin automatically loads on the opposite wing. The
Defender and Kiowa Warrior are exceptions; their pylons can carry different
weapons.

Fuel Highlight "Fuel" and press Selector #1. Expressed as a factor of 100%,
fuel is increased or decreased as desired. While it's real tempting to trade
fuel for weapons, don't leave yourself short; it's very embarrassing if you
have to walk back.

Ammo: This only applies to helicopters with integral cannons or machine-guns.

                                                                  [Page  34]

Highlight "Ammo" and press Selector #1. Ammo is loaded to the maximum, or any
lesser amount.

Chaff/Flares: Highlight "Chaff/Flares" and press Selector #1. A mix of 60 
chaff & flares are carried.

Load: All helicopters are rated for a maximum load capacity; this value is
expresed as a factor of 100%. Theater and weather conditions affect the
maximum load capacity of a helicopter. It decreases as temperature and
humidity increase, and is further reduced by low atmospheric pressure. Load
capacity is also reduced at higher altitudes as air becomes thinner as
altitude increases.

The load capacity is automatically calculated for each helicopter, but of
course, varies by the theater and mission conditions. As you change weapons or
increase/decrease Fuel or Ammo (the chaff & flare mix doesn't impact load) the
load capacity changes. You can load ordnance in excess of 100%, but the load
must be 100% or less before you exit the arming sequence.

A load of less than 100% is desirable since more reserve power is then
available.

Change Helicopter: Highlight "Change Helicopter" and press Selector #1. Select
the new helicopter by highlighting it and pressing Selector #1. New
helicopters always arrive on the flightline "clean" (without ordnance).

Return to the Outfit Summary screen when satisfied with the mix; highlight
"Ordnance Complete" and press Selector #1.


Exiting Mission Briefing

You're ready to start the mission. Position the cursor over the map and press
Selector #1.

Note that during campaigns, this map is used to advise you of the current
state of a campaign. The degree of victory or defeat is indicated by how far
the blue side (friendly) or the red side (opposing) has advanced beyond the
original front line.


Cockpit Switches

You preflight, or set, the Cockpit Switches to determine the overall "reality"
or difficulty of the upcoming mission. Many different switch combinations
allow you to tailor the settings to your own particular needs. You must also

                                                                  [Page  35]

enter the GPS Authenticator Code to activate on-board systems.

There are nine "action areas" located at various positions around the screen.
The "Data Display" in the upper right corner displays a brief description of
each switch whenever an action area is accessed. Change switch settings by
positioning the cursor over the switch and pressing Selector #1.


CP/G Controls

This assign duties to your invisible CP/G, and enables you to concentrate on
other activities.

Weapons/C.M.: The CP/G automatically fires all weapons. The CP/G additionally
activates the appropriate countermeasures systems as needed.

C.M.: The GP/G controls just the C.M. systems.

None: You control all weapon/C.M. systems.

While the CP/G does an adequate job, you will eventually want to control all
systems yourself.


Enemy Quality

This determines the competency level and training of the opposing forces. It
has a direct correlation with how quickly an opposing unit can achieve a lock
on your helicopter, and the relative accuracy of its weapons. Units of lower
quality are also more reluctant to pursue an objective in the face of stiff
resistance.

Poor: These guys are best described as rabble. A civilian force could probably
do just as well. Not much to worry about here, you can mop up these troops 
with no trouble. A good first opponent for new pilots. 

Average: These are your basic every day troops. Certainly not exemplary, but
at least they're not the bottom of the barrel.

Crack: Now we're starting to talk competence. These guys know their business,

                                                                  [Page  36]

and are a real challenge. They are agressive and clever. Don't assume anything

Elite: The Best of the best. Not much more need be said about these troops.
They go to any lenghts to accomplis their objectives or to stop you from
accomplishing yours. You need to be exceptionally quick and skillful to get
the upper hand.


Flight

This switch sets the flight mode parameters of your helicopter.

Easy: The pitch, roll, altitude and airspeed of the helicopter have no effect
on lift. No matter how you maneuver the cyclic (joystick), lift, and therefore
your altitude is unaffected. The collective is the only control that affects
lift/altitude.

Realistic: Here the pitch, roll, altitude and airspeed affect lift as in a 
real helicopter.


Landings

This switch sets the difficulty level or "forgiveness" associated with your
landing attempts.

No Crashes: All landings are perfect.

Realistic: Landings need to be within the design specifications of the
helicopter; if not, damage or destruction could result. Easy does it.


Avoidance

This switch turns the on-board collision avoidance system on or off.

On: The helicopter automatically avoids all intervening terrain features,
thereby preventing instant destruction on hillsides. The system avoids the
objects by gaining altitude, so don't deliberately fly at tall mountains; it
can't protect you from bullets.

Off: You're on your own, so keep alert. The radar altimeter is probably your
best freind.


Wind

This switch activates or deactivates wind effects

No Wind: The flight conditions are calm and serene.

Realistic: The wind is blowing across the battle field at the velocity and
bearing indicated in the Mission Orders. Your helicopter displaces an equal
amount to the wind.

                                                                  [Page  37]

Visibility

This switch's setting determines the probability of naturally occuring (fog,
rain, etc.) or man-made conditions (smoke) obscuring visibility or limiting
the effectiveness of visiononics equipment.

Clear: Visibility is unlimited.

Realistic: Visibility can be limited by battlefield obscurants.


Difficulty

The combination of theater, mission type and switch settings determines the
overall difficulty level of the upcoming mission. The higher the difficulty
level, the greater the challenge, but the potential reward is heightened.

The "Difficulty" indicator provides a visual gauge of the difficulty level.
When fully illuminated, the mission is of extreme difficulty. The indicator is
unilluminated, regardless of the settings, for Training Missions, as no score
is awarded.
                                                       
                                                  
GPS System

Located in the center of the screen is the "GPS Consol". Position the cursor
over this area. After the Data Display describes the Console's function it
then displays the GPS Cipher as it appeared in your Mission Orders.
                                                          
You were shown a Squadron Insignia along with a five digit number. These
insignia and numbers are found between pages 21 & 60 of this manual. Find the
corresponding five digit Authenticator Code, and enter this number by
pressing the appropriate numeric keys.

If the correct code is entered, the GPS Console will display "Signal Locket".
You're ready to start the mission.

If you can't find the correct code, you can still fly the mission, but the on-
board GPS Map are disabled along with your weapons.


APU

Now position the cursor over the "Aux Power Unit" switch. This switch is used
to start the helicopter's engines and begin the mission. It has a safety cover
so that it won't be inadvertently activated; it requires two keystrokes to
activate. Press Selector #1, and the safety cover flips up. Press Selector #1
again, and the power starts to wind-up.
                                        
                                                                  [Page  38]
                                                                
SIMULATION CONTROLS AND VIEWS
                                                  

Simulation Controls

A number of commands are available to control "overhead" or various game
functions. While these commands can be utilized at any time, some relate to
specific functions, and have no effect.


Pause

Press the Pause (alt p) key to immediately freeze the action. Some computers
have specific "pause" or "hold" keys. Depending on the internal design of your
computer, these keys may also work. Pause is only effective during flight.


Joystick Adjust

Gunship 2000 supports either a joystick or the keyboard for all game
functions. If you're using a joystick, the keyboard also remains active.

If your joystick seems to be "drifting", press the Joystick Adjust (alt j) key
with the joystick centered, to re-calibrate.


Detail Adjust

If you have a slower computer, you may use the Detail Adjust (alt d) key to
access the selection menu. The simpler detail levels increase the processing
speed. The action is temporarily suspended when making the selections.


Quit to Dos

Press the Quit (alt q) key to immediately end the simulatoin and return the
system to DOS. No information, including current scores or settings, is saved
to disk. Scores and settings are automatically saved at the completion of each
mission, so only the current data is affected.


End Mission

Press the End Mission (alt e) key to end the current mission. The computer
projects the current situation into the immediate future, and determines the
results. Therefore, you can't use this key to escape from impending disaster;
and the result do count as a mission flown.


Volume Adjust

The Volume Adjust (alt v) key accesses the sound effects selection menu. The
action is temporarily suspended when making the selections.


Co-Pilot Sound

Your invisible co-pilot communicates system status and threat/target
information to you via digitized sound. While these prompts are quite helpful,
there's a price to pay in computer processing speed. If you find your system
slowing too dramatically, pressing the Co-Pilot Sound (alt c) key turns these
sound off.

                                                                  [Page  39]

Last Message

The other section leader or pilots communicate with you during the course of a
mission. These messages stay visible for only a short period of time. If for
some reason you are unable to review an entire message (you could be busy with
some bad guys of your own), pressing the Last Message (alt m) key re-displays
the text.


Cockpit Style

In addition to the processing speed gained by adjusting the detail, the style
of the cockpit can be adjusted to increase performance. Press the Cockpit
Style (alt s) key to access the selection menu. The action is temporarily
suspended when making the selection.


Accelerate Time

Press the Accelerate Time (]) key to increase the rate at which time passes,
therefore increasing the speed of your flight. This is variable setting of 16
levels. Each successive press of the key increases the speed one level. This
function is best used in combination with auto-pilot mode.


Normal Time

Press the Normal Time ([) key to immediately return to normal time; it can't
reduce the rate to less than normal time. Flight automatically returns to
normal time whenever a target is sighted or upon reaching the final waypoint.


Simulation Views

Gunship 2000 offers a number of different points of view while flying. You can
jump from inside the cockpit to a point of view outside or even ride a
Hellfire into its target.


From-the-Cockpit Views

These views are from inside of the cockpit looking out. These are your "true"
views.

Cockpit (F1): This is your normal from the cockpit view. From this you see the
gauges and controls ofthe cockpit panel. When engaging in combat, this is the
most advantageous point of view, as you have the aid of the weapon targeting
systems.

Mast (F2): The OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, MD530G Defender and AH-64B Longbow Apache
are equipped with mast mounted sights. They're used to peer over the tops of
obstacles while keeping the body of the helicopter hidden and safe from
opposing eyes and more importantly, opposing weapons.

They're best employed from hover mode (the auto-hover mode holds your
position), as you really can't mask behind terrain in forward flight. When

                                                                  [Page  40]

activated, the controller is utilized to rotate the sight, left or right,
through 360`, not to control helicopter flight.


Left (F3): View from out of the left cockpit window.

Right (F4): View from out of the right cockpit window.


Out-of-Cockpit Views
 
As an aid to flight maneuvers and combat, a variety of external views are
available. In all of them, you're "out-of-the-cockpit" looking at your
helicopters and/or the targets.

Chase (F5): You're positioned just behind your helicopter, looking past it at
whatever lies ahead. You maintain this perspective no matter how the
helicopter is maneuvered.

Flight Chase View (shift F5): You're positioned just behind one of your
pilot's helicopters looking past it at whatever lies ahead. You maintain this
perspective no matter how the helicopter is maneuvered. Press the key again to
shift your view to the next helicopter.

Tactical View (F6): You're positioned just behind your helicopter, looking
past it at the target. This view automatically rotates and pans to keep both
the helicopter and targetin view.

This view is helpful when engaging air targets, and is also useful if you want
to return for a second or third pass at a ground target. It's probably wise to
return to the cockpit before firing, so as not to waste ammunition.

Remote View (F7): You're positioned just off from your helicopter; your
helicopter continues its flight. This view automatically rotates and pans to
keep your helicopter in view. It's not unlike the view of a radio-controlled
flight.

Additionally, by pressing and holding Selector #2 and adjusting the controller
you can shift your point of view. Holding Selector #2 maintains that point of
view.

Reverse Tactical View (F8): You're positioned just behind your helicopter's
target, looking past it at your own helicopter. The target can either be an
air or ground unit - whatever you're locked on. In either case, the target is
in the foreground, and your helicopter is in the distance. In fact, it may

                                                                  [Page  41]

only be a dot in the sky. This view automatically rotates and pans to keep
both the target and your helicopter in view.

Experienced pilots find this a very dramatic view when making attack runs at
ground targets. It's a great view to showoff, but keep in mind that your
helicopter is still flying; don't crash into a hill while admiring the view.

Missile View (F9): You're positioned directly behind the weapon just
launched. This view is very entertaining, as you follow the weapon directly
into the target. If you're having trouble understanding why your weapons are
missing, switching to this view can be very helpful.


Map View

When the Map View (F10) key is pressed, the GPS map aapears. Your helicopter
won't crash while you're viewing the map, since the action is suspended.

The GPS map displays the entire world in which you're flying in low and high
scales. The high scale map is the default display. Not that it matches the
map provided in your Mission Orders.

This map displays the positions of all friendly units and the positions of
sighted opposing units. Current sighting display in bright red, while old
sightings display in dark red. Remember that the opposing forces may be moving
so don't rely on old sightings. Icons are used to mark the sightings.
                                                               
                                                                  [Page  42]

The different terrain features are depicted on the high scale maps. These come
in many shapes and sizes, and vary from world-to-world. Terrain is the number
one defensive measure. Get familiar with the different terrain types, and use
them to your advantage.

Press the spacebar to switch to the low scale mode. The low scale maps depict
specific terrain features. Where the large scale map indicates a mountain
group, the small scale map depicts the actualy mountains of the group. The
displayed area is scrolled by moving the Controller in any direction. A
reduced versoin of the large scale map displays in the upper right corner; the
yellow indicater "boxes" the display area. Press the spacebar to return to the
high scale map, or the esc key to return to flight mode.

Flight Controls
                                               
A number of controls and flying aids are available to you as a pilot. The
following describes and defines how each works; but do not use this section as
a guide to flying, see "How to Fly", pages 53-59.

                                                                  
Cyclic Stick
                                   
Pushing the Joystick (up Arrow) forward pitches the helicopter's nose down.
Pulling the Joystick (down arrow) back pitches the helicopter's nose up.
Pushing the Joystick left (left arrow) or right (right arrow) rolls the 
helicopter in that direction.

A downward pitch moves the helicopter forard; a large down pitch causes a
faster dive in Realistic Flight mode. An upward pitch moves the helicopter
backwards.

Rolling the helicopter left or right at extremely low speeds (under 10 knots)
causes the helicopter to rotate left or right. At low speed (under 40 knots),
it causes a skid or "sideslip" left or right. At medium or high speed, it
causes a banking turn left or right.

The Artificial Horizon Gauge shows the current pitch and roll of helicopter.


Collective

Lift keeps the helicopter airborne. In level flight, increasing the collective
causes the helicopter to ascend, while decreasing the collective causes the
helicopter to descen. The current level of the collective is measured as
"torque". When raising or lower the collective, the engine torque/throttle is
automatically adjusted.

To raise or lower the collective, press the Collective Up (=) or the
Collective Down (-) keys respectively. To raise or lower the collective fast,
press the shift Collection (= or -) keys.

The Torque Gauge indicates the current level of torque.
                            

Gear

Press the Gear (3) key (AH-66a Comanche only) to toggle your landing gear up
or down. Flying with the gear down not only reduces airspeed, it increases the
radar cross-section.

The Gear Indicator Light is illuminated when it's down.

                                                                  [Page  44]
                          
Autopilot

Press the Autopilot (5) keys to engage or disengage the autopilot. When
engaged, it flies you to the "active" INS waypoint; if no waypoints are set,
the autopilot doesn't engage. When engaged, the autopilot locks in your
current altitude and speed. However, if your altitude is less than the Low
Limit, the Auto-Pilot climbs the helicopter to that altitude. If the cyclic
stick is moved in any direction, the autopilot automatically disengages.

The autopilot Indicator Light illuminates when it's engaged.

Warning: the autopilot doen't avoid hills or obstacles (unless Collision
Avoidance is engaged); it flies a straight line from waypoint to waypoint.


Next Waypoint

Press the Next Waypoint (6) key to immediately switch to the next waypoint.
This can be selected while the autopilot is engaged.


Previous Waypoint

Press the Previous Waypoint (7) key to immediately switch to the previous
waypoint. This can be selected while the autopilot is engaged.


Bay Open/Close

Press the Bay Open/Close (8) key (AH-66A Comanche only) to open or close the
weapons bay. The Comanche's interval weapons, except for the 20mm cannon, can
only fire when the bay is open. However, when open, it increases the radar 
cross-section.

The Bay Indicator Light is illuminated when it's open.


Rotor Engage/Disengage

Press the Rotor Engage/Disengage (9) key to engage the rotor (cause the
engines to turn the rotor), or disengage the rotor (cause the rotor to spin
freely, unconnected from the engines) When it's disengaged, the collective is
automatically "bottomed" (set to zero).

The Rotor Status Light indicates if the rotor is engaged (green) or disengaged
(red). The light flashes red if you attempt to add collective with the rotor
disengaged.


Auto-Hover

When flying at a speed from +10 to -10 knots, pressing the Auto-Hover (0) key
automatically places the helicopter in hover mode; your speed is automatically
reduced to zero. The collective controls can be used normally, but auto-hover
doesn't allow the altitude to drop below the Low Limit. Therefore, you can't
land with auto-hover engaged. If the cyclic stick is moved forward or back
(you may still rotate left or right), auto-hover automatically disengages.

                                                                  [Page  45]

The auto-hover Indicator Light illuminates when it's engaged; it flashes
when engaged at too high a speed.

Auto-hover is very useful to maintain a position during windy conditions or
to unmask and quickly mask from cover. You can drop altitude like a rock, 
since auto-hover holds you at the Low Limit Altitude.


One or Left MFD

Press the One of Left MFD (z) key to change the information displayed in a
single or left hand MFD. Helicopters with a single MFD have five possible
displays: navigation (heading & waypoint data), low scale map, mission orders,
weapons status or target camera. The target camera automatically displays,
overriding any other display, whenever a lock-on occurs.

Helicopters with two MFD's add a sixth option - threat display.


Right MFD

Press the Right MFD (x) key to chenge the information displayed in the right
hand MFD. Helicopters so equipped have six possible displays: navigation
(heading & waypoint data), low scale map, mission orders, weapons status,
target camera or threat display. The threat display automatically displays,
overriding any other display, whenever a target is detected.


Low Limit -

Press the Low Limit - (c) key to decrease the low altitude limit by 50 feet;
it can not be reduced below 50 feet. Both the barometric and radar altimeters
utillize the low limit setting as the bases for low altitude warnings. Audio
and visual indicators are activated whenever the altitude falls below the low
limit.

In addition to its function as a flying aid, the low limit is used to set the
flying altitude of independent helicopters and/or sections.


Low Limit +

Press the Low Limit + (v) key to increase the low altitude limit by 50 feet;
it can not be raised above 250 feet.


WEAPON CONTROLS


A number of weapon controls are available. The following describes and defines
how each works. Do not use this section as a guide to combat, see "How to
Fight", pages 60-73.


Rocket Salvo x1,x2,x4

Press the Rocket Salvo x1,x2 or x4 (1,2,4) keys to set the number of Hydra 70
unguided rockets that will be fired from each wing pod whenever "rockets" are
selected and Selector #1 is pressed. Rockets are fired symmetrically from
both wing pods, except for the Kiowa Warrior and Defender. The salvo mode is
shown in the Weapons Display.

                                                                  [Page  46]

Acquire/Next Target

Press the Acquire/Next Target (back space) key to lock onto a target or to 
switch the current lock-on. Normally, the targeting system automatically locks
onto the nearest target; this enables you to switch to an alternate target.

If no other targets are present, the lock-on remains with the current target.
The target system toggles through the potential targets from nearest to
farthest.


Radar Jammer On/Off

Press the Radar Jammer On/Off (n) key to toggle the radar on, if currently off
or off, if currently on. When the radar jammer is active, a green light
illuminates next to the "R" warning indicator.


Drop Chaff

Press the Drop Chaff (m) key to release a chaff decoy.


IR Jammer On/Off (.) key to toggle the IR on, if currently off, or off, if
currently on. When the IR Jammer is active, a green light illuminates next to
the "I" warning indicator.


Drop Flare

Press the Drop Flare (/) key to release a flare decoy.


Select Weapon

Press Selector #2 to change the active weapon; the active weapon, along with
the vailable quantity, is shown in the Weapons Indicator.


Fire Weapon

Press Selector #1 to fire the active Weapon. Most weapons are fired/launched
singly; each time Selector #1 is pressed, one round is fired. However, rockets
are fired in salvos and cannons & machine-guns fire in multiple-round bursts.

                                                                  [Page  47]


HELICOPTER GAUGES AND INDICATORS


AH-64A/B Apache

This guage, along with its digital readout, shows your horizontal speed
through the air in knots. A speed of 100 kts equals about 114 mph, or about
161 kph.


Airspeed Gauge

This gauge, along with its digital readout, is your barometric altimeter; it
shows your true altitude in feet. It's adjusted for you to compensate for
ground elevation variances so that "0" altitude is always at ground level.


Artificial Horizon

This ball guage shows your pitch (nose up or down) and your roll (left or
right).


Autopilot

The "P" illuminates whenever the autopilot is engaged.


Auto-Hover

The "H" illuminates whenever auto-hover is engaged.


Compass

The analog compass, along with its digital readout, indicates your current
heading. Note that the compass shows the heading your helicopter faces. 
During skids or backwards flight, your actual course is different.


Chaff and Flare Indicator

This indicator shows the number of defensive stores remaining. Its shown as
chaff "CF" and flares "FL". Each defensive unit is released as a group of
three cartridges.


Engine Gauge

The left and right strips in the guage marked "E" show the RPM's of the port
(left) and starboard (right) engines.


Fuel Gauge

The gauge marked "F" shows the amount of fuel remaining in all tanks.


HUD

The HUD (head-up display) projects bright numbers and symbols ahead of your 
view so that you can simultaneously read the display and look ahead.

The left scale indicates your airspeed along with a symbolic representation of
the artificial horizon.

The right side scale combines the radar altimeter with the vertical speed
indicator (see below). The radar altimeter is probably the most important
indicator you have, so pay close attention to it. It indicates your actual
height over ground. There's an important distinction between this and the 
standard altimeter. As you fly over obstacles your true altitude remains
constant, but the height over ground changes. This can be the difference

                                                                  [Page  48]

between crashing or surviving. The red band at the lower end of the scale is
low limit.

The top scale is your heading along with the INS and target lock-on pips.


INS Indicator

The INS (Inertial Navigation System) indicator indicates your course to your
current waypoint. The top fixed pip is your heading, while the bottom pip is
the waypoint. If it's right of center, turn to theright; if it's left of
center, turn to the left. The waypoint course is also indicated digitally.


MFD

The MFD has five possible displays: navigation (heading & waypoint data), low
scale map, mission orders, weapon status or target camera.


Rotor Light

The light is green when the main rotor is engaged. The light is red when the
main rotor is disengaged, i.e. spinning freely, unconnected to the engines.


Systems Status Lights

These lights show the status of major systems on board your helicopter. A
green light means the system is functioning normally; a yellow means the
system is damaged and malfuntioning; a read light means the system is knocked-
out and off-line.

The abbrevations represent:

AVN: Avionics (gauges, defensive measures)
CAN: integral cannon
FUL: fuel tanks
OPT: optics (targeting systems)
PTE: port engine
PTW: port weapons wing
RTR: Main Rotor
SBE: starboard engine
SBW: starboard weapons wing
TAL: tail rotor (flight stability)


Threat Display

This screen shows nearby targets that can potentially threaten your helicopter
Red dots are opposing units, grey dots are non-threatening units or structures
blue dots are enemy aircraft, and yellow dots are missiles in flight. This
includes both opposing missiles AND your missiles. The white flashing dot is
your present target.

The threat display automatically scales from short to long range (short range
will override long range).

                                                                  [Page  49]

Page 49 contains a picture of the Cockpit Screen (If i had a scanner, i would
Scan this picture cause it displays all the indicators and what they are etc.)
Oh and btw it's the AH-64A/B Apache Cockpit Screen it says here...

                                                                  [Page  50]

Torque Gauge

The strip shows the amount of torque in the turbine engine(s). This is
proportional to the amount of collective control and rotor lift. The higher
you set the collective, the higher the torque.


VSI

The VSI (vertical speed indicator) shows the rate you are changing altitude
(ascending or descending). If the needle is horizontal, you're maintaining a
constant altitude. If the needle dips downward, you're descending towards the
ground; if it points upward, you're ascending. The greater the needle varies
from horizontal, the greater the altitude change.


Warning Indicators and Jammers

The "R" warning light flashes red whenever a search radar "sweeps" over your
helicopter. When tracking (firing) radar for either guns or missiles locks
onto your helicopter, the light turns solid red. If you turn on your radar
jammer, the neighboring light turns green while the jammer is running. If the
jamming is successful, the solid red warning light turns off.

Note: your jammer can't suppress radar searches, so flashing red warnings may
continue even if your jammer is active. If you leave the jammer active they'll
eventually "read" your frequency and overcome the jamming.

The "I" warning light turns solid red whenever an infrared (IR) homing weapon
is approaching your helicopter. If you turn on your IR jammer, the neighboring
light turns green while the jammer is running. If the jamming is successful,
the solid red warning light turns off.

While the radar jammer can remain on, the IR jammer eventually "times out"
due to heat. It must cool down again to become effective.

Note: there aren't any active IR search devices, IR search is passive,
therefore there's no flashing red "IR" warning.

The "L" warning light turns solid red whenever your helicopter is being
illuminated by a laser ranging or targeting device. At the present time, laser
jammers are still on the drawing boards. So, find the source and get it before
it gets you or get out of Dodge quick.


Weapons Indicator

The weapons indicator shows the active weapon, its position on the helicopter,
and quantity of rounds remaining. For rockets, it also indicates the current
salvo setting.

                                                                  [Page  51]

AH-66A COMANCHE

The Comanche cockpit is dominated by electronic systems, and aptly fits the
trend towards total digital display. The first thing you notice is the lack of
analog indicators (except for the compass).


Airspeed and Altimeter

The airspeed (ASI) and altimeter (ALT) data are both digitally represented.
Next to the altimeter is the VSI icon; it indicates ascending, descending and
neutral altitude change modes.


Gear

The status retractable landing gear is indicated by the gear ("G") light; it's
illuminated when it's down. You can flyy with the gear in the down position,
but speed is reduced and the radar cross-section is increased. Landings are
impossible with the gear in the up position.


Bay

The status of the weapons bay is indicated by the bay ("B") light; it's
illuminated when the bay is open. Internal weapons, except for the 20mm
cannon, can't fire when the bay is closed. However, when open, it increases 
the radar cross-section.


Other Displays

The remaining indicators, displays and HUD function in a similar manner to
the Apaches.


THE REMAINING HELICOPTERS

Although their cockpit layouts differ from the Apaches, the gauges, indicators
and HUD in the other helicopters function exactly like the Apaches. Just
familiarize yourself with the unique layouts; the "look" of the gauges and
indicators has been standardized for ease of use.

                                                                  [Page  52]

Page 52 contains a pic of the AH-66A Comanche Cockpit Screen.

                                                                  [Page  53]

HOW TO FLY

Helicopters are very complex flying machines. One wonders how a machine so
angular and ungraceful could ever get off the ground. In flight, they look
like a mass of whirling blades. Yet, helicopters do fly - and fly well for
that matter; but, the controls are quite different from a conventional 
airplane. 

It's often said that the real pilots fly helicopters; the other guys just
dabble at flying.

Remember just one thing - DON'T OVERCONTROL! Helicopter controls are sluggish;
they react slowly. Even the most responsive helicopter (like the Comanche)
takes a couple of seconds to respond to your control movements.

Be gentle with the controls. After each control movement, watch for the result
before you do anything else. Numerous fast, radical control movements produce
unexplainable results and possibly a crash!

The most common error in helicopter flight is to over-control by pulling or
pushing hard on the cyclic or pressing too long on a key.

The emphasis is on realistic flight, since that's the most complex. If 
possible, learn to fly in the realistic mode from the beginning; you can
always fall back on the easy mode if the frustration factor gets too high.


GETTING AIRBORNE


Engage the Rotor

Your power is already on line; the APU provided the power to start the 
engines. Press the Rotor Engage/Disengage (9) key to engage the rotor system.
The rotor status light turns green when the rotor is engaged. The rotors now
come up to speed (the sound level increases).

                                                                  [Page  54]

Climb to a Hover

Press the Collective Up Fast (shift =) key until the helicopter starts to
ascend. The torque gauge rises as you "raise" the collective. Press the
Collective Down (-) key if the ascent is too fast. The VSI indicates the rate
of your ascent (the indicator is above horizontal). Let the helicopter ascend
to about 100 feet.

Press the Auto-Hover (0) key anytime your speed is from +10 to -10 knots. It's
very useful to maintain a position during windy conditions or to unmask and
quickly mask from cover.


Rotating in Hover

Push the Cyclic (left or right arrow keys) left or right to rotate the
helicopter in that direction. The speed of rotation is dependent on how far
the Cyclic is pushed (multiple presses of the arrow key). Center the Cyclic
(press the opposite arrow key until rotation stops) to stop the rotation. You
can only rotate the helicopter at speeds under 10 kts.


FLIGHT TECHNIQUES


Forward Flight

Add a little more collective. AS uyou begin climbing, push the Cyclic forward
slightly to "pitch down" the helicopter. You'll begin to move forward. At
about 30 kts, you'll start to climb. Your altimeter and VSI reflect this
change in lift. This is because forward motion in a helicopter adds extra lift
(termed "translational lift"), especially at 30-90 kts.

The further you pitch down, the more your speed increases. As your speed
exceeds 100 kts, tranlational lift deceases. The VSI starts to move to the
negative end of the scale. More pitch downward will push you into a dive.

Easy Flight: Lift is unaffected by forward motion. Your altitude remains
constant, and is therefore independent of the cyclic.


Level Flight

Move the cyclic forward or back until the airspeed reads about 120 kts. Now
check the VSI. If you're descending (the indicator is below horizontal), add
more Collective until the indicator is horizontal. Alternately, if you're
ascending, reduce Collective. When the VSI is horizontal, you're in level
flight.

Due to the slow control response, it's easy to over-correct and add or reduce
the collective too much. You'll constantly "chase the needle", trying to
stabilize your flight. After each adjustment, wait a moment for the VSI to
stabilize.

Easy Flight: These adjustments are unnecessary since lift is unaffected by
forward motion.

                                                                  [Page  55]

Changing Altitude

When flying level (about 120 kts), the easiest way to descend is to push the
Cyclic forward (pitch down) into a dive. As you approach the altitude desired,
gently pull the Cyclic back (pitch up) until the VSI again stabilizes.
Similarly, the easiest way to ascend is to pitch up slightly, reducing
airspeed below 100 kts. When you reach the desired altitude, pitch down again
until the VSI stabilizes. This technique is not unlike conventional airplane
flight. You're able to change altitude without adjusting the collective.

A second way to change altitude, applicable at any speed, is to raise or
lower the collective. When you reach the desired altitude, adjust an opposite
amount of collective to regain level flight. This is the only way to change
altitude from a hover.

Regardless of the technique used, don't try to fly the helicopter by
constantly adjusting the collective. Learn to "feel" the correct collective
setting, and then fly with just your cyclic. This takes time, so be patient.
Even real pilots must practice many long hourse before it's mastered.

Easy Flight: The collective must be used to change your altitude; it's just
like choosing the floors on an elevator.


Low Limit

The low altitude limit is a flying aid that warns you of close ground
proximity. It works in conjunction with the radar altimeter, and is displayed
as a red band on the radar altimeter.


Turning

From a level flight (about 120 kts), move the Cyclic slightly to the left.
Your helicopter rolls into a banking left turn. As you turn, observe the
change in your compass heading. Move the Cyclic further left and bank into a
tight turn; you'll now start to lose lift. Notice that your altitude is 
dropping and the VSI is below horizontal. If you center the Cyclic and level
out, you'll return to level flight.

There are two methods to maintain altitude in a tight turn; this could be very
important at low altitudes. Add some Collective before you start the turn,
then reduce the Collective just before you come out of it.

Alternately, pull up your nose slightly as you enter the turn, then drop it
back down as you come out of the turn. With this method, you can make fast,
banking turns without losing altitude.

                                                                  [Page  56]

At speeds below 40 kts, the helicopter will skit ("sideslip") in the direction
of cyclic movement, rather than bank into the turn; at this point, you're
basically flying sideway.

Easy Flight: Altitude is never lost, no matter how tight the turn. However,
the helicopter will sideslip at speeds below 40 kts.


Turbulence

When flying below 100', you may feel air turbulence. You'll sometimes bounce
up and down, or roll from side to side. The amount of air turbulence varies
with altitude and speed; the faster and lower you fly, the more turbulence you
may experience.


Autorotation

Helicopter crewman can't eject or bailout in times of trouble. However, the
total loss of engine power means only one thing - they must ride the bucking
bronco in.

Fortunately, helicopters have the equivalent of an conventional airplane's
"dead stick" landing. This unpowered method of landing is called
"autorotation".

To begin an autorotation, disengage the rotor. In real life the pilot must
also "bottom" the collective (reduce it to zero), but the collective 
automatically bottoms when you disengage the rotor. This must be done
immediately, or the rotor will slow to a stop (remember it's still engaged to
the now-dead engine). If the rotor stops, you'll fall like a baby grand piano.

Now adjust the pitch until your airspeed is about 70 to 90 kts (maximum
tranlational lift). The rotor is now spinning freely because the airflow keeps
the blades turning. The descent will become quite fast, a bit frightening to
the inexperienced. When you get close to the ground, raise the nose and
simultaneously add Collective. The rotor blades will "bite" into the air,
giving you lift and slowing the descent. Unfortunately, as the blades start to
bite, air resistance slows them down.

You must time the "up collective" so that the helicopter lands gently
(figuratively speaking) before the rotor slows too much. If you raise the
collective too soon, the rotor will stall and you'll be playing the piano
again. If you raise the collective too late, you won't slow your descent and
you'll crash. Nobody said it would be easy - it just takes practice.

Easy Flight: Autorotation is not functional with easy flight. It's best to
set "no crashes" when in this mode.

                                                                  [Page  57]

Flight Envelope

There are "unsafe" speed and altitude situations that, in the event of total
engine failure, will unavoidably result in a crash. These unsafe situations
are considered to be outside of the "flight envelope".

Hovering at altitudes from 25' to 500', or high speed flight below 20' to 30'
will probably result in a crash if engine power is lost. It take a certain
amount of time to convert from normal flight to autorotation. In these
situations, there just isn't enough time to gain control.

However, "unsafe" is a relative term. In combat situations unsafe flying is
probably "safer" than taking a hit. During combat, chances must be taken;
evaluate the situation and make the best decision.


Rules of Engagement

Everyone has rules they must abide by, and this is no different in combat.
Helicopters live and fight near ground level, as high altitude is only safe
for the jet jockeys.

The high command wants to assure that you will have a long and distinguished
career. Therefore, your maximum altitude is restricted to 1000' in all
situations. Any higher, and you'd be a sitting duck. 


NAVIGATION


INS System

Pressing the Map View (F10) key displays the high scale mission map. You can
always fly to specific points by dead reckoning or, more simply, you may input
up to three waypoints into the INS system.

To input waypoints, press the Fly To (F) key; a yellow crosshair appears over
your helicopter. Use the Controller to move the crosshair to any point on the
map, and press Selector #1; waypoint #1 is now marked. Press Selector #2 to
stop with less than three waypoints or continue to mark waypoints #2 and #3.
Press esc, at any time, to cancel the waypoints. Existing waypoints are
automatically cancelled whenever the Fly To (F) key is pressed (esc will
cancel the command).

Because the high scale map is only a representation of the actual terrain, you
may want to "fine-tune" the placement of the waypoints. After all, you
wouldn't want to fly into a mountain. Press the spacebar; the low scale map
appears. Use the Controller to follow the path of the waypoints (each waypoint
is marked with its number). To adjust a waypoint, press its number. It's now
centered in the map display. Use the Controller to adjust its placement; press
Selector #2 when finished.

                                                                  [Page  58]

The current INS heading is the flight path to the "active" waypoint. The
waypoint range and heading can be displayed in the MFD. The Next Waypoint
(6) and Previous Waypoint (7) keys are used to change the active waypoint. To
manually adjust your course, always turn towards the INS pip.

Press the Autopilot (5) key at anytime to engage the autopilot. When engaged,
it flies you to the "active" INS waypoint.


Wind and Weather

When flying during windy conditions, the same considerations that apply to an
airplane apply to helicopters. Namely, the wind will increase your speed,
slow you down, and/or push you sideways, depending on your flight path in
relation to the wind velocity and direction. This is most noticeable on long
distance flights.

Temperature also affects helicopter flight. As air gets warmer, it exapnds and
becomes thinner, providing less lift. If the air gets too cold, icing on the
rotor becomes a problem. Similarly, in humid conditions the air is composed of
more water, reducing lift. Finally, as altitude above sea level increases, air
gets thinner, reducing lift. For helicopters, ideal flying conditions are 70
degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) on a dry day at sea level.


LANDING

The nice thing about helicopters is theri ability to land without a paved
airstrip. However, they can't land on sloping ground. Any slope greater than
5' causes so much rotor tilt that the helicopter flies, or skids away from the
slope, making a landing impossible. NEVER try to land on a hillside - you'll
crash!

Ideally, all landings, and takeoffs for that matter, should be into the wind.
As you approach the base, lower your altitude to about 50' and reduce your
airspeed to 60 kts by pulling back slightly on the Cyclic. You'll need to
reduce the Collective to maintain your 50' altitude. Your goal is to land in
the center of the base. Just before you cross the outside edge of the base,
begin slowing down to a hover by pulling back on the Cyclic. Note that as your
speed drops towards 0 your lift will decrease. Add some Collective to maintain
your altitude.

The wind will tend to push you away from your present position; the Cyclic
should be moved slightly toward the wind, producing just enough skid to
counteract the wind velocity. This will maintain hover against the wind.

                                                                  [Page  59]

Reduce the Collective (easy does it here) to begin your final descent. At
about 20' you may need to reduce the Collective further to acieve touchdown.

Easy Flight: The collective must be used to change your altitude; however,
altitude is unaffected by the cyclic controls.


FARPS

Forward aiming and refueling points (FARP) are highly movile bases designed
to support helicopter operations. They are placed near or around the battle
area, and are usually set to support a particular squadron or mission. They
are well stocked with aviation and a full range of weapons.

Your mission orders indicate if a FARP is available for the current mission.
If available, you may land at the FARP just like any other base. The ground
crew immediately refuels and rearms your helicopter and your flight.

Unfortunately, they're not supermarkets - there's no shopping allowed. Your
helicopters are refueled and rearmed to match your start of mission 
configurations.


Carrier Landings

You may ask what business the Army has at sea? As a member of highly trained,
elite force, you are more than up to the task. Still, carrier based
landings are a little more complicated than your everyday open-field variety.

The landing pad is smaller, and the carrier deck isn't at 0' altitude. The 
radar altimeter is the key instrumentation; it indicates the proper approach
altitude as you center your position over the deck. The other steps are just
like landing on the ground, but be prepared to immediately max the collective
if you've misjudged your approach.


Shut Down

When you have landed at your base (altitude is 0), disengage the rotor. Your
postflight options now appear.

                                                                  [Page  60]

HOW TO FIGHT

Helicopter combat systems have come a long way since the days of door mounted
machine-guns and "wing and a prayer" defensive measures. Contemporary
helicopters possess an extensive array of weapon and defensive systems. Each
has been tailored to specific target type or purpose. It's important to become
familiar with each system's strengths and weaknesses. It'll be the difference
between getting the target or the target getting you!


Flight Plan

Before you takeoff, re-examine the mission map, and decide on a flight path
that will take you to the primary or secondary. Remember, the most obvious
route may end up being the most disastrous. Bounding directly into the target
at 140 kts and 500' of altitude may work in training, but it's suicide against
well-equipped troops.

A standard technique is to fly to the target in short dashes. Fly from behind
one hill to another, then hover and pop up briefly to scan ahead. Drop down,
pick your next destination and repeat the process. Stay as low as possible
when dashing, and use intervening terrain to mask your movement. It may sound
boring, but you'll enjoy the results.

Fuel is a major consideration; it isn't unlimited. Don't stretch yourself to
the point you can't make it back. This is especially important when flying
over water.

Any success quickly turns to failure if you loose your flight to poor fuel
planning. Always know the position of your base and FARP. Don't hesitate to
"top off" your tanks if there's any question.


Threats

As you fly, watch the threat display; the top of the display coincides with
your current heading. A red dot is an opposing ground unit. A blue dot means
an opposing aircraft is approaching. A yellow dot indicates a missile in 
flight. Note that the threat display can't distinguish between friendly and
opposing missiles. A grey dot is a friendly unit or a neutral structure.

When units appear on your threat display, they are also plotted on the maps.
They appear darker when they disappear from your threat display; that's their
last known position.

                                                                  [Page  61]

Though virtually every oppsing unit has some sort of gun or shoulder-
launched missile, the most dangerous are AA guns and vehicles and SAM
vehicles.


Warning Indicators

Watch your warning indicators' they are the true measure of enemy activity.
The "I", "R" and "L" indicators turn or flash red to indicate opposing search
or tracking activity. Additionally, the originating unit's dot on the threat
display automatically changes to a cross, thereby alerting you to the bearing
of the most dangerous threat or threats.


Jammers

When a warning indicator illuminates, the standard response is to turn on the
corresponding jammer; press the Radar Jammer (n) key or IR Jammer (.) key
("L" jammers currently aren't available). A small green light beside the
warning light illuminates, showing your jammer is active. If the warning
indicator turns off, the jamming was successful. Immediately turn onto a new
course, as jammed missiles often continue on their old course.

Keep your jammer active until you destroy or fly away from the threath. It's a
good idea to immediately activate both jammers if the threat concentration is
high.


Decoys

If the warning indicator remains illuminated, try using a decoy; press the
Chaff (m) key or Flare (/) key to launch a decoy. The decoy indicator
illuminates as long as the decoy is active. The decoy should be drawing the
missile or gunnery to its position.


ON THE DEFENSIVE


How They Find You

For a general description of helicopter tactics, see pages 110-112.

Ground based weapons utilize active radar, passive IR or optical means to
search out and find targets.

Search radars can "see" you at long distances in day or night. A distant red
dot on the threat display is probably a search radar. Since the purpose of
search radars is to detect your presence, jammers and decoys are counter-
productive, as both announce your presence!

Other units use short-range passive IR or the old standby - eyesifht. They
can't see you until you're much closer, and at night optical sighting is
especially limited.

                                                                  [Page  62]

All methods of search are blocked by objects on the ground. As a result,
ground-based units have a "dead-zone" they can't see. Above this dead-zone
the "eyes" will eventually find you. This dead zone becomes smaller and lower
as you approach the unit.


How They Track You

If a search is successful, they switch to "tracking" mode. If employing radar,
they constantly illuminate you with a radar beam. This sets off your radar
warning and causes the indicator to solidly illuminate.

When launched, IR weapons set off your IR warning and cause the indicater to
solidly illuminate.

If a laser ranger/designator is "painting" your helicopter, the laser warning
goes off and causes the indicator to solidly illuminate.

If you're being tracked by radar or an IR weaon, use your jammers and decoys.
If that fails try evasive flying.

Dive to a lower altitude while turning parallel to or away from the threat. If
you get lower and avoice closing the range (the dead-zone effect), an enemy
often loses its track. Evasive flying is a superior option to jammers and
decoys, because it doesn't broadcast your position.

Laser guided and visually aimed weapons can't be jammed or decoyed, so evasive
flying is your only defense.


Surviving Triple-A

If they find you, opposing guns will open fire and continue to fire until they
shoot you down. You must either breat the track or destroy the weapon. It's
that simple. If the gunfire is radar controlled, you can probably break the
track with jamming or chaff. However, all guns have optical backup systems
(some have laser systems).

The best way to survive gunfire is skillful evasive flying and dead-eye
firepower.


Surviving Sams

If they find you, SAM equipped units will launch a misisle. Missiles are
either IR-guided, radar-guided or visually-guided. When a missile is in flight
you'll see a yellow dot moving towards you on the threat display.

Passive IR-guided missiles are the most common threat. Your IR warning
indicator illuminates when they approach. Use your jammer or flares to 
"confuse" the missile, but remember to turn away so as not to collide with it.

                                                                  [Page  63]

Sophisticated IR missiles probably have visual or laser back up guidance; 
don't get too elated if you defeat the IR-guidance, there may still be a nasty
surprise in store.

While radar-guided missiles are primarily designed for use against
conventional jet aircraft, they still pose a serious threat. A radar beam
reflecting off your helicopter guides the missile. This radar beam is what
illuminates your radar warning indicator. Use your jammer or chaff to 
"confuse" the missile, but remember to turn away so as not to collide with it.
Just like IR-guided missiles, radar homers probably have back up guidance
systems. Therefore, defeating the radar is just the first step in defeating 
the missile.

Visually or laser-guided missiles are the greatest threats. You have no
effective jammer or decoy defenses; your only bet is evasive flying. Putting
terrain between you and the missile is the best bet. Flying into the dead
zone is the only other hope. Remember, successful evasive flying requires that
you fly lower AND away from the launcher. If you continue flying towards the
launcher, flying lower may not be effective.

After all this, there is some good news. All missiles have one universal weak
point - they have a wide turning radius. If you can get one close, dart off
perpendicular to its flight path; it will be unable to turn fast enough to hit
you. This tactic is easier said than done in a slow moving helicopter (fast-
movers swear by this manoeuvre). It takes enourmous skill, and split second
timing to turn inside of a missile screaming in a Mach 3.

The Appendix includes a summary of the various AAA and SAM systems that await
your pleasure. A description of the search, tracking and missile guidance
system is listed, along with an estimate of their effectiveness.

Study your mission intelligence briefings closely. If necessary, reference the
weapon system to understand its use and effectiveness.


Out at Sea

When out over the water, you have lost the best means of defense - terrain.
You'll need to stay extremely alert, since the opposing patrol craft carry a
number of defense weapons. Stay low or carry long range weapons, such as
Penguin and Maverick.

                                                                  [Page  64]

DAMAGE

If you're unable to "spoof" the threat, the gunfire or missile will probably
hit your helicopter. You'll see the explosion and the shudder of your
helicopter. If the hit was severe, one or more of the system's status lights
will illuminate. Systems will start to malfunction or fail. You'll need to
evaluate the damage to determine if you can continue the mission or need to
return to base.

If you are hit in multiple or critical systems, your helicopter will lose
power. The only way to survive this is to autorotate to a safe landing. The
number of hits required for a general systems failure varies; after three or
four, you should expect the worst.


HELICOPTER WEAPONS


Targeting

Your on-board targeting system is constantly scanning the forward arc; the
system is limited to the front 180'. It can't scan to the rear, so pay close
attention to your flight path, and occasionally swing around to check your
"six".

The targeting system is line-of-sight dependent. As a result, the higher you
are, the farther it can "see". Of course, the higher you are, the easier it is
for the other guys to spot you.

The targeting system automatically "locks" onto the closest target. A diamond
appears in your forward view, and an image of the target, along with its range
and heading data, displays in your MFD. You may switch the target lock, 
assuming others are in the area, by pressing Selector #2. There may be a
momentary delay; the targeting system must re-scan the entire area for new
targets.

When the locked target is within maximum range for the selected weapon, the
target box becomes a solid. This range varies from weapon system to weapon
system, as maximum ranges differ. If you fire at a target before the target
box changes, there's no chance of a hit!


Mast-Mounted Sights

The AH-64B Longbow Apache, OH-58D Kiowa Warrior and the AH-6 Defender are
equipped with a sighting system mounted on top of the main rotor hub. This
system enables these helicopters to "see" at greater ranges. Better yet, they
may peer over the top of intervening terrain without exposing the helicopter.
Press the Mast View (F2) key to switch to mast view; use the Controller to
rotate your view.

                                                                  [Page  65]

Firing

Depending on the weapon selected, a reticle ring or a fixed crosshair appears
in your view. The reticle ring works with "guided" weapons, whereas the
crosshair works with "unguided" weapons.

The reticle ring must be superimposed over the target diamond to accurately
engage the target; adjust your flight path if necessary. It has a range of
movement that represents the angle of offset for the selected weapon. The
reticle ring also becomes larger as the range drops, indicating the 
"confidence" of the shot.

The crosshair is always positioned directly ahead. Unguided weapons always
fly or fire as you bear. Adjust your flight path to coincide with the target
box. There's no question it's a challenge to fire unguided weapons at long
range. Aiming errors, no matter how slight, normally reslut in a miss.

Pressing Selector #1 fires the "active" weapon. Cannons and machine-guns fire
in 20 round bursts. Rockets fire in salvos of 1, 2 or 4. All other weapons
fire singly.


Weapons

The weapon indicator displays the "active" weapon, its position and rounds
remaining; rockets also indicate the current salvo setting. Press the spacebar
to change the active weapon.

All rockets, both gun pods and the AH-6 Defender's integral gun are unguided
weapons; the remaining weapons are all guided.

Certain weapons are only effective against certain target types. The Appendix
includes a summary of the weapon systems, including characteristics and
effectiveness. Familiarize yourself with these systems. There's nothing worse
than blazing away at a target, wasting round after round, only to discover 
that you're using the wrong weapon.

When you fire a cannon or a guided missile, the helicopter bucks and recoils
upward; some altitude will be gained due to the loss in forward motion.

Note: this effect isn't experienced in easy flight mode.

                                                                  [Page  66]

Primaries and Secondaries

If a loced target is part of the primary or secondary mission, a prompt
appears in the MFD along with the other target data.


The CP/G

Your invisible co-pilot/gunner (the front seater - back seater if you're 
flying the AH-66A Comanche) assists you in two ways during the course of a
mission. First, by communicating important system status and threat/target
information; and second, by assuming control of part of the weapon systems
functions. The degree of weapon system control is dependent upon the CP/G
reality switch setting.


ON THE OFFENSIVE

The best thing about helicopters is their ability to approach targets
undetected; they literally live (from a survival standpoint) at nap-of-the-
earth (NOE) altitude - about 100'. They move in and out of the terrain like a
jungle cat stalking its prey.

Sneak up on suspected targets, and use caution. Take a few extra minutes to
evaluate the situation. The pilot that plunges headlong into a combat
situation will more than likely retreat just as quickly with his tail between
his legs. Leave the flamboyant entries to the jet jockeys - they need more
attention, anyway!

If possible, attack from the flank rather than the front; this is referred to
as an enfilade attack. You can engage targets in turn, while limiting the
number that can spot you. If you engage from the front, all of the targets can
spot you simultaneously.

Use long range engagements; the further you stay away, the better. Most of
your weapons are longer-ranged than the opposition's - take advantage of it.

If you only remember one thing, NEVER overfly the target. If you didn't
destroy the target, you're giving away a free shot at your tail.

First and foremost, choose the right tool for the job. Evaluate your mission
orders carefully and outfit your helicopters with the most advantageous mix of
weapons. For example, if you're ordered to intercept enemy shipping, you may
want to take a few Penguins or Mavericks along for the ride.

                                                                  [Page  67]

Weapons

Once in combat, make sure that the "active" weapon is the most effective
choice. Don't try to fire Sidewinders at tanks or TOWs at aircraft.

Cannons: are close range weapons that are best fired straight ahead. They lack
the penetrative power of cannons, and therefore are only effective against
unarmored targets.

Machine-guns: are very close range weapons, and can only be fired straight
ahead. They lack the penetrative power of cannons, and therefore are only
effective against unarmored targets.

Rockets: are available in three types. Each is best suited for a particular
type of target, but can be effective against other target types. They're
unguided weapons, and are therefore easier to fire at close range. However,
they can be fired in salvos, and you can carry a fair number.

ATGMs: are also available in three types. They're powerful anti-armor weapons
that can be effectively utilized against structures, ships and even slow
moving aircraft.

TOW is a wire-guided weapon that's steered to the target. It's not as
difficult as it may seem. As long as the target is locked, corrections to the
missile's flight path are automatically calculated and transmitted to the TOW
over the unspooling wire. However, the wire is the biggest limitation - it
runs out at about 3,800 meters.

HellFire-A is a laser designated weapon that homes in on reflected laser light
It's much longer ranged than the TOW and has a wider target envelope. Since
the Hellfire "sees" the reflected light, the designation can be switched to a
different target; if it's within the target envelope, the Hellfire will hit 
the new target. This allows for "ripple fire" tactics. Multiple missiles are
fired at short intervals; after the first hits, the designator "spots" the
new target, and then guides the second missile.

                                                                  [Page  68]

Lasers are not as effective during low visibility conditions. Rain, fog and
snow can reflect some or all of the laser light limiting range and hit
probabilities. There's another disadvantage; if you're designating your own
target, you must also expose the helicopter until the Hellfire hits the target

Hellfire-B is the latest version of this effective weapon system. It's the
primary armament on Longbow Apaches; it can't be carried on Model-A Apaches.
It replaces the laser homer with a fire-and-forget millimeter wave radar
homer. All you do is find the target, and fire the missile - it doesn't get
any easier. This combined with the Longbow's mast mounted sight makes for a
potent, unbeatable combination.

Sidearm: is designed to home in on any surface radar emission source;
therefore, it's classifed as an "anti-radiation missile". Its big brothers,
HARM, Standard and Shrike, have been utilized to great effect on conventional
aircraft for years. Now, helicopters possess a similar punch. You don't have
to get a target lock to fire a Sidearm; just make sure to fire it towards the
radar source. It's fragmentation warhead and fire-andforget technology make
it one terrific "quick-draw" weapon - a surefire way to permanently cancel
that radar.

The Big Loads: Maverick and Penguin are heavyweight special purpose weapons.
Their use in helicopters is shrouded in controversy; some argue they're not
worth their weight. The opponents fell that Hellfire is just as effective, and
you can carry 4 Hellfires for every 1 Maverick or Penguin. On the other hand
Maverick and Penguin are both longer ranged than the Hellfire and are fire-and
forget weapons. The arrival of Hellfire-B makes the argument even hotter -
the decision is yours.


Masking

Not what you'll wear to your next costume party, it's the method of terrain
shielding often called the "pop up". It's also where the auto-hover pays for
its weight. It automatically maintains your present position and altitude
even in the face of a stiff wind.

Pull up behind a convenient hill position and drop your airspeed to 0; your
altitude should be about 100' - 150'. As your airspeed approaches 8-10 kts (it
must be 10 kts or less), press the Auto-Hover (0) key; this immediately
reduces your airspeed to 0.

                                                                  [Page  69]

Now press the Collective Up (=) key to start a slow ascent. As you clear the
crest of the hill, stop your ascent. If your helicopter is equipped with a 
mastmounted sight, stop the ascent just as the sight clears the hill. You're
now in position to scan the surrounding area.

If you lock onto an important target engage it immediately, and then drop down
below the crest; press the Collective Down (-) key. Otherwise, drop below the
crest and re-evaluate the situation. If necessary, check the mission map. You
may need to adjust your flight path, or unmask again to engage the other 
targets.

As an alternative approach, rotate the helicopter left or right by moving the
Cyclic left or right. Then push the Cyclic ahead slightly to add a few knots
of airspeed. Try to keep your airspeed under 10 kts. As you clear the side of
the hill, press the Auto-Hover (0) key, and rotate back to the forward area.
After scanning the area or engaging the targets, reverse the process (with a
little more haste this time), and duck back behind the hill. While this 
method of unmasking limits the scanning range, due to low altitude, it's an
excellent method of engaging known targets - longer ranged targets probably
won't spot you.

Remember with auto-hover active, you can quickly drop altitude by virtually
bottoming the collective; it holds you at the low limit.


Targets

Your missions present a number of target options, each with unique character-
istics requiring different tactics of engagement or weapon selection.
Always look before you shoot; the high command gets real upset when you start
shooting upon the friendlies.

AAA & SAMs: are your biggest challenge. These are the only targets that can
fire back with any real effect. Getting in the first shot is the key here.
Both types have reaction times of 5 to 20 seconds, depending on the 
sophistication of equipment and the skill of the crew. If you plan your
attack carefully, you can "take them out" before they even get a shot off.

                                                                  [Page  70]

Tanks & Light Vehicles: can be a turkey shoot. Attack helicopters, especially
the Apache, are made to destroy tanks and vehicles. The tanks don't carry
anything larger than a short range 14.5mm machine-gun; you can pick them
off easily. IFVs and APCs can be a bit nastier; they carry shoulder-launched
SAMs. Most of the other vehicles, such as truck convoys, are totally unarmed.

This may seem to good to be true, but before you think it's a cakewalk, the
opposition has also recognized these weaknesses. Groups of tanks and other
vehicles normally travel with AAA & SAM vehicles. Keep an eye out for these
escorts.

Working on the Railroad: doesn't get any easier than this. Railroad "rolling
stock" isn't much of a challenge, but important none the less. You know where
they are and where they must go; it's just a matter laying in wait and taking
them out of action.

Naval Targets: can get quite pesky, and the opposition has a habit of placing
armed forces on their oil platforms. Guided weapons are a must in these
situations. They are better suited todeal with the maneuverable patrol craft,
and you need their punch to take out the oil platforms.

Infantry: are difficult to spot and root out. They're only armed with light
weapons, but most also carry shoulder-launched SAMs. Rockets and cannon/
machine-gun fire are a good choice in this case.

Structures: pose problems similar to infantry. Although bigger and easier to
spot, they are seldom undefenced. SAMs and all types of AAA guns are usually
in the Vicinity. If you pick off the defenders first, the structures are then
fair game.

Bunkers and bridges are especially tough nuts to crack. It may take more than
one hit to destroy them.

                                                                  [Page  71]

AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT

When helicopters were first envisioned as combat weapons, the importance of
air-to-air combat was all but overlooked in the USA. Unfortunately, the Soviet
planners were not so shortsighted.

The Soviets have always placed a strong emphasis on air-to-air combat, and
have made concerted efforts to design this capability into their helicopters.
Many in the US Intelligence community consider the new Ka-34 Hokum to be a
purpose built "anti-helicopter" helicopter.

Fortunately, the US military planners are no longer ignoring this all too
important technology. Air-to-air weapons have become a standard load when
flying where air superiority is in doubt. The new AH-66A Comanche is designed
with a high degree of air combat functionality; it's closer in concept to
high-performance jet aircraft than past helicopter designs.

In actual air-to-air combat, one facet that requires constant vigilance is a
helicopter's ability to spring from nowhere. It's on you before you know what
is happening, snaps off a missile and vanishes in the wink of an eye.

Helicopter borne air-to-air missiles are the primary threat. They come in all
varieties of homers, and are usually more maneuverable than ground based
weapons. The helicopters also carry machine-guns or cannons. Unit for unit,
they can pack just as strong a punch as the friendlies.

In Chapter 3, Helicopter Tactics, a number of the tactical maneuvers key to
air-to-air combat, are discussed and diagrammed, but it essentially boils down
to a few specific factors:

Altitude: Stay low! Aircraft like nothing more than to find a helicopter 
flying up where only the eagles should dare. It's bad enough exposing yourself
to the ground fire, but it's murder against aircraft.

Take the First Shot: If you can get the first shot in, you have the best
chance of coming out on top. Pay attention to the threat display, and stay 
ready to snap off a quick shot.

                                                                  [Page  72]

Range: Fire at the longest range possible. This gives you a chance to 
reposition and take additional shots. Additionally, if they have ordnance in
the iar, it gives more time to counter or evade.

Hold the Advantage: Get on the aircraft's tail or keep it to your front. NEVER
lose sight of the enemy! If they get on your tail, use a side flare or a
horizontal scissors to revers the advantage. If necessary, use the Left View
(F3) key or Right View (F4) key to maintain visual contact.


WEAPONS

There aren't as many decisions to make with air-to-air weapons. They are
adaptions of existing weapon systems. To date, the first purpose built
helicopter AAM is yet to be seen.

Cannons: is the choice for close quarters. The Apaches, SuperCobra and
Comanche use their helmeted mounted sights to maintain lock-on during tight
twists and turns. Fixed-firing cannons can still be effective, especially
with tail shots. Don't waste your time with machine-guns; when you're up
against gunships, their armor can't be penetrated.

Sidewinder: the father of the Sidearm, is one of the most successful and
tested weapon systems in service. It's a highly maneuverable, fire-and-forget
IR homer. It's long-ranged and packs a potent warhead. Like Sidearm, you don't
have to get a target lock; just make sure to fire it towards the IR source.
Long range multiple engagements are a simple process; just disperse the 
missiles so they don't home in on the same target.

Stinger: may be about half the weight of Sidewinder, but is certainly more
than up to the task. You can also carry twice as many Stingers as Sidewinders
you never know when you may need those extra shots. While it may be shorter
ranged, it'll reach just about every thing you can see. Some targets may take
two hits, but those should be few and far between.

Helstreak: is a British import that's derived from the ground-based Starstreak
SAM. It's carried by the Longbow Apache and the Comanche. It's not a fire-
and-forget system; laser guidance must be provided by the launching helicopter
Therfore, a lock-on must be attained prior to launch. On the plus side, it
flies faster than Sidewinder and Stinger, which reduces the exposure time.
It's three element warhead covers a broad area, so close is probably good

                                                                  [Page  73]

enough. As an added advantage, it can also fire at ground targets. Its 
warheads can pierce most medium weight armor.


Targets

Helicopters: For the most part, Stingers and Helstreaks are more than adequate
It's the rare case where one shot won't do the trick; Sidewinders may be
overkill. Don't discount Hellfires in a pinch. If the helicopter isn't moving
too fast, you can reasonably maintain a lock, especially from hover. When you
get in close, switch to cannon and "hose" them down. M255 rockets can also
be a nasty surprise!

                                                                  [Page  74]

HELICOPTER FLIGHT COMMANDS

The essence of Gunship 2000 is the multi-helicopter operations. Through this
mechanism, you direct the flying, combat and support functions of the other
four helicopters in your flight. It's a simple, straightforward, yet powerful
process that's executed through a series of single key commands.

After receiving your commission, the door opens to this challenging and
exciting process.


SYSTEM SUMMARY

Press the Map View (F10) key to access the flight commands menu. The commands
are listed across the bottom of the screen. Commands available to the "active"
section or helicopter display "brightly".

As you toggle through the helicopters, information relating to the "active"
helicopter displays along the left side. The combat data link system
automatically tracks key helicopter systems and mutually transmits this data
via its communication link to all helicopters in the flight.


Damage Schematic

The schematic helicopter diagram graphically displays damage to helicopter
systems. A yellow burst over a system indicates damage; a red burst indicates
system failure.

The Rotor, tail rotor, left wing, right wing, left engine, right engine and
cannon indicate damage in their respective positions. Optics are located in 
the nose and/or mast mounted sight; avionics are located in the tail boom; and
fuel cells are located below the cockpit positions. While these positions
may not be true location in all helicopter types, the consistency helps speed
recognition.


Helicopter Status

The helicopter's current orders and key system indicators display below the
damage scematic.

                                                                  [Page  75]

COMMAND CONTROL

The command list is utilized to pass instructions to the other helicopters in
the flight. Commands given to a section leader apply to all helicopters in 
thatsection. Helicopters in your section always fly your course, speed and
altitude unless instructed to do otherwise.


Next Unit

All commands applicable to a section leader may also be given to a single
helicopter. In this case, the helicopter deviates from the leader's control.

Press the Next Unit (n) key to toggle between the helicopters. If the 
helicopters are flying as part of a single section, the helicopters display
in numerical order. If a heavy and light section are both operational, the
other section leader displays first, followed in numerical order by the
remaining helicopters.


Fly To

Press the Fly to (f) key to establish a flight path. Up to three waypoints
can be placed. This command is applicable to your helicopter.


Hold Position

Press the Hold Position (h) key to order the section to maintain its present
position. The Section maintains its current altitude and heading, but reduces
its airspeed to 0. This command can be given to a section at any point; it
doesn't cancel existing waypoints. Pressing the key a second time cancels the
hold.

Upon reaching its destination, the section immediately assumes a hold command.


Speed

Press the Speed (s) key to modify the section's airspeed. There are three
possible settings - slow, medium and fast.

Slow speed is 50% of the possible maximum for the current altitude.

Medium speed (the default) is 75% of the possible maximum.

Fast speed is 100% of the possible maximum.

Pressing the key loops through the possible settings.


Altitude

Press the Altitude (a) key to modify the section's altitude. There are three
possible settings - NOE, contour and low.

NOE altitude (the default) is 20' higher than your present low altitude limit
setting.

                                                                  [Page  76]

Contour altitude is 150' higher.

Low altitude is 350' higher.

Pressing the key loops through the possible settings.


Land

Press the Land (l) key to order the section to land upon reaching its final
waypoint. If no active waypoints exist, the section immediately lands. The
section seeks out terrain suitable for a landing in the immediate area.


Return to Base

Press the Return to Base (b) key to order the section to immediately return to
base; all existing waypoints are cancelled. If on a deep strike mission, the
section returns to the passage point.

The section initiates the default speed and altitude unless ordered otherwise.
The section takes the most direct route to the base, and lands upon reaching
its destination.

This command is applicable to your own helicopter. It sets a single waypoint
with your base as the destination. You must initiate the autopilot or head
towards the waypoint.


Disengage

Press the Disengage (d) key to order the section to immediately break contact
and move away from all opposing forces. Upon reaching a "safe" position, the
section assumes a hold command. This command cancels all existing waypoints.

The section disregards this command if not currently in contact with opposing
forces.


Regroup

Press the regroup (g) key to order an independent helicopter to immediately
rejoin its section. It takes the most direct route, and initiates default
speed and altitude settings. This command cancels all existing waypoints.


Weapons Free

Press the Weapons Free (w) key to order a section to engage all sighted
targets. The section employs the appropriate weapons, if available, based on
target type. Pressing the key a second time returns the section's weapons to
"hold". Helicopters on "hold" status fly directly to their destinations.

The section freely employs defensive measures on either setting.

                                                                  [Page  77]

Cargo Drop

Press the Cargo Drop (c) key to order the section's cargo carrying helicopters
immediately to drop their cargo. The section's UH-60 K/L Blackhawks drop
their cargo upon reaching the Primary/Secondary waypoint.


COMMUNICATIONS

Communication is the key element to any successful operation. Since you're an
active pilot in the flight, not some desk jockey, you must rely on your
pilots to keep you abreast of developments.

During the course of a mission, your pilots communicate key information and
status updates. The message include target sightings, reaching destinations
and damage updates.

Their call sign appears on the screen, along with their message. This enables
you to fly your portion of the mission and not constantly check on flight
status.

When important situations do develop, you can immediately access the Map
View to re-evaluate and revise orders as necessary. You can also "jump on
their tail" by pressing the Flight Chase View (shift F5) key to directly
view the situation.

If, for any reason, you are unable to read an entire message, press alt m to
redisplay the last message.


Strategy

It's probably easier to just say I'll do it myself, but combat is a team
effort. The commander that best employs flight assets will be the most
successful. You could always keep the entire flight with you at all times, but
that will limit your options dramatically. Give the other pilots a chance;
they'll give you their best.

                                                                  [Page  78]

Experience

Use your flight to the best of its abilities. Inexperienced pilots may not do
exactly what you had in mind. Developing skills and moxie takes time, just as
you've probably found out by now. Experience is a measure of missions flown,
rank and decorations. Your best pilot will have flown the most missions, is
one rank under you, and has a chest full of decorations.

This pilot is your best choice for the other section leader. Avoid selecting
that wet behind the ears W-01, fresh out of flight training. Don't ask any of
them to do more than they're capable of accomplishing.


Commands

Try to envision yourself flying this leg of the mission; what would you do if
you were there? Apply a command stream that accomplishes that image. If you
give them poor orders, they'll perform poorly. You're their commander; they
look to you for the right measure.

The tactics described earlier still apply here. Fly and fight smart!


Scouts

Scouts play a very useful role as independent helicopters. Send one on ahead
to look for enemy units and/or to clear a safe flight path. It's no use
sending loaded Blackhawks into totally unfamiliar territory; their loads are
just too valuable to squander away.

A Kiowa Warrior can also mark targets for Hellfire equipped Apaches, 
SuperCobras and Blackhawks. The gunships can wait safely behind a hill while
the Kiowa Warrior is out looking for some ripe targets.


Ambush

With the opposing forces constantly on the move, it's easy to stuble across a
force occupying an area you thought was clear or just flew through a few
minutes ago. It's usually expedient to position a helicopter in covering
terrain along any suspected movement paths.

Also, a helicopter can be positioned to watch your "back door". This way you
can be confident that your means of exit is clear of enemy forces when you
need to get out quick.

                                                                  [Page  79]

Special Considerations

Upon landing, UH-60K/L Blackhawks automatically drop off their passengers,
unless at a base or FARP. Be sure they're at the correct location before
giving the orders to land. They also automatically pick up and passengers, if
in the vicinity, when they land.

Cargo drops are also automatic. Even though cargo can be successfully dropped
without making a landing, it's easier to verify the location by landing first.
Of course, if the LZ is "hot", you may be forced to drop the load and get
out quickly.

                                                                  [Page  80]

AFTER THE MISSION


MEASURE OF SUCCESS

You've landed, and are relatively safe and secure. The S2 now wants to run
through the debriefing. Never an easy read, you can't tell if he's pleased or
disappointed. The mission replay indicates how well you did this time out.

If you do nothing else, complete the primary and secondary missions, and
return safely to your base. If you can manage only one of the two, make it the
primary. Destroying additional units is always a plus, but not at the expense
of your missions. Stay focused, but flexible. The TF commander has a habit of
changing missions.

Promotions and decorations are awarded for hitting the assigned missions and
returning an intact helicopter to base. Time is also a performance measure. 
You can't spend the entire day flying just one mission; you need to get in and
get out as quick as possible. There's only so many helicopters and pilots
available, and more than enough mission to go around.


Ditching

If you land and abandon your helicopter, every attempt is made to pick you up,
but you may be captured by the opposing forces. Naturally, the chance of 
rescue increases if you're near a base or FARP. The best bet is to make it
back to base. It's better to return even if you can't complete your missions.
You can always return to fight another day.


Campaigns

When a campaign is completed, you are advised as to the outcome. This
shouldn't be any surprise, you've known the progress all along. The campaign
map is routinely updated when you attend briefings.


Promotion

Successful completion of your assigned mission improves your overall record.
An excellent record leads to promotion. However, even in combat, promotions
take time. Don't expect a promotion after every mission. As you increase in
rank, promotions are even harder to come by. After all, not everyone can be a
Brigadier General.

A reprimand on your record makes promotion more difficult. Reprimands occur
whenever you decline a mission, or you fail to achieve either the primary
or secondary mission. On the other hand, decorations for heroism move you
to the head of the promotion pack.

                                                                  [Page  81]

Battlefield Commissions

The TF commander is always on the lookout for pilots with leadership potential
If you're selected to receive a commission, you're approached by the TF
commander. The choice is yours to make; it's not required. However, accepting
the commission does open the door to the exciting world of multiple
helicopter flight.

The TF commander is persistent. He'll keep after you even if you decline a
commission. If you continue decline the offer of a commission, CW4 is the
highes rank you can attain.


Decorations

If you do exceptionally well on a mission, you may be awarded a medal for
heroism and valor. Unlike promotions, decorations are based purely on your
performance during a single mission. Your curren rank and record have no
effect on your chance of getting decorated.

In addition to the decorations for heroism and valor, two other decorations
can be awarded. The National Defense Service Medal is given for successfully
completing training, and the Purple Heart is awarded for wounds received in
combat.


MISSION REPLAY

The mission replay summarizes the key events of your mission. It shows what
went well and not so well. It's a learning experience; the next time out
apply the lessons learned from this mission.


Film Library

Upon the completion of a mission, or if you access the mission films through
the Squadron Archives, the Film Library panel appears.

Here you select the film to view; the last mission flown is always titled
"Last Mission". To select a film, position the cursor on the title line and
press Selector #1; the selected title highlights. Press "Play" to begin the
replay.

From this control panel, you may also rename and delete mission films.
Remember, if you wish to save the current mission, you must rename "Last
Mission" or it'll be lost after the next mission.

Once you fill the entire page, the slide bar to the right is used to scroll
the film listing.


External Viewpoint

In this, the default viewpoint, replay displays the actual combat films from
your mission. You are there again with your flight, with an "out of body"

                                                                  [Page  82]

view of all the action. A short mission summary is displayed at the top of
the replay screen.

A running list of events is displayed on the panel. This way you can follow
along with the action as it happens.


Controls

Replay uses a "VCR" type panel to control the replay functions. During the
Conventional Replay, the Controller is used to position the cursor over a 
key; press Selector #1 to activate the key. As an alternative, the tab and
shift keys can be used to position the cursor.
                                 __
Position over and press the  /\  \/  |>  <|  keys (or press directional keys)
to adjust the point of view. ~~

Position over and press the  | <| <|   key (or press the r key) to rewind to
the beginning of the replay.
                              _
Position over and press the  |_|  key (or press the s key) to stop the replay.

Position over and press the  |>  key (or press the p key) to start the replay.

Position over and press the  |> |   key (or press the n key) to fast forward
to the next event. Upon reaching the next event, replay automatically shifts
into the "play" mode.

Position over and press the  |> |>  key (or press the f key) to fast forward.

Position over and press the  1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 keys (or press the respective
numeric key) to shift the view to that helicopter. If the mission type was
"Single", only the "1" key is active.

Position over and press the  T  key (or press the t key) to shift the view to
the target.

Position over and press the  RESUME key (or press alt x) to resume the fight.

Position over and press the  DEMO key (or press alt y) to activate the Demo
Viewpoint. Press alt y to return again to the external viewpoint.


Demo Viewpoint

The replay takes the "pilot's" viewpoint. In this mode, you view the mission
from the pilot's seat. All actions are replayed exactly as they occured in
the actual mission.

To exit the replay, press alt e, this returns you to the game. To return to
the control panel, press alt y.


Resume Flight

Replay offers one additional exciting feature. You can jump in and take over a
flight at any point during the replay! Position the cursor over the Resume key
and press Selector #1 (or press alt x).

                                                                  [Page  83]

This feature is an excellent combat tool for learning and developing tactics.
You can re-fly a tough mission, change your tactics, and observe the impact
of a revised plan of attack. Or, you can re-enter another pilot's mission, and
see if you can top their results. These "films" are loaded via the squadron
archives file.

When you re-enter a mission, you are positioned in the #1 helicopter and are
now in control with all game controls active.

The results of a re-entered mission never affect your record, nore are the
results of this "mission" recorded for future viewing. The original replay
remains intact.

To exit, press alt e; this returns you to the game.


FLIGHT PROMOTIONS

The pilots in your flight are also eligble for promotions and decorations.
The high command makes recommendations as to who should be promoted and who
should receive decorations. As the flight commander, you're authorized to
accept the recommendations or transfer the awards to other pilots.

To change a recommendation, highlight the award and press Selector #1. The
award is transferred to the next pilot. Promotions are automatically adjusted
to the next higher rank. A pilot can't be promoted to a rank equal to your
current rank. Decorations are awarded as presented.

When you concur with the recommendations or changes, highlight the Accept key
and press Selector #1.


REPLACEMENTS

If you're ever faced with the unfortunate situation of having lost a pilot in
combat, you'll automatically receive a W-01 replacement from the pilot pool.

If you're not satisfied with the replacement or you with to change an existing
pilot, the pilot replacement screen is provided to make these administrative
changes. You may replace the pilot, but the new pilot's rank and decorations
are comparable.

Highlight the pilot to be replaced, and press Selector #2. Enter the name of
the new replacement and then press Selector #1.

                                                                  [Page  84]

                                3. THE HELICOPTER


HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT


Father of the Helicopter

Leonard da Vinci is widely considered to be the "Father of the Helicopter."
In the late 15th Century, da Vinci developed the first theories of flight, and
designed a screw-like rotary-wing aircraft that operated on the principles he
developed.

Da Vinci's Helix had a large, screw-like rotary wing. Da Vinci had theorized
that air has a "substance", or density, and that a lifting force could be
generated by pushing down against it; it would, theoretically, bore through
the substance of the air like an auger bit through wood.

While a full-size version of da Vinci's Helix never flew, some small working
models were produced. The problems that faced da Vinci's craft would confront
every would-be-inventor of a self-propelled helicopter. The power plant and
structure of the aircraft needed to be kept low, the torque produced by the
spinning propellers had to be counteracted, and the craft had to be
controlled.


The Helicopter Takes Shape

The next significant step toward rotary-winged flight occurred in 1783, at the
World's Fair in Paris. Two Frenchmen, Launoy and Bienvenu, created a toy
rotary-wing craft with four feathered propellers. The propellers were placed
on either end what was basically a stick, and turned independently of one
another in opposite directions.

The toy, drive by a wind-up bent-bow system, managed to fly up to altitudes
of seventy feet, and provided a great deal of inspiration for other inventors.
But they still lacked a propulsion plant strong enough to generate the lift
needed to get larger craft airborne. It would be nearly another hundred years
before inventors would have any significant successes.

In 1862, another Frenchman named Ponton D'Amecourt developed a steampowered
helicopter. The craft had coaxial propellers, counter-rotating wings spinning
about the same axis. The helicopter's steam engine was made of aluminium, and

                                                                  [Page  86]

weighed only four pounds. While the power-to-weight ratio of the craft was 
still too low for it to get airborne, it bobbed and bounced on the ground on
the threshold of flight. This alone encouraged inventors to continue.

By 1870, an Italian inventor, Enrico Forianni, met with some success. His
steam-powered coaxial helicopter weighed only six and a half pounds, but it
managed to fly up to heights of 40 feet and for a duration of 20 minutes.
Rotary flight, albeit unmanned rotary flight, was a reality. But the hurdles
to manned flight - the power-to-weight ratio and control of flight - still
remained.

The first breakthrough in manned rotary flight would not come until 1907, four
years after the Wright brothers' first flight at Kitty Hawk. The development
of internal combustion engines had finally produced a power plant with a 
sufficient power-to-weight ratio to be effective, and yet another Frenchman,
Paul Cornu, set out to take advantage of that new technology.

His craft had dual rotors, one placed forard and the other at the rear of the
fuselage. Each rotor measured twenty feet in diameter. The rotors were 
connected by drive belts to a 24-horsepower internal combustion engine. For
control of flight, Cornu had placed tilted vanes below each rotor.

The belts slipped and the rotors spun unevenly, but Cornu's helicopter became
airborne. His flight was short, and he only managed to rise a few feet above
the ground, but he had flown!

Many other helicopter designs followed; but for the next ten years, few met
with any greater success than Cornu's. Control remained the greatest problem.
And while World War I had a drastic effect on the evolution of the airplane,
it produced few advances in powered rotary-wing flight.

The 1920s saw two major step forward in rotary wing aircraft design. The first
was in 1922, when Raul Pateras, an Argentinean, built (with the backing of the
French military) a coaxial helicopter with controlled-pitch propellers. The
controllable pitch of the rotor blades while in flight increased the 
maneuverability, and the craft also demonstrated the effect of autorotation -
allowing the rotors to spin freely in unpowered flight to slow descent.


The Autogiro

The second major step forward came not in the form of a helicopter, but from
an entirely different aircraft. Juan de la Cierva, a Spanish airplane 

                                                                  [Page  87]

designer, decided to investigate rotary winged flight in 1924, and soon after
unveiled an entirely new type of aircraft - the autogiro.

Rather than using a powered rotary wing for lift, the autogiro has a freely
rotating overhead wing that is allowed to windmill. The forward motion of the
aircraft through the air, generated by the thrust of a conventional propeller,
causes the rotor to spin and generate lift. Consequently, the autogiro
cannot hover; but it can take off and land in a substantially smaller area 
than conventional aircraft. In 1928, de la Cierva flew his autogiro across
the English Channel, attaining an airspeed of nearly 100 miles an hour.

The autogiro found its way into the hands of the military in limited numbers,
mostly for evaluation purposes. One was the first rotary aircraft flown off
a ship, launched from the carrier USS Langley on September 23, 1931; another
was evaluated by the Marine Corps during operations in Nicaragua in 1932.
Admiral Richard E. Byrd used an autogiro during his exploration of the
Antarctic in 1933 and 1934, and the Army tested several autogiros between
1935 and 1938.

But all of these craft were "of-the-shelf" civilian models, and little more 

                                                                  [Page  88]

was done with the craft. Some military applications, such as antisubmarine
warfare and artillery spotting, were noted, but there was little real 
interest in further development; its low payload capacity and its inability to
take off vertically made it unsuitable for what the military had in mind.


World War II

The Second World War accelerated the development of helicopters dramatically,
especially in Germany. The first truly practical helicopter, the Focke-
Achgelis Fa61, was built for the Third Reich by Dr. Heinrich Karl Johann
Focke, and flew for the first time on June 26,1936 (even though he had been
marked by the Nazis as being "politically unsafe").

The Fa61 was a single-seat aircraft, with side-by-side threebladed rotors and
a conventional propeller for forward thrust. Both the rotors and the propeller
were powered by a single 160 horsepower engine.

The craft proved to be difficult to fly at first; eventually, it was mastered
by Hanna Reitsch, one of Germany's most respected test pilots. In February of
1938, she flew the Fa61 in the Berlin Deutchlandhall sports arena, 
demonstrating the helicopter's incredible handling characteristics. She later
described the experience as "intoxicating." 

Reitsch and the Fa61 went on to set numerous world records for rotary flight
between 1937 and 1939, proving the practicality and reliability of the
helicopter once and for all. Among its records were a top speed of 77 miles
per hour, a distance of 143 miles, and an altitude of 11,243 feet.

While Dr. Focke did not intend the helicopter for military applications, the
Nazis had other ideas. Another German, Anton Flettner, built what is 
considered to be the world's first military helicopter - the F1 282 Kolibri.
The Kolibri had twin counter-rotating propellers that turned in 
synchronization, their planes of rotation intermeshing. Flettner's Kolibri
flew for the first time in 1940, and by 1942 was operational on German 

                                                                  [Page  89]

airships and escorts in the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Baltic Seas. Eventually
a modification of the Kolibri was used for antisubmarine warfare.

Another Focke design, the Fa 233 Drache, was the world's first transport
helicopter. The Drache, which carried six passengers and could carry a cargo
load suspended from a cable, was tested extensively for use as a general
purpose transport for mountain troops. Allied bombing raids destroyed all but
seven, and by 1945 only three remained serviceable. These were formed into the
first (and only) WWII Luftwaffe helicopter squadron, Transportstaffel 40.

While more Fa 233's were built, only one additional helicopter was ever
completed. At the end of the war, only two operational helicopters remained.

In the United States, Igor Sikorsky's Sikorsky Aircraft Company received a
contract from the U.S. Army for a two-passenger observation helicopter.
Sikorsky had earlier demonstrated a prototype helicopter, the VS-300, and the
success of that aircraft had finally drawn the interest of the Army back to
rotary-winged flight.

In January of 1942, Sikorsky's Army prototype, the XR-4, flew for the first
time. By the time it was delivered to the Army on May 17, 1942, it had broken
practically all of the existing worl records for helicopter operations. The
U.S. military was now thoroughly convinced of the helicopter's potential.

The XR-4's design, like Sikorsky's VS-300 before it, utilized a single rotor
with three blades, and a tail rotor to counteract the torque of the main rotor
This design set the standard for the great majority of American helicopters
that followed it.

By the end of WWII, over four hundred Sikorsky helicopters of three designs
were flying for the Army, Navy and Coast Guard, and for the British Navy and
RAF. They served as scouts, delivered mail to ships at sea, and served as
rescue craft during carrier operations. In addition, the growing need for
antisubmarine platforms gave the helicopter an active combat mission in fleet
operation; with the advent of the dipping sonar in the mid-1940s, the
helicopter became a viable sub-hunter.

In 1944, the helicopter saw its first duty as a combat search and rescue
(C-SAR) and medevac craft, during operations in Burma. In April of that year,
Sikorsky R-4 helicopters attached to the U.S. Army's First Air Commando Group

                                                                  [Page  90]

based at Hailakandi, India, were fitted with fuel tanks from fixed-wing
aircraft to extend their range, and were flown behind enemy lines to rescue
the crew and passengers of a light British medevac aircraft. The mission
was a success, and the R-4 was called upon almost daily afterwards for other
SAR missions.


The Malayan Emergency

The first real conflict in which helicopters were used extensively was the
Malayan Emergence, a counter-insurgency war fought by the British for twelve
years beginning in 1948. By the time the Korean War began, the British already
had nearly forty thousand troops fighting a guerilla war against Chinesebacked
communist insurgents. British forces depended heavily on helicopters in this
jungle war, for medical evacuation, troop transport, observation and
reconnaissance. The operational flexibility of helicopters, along with their
ability to deploy and retrieve troops in jungle terrain, proved their worth in
combat beyond a shadow of a doubt.


The Korean War

The Korean War was to U.S. helicopter aviation what the Malayan Emergency was
to the British. During the course of the war, the helicopter was used by all
four branches of the armed forces, and tactics were developed for their use.

While the helicopter was primarily used for transport, medevac, search and
rescue, and reconnaissance by all of the service, there was some unofficial
experimentation with gunship tactics. For the first time, helicopters became
a threat to enemy troops.

The first shots fired in anger from a helicopter were from a U.S. Navy
helicopter in January, 1951. Lieutenant, j.g.John W. Thorton and his crewman,
Petty Officer Whitaker, experimented with light attack helicopter tactics by
firing .45 caliber pistols and carbine rifles and dropping grenades from their
HO3S-1 on North Korean troops. If fragmentation grenades were not available,
LTJG Thorton would obtain percussion grenades and tape nails to them, so they
could "nail them to a tree."

These tactics did not endear Thorton to the North Koreans, nor to his fellow
pilots. The North Koreans quickly learned that the helicopter was a potential
threat, and soon were firing upon all they saw.

The HO3S-1 had been the subject of another experiment in helicopter armament a
year earlier, at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey.

                                                                  [Page  91]

Mechanics at Helicopter Utility Squadron One (HU-1) attempted to install
swivel gun mounts with .30 and .50 caliber machine guns in the doors of a
helicopter. Unfortunately, the airframe wasn't strong enough to support the
guns, and when they were fired, they nearly ripped the sides of the aircraft
off. The experiment was only slightly ahead of its time.

The Army experimented with the idea of an armed helicopter during the war.
The need for armament aboard helicopters became apparent when the H-19 troop
transport helicopter was deployed to Korea - it proved to be extremly
vulnerable during troop assault landings. The Army tried mounting a bazooka
on an H-13 helicopter in 1950, with little success; three years later, the
Army tried a grenade launcher, with the same result.

American experience with the helicopter during Korea led to the development
of the "Air Cavalry" concept. General Matthew B. Rideway, who had seen the
importance of the helicopter in Korea, reorganized Army aviation in January
1955, and laid the foundation for the modern "Air Cav". Accompanying this
new organizational concept was that of a "helicopter gunship".

In 1956, the Army began testing various types of helicopter armament again,
with the goal of providing an effective for providing suppressive fire during
assault landings. Air Cavalry units experimented with .30 and .50 caliber
machine guns, rockets, and varioius cannons. Eventually, these experiments
led to the formation of an aerial combat recon company in 1958.

The French would be the first to apply the gunship concept under actual
combat conditions. During the bloody French-Algerian War, the French Army
and Air Force applied the American experience with helicopter armament to
their Vertol H-21's twin rotor helicopters originally built for troop
transport.

The French used several mixes of armament, from .30 and .50 caliber machine
guns to 37mm rockets and 20mm cannon in their war against the Muslim rebels.
The French also armored their helicopters, using self-sealing gas tanks, and
fiberglass armor plating around engine compartments and the cockpit. After
adding weaponry and armor to their helicopters, the French did not lose
any helicopters to ground fire. The French also pioneered the development of
a helicopter-launched anti-tank missile, in 1958.

While the French had some success with the use of helicopters during the

                                                                  [Page  92]

French-Algerian War, in the end they were forced to quit Algeria, granting
their former colony independence. The helicopter alone could not win a 
guerilla war. Still, the utility of the armed helicopter had been proven, and
important lessons had been learned about its employment.

But the real test of "Gunship" weapons and tactics would come with the
escalation of a war in another former French Colony - Vietnam.


The Vietnam War

The Vietnam War has often been called the "Helicopter War" because of the
pivotal role that helicopters played in all aspects of the conflit. U.S.
forces depended heavily on the helicopter because of its utility and flexi-
bility in an environment similar to that the British faced in Malaya during
the early '50s. During the conflict, more helicopters, and more types of
helicopters would be used than ever before. Some eighteen types of helicopters
were flown by U.S. pilots over the course of the war (many of which are still 
in service today in some capacity). The war also saw the first widespread use
of gas turbinepowered helicopters in all facets of operations.

The first gas turbine-powered helicopter deployed to Vietnam became a symbol
of the war itself - the UH-1 Iroquois, more commonly knows as the Huey.
First delivered to the Army in 1959, the Huey was commonly referred to early
on as the "helicopter ambulance," despite its multi-role design. The Huey
was remarkably successful in all of its roles, and eventually over nine
thousand were built - many are still in service.

The UH-1B Huey became the first true helicopter gunship. It was built with
universal wiring and "hard points" for the attachment of various weapons
systems. Three weapons were used by the UH-1B: the XM-6 quad (four 7.62mm
machine guns and four grenade launchers, mounted in pairs on each side of
the ship), the XM-3 rocket pod system (two pods of 24 2.75 inch rockets),
and the SS-11 guided anti-tank missile (three guided missiles mounted on each
side of the helo). While the XM-3 and SS-11 systems were not available early,
the XM-6 quad was almost universally in use as early as 1962, giving the Huey
a lethal punch.

Huey 1A's were also equipped with weaponry, though their lower turbine
power and lack of universal wiring limited the range of weapons available.
They were equipped with two fixed rocket pods and two 30-caliber machine guns,
mounted on the skids of the aircraft.

                                                                  [Page  93]

The first Huey 1A's and 1B's to arrive in Vietnam were organized into the
Utility Tactical Transport Helicopter Company (UTTHCO). The 1B's proved to
be much more flexible in meeting the needs of the local commanders. Almost
as important as the 1B's better armament mix was its higher shaft power,
essential for maneuverability in the high humidity of Vietnam. The gunships
provided light close-in fire support for assault landings of airborne troops,
and were essential to the evolution of the "airmobility" strategy of the 
U.S. Army.

The "airmobility" concept emerged in the early sixties as a product of a study
by a board of Army officers convened by Secretary of Defense Robert MacNamara.
The Army Tactical Mobility Requirements Board, also known as the "Howze Board"
(for its chairman, General Hamilton H. Howze, an experienced Airborne 
commander), recommended the substitution of helicopters for a large amount of
the Army's ground transportation. All Army units would be equipped with 360
air vehicles to every 2000 wheeled land vehicles.

The committee also recommended the formations of specialized, completely
airmobile "air assault divisions". The concept of Air Assault Division was
tested by a skeleton division formed at Fort Benning, Georgia, in 1964. During
exercises in North and South Carolina, the division proved itself against the
82nd Airborne.

The Secretary of Defense recognized the effectiveness of such a unit, and gave
the Army the approval to proceed with organization of the first airmobile
division. The division selected for this honor was the famed 1st Cavalry
Division. On July 28, 1965, President Johnson ordered the 1st Cavalry Division
(Airmobile) to Vietnam.

As the war excalated, and helicopters took increasing amounts of ground fire
from heavy antiaircraft weapons, it became apparent that a dedicated 
helicopter gunship was needed. The UH-1B, while highly successful, was limited
in its capabilities - it was, after all, just a modified logistics helicopter.
Bell helicopter had foreseen the Army's need, and was preparing to meet it. In
1966, the Army ordered its first true gunship - the Bell AH-1 Huey Cobra.

The Cobra was based on the UH-1B, but had some major innovations. The airframe
was narrow, presenting a very small head-on target. The very look of the 
helicopter suggested its purpose - it was death from above for the enemy.

                                                                  [Page  94]

The first Huey Cobra went to Vietnam in 1968. Perhaps their most famous role
in the war was the operations conducted by AH-1's over the Ho Chi Minh Trail,
ambushing North Vietnamese and Viet Cong supply trains. It was during these
ambushes that Cobra pilots developed tactics like "Cobra Stacking," flying one
above the other to maximize the amount of ordnance delivered on a small area.

But the AH-1s also earned their keep in the troop transport escort role as
well, protecting assault helicopter landings and providing "instantaneous fire
suppression". The Marine Corps found them vital to carrying out their mission.

With a broad range of weaponry, high speed and high maneuverability, the Cobra
proved to be a very important asset to American field commanders; its success
insured the long line of gunships that followed it. Many other nations have
copied it, and the Army and Marine Corps use modifications of the AH-1
(particularly the AH-1W SuperCobra) to this day.


Afghanistan

Vietnam was the proving ground for American gunships; for the Soviets, 
Afghanistan served a similar role.

While the Soviets had been pioneers in heavy lift helicopter design and
construction, and had been arming helicopters since they early 50s, their
first helicopter gunship was not introduced until 1972. The Mi-24 Hind-A was
really a heavily armed and highly mobile transport helicopter. It is believed
that the Hind-A was designed to act as its own fire support during troop
insertions; the Soviet staff believed at the time that they could not afford
a large number of single-purpose helicopters.

Soviet attitudes about gunships changed over time, and the Hind went
through a series of modifications. The Hind-D was equipped with a nosemounted
gatling gun. Still, the Hind retained its transport capability; the Hind-E,
introduced in 1976, can carry up to ten troops with its full weapon load.
With its weaponry and heavy armor, the Hind is comparable to a very fast
and meneuverable flying armored personnel carrier.

In December of 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan under the pretenses of
an invitation by the Aghani government. By mid-January, the Soviets had
more than 75,000 troops in the country.

                                                                  [Page  95]

The Hind gunship was the workhorse of Soviet aviation in Afghanistan; nearly
200 of them were deployed by January of 1983. The Hind served in a role
similar to the Cobra in Vietnam, escorting troop transports in assault on
guerilla concentrations. But like the French in Algeria and the Americans in
Vietnam, the Soviets faced an enemy that enjoyed considerable freedom of
movement, superior knowledge of the terrain and had the will to fight. The
Mujahadeen also had U.S. made stinger anti-aircraft missiles, a great threat
to the Soviet helicopter forces.

One Soviet soldier said after the war, "You could tell when a landing zone
was really hot by the number of assault troops they put on a helicopter. The
more men a (Hind) had to land, the longer it was vulnerable to guerilla fire.
If you had four or five to a helicopter, it wasn't too bad. If you had two or
three to a helicopter, you knew it was really bad."

As the therat to Soviet helicopters increased, more and more infrared decoys
(essentially flares) were carried to draw away the Stingers of the Mujahadeen.
And the Soviets also reportedly deployed chemical weapons in large numbers
from Hinds.


Grenada - Operation Urgent Fury

In 1983, the U.S. and a coalition of Caribbean States invaded the isle of
Grenada to overthrow the oppressive Marxist military junta that had recently
taken power.

During the invasion, code-named Operation Urgen Fury, U.S. Army and
Marine forces met stiff resistance from Cuban "advisor" forces, and fought a
heavily armed and fortified force holed in the island's fortress prison. AH-1
Cobra gunships proved their versatility and, unfortunately, their 
vulnerability during engagements with these force. Army Cobras and Mrine
SeaCobras provided close air support and assaulted the fortress with TOW
missilis, but two of them were lost to ground fire.

Other Marine helicopter forces were used in the mission to rescue American
students at the St. George's Medical School. These Marine Sea Knights were
used as well for "vertical envelopment" assaults on the island in the early
stages of the operation.

Lasting only a few days, the operation is not considered to be one of the high
points in U.S. military history. It's generally felt that U.S. forces will

                                                                  [Page  96]

ill-prepared for the level of opposition, and rushed into the operation with
too little planning. In any event, its effects went a long way to shape the
future of helicopter operations.


The Apache is Born

In the early 70s, the U.S. Army sought a heavy gunship in the form of the
AH-56 Cheyenne. The program was cancelled, however, and for the remainder of
the decade, the only heavy helicopter gunships in the U.S. inventory were on
paper. The Cobra was called upon to fill the gap.

The 70s saw an increased emphasis on the anti-armor capability of the
helicopter gunship. With the addition of the TOW missile to the Cobra (and
later the SuperCobra), and similar weapons to the helicopters of other nations
the gunship was becoming a real "force multiplier", with greater anti-armor
capability than most ground units.

In 1976, the Hughes Aircraft design for the all-weather heavy helicopter
gunship, the AH-64 Apache. It would be stuck in development for another
six years before the production line got rolling. In the meantime, the U.S.
invaded Grenade in 1983. The Cobra provided the only dedicated gunship
capabilities available at the time.

Now fully operational, the Apache is the front-line anti-armor aircraft of the
U.S. Army. The AH-64 marks the true beginning of a new generation of
helicopter gunships - highly automated, heavily armed, and capable of combat
in all weather, night or day. While the airframe is essentially a conventional
helicopter, the advanced electronic systems about the Apache make it the link
to future helicopter gunships. It is being considered for a number of other
mission areas, including anti - ship missions.

There is still a great deal over debate as to which type of helicopter 
technology should be the basis of the next generation of gunship.

Panama - Operation Just Cause

In the early months of 1989, relations between the U.S. government and the
regime of General Manuel Noriege in Panama were rapidly deteriorating, and
by the end of spring, events had reached a flash-point. After a number of
violent incidents, including the killing of an off-duty American soldier by
Panamanian Defense Force (PDF) troops, the crisis escalated, and the United
States mounted an invasion of Panama to remove General Noriege and put the
elected president of Panama in power. Operation Just Cause, as the invasion

                                                                  [Page  97]

was called by the military, lasted only a few days, but it demonstrated the
lethality of modern weapons.

Operation Just Cause saw the first use of Apache helicopters in actual combat.
AH-64A Apaches were used in the attack on the PDF Commendancia in downtown
Panama City - the helicopters were used against targets on individual floors
of the building. Ground based laser designators were utilized to pinpoint
the targets for the deadly accurate Hellfire missiles.

While, there was no opposition to U.S. helicopters during the operation, the
Apache proved itself an effective weapon nonetheless.


The Persian Gulf - Operations Desert Storm and Sabre

The Apache would get its first real test on the battlefield during the quick
and bloody war with Iraq in January and February of 1991. On August 5, 1990,
Saddam Hussein's army invaded the city-state of Kuwait, and Hussein
proclaimed its annexation. The United States quickly mobilized a coalition of
nations to come to the defense of Saudi Arabia, and began putting pressure on
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.

By January, the United States had completed the largest deployment of troops
since Vietnam, and was ready to take back Kuwait by force, With the aid of
the British, Italian, French, Saudi and Kuwaiti air forces, an air offensive
was launched on January 16 against Iraqi forces in Kuwait and Iraq. Apache
gunships played a significant role in the early air campaign, attacking Iraqi
positions in Kuwait and Iraq.

The first mission for the AH-64 came during the first hours of the war. On the
night of January 17, Apaches were sent in to take out two Iraqi electronics
installations near the Saudi-Iraqi border. The Apaches launched Hellfire
missiles at several targets in Kuwait and Iraq, including mobile air defense
sites and electronic sites. All objective targets were destroyed. In some
cases, it was reported that Special Forces troops provided forward laser
designation for Hellfires launched by Apache gunships.

The night-fighting abilities of the Apache were used heavily during the first
phase of the war. Apaches were used against a variety of fortified targets
during night operations, including Iraqi artillery batteries and radar sites.
Iraqi forces attempted to begin the ground war on their own terms in early
February, by invading the Saudi coastal city of Kafji. Apache helicopters took

                                                                  [Page  98]

part in a night time assault on the Iraqi armored forces there, and during
combat accidentally fired on U.S. armored vehicles, killing two American
soldiers. This incident highlights the hazard of the modern battlefield, where
smoke, fire and darkness can make it difficult to separate the enemy from
friendlies on the ground.

With allied air superiority established, Apache gunships and other helicopter
forces raided the Iraqi rear at will. On February 20, OH-58D Kiowa Warriors
and AH-64A Apaches destroyed "fifteen to thirty" Iraqi bunkers in Kuwait, and
421 Iraqi soldiers surrendered to them. Only one US serviceman was killed in
the operation.

In the early hours of February 24, a combined allied air-ground offensive
began. The operation, code named Desert Sabre, lasted 100 hours, and nearly
completely destroyed the Iraqi armed forces in and near Kuwait. Apache and
Cobra gunships played an important part in the offensive, taking part in some
of the largest armored battles since World War Two. In fact, the first shots
fired during the operation were by Apache gunships.

The 1st Marine Division was assigned one of the more difficult missions of 
the offensive - a frontal assault on Iraqi defensive lines in Kuwait. After
punching through Iraqi fortifications, the division pushed on toward Kuwait
City. In a battle with an Iraqi armored brigade and mechanized infantry
brigade near the Burquan oil fields, Marine AH-1W SuperCobras and ground 
forces destroyed about 30 enemy vehicles. This battle proved to be only a
prelude to the tank battle that would follow at Kuwait International Airport,
where an estimated 310 Iraqi tanks were destroyed.

To the west, the 101st Airborne began a heliborne assault into Iraq, with over
460 Blackhawk, Apache and other helicopters. Their operation, nicknamed 
"Cobra", severed Iraqi roads along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and cut
off the only Iraqi escape route to the north.

On February 28, the operation ended, having taken over 80,000 Iraqi POWs and
having destroyed or "rendered ineffective" at least 40 of the 42 Iraqi
divisions. No US aircraft were downed during the last phase of the war - a
tribute to the level of organization planning employed and to the men and
women that took part in the operation

The operation more than reaffirmed the role of the helicopter in modern
combat operations.

                                                                  [Page  99]

The U.S. Army

Today, the Army deploys its helicopters as integral parts of nearly every type
of division, from light infantry to heavy armor. As a result, the battlefield
commander of any Army formation will have some "organic air support" within
his assets. The highest concentration of helicopters of all types is within
the airborne and air assault divisions; within a typical air assault division,
for example, there is one full squadron of air cavalry and an aviation
brigade consisting of eight helicopter battalions.

The air cavalry squadron's primary missions are "airmobility" and 
reconnaissance, so its aircraft will be of the troop transport variety - the
UH-60 Blackhawks and probably a few UH-1 Hueys. In addition, the squadron will
have some AH-1 Cobra gunships for escort and air reconnaissance.

A squadron will usually have about 950 soldiers assigned to it; 70 
commissioned officers, 100 warrant officers and 780 enlisted men. These 
personnel are divided among the squadron's four "troops" and headquarters
"troop." A single troop of air cavalry will have about 200 men assigned, with
15 commissioned officers and 32 warrant officers among them.

The aviation brigade within an air assault division is made up of some 1000
personnel, and is broken down into four mission groups: assault, medium lift,
command, and attack. Two assault helicopter battalions are dedicated to the
combat troop transport mission, and arre equipped with UH-60's. The medium
lift helicopter battalion, equipped with CH-47 Chinook cargo helicopters, 
provides logistical air support for the division, while the command helicopter
battalion provides administrative, scouting, and command and control support
for the division commander with its UH-1 Hueys and OH-58 Kiowa scouts.

The other four battalions of helicopters in the aviation brigade are attack
helicopter battalions. These units are equipped with a mixture of aircraft,
including AH-64 Apaches, OH-58 Kiowas and probably some AH-1S SuperCobras.
These units are manned by some 20 commissioned officers, 44 warrant officers,
and 177 enlisted men per battalion.

In addition to these air assets, the division will also have an air ambulance
company assigned to its medical battalion, equipped with UH-60 and UH-1
helicopters and dedicated to air medical evacuation.

The number and type of helicopters that are assigned to a unit may vary with
the theater of operation that they are assigned to and their level of
readiness.

                                                                  [Page 100]

There are large numbers of helicopters considered "obsolete" for front line
troops that have been widely spread through the Army's aviation reserve
units. As demonstrated during Operations Desert Shield, Storm & Sabre, these
units may quickly find themselves on or near the front line of any conflict
of arms.

The number and type of helicopters assigned to a mission group during
operations will also vary widely, depending on the theater of operations, the
mission objective, and other forces deployed in the area. For example, a
formation of Apaches may be supported by Special Forces units on the ground
(with laser designators for their Hellfire missiles), or they may need a Kiowa
scout configured for laser designation to accompany them if there are no
forward forces to support them. The terrain, battlefield conditions, and
weather may all be factors in deciding the number and type of aircraft to
assign to any specific mission.

                                                                  [Page 101]

FLYING THE HELICOPTER

Flying a helicopter is a lesson in the physics of vectors. It places a great
demand on the ability of the pilot to simultaneously control each of the
factors affecting the flight of his aircraft. The following material only
begins to scratch the surface of the intricacies of rotary-wing flight.


The Basic Forces

The four basic forces, or vectors, that act on all aircraft are gravity
(which pulls the craft down), lift (which pushes it up), thrust (which moves
the craft horizontally), and drag (resistance against thrust). These four 
forces, and to what degree they act on an aircraft determine if and how well
if flies. Changing vectors that act on an aircraft and, consequently, change
its flight characteristics.


Lift, Thrust and the Helicopter

Helicopters and airplanes both get their lift from an airfoil - a shape that
creates lift from relative motion through the air. An airfoil is shaped so
that air moving across the top of it must travel farther than air crossing
along its bottom; this creates a condition known as the Venturi Effect, in
which an area of low air pressure is created above the airfoil. As a result,
the airfoil is drwan upward into the low pressure area, creating a lifting
force.

Conventional airplanes depend on the relative motion of air across their
fixed wings, caused by forward motion, to create the lift necessary for them
to get and ramain airborne. As a result, lift for an airplane follows the
thrust of its engines; the more thrust available, the more lift an airplane
can get out of its wings, or the less wing surface it needs to generate
that lift.

Helicopters, on the other hand, get all of their lift and thrust from one
source - the rotor blades; these are the helicopter's "wings". Since the
helicopter spins its lifting surfaces through the air, it creates the relative
motion necessary to generate lift without having to move the whole helicopter
through the air. This is why helicopters can hover and maneuver at low speeds.

Unlike the wing of an airplane, the blades of a helicopter's rotor are
symmetrical - the top and bottom of each blade is shaped the same. Thus, if
they were allowed to spin perfectly flat, they would provide no lift at all.
The difference in surface area needed to create lift is achieved by changing

                                                                  [Page 102]

the pitch, or angle of the blades. By increasing the tilt of the rotor blades,
a helicopter can essentially take a bigger "bite" out of the air and create
more lift.

The helicopter's directional thrust - the force that moves it horizontally -
is created by tilting the plane of the rotor blades' spin. When the rotor is
tilted, it pulls the helicopter in the direction of the tilt, as well as
providing lift.

There are four basic configurations for helicopter rotors. The most common is
what the Britis call "penny and farthing" - the single overhead rotor with a
smaller stabilizing tail rotor. The smaller rotor counteracts the torque
generated by the main rotor. Another common rotor configuration is the twin
tandem - two rotor, one forward and one aft. The rotors revolve in opposite
directions to counter act each other's torque.

The twin side-by-side is not very common among military helicopters. In this
configurations, the rotors are mounted on the side of the helicopter, and 
often intermesh. Several commercial helicopters manufactured by Kaman used
this design. The coaxial rotor configuration is most commonly used by
Soviet helicopter designers, and can be seen in the Hormone, Helix and the new
Hokum helicopters. Two counter-rotating sets of rotor blades revolve about the
same axis, counteracting each other's torque.


Dissymetry and Asymmetry of Lift

Since a helicopter's rotor blades spin about an axis, the relative speed of 
air over the rotor blades is slower toward the inside of the blade and faster
toward the tip of the blade. This means that a greater amount of lift will be
created at the tips of the blades, so the blades will tend to bend up at the
ends. This phenomena is known as dissymetry of lift.

Also, if the helicopter is moving forward, one side of the rotor (the side
spinning toward the direction of movement) will have a higher relative air

                                                                  [Page 103]

speed than the other (spinning away from the direction of movement). This
effect is called asymmetry of lift. The effect, first noted by Juan de la
Cierva during his development of the autogiro in the 1920's, tends to make
rotary-winged aircraft roll to one side unless it is compensated for. In most
cases, helicopter designers have adjusted to this effect by hinging the
blades, allowing them to rise slightly while they spin forward.


Torque

Since the helicopter's rotor blades are spinning, another force is exerted on
the helicopter - torque. When a helicopter has only one rotor, the torque
generated by that rotor tends to turn the helicopter in a direction opposite
of the spin of the rotor blades. This is counteracted in most helicopters by
a tail rotor, which pushes back against the torque. In helicopters with two
rotor blades, the rotors spin in opposite directions and the torque is
cancelled out.

Torque can also be used to the helicopter's advantage. Torque, in conjunction
with the tail rotor, can be used to help turn the helicopter in flight, and
pivot the helicopter about its axis when it's hovering.

                                                                  [Page 104]

Blade Stall and Air Compressibility

There are two properties of helicopter flight which significantly limit the
top speed of all helicopters. The first of these is called blade stall. As a
helicopter accelerates its forward flight, its rotor tilts forward, adding
thrust. As it does so, the angle of attack, or the angle of the blades in 
releation to the direction of flight of the "retreating" blades becomes
steeper. When the helicopter exceeds its maximum speed, this angle becomes
too great, and the retreating blades stall - they cease to provide lift - just
as an airplane stalls when flying at too low a speed.

The second speed-limiting factor affecting helicopters is the compressibility
of air. The faster the rotor spins, the greater the airspeed of the advancing
blades; when the relative speed of the advancing rotor blades exceeds the
speed of sound, a wave of compressed air, known as a shock wave, forms in 
front of the blades, increasing the drag on the blades and possibly decreasing
lift.

                                                                  [Page 105]

The Controls

A helicopter requires both hands (and both feet) on the controls at all times.
Helicopters are controlled in flight by three pilot "inputs": the cyclic and
collective sticks (which occupy the hands), and the rudder pedals (which are
controlled by the feet of the pilot).

The cyclic controls the "attitude" of the helicopter - its direction and
degree of tilt. This affects the horizontal direction and speed of flight, by
adjusting the direction of thrusts from the rotor. Direction of flight as
controlled by the cyclic is independent of heading (the direction the 
helicopter is pointing); this enables a helicopter to fly forward, backward or
sideways.

The collective controls the lifting and thrusting force of the rotor blades by
altering their pitch - taking a bigger or smaller bite out of the air. While
the helicopter is in a hover, the collective controls the vertical thrust 
(lift) of the helicopter. The collective is often combined with, and always
used in conjunction with the engine throttle, to adjust the engine's power to
the demand of the collective.

The rudder pedals control the heading of the helicopter - the direction it 
points in. Using the pedals, a pilot can turn a helicopter about the axis of
its rotor blades while in a hover. Using the foot pedals in combination with
the cyclic control when the helicopter is in forward flight enables it to make
a very tight turn.


Hovering

To hover a helicopter, the cyclic must be held at center, so that the
helicopter does not gain airspeed in any direction. The collective controls
keep the helicopter at a constant altitude, while the rudder pedals keep
the helicopter pointed in one direction. Since the air is a dynamic 
environment, the pilot must constantly adjust these controls to maintain the
hover.

When a helicopter is in a hover or in slow forward flight close to the ground,
it creates an effect known as ground cushion. Air forced down by the rotors
cannot escape quickly and is compressed between the helicopter and the
ground. This, in turn, increases the efficiency of the helicopter's engine
and rotor blades.

                                                                  [Page 106]

Accelerating Forward

To accelerate a helicopter forward from a hover, the pilot pushes the cyclic
forward and pulls up on the collective. More lift is generated by the rotors
as the collective is pulled up, and this lift is converted to forward
thrust as the rotor (and the helicopter) is tilted forward by the collective.

As the helicopter shifts from a hover to forward flight, the helicopter 
settles toward the ground. This is because of a slight loss of lift as some of
the helicopter's lift is converted to thrust, and as it "slips off" the ground
cushion. But when the helicopter has gained some forward momentum, it also
gains what is called "translational lift" - the additional lift generated by
the relative motion created in horizontal flight. As the helicopter 
accelerates forward, the translational lift grows. However, this additional
lifiting efficiency is cancelled out by other effects once the helicopter
reaches about 90 kts forward speed.


Level Flight

When the helicopter is in straight, level flight, the cyclic controls airspeed
for the most part, while the collective maintains altitude. When climbing or
descending, the cyclic maintains the airspeed of the helicopter while the
collective increases or decreases lift as required. Since an increase or
decrease in collective often corresponds with an increase or decrease in
throttle, the torque of the helicopter may increase or decrease during 
altitude changes. This means the rudder pedals need to be adjusted constantly
to match the torque on the helicopter.


Takeoff and Landing

Helicopter takeoff usually consists of two maneuvers - going into a hover, and
forward, climbing flight. First, the pilot lifts off the ground vertically
using increased throttle and collective, maintaining horizontal position as in
a hover but adding more collective to pull the aircraft upward. Then, the
pilot pushes the cyclic forward and pulls up on the collective to attain 
airspeed and climb to altitude.

Whenever possible, helicopter takeoff should be done into the wind, to
prevent drift during takeoff. The pilot should also pick some reference point
on the ground to keep his heading steady on during initial acceleration.

Landing is essentially a reverse process - descending forward flight to a 
point above the landing point, and a gradually descending hover to the ground.
All descent should be stopped when the helicopter goes into the hover.

The helicopter should not be allowed to drift horizontally while touching

                                                                  [Page 107]

down, as it could easily tip over. This could lead to the pilot and crew
eating pieces of shattered rotor blade. Also, it is important that the 
collective be handled gently during landing, as too rapid a descent can prove
dangerous. At best, a very expensive aircraft is bounced off the ground, and
several vertebrae are compressed.


"Stepping on the Brakes"

There may be occasion where it becomes necessary to rapidly slow down 
horizontal flight - a large, impassable obstacle ahead, or some other
condition that might have a negative impact on the service life of the
helicopter. In such a situation, care should be taken by the pilot to maintain
altitude and avoid wild changes in heading. Coordinated, simultaneous use of
the controls is essential.

To "put on the brakes", the pilot lets down on the collective and pulls back
on the cyclic at the same time, while adjusting the rudder to prevent a wild
swing in heading. As the helicopter slows to the desired speed, the pilot
levels the craft by pushing forward on the cyclic (to prevent the helicopter
from settling tail-first and hiting the ground) and adjusting the collective
(to maintain altitude).

                                                                  [Page 108]

HELICOPTER TACTICS

One of the great handicaps of helicopter combat is that there is nowhere to
hide in the sky. Anti-aircraft artillery (AAA), surface-to-air missiles,
helicopters, and ground fire from small automatic weapons can swat a 
helicopter from the sky. With the wide proliferation of man-portable, high-
tech weapons like the Stinger, SA-7 Grail, and SA-14 Gremlin missiles, the
open skies are an even more dangerous place for slow-flying helicopters than
before. To survive, the pilot must be able to use the unique flight
characteristics of the helicopter to his advantage.

One of the most commonly used defensive maneuvers for helicopters is nap-of-
the-earth (NOE) flying. In this type of flying, the helicopter follows the
contour of the earth, in almost all respects becoming a ground vehicle. This
type of flight demands a great deal of skill. But if the pilot doesn't hit a
tree or hill, he gains a great deal more security on the battlefield from SAMs
and AAA. Exposure to fire from enemy units is minimized because the helicopter
is masked by the terrain for a majority of its flight, and the helicopter
gains a degree of surprise.


Helicopter VS. Tanks and Ground Units

The maneuverability of helicopters gives them the best of both worlds when it
comes to combat with ground forces; they can use the terrain to their
advantage, and then fly above it when it becomes an impediment. This ability
gives the helicopter gunship the ability to ambush enemy ground forces 
whenever the terrain permits.

Ambush tactics for gunships date back to the Vietnam War, when Huey Cobras
patrolled the Ho Chi Minh trail. The most common ambush maneuver is the
"pop-up" - the helicopter masks itself behind a tree line, house, or other

                                                                  [Page 109]

terrain feature, and then "pops up" from behind its hiding place to deliver
the attack. The usual minimum number of helicopters for an ambush attack is
three, bu NATO doctrine.

A "pop-up" is only necessary to use direct-fire weapons - weapons that require
the target to be in a line of sight. With the Apache's Hellfire laser-guided
anti-tank missiles, the Apache does not even need to pop up. Another
helicopter or a forward observer can designate the target with a laser, and
the Apache can fire from cover.

Another weapon that offers virtually no exposure time to enemy fire is the
sub-munition-type anti-armor system attack. This attack relies on a pattern of
multi-purpose bomblets from exploding unguided rockets. The helicopter
makes its approach shielded by the terrain, then pulls up and fires, and turns
toward the rear, immediately returning to NOE flight to avoid enemy fire.


Helicopter VS. Helicopter

The first all-helicopter dogfight on record occured during the Iran-Iraq war,
when an Iraqi Hind shot down an Iranian Cobra. Even before this event, it
was widely assumed that in any large-scale conflict of the future, helicopters
would meet other helicopters in air combat. The Soviets have even designed a
helicopter for the single purpose of air-to-air combat operations (the Hokum).

Helicopter-to-helicopter combat tactics are an evolution of the combat tactics
used first by fighter pilots in World War One. The unique maneuvering 
abilities of the helicopter add some considerations to the equation, but the
old problems are essentially the same - how to convert velocity and altitude 
into a shooting position.

                                                                  [Page 110]

If approached from behind, the first instinct of many helicopter pilots is to
brake hard to force the enemy to overshoot. To recover from an overshoot,
helicopter pilots have developed a maneuver known as the "High Yo-Yo." When 
the target brakes, the attacker pulls up hard to avoid an overshoot, 
converting airspeed into altitude, and then maneuvers to the "six-o'clock"
position (directly behind the target) and drops down for the attack.

Rather than braking hard, a pilot finding himself in front of an oncoming
attacker might execute a maneuver known as the "Horizontal Scissors." In this
maneuver, the pilot turns hard to one side and reduces forward velocity. The
attacker is forced to turn to follow, and the pilot then turns hard in the
opposite direction. The attacker is forced to reverse his turn and is forced 
out in front of the defender, who is now in a position to take a shot.

When faced with an attacker in close proximity, a helicopter pilot can use a
manevuer developed by the U.S. Marines known as the "Side Flare Quick Stop."
The pilot pulls up hard and flares to one side, forcing the attacker to
overshoot. Now behind the opponent, the pilot dives down into the six-o'clock
position and has the enemy in his sights.

When meeting an adversary from an opposite direction, a pilot can use a
maneuver known as a "Stern Conversion." The pilot accelerates and performs a
hard, banking turn called a "wing-over" (similar to the maneuver used in 
World War Two movies by pilots turning out of formation for an attack run).
The pilot then performs a turning dive into attack position behind the enemy
aircraft.

                                                                  [Page 111]

As of yet, these tactics are fairly theoretical - none have been truly proven
in combat. But it is clear that pilots will use some derivative of the them
in any future conflict where helicopters meet over the battlefield.

                                                                  [Page 112]

                          4. EQUIPMENT AND ORGANISATION


DATA FORMAT


All are expressed in metric measurements. Metric measurements are used because
most armies, including the U.S. Army, utilize the metric system.


Length, Width, Height, Weight and Diameter

Vehicles list fully loaded combat weights. Aircraft list maximum take-off
weights.


Crew/Pass

The "crew" is the normal fighting complement of the vehicle or aircraft - the
men who remain aboard in combat situations.

While most all vehicles can carry passengers in some form or another, only
those that are specifically built for transport, or provide a modicum of cover
list passengers. The "passengers" frequently dismount in combat.


Engine

The horsepower (hp) and type of the main (engine(s). Helicopter engines are
rated in "shaft horsepower" (shp). Fixed-wing aircraft engines are rated in
"pounds of static thrust" (lb st). "AB" indicates afterburner capability.


Max Speed

For vehicles, this is maximum rated road speed in kilometers per hour (kph).
For aircraft and ships, this is the maximum level speed in knots (kts) at sea
level.


Rate of Climb

For helicopters, this is the vertical rate of climb from hover in feet per
second (ft/sec). In most case, the maximum rate of climb is about twice this
value.


Service Ceiling

The maximum attainable altitude with a nominal weapon load. The Rules of
Engagement (ROE) for a Theater of Operations (TO) normally limit the
maximum altitude to a much lower value.


Main Gun

The size and type of the main gun, if any. All guns are rifled unless "SB"
(smoothbore) is indicated. For guns other than machine-guns (MG), the
number of rounds carried (rds) is also indicated.


Missiles

The name and type of missile carried. Aircraft and ships will also list the
predominate non-missile weapons. Please note that other weapon systems could
also be carried.


Weapon Load

For aircraft, this is the maximum weapon load. More often than not, aircraft
fly with less than their rated maximum load.

                                                                  [Page 116]

Sec Guns

Many vehicles mount one or more secondary weapons, usually machine-guns, for
local ground and air defense.


Armor

Vehicle armor thickness is expressed as Heavy, Medium, Light or None.


What's in a Name

You may wonder where the Soviets came up with all those weird names? Well,
the names listed for most of the Soviet equipment are in reality NATO
designations, not the real Soviet names. These NATO designations utilize the
first letter of the unit's type to formulate the name. That's why Soviet 
fighter aircraft have names beginning with an "F", helicopters with an "H",
air-to-air missiles with an "A", and so on.

The reason is twofold. First of all, the Russian language is not that easy to
read or pronounce; secondly, the actual names are sometimes not known until
years after the unit has been spotted or released - afterall, you have to call
it something.

                                                                  [Page 117]

YOUR HELICOPTERS AND WEAPON SYSTEMS

AH-64A Apache Gunship

In the mid-1960s, after the AH-56 Cheyenne program failed to meet required
developmental specifications (too expensive and too complex), the US Army was
left without an advanced attack helicopter. At that time, the AH-1 Cobra was
considered to be only a near-term step. The search continued, and the contract
for the Apache was finally awared in 1976; the first Apache entered service in
1986. The Apache is now considered to be the premier helicopter gunship.

Avionics: Includes a full suite of advanced communication systems, 
navigational flight aids and survivability systems. The target aquisition/
designation sight and pilot's night vision sensor (TADS/PNVS) are the heart
of the avionics package. These linked systems include an auto-focus thermal
imager, laser ranger/designator and TV camera. Both are integrated into a
helmet-mounted sighting system. IR signature is reduced by the Black Hole
System. An airborne target handoff subsystem (ATHS) data link is also included

AH-64B Longbow Apache Gunship

A natural follow-on to the AH-64A, the Longbow Apache will feature a number of
mid-life product improvements, but will be built around the new millimeter-
wave radar guided Hellfire weapon system. This system includes an integrated
mast-mounted sight. The MMW Hellfire is a true fire-and-forget weapon. Its
seeker head will guide itself to the target; a target designator is not 
required. It's also longer ranged, and suffer less degradation from rain, fog
and smoke than FLIR's & thermal imagers. These upgrades will make the Longbow
Apache and the Comanche unbeatable stable mates.

Avionics: Will be an upgrade to the current Apache systems, but changes will
mainly involve the target type discriminating MMW systems and related
subsystems.

AH-1W SuperCobra Gunship

The first AH-1 Cobra was built from the UH-1 Huey airframe, and saw combat in
Vietnam. The Cobra has gone through many modifications and model changes. The
"W" model is the SuperCobra on or about the "S" model). While it's currently
only fielded by the US Marines, the US Army is soon expected to upgrade to
"W" standards.

Avionics: Includes a full suite of communication systems, navigational flight
aids and survivability systems. The nose mounted night targeting system (NTS)
includes a FLIR, laser ranger/designator and TOW fire controls. This system

                                                                  [Page 119]

is integrated with the helmet-mounted sighting system. An airborne target
handoff subsystem (ATHS) data link is also included.

Engine:            two 1,690 shp


AH-66A Comanche Gunship/Scout Helicopter

In 1982 the US Army invited manufacturers to submin design concepts for its
Light Helicopter experimental (LHX) program. The original procurement called
for 5,000 units to replace UH-1, AH-1, OH-58 and OH-6 airframes; this was
later revised to 2,096 units (the UH-1 Huey follow-on was eliminated). The
LHX, now designated the AH-66A Comanche, will feature many advances in
helicopter technology, including all-composite airframe construction, advanced
bearingless rotor system, internal weapons bay and retractable landing gear.
Stealth technologies will be employed where feasible. Its tandem cockpit
seats the pilot in the front seat, as in jet aircraft.

Avionics: Includes the most advanced systems to date. All will be fly-by-wire
technology. All systems are integrated into the wide field-of-view helmet
sighting/targeting system. MFD's will dominate the console, and the 
architecture will be of the same generation as US Air Force's Advanced
Tactical Fighter (ATF).

                                                                  [Page 120]

OH-58D Kiowa Warrior Scout Helicopter

The first OH-58's saw service in the Vietnam War. It had been selected as the
replacement for the OH-6 Cayuse. It also has seen great commercial success as
the JetRanger. The Kiowa Warrior is considered to be only the near-term scout
helicopter. It's scheduled to be replaced in the mid-1990s by the AH-66A
Comanche, The US Army plans to field a total of 477 OH-58D's, by upgrading
OH-58A models to OH-58D standards.

Avionics: Mast-mounted sight includes auto-focusing thermal imager, laser
ranger/designator and TV camera. The airborne target handoff subsystem (ATHS)
enables remote targeting for the Hellfire missile.

UH-60K/L Blackhawk Assault Helicopter

As a replacement for the UH-1 Iroquois Transport Helicopter (the famous Huey),
the Blackhawk entered service in 1979. Designed primarily to transport 11 
fully equipped troops, its spacious cabin enables it to also be used, without
modification, for medevac, supply and command functions. The external stores
support system (ESSS) can carry a significant number of weapons. The "K" &
"L" models entered service in 1988.

Avionics: Includes a full suite of communication systems, navigational flight
aids, including advanced AFCS subsystem, and survivability systems. UHF 
satellite communication is also available. IR signature is reduced by the
hover infrared suppressor (HIRSS) system.

AH-6G Defender Light Gunship/Scout Helicopter

The original Defender dates back to the Vietnam War, where it saw action as
the OH-6A Cayuse LOH (Light Observation Helicopter - "Loach"). The AH-6G is
based on the commercial MD530 helicopter. A compact integrated crew station
with multiple MFD's enhances this helicopter's field of view. It's designed
primarily for day or night point attack and antiarmor missions, but is 
equally suitable for scout missions.

Avionics: Includes a full suite of communication systems, navigational flight
aids and survivability systems. Mast-mounted sight includes FLIR, laser
ranger and TOW fire controls.

                                                                  [Page 122]

M197 20mm Gatling Gun

Primary armament on the SuperCobra. The M197 is a lightweight, externally
powered 3-barrelled variation of the M61A1 20mm Vulcan 6-barrelled fighter
aircraft weapon. It uses the gatling gun principle of rotating barells
around a common axis. This makes for a high rate-of-fire and limits jamming.

Weight:               66 kg

Rate-of-Fire:         3,000 rpm

Aiming Mechanism:     Helmet Mounted Sight or Gunner's Sight

SUU-11B/A Minigun Pod

The minigun is a 7.62mm development of the M61A1 20mm Vulcan 6-barrelled 
gatling gun. It's available as a wing mounted pod weapon on the Blackhawk,
SuperCobra, Kiowa Warrior or Defender, and it's also the fixed gun weapon on
the Defender. It provides excellent area suppressive fire for a small cost
in weight.

Weight:               147 kg, with 1,500 rds

Rate-of-Fire:         2,000/4,000 rpm

GPU-2/A Gun Pod

The GPU-2/A is basically a M197 20mm 3-barrelled gatling gun in pod form. It's
totally self-contained unit with gun and ammunition. It even has its own
rechargeable power source. All the pilot needs to do is aim and fire. It's
available as a wing mounted pod weapon on the Blackhawk, SuperCobra, Kiowa
Warrior or Defender.

Weight:               270 kg, with 300 rds

Rate-of-Fire:         1,500 rpm

Aiming Mechanism:     Direct fire along axis of flight

Primary Target:       Lightly armored or unprotected targets


Viper 20mm Gatling Gun

Primary armament on the Comanche. The Viper is a lightweight 2-barrelled 
cannon. It uses an all new configuration, but is still based on the gatling
gun principle of rotating barrels around a common axis. It's speculated that
it fires a more effective round of ammunition than the standard M197 20mm
cannon round.

Weight:               50 kg

Rate-of-Fire:         2,000 rpm

Aiming Mechanism:     Helmet Mounted Sight

Primary Target:       Lightly armored or unprotected targets


AIM-92 Stinger AAM

Primary Target:       short range, low-flying targets


AIM-9R Sidewinder AAM

The Sidewinder missile dates back to the late 1940s, when it was first
developed by the US Navy. The current model bears little resemblance to the
original other than in outward appearence. It has gone through innumerable
changes in its lifetime. The "R" model has an all-aspect seeker head and
improved low-smoke rocket engine.

Weight:               87 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 18 km

Guidance System:      IR homing

Primary Target:       All airborne targets


AGM-122 Sidearm AGM

The Sidearm system evolved out of the need to develop a low cost, lightweight
anti-radar missile. Unused Sidewinder AIM-9C's were refurbished and brought up
to AIM-9L/M standards, and a broadband passive radar seeker replaced the
existing seeker. It will be carried by AV-8B Harriers, F-4G Phantom Wild
Weasels, and helicopters.

Weight:               91 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 15 km

Guidance System:      Passive radar homing

Primary Target:       SAM & gun control radars

                                                                  [Page 126]

AGM-65D Maverick AGM

The Maverick "D" model entered service in 1983, and was a naturaly follow-on
to this very successful weapon. It has replaced the earlier "TV" guidance
system with an imaging infrared system. The IR system has a much greater
range and has ability to "see" through smoke and dust. Maverick is a true
fire-and-forget weapon system.

Weight:               220 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 25 km

Guidance System:      IR homing

Primary Target:       Heavily armored targets & fortifications


AGM-114A/B Hellfire AGM

Hellfire is the US Army's latest anti-armor weapon system. The "A" model's
laser seeker requires the target to be illuminated by a laser source; however,
it need not be the launching helicopter. The "B" model's millimeter wave radar
seeker is a true fire-and-forget weapon system. It will be carried by the
Longbow Apache.

Weight:               43 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 6 km (A), 8 km (B)

Guidance System:      semi-active laser (A), MMW Radar (B)

Primary Target:       Heavily armored tarets & fortifications


BGM-71D TOW-2 AGM

The TOW system has been utilized as an airborne ATGM since the Vietnam war.
It (SACLOS) uses semi-automatic command to line-of-sight guidance. All the
operator need to do is keep the cross-hair centered on the target. Commands
are transmitted to the TOW via a thin wire. The TOW-2 model has a larger,
improved warhead.

Weight:               22 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 4 km

Guidance System:      Command to Line-of-Sight via Wire

Primary Target:       Heavily armored targets & fortifications

                                                                  [Page 127]

Helstreak HVM AGM/AAM

The Helstreak High Velocity Missile (HVM) system is based on the British
Starstreak SAM. It's laser guided warhead contains three accurate darts that
independently home in on the target. This makes for a wide coverage pattern,
which is important in the air-to-air role. With HUMs, exposure time is
reduced.

Weight:               40 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 7 km

Guidance System:      semi-active laser homing

Primary Target:       Medium armored ground & air targets


Penguin-3 Anti-Ship Misisle

The Norweigian developed Penguin-3 anti-ship missile's modest weight (as far
as anti-ship missiles go) makes it ideally suited for helicopters. The missile
is aimed at a point on the surface, and it flies there under its own inertial
guidance. Then, it switches on its IR homer, seeking out the heat of a ship
against the cool ocean background.

Weight:               380 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 40 km

Guidance System:      IR homing

Primary Target:       Medium & Light ships

                                                                  [Page 128]

Hydra 70 Rocket System

The Hydra 70 rocket System (the 70 = 70mm, or 2.75 in) is a series of rockets
each with a special purpose warhead. The M261 has a sub-munition multipurpose
warhead. The M247 has a shaped-charge warhead for use against armored targets.
The M255 has a flechette warhead for use against unarmored targets or 
Helicopters.

Weight:               9 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 2-3 km

Guidance System:      Unguided

Primary Target:       Varies by Warhead Type

                                                                  [Page 129]

THE GROUND AND AIR UNITS


U.S AND ALLIED UNITS

The friendlies and not so friendlies. These are the predominate vehicles,
aircraft and ships you'll cross paths with throughout your missions. While
you'll certainly come across many other units (e.g. trains, trucks, buildings,
bridges, oil tanks and airfields), they're just too numerous to mention.


M1A1 "Abrams" Main Battle Tank

Unquestionably the finest tank in the field today, the M1A1 entered service in
1985. It mounts the hard-hitting German Rheinmetall 120mm smoothbore cannon
(same as the German Leopard-2) backed by a sophisticated fire control system.
Later versions have depleted uranium (DU) armor added to the turret and hull
fronts.

Weight:        57.2 tons            Main Gun:    120mm SB, 40 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        1,500 hp turbine     Sec Gun:     three MG's

Speed:         64 kph               Armor:       Heavy


M60A3 Main Batle Tank

The M60A3 lineage dates from the venerable M47s and M48s. An earlier model,
the M60A1, saw great success in the hands of the Israelis. It's slow and tall
by today's standards (not a good combination), but still possesses reasonably
good armor and firepower. It's also fielded by Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

Weight:        52.6 tons            Main Gun:    105mm, 63 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/2                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        750 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         48 kph               Armor:       Heavy

                                                                  [Page 130]

Challenger Main Battle Tank

The British began design work on a replacement for the Chieftain in the late
1960s. The final concept took a round-about route, as the Challenger is 
essentially the Iranian Shir-2. It was designed by the British, for, at that
time, the Shah led Iran, but the Ayatollah had a different opinion about
buying tanks from the British.

Weight:        62 tons              Main Gun:    120mm, 64 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        1,200 hp diesel      Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         56 kph               Armor:       Heavy


AMX-30 Main Battle Tank

A French design, the AMX-30 entered production in 1966. Emphasizing the
predominate European theories of the time, its design embraces speed and
firepower, as armor was considered a secondary factor. The AMX-30 is also
fielded by a number of middle eastern nations including Saudi Arabia and
Qatar.

Weight:        36 tons              Main Gun:    105mm, 47 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        720 hp multi-fuel    Sec Gun:     one cannon, one MG

Speed:         65 kph               Armor:       Medium


M2A1 "Bradley" Infantry Fighting Vehicle

The first Bradleys entered active service in 1983 after a protracted 
developmental period; the need was first identified in 1963. Its 25mm 
"Bushmaster" chaingun (a relative of the 30mm chaingun mounted on the AH-64
Apache) fires highly effective depleted uranium shells; TOW ATGM's provide
the long-range hitting power.

                                                                  [Page 131]

Weight:        22.6 tons            Main Gun:    25mm, 900 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/7                  Missiles:    TOW-2,7 rds

Engine:        500 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         66 kph               Armor:       Light


Warrior Mechanized Combat Vehicle

In the 1970 the Brit's embarked on a program to develop a mechanized combat
vehicle. Somewhat austere by US standards, the Warrior lacks long-range
missile capability, and has relatively simple fire control systems. But, it's
relatively inexpensive, and quite sound mechanically. The Warrior entered
service in 1987.

Weight:        24.5 tons            Main Gun:    30mm, 228 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/7                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        550 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         72 kph               Armor:       Light


M113A3 Armored Personnel Carrier

The profilic M113 series was originally designed in 1956, and entered service
in 1960. The A3 version entered production in 1987. The M113 is a "battle-
taxi", designed to only transport the infantry into the general vicinity of 
the battle. Over 75,000 have been produced. It's used by many middle eastern
nations.

Weight:        12.1 tons            Main Gun:    12,7mm MG       

Crew/Pass:     2/10                 Missiles:    None

Engine:        275 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         64 kph               Armor:       Light

                                                                  [Page 132]

Scorpion Reconnaissance Vehicle

Born out of a British study conducted in the 1950s, the Scorpion entered 
British service in 1972. Its excellent cross-county performance and high
speed make for the ideal recon vehicle. The scorpion's basic design has
spawned 7 follow-on vehicles. It's also fielded by Saudi Arabia, UAE and Oman.

Weight:        8.1 tons             Main Gun:    76mm, 40 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        190 hp petrol        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         81 kph               Armor:       Light


Scimitar Reconnaissance Vehicle

A descendant of the Scorpion, the Scimitar followed it into service one year
later. The two vehicles differ primarily only in their armament. The Scimitar
is intended to provide area suppressive fire, while still having the
penetrative power to engage opposing recon and light vehicles.

Weight:        7.8 tons             Main Gun:    30mm, 165 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        190 hp petrol        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         81 kph               Armor:       Light


M901A2 ITV Anti-Tank Vehicle

The ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle) entered service in 1979 as a replacement for
the M150 open-topped TOW vehicle. It's a M113A2 fitted with the Emerson M27
TOW cupola. The M27 mounts a twin launcher, TOW guidance systems and a thermal
imager. The TOW's can be fired and reloaded from "under armor".

Weight:        13.0 tons            Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    TOW-2, 12 rds

Engine:        215 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         55 kph               Armor:       Light

                                                                  [Page 133]

M163A2 PIVADS Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun

The M163 entered service in 1968; the PIVADS (Product Improved Vulcan Air
Defense System) came on to the scene in 1984. The system is an M113A1 chassis
with a one-man electrically-driven turret. The 20mm gatling gun is the same
as used by Air Force Fighters. Even with its high rate of fire, it's very
limited.

Weight:        12.3 tons            Main Gun:    20mm, 2100 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        215 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         68 kph               Armor:       Light


M998 "Hummer" Utility Vehicle

The multi-purpose "Hummer" entered service as a replacement for the famous and
ubiquitous Jeep (M151). The Hummer fulfills many rolse, serving as an APC,
Scout, TWO platform and fire support vehilce. To date, over 100,000 have
been ordered for various branches of the US Armed Forces.

Weight:        2.3 tons             Main Gun:    12.7mm MG       

Crew/Pass:     2/4                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        132 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         105 kph              Armor:       None

M109A3 Self-Propelled Artillery Vehicle

The M109 concept dates back to 1952, when it was born out of a study on
self-propelled artillery. The lessons learned in WW2 and Korea clearly spelled
the ultimate demise of static artillery. The M109 series emerged as the 
standard by which all other "SP's" are judged. It's fielded by most NATO
members and many other nations.

Weight:        24.9 tons            Main Gun:    155mm, 36 rds       

Crew/Pass:     6/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        405 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         56 kph               Armor:       Light


MRLS Rocket Launcher

An international design/production program, the MRLS (Multiple Rocket Launch
System) entered service in 1983. The vehicle is partially based on the M2
Bradley chassis. Its primary rocket is the M77 rocket; each warhead contains
644 dual purpose shaped-change fragmentation bomblets.

Weight:        25.2 tons            Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    12-227mm rockets

Engine:        500 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         64 kph               Armor:       Light

                                                                  [Page 135]

LHA Tarawa Class Amphibious Assault Ship

The first ship of this class has been in service since 1976. The LHA's are
intended to combine the capabilities of LPH (helicopter carriers) and LPD
(amphibious docks) into one ship. Four landing craft are carried in its deck.
Its boilers are the largest ever installed on a US ship. It has a complete
300 bed hospital.

Weight:        39,400 tons          Main Gun:    3x127mm       

Crew/Pass:     1014/1924            Missiles:    Sea Sparrow SAM

Max Speed:     24 kts               


FF Knox Class Frigate

The Knox Class is typical of many escort frigates built during the 1970s. The
class packs a large amount of firepower onto a small frame. The Harpoon SSMs
are fired from the forward mounted ASROC launcher. The originally fitted Sea
Sparrow SAM system, are being replaced by the Vulcan/Phalanx 20mm system.

Weight:        4,250 tons           Main Gun:    1x127mm       

Crew/Pass:     275/0                Missiles:    Harpoon SSM, ASROC anti-sub

THE OPPOSING FORCES

T-80A Main Battle Tank

The Soviet T-80A is thought to have entered service in 1983. It has closer
developmental ties to the T-64 then to the T-72. It's considered to be
only an evolutionary design, although, the gas turbineengine is a radical
departure. The AT-8 Songster was added to provide long range capability, as
the 125mm SB's accuracy is poor.

Weight:        42 tons              Main Gun:    125mm SB, 42 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    Songster, 2 rds

Engine:        980 hp turbine       Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         75 kph               Armor:       Heavy


T-64B Main Battle Tank

The original Soviet T-64's entered service in 1967, and were plagued with
autoloader and engine problems. The "B" model seems to have corrected these
problems since it's still in production. It appears the T-64's were the "high-
tech" option while the T-72's embodied the "bargain-basement" approach. The
T-64 has never been exported.

Weight:        42 tons              Main Gun:    125mm SB, 42 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    Songster, 2 rds

Engine:        750 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     two MG's

T-72M1 Main Battle Tank

The Soviet T-72 followed shortly after the T-64, entering service in 1972.
The T-72 series has had a long career, and has been exported to many nations.
Over a dozen sub-models have been identified to many nations. Over a dozen
sub-models have been identified to date. This model features enhanced
turret armor, resulting in the nickname "Dolly Parton". It's also fielded
by Iraq, Syria and Kuwait.

Weight:        41 tons              Main Gun:    125mm SB, 39 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        780 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         80 kph               Armor:       Heavy


T-62E Main Battle Tank

The Soviet T-62 was developed from the earlier T-54/T-55 series, and entered
service in the early 1960s. It was the first tank to mount a smoothbore gun.
Its low ballistic shape was a plus, but otherwise it was mediocre. The "E"
model features add-on "horseshoe" turret armor and a laser sight. It's also
fielded by Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        41.1 tons            Main Gun:    115mm SB, 40 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        580 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         50 kph               Armor:       Heavy

                                                                  [Page 138]

T-55M1 Main Battle Tank

This latest version of the Soviet T-55 (the first entered service in the late
1950s) features add-on "horseshoe" turret armor and a laser sight. This is 
your basic "no frills" tank; simplicity is king here. The T-54/T-55's are the
most widely exported of all Soviet MBT's, and is fielded by over 50 nations
including Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        37.0 tons            Main Gun:    100mm, 43 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        580 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         50 kph               Armor:       Heavy


Chieftain Main Battle Tank

The British designed Chieftain introduced a number of innovations when it 
appeared in 1963. It was the first tank to mount a 120mm gun, and its highly
sloped armor provided then unheard of protection. Yet still, it's slow and
relatively clumsy. Iraq does field a large force, but aquired them as war
booty from Iran and Kuwait.

Weight:        55 tons              Main Gun:    120mm, 64 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

                                                                  [Page 139]

BMP-2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle

The BMP-2 is an upgrade ofthe Soviet BMP-2, and probably entered service
around 1980. It saw the poor 73mm gun replaced with a high-velocity 30mm
auto-cannon. The commander was moved from the hull to the turret, improving
labor distribution and vision. The Sagger was replaced with the longer-
ranged Spandrel.

Weight:        14.6 tons            Main Gun:    30mm, 500 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/7                  Missiles:    Spandrel, 5 rds

Engine:        400 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         65 kph               Armor:       Light


BMP-1 Infantry Fighting Vehicle

The Soviet BMP-1 caused quite a stir when it entered service in 1967. This
revolutionary design was the first to combine cannon, ATGM and a full
infantry squad with under armor fire capability. Its 73mm gun has poor long
range accuracy, and the one-man turret is inefficient. It's also fielded by
Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        13.9 tons            Main Gun:    73mm SB, 40 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/8                  Missiles:    Sagger, 5 rds

Engine:        300 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         70 kph               Armor:       Light


BTR-60/70/80 Armored Personnel Carrier

The first version of this Soviet APC, the BTR-60, entered service in 1960. 
These vehicles are rather mediocre in all respects. The later models did
overcome a number of flaws; at least the BTR-80 (data is for this vehicle) did
replace the volatile petrol engines. The BTR-60 is fielded by most of the
middle eastern nations.

                                                                  [Page 140]

Weight:        10.5 tons            Main Gun:    14.5mm, 500 rds       

Crew/Pass:     2/12                 Missiles:    None

Engine:        260 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         80 kph               Armor:       Light


MT-LB Armored Personnel Carrier

The Soviet MT-LB design closely followed the MT-L arctic tractor. This 
accounts for its excellent cross-country performance. Typical roles for the
MT-LB include artillery prime mover, command post and cargo carrier. Its
chassis is also the bases for a number of other vehicles.

Weight:        9.7  tons            Main Gun:    7.62mm MG       

Crew/Pass:     2/10                 Missiles:    None

Engine:        240 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         62 kph               Armor:       Light


EE-11 Uruto Armored Personnel Carrier

The Brazilian EE-11 first entered service in 1974. By all measures, it's a
nondescript, basic every day APC. Even its wheeled configuration is much
easier to maintain than a tracked arrangement. Like its cousin, the EE-9,
it has been exported to many nations including Iraq.

Weight:        14 tons              Main Gun:    12.7mm MG       

Crew/Pass:     2/11                 Missiles:    None

Engine:        260 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         105 kph              Armor:       Light

                                                                  [Page 141]

BRDM-2 Reconnaissance Vehicle

The Soviet BRDM-2 replaced its predecessor, the BRDM-1, in the mid-1960s. Its
also used as a command or an observer vehicle. It has become outclassed by 
more modern vehicles, and its 14.5mm gun is outdated and inadequate. It's also
fielded by most of the middle eastern nations.

Weight:        7.0 tons             Main Gun:    14.5mm, 500 rds       

Crew/Pass:     2/3                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        140 hp petrol        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         100 kph              Armor:       Light


AML-90 Reconnaissance Vehicle

The French ordered the construction of this light recon vehicle after their
sucessful use of the British Ferret scout car in North Africa; the AML-90
entered service in 1961. Over 5,000 AML's have been built to date in many
configurations. It's fielded by Suadi Arabia, UAE and Iraq.

Weight:        5.5 tons             Main Gun:    90mm, 20 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        90 hp petrol         Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         90 kph               Armor:       Light


EE-9 Cascavel Reconnaissance Vehicle

Of Brazilian design, the EE-9 entered service in 1974. It shares many
automotive components with the EE-11 APC. It now mounts a 90mm gun of 
Brazilian design; earlier models had 37mm gunsfrom WW2 vintage US M3 Stuart
tanks. It's very simple yet robust, and this has made it a popular export.
It's fielded by Iraq.

                                                                  [Page 142]

Weight:        13.4 tons            Main Gun:    90mm, 44 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        212 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         100 kph              Armor:       Light


BRDM-3 Anti-Tank Vehicle

The Soviet BRDM/Spandrel (often called the BRDM-3) was first seen in 1977. It
has replaced the less capable BRDM - Sagger combination in front line service.
This missiles are fired from a roof mounted launcher. Some vehicles have been
seen with Spandrel/Spigot missile combination.

Weight:        7.7 tons             Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     3/2                  Missiles:    Spandrel, 15 rds

Engine:        140 hp petrol        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         100 kph              Armor:       Light


2S6 30mm/SA-19 Self-Propelled AA Vehicle

The Soviet 2S6 was first seen in 1986 in then East Germany. It appears to be
a very capable gun & missile system. Its four 30mm guns, although much longer,
probably share ammo with the BMP-2. The SA-19 SAMS are IR homers and probably
have a range of 10 km. It has separate serach and track radars and a laser
ranger.

Weight:        18.0 tons            Main Gun:    4x30mm, 2000 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    SA-19, 8 rds

Engine:        520 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         60 kph               Armor:       Light

                                                                  [Page 143]

ZSU-23(4)"Shilka" Self-Propelled AA Gun

The Soviet ZSU-23(4), or "Zoo" as it's known to western forces, entered 
service in 1966. Each 23mm gun has a rate-of-fire of 1000 rpm. Its single
search/track J-band fire control radar has a range of 20 km. It's a very
effective system when employed with missile armed systems. It's also fielded
by Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        14 tons              Main Gun:    4x23mm, 2000 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        280 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         44 kph               Armor:       Light


ZSU-57(2) Self-Propelled AA Gun

The first post-WW2 eastern bloc AA system, the Soviet ZSU-57(2) entered
service in 1955. Its chassis is based on the T-54 tank, but with much thinner
armor. Its twin 57mm guns are quite effective in a ground fire role, but have
limited AA capability due to its mechanical reflex sight. It's still fielded
by Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        28.1 tons            Main Gun:    2x57mm, 316 rds       

Crew/Pass:     6/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        520 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         50 kph               Armor:       Light


SA-6 "Gainful" Self-Propelled SAM Vehicle

The Soviet Gainful had a long and troubled development period, finally
entering service in 1967. It saw much success in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The
SA-6 missile uses semi-active radar homing guidance. Gainful works in
conjunction with the "Straight-Flush" radar system. It's also fielded by
Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

                                                                  [Page 144]

Weight:        14   tons            Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    SA-6, 3 rds

Engine:        240 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         44 kph               Armor:       Light


SA-13 "Gopher" Self-Propelled SAM Vehicle

The Soviet Gopher entered service in 1977. In Soviet units, it's replacing
the older Gaskin on a one-for-one basis. The SA-13 missile is very capable.
It uses radar only for ranging as the missile is an IR homer; it has a range
of 8 km. The Gopher utilizes a variant of the MT-LB chassis. It's also fielded
by Siria and Iraq.

Weight:        12.5 tons            Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    SA-13, 4 rds

Engine:        240 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         60 kph               Armor:       Light


2S1 S0-122 Self-Propelled Artillery Vehicle

The Soviet "Gvozdika" (Carnation) entered service in 1971. Outwardly, its 
appearence is very similar to the US M109. The Soviets were slow to adopt
self-propelled artillery, continuing to rely on towed weapons. SP's are less
vulnerable to counter-battery fire nad provide crew protection. It's also
fielded by Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        16 tons              Main Gun:    122mm, 40 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        240 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         60 kph               Armor:       Light

                                                                  [Page 145]

S-60 Anti-Aircraft Gun

The Soviet S-60 is indicative of the many types and calibres of towed/fixed
anti-aircraft guns still in use today. While limited in their flexibility,
they are as accurate, or more accurate in some cases, than their self-
propelled counterparts. Towed guns are fielded by many nations including
most middle eastern nations.

Weight:        4.5 tons             Main Gun:    57mm, 200 rds       

Crew/Pass:     7/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        None                 Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         Towed                Armor:       None


Sa-3 "Goa" Low/Medium Altitude SAM System

The Soviet Goa is obsolete by today's standards; it entered service in 1961.
Aircraft counter-measures have made significant advances rendering missiles
of the Goa's ere almost useless. However, there's always luck. The Goa is a
radar beamrider; it works in conjunction with the "Low Blow" radar system.
It's also fielded by Iraq.

Weight:        7.0 tons             Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    SA-3, 4 rds

Engine:        None                 Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         Towed                Armor:       None

                                                                  [Page 146]

MI-24W "Hind-E" Gunship

The Soviet Hind first appeared in 1972. It was originally designed as a 
heavily armed assault helicopter, but has evolved into a capable gunship.
It lacks the nap-of-the-earth maneuverability of its western counterparts. 
Still, it carries a heavy load, and has retained its transport capacity. It's
also flown by Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        12 tons              Main Gun:    12.7mm       

Crew/Pass:     2/8                  Missiles:    Spiral ATGM, Rockets, 
                                                 SA-7 AAM
Engine:        two 2,200 shp        Weapon Load: 2.4 tons

Speed:         295 kph              


Mi-8TBK "Hip-E" Transport Helicopter

When it first appeared in 1961, the Soviet Hip was a simple, quasi-military
transport helicoper. After years of modifications, the Hip has evolved into
one of the most widely accepted military helicopters with over 10,000 in use.
It's described as the most heavily armed assault helicopter. It's flown by
Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        11.2 tons            Main Gun:    12.7mm       

Crew/Pass:     2/28                 Missiles:    Swatter ATGM, Rockets 
                                                 
Engine:        two 1,700 shp        Weapon Load: 3 tons

Speed:         130 kph              

                                                                  [Page 147]

MI-28 "Havoc" Gunship

Often descried as the Soviet Apache, the Havoc completed pre-production
testing in 1989. A true gunship, as opposed to the Hind's hybrid approach,
the Havoc's narrow silhouette and tandem seating are much more suited to its
role. Its high speed agility has also been enhanced by a new rotor structure.

Weight:        11.4 tons            Main Gun:    30mm, 300 rds       

Crew/Pass:     2/0                  Missiles:    Spiral ATGM, Rockets, 
                                                 SA-14 AAM
Engine:        two 2,200 shp        Weapon Load: 3 tons

Speed:         165 kph              


KA-34 "Hokum" Combat Helicopter

By 1990, the Soviet Hokum was still in the testing stage. The exact role of
the helicopter is not yet known. Kamov (Ka) helicopters have always been
produced mainly for maritime roles. It may be intended for amphibious assault
escort or anti-helicopter combat. It has the distinctive Kamov mark of
contra-rotating rotors.

Weight:        7.5 tons             Main Gun:    30mm, 300 rds       

Crew/Pass:     2/0                  Missiles:    Spiral ATGM, Rockets, 
                                                 SA-14 AAM
Engine:        two 2,200 shp        Weapon Load: 2.3 tons

                                                                  [Page 148]

SA-342 Gazelle Utility Helicopter

The French Gazelle first flew in 1967. It has been utilized in many different
roles, from recon, liaison and light attack, and many civilian applications.
A disguised Gazelle was used in the filming of the movie Blue Thunder. It has
been exported to over 41 nations including Great Britain, Egypt, Syria, Kuwait
Qatar and Iraq.

Weight:        2.1 tons             Main Gun:    None     

Crew/Pass:     2/3                  Missiles:    Hot ATGM

Speed:         140 kph              Weapon Load: 1.2 tons


Osa-II Class Guided Missile Patrol Boat

A replacement for the earlier Osa-I boats, the Osa-II's have been in service
since 1966. A favorite of many smaller or developing nations, these boats
can provide an instant navy at low cost. The SA-N-5 SAM is the navalized
version of the SA-7 Grail. Said to be poor sea boats with temperamental
engines.

Weight:        245 tons             Main Gun:    4x30mm       

Crew/Pass:     30/0                 Missiles:    Styx SSM

T-4 Class Landing Craft

The Soviet T-4 class has been in service since 1954. It's not all that
different from the landing craft that saw action during WW2.

Weight:        70 tons              Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     5/50                 Missiles:    None

REGIONAL DEPOLYMENTS


CENTRAL EUROPE


Current Events

This area has gone through more change, in a short perios of time, than any
regional area in the twentieth-centure. Ten years ago, no one could have
predicted what is now taking place.

The Germanies are reunited and the Warsaw Pact has collapsed into a quasi-
polititcal organization; its military teeth are gone. Civil and political
strife continues to escalate in the Soviet Union; this has further de-
stabilized the region.

The Soviet Union is a giant teetering on the brink of civil war. The old guard
conservatives and the liberal progressives (right-wing moderates by our
standards) are each vying for control of the country. Whoever ultimately
evolves as the victor will have far-reaching effect on the military stability
of the region.

Western Europe is a very appealing target. Its consumer goods, resources,
technology and labor force are hard to ignore. The Soviet Union, regardless
of who wins political supremacy, has tremendous "needs" and corresponding
expectations. They will get the goods one way or another.

The ex-Soviet client states are also a potentional hotbed. Their new found
freedom has opened the door for secularism to again rear its ugly head. There
have been clashes between the Czechs and Slovaks, and the Baltic States are
constantly at odds with their old master.

These internal conflicts have a habit of escalating to major proportions and
drawing in other "interested parties".


Military Balance

Even without the non-Soviet Warsaw Pact Forces, the Soviet Union can still 
field over 3,000,000 men just in the land forces. Equipment includes over
50,000 tanks, 70,000 IFVs and APCs, 60,000 pieces of artillery and over 4,500
helicopters. There's no question that a portion of the equipment is obsolete,

                                                                  [Page 152]

and is no longer of the first line status, even by Soviet standards.

The Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty (CFE) is being touted by many as
the greatest peace initiative since the Treaty of Ghent. Don't be fooled by
all the rhetoric.

The CFE treaty calls for equal force limits in five broad categories: MBTs,
AFVs, artillery pieces, combat aircraft and armed helicopters. These 
categories were arbitrarily selected because of their reference to "offensive"
weapons. These limits affect the forces fielded by all treaty signors (it was
signed by the 22 members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact). The immediate result
of the treaty - many nations, especially the Soviet Union, must dispose of
military equipment.

Here's where it gets sticky. The treaty simply allows the Soviet Union to
dispose of outdated equipment or just to hold or store it east of the Ural
mountains. Only the countries physically located in Europe must permanently
dispose of their equipment.

Of course, the USA also benefits from this apparent "loophole". Much of the
US equipment must be stationed outside of Europe (the Persian Gulf region, for
example) or returned to the USA. The question is, how long will it take to
move it back?


Geography

The area boasts of some of the most fertile ground found in the world. Parts
are mountainous or heavily forested, while others are as flat and clear as
the plains of Kansas. Towns and villages dot a countryside cut by many small
rivers and their tributaries and crisscrossed by a highly developed road and
rail net.


The Conflict

Soviet forces cross the border into the new Germany after "rescuing" Poland
from Western Europe dominance. Economic woes and a restless, impatient
populace prompt the new conservative Soviet government to use military might
to quickly solve their problems. After all, the aggressive Western Europeans,
backed by the equally aggressive USA, have forced them to take this
action to protect their borders.

As part of the US V Corp, you must stem the Soviet tide to buy time for the
mobilization of all NATO forces and the re-deployment of US forces from other
regions.

                                                                  [Page 153]

PERSIAN GULF


Current Events

The recent events in this region have been near and dear to all of our hearts.
It couldn't have had a better ending if it had been written as a Hollywood
movie script. Still, conflict is a way off life here.

The region has seen constant war dating back to biblical times. In addition
to the most recent UN sanctioned action, the past fifty years have witnessed
constant civil wars and changes of government (mostly bloody), five Arab -
Israeli conflicts, regional clashes, terrorism, internal genocide and a
protracted war between Iran - Iraq ... not a pretty picture when you
think about it.

It remains an extremely volatile region. The coalition force that fought in
Operations Desert Storm and Sabre are held together by a thread. Countries
not stand beside allies whom they only recently fought as enemies. The 
smallest provocation could trigger a conflict between these strange bedfellows
No one has forgotten the old hatreds; there was just something else a little
more pressing.

The poor Arab States hate the rich Arab States; the communist Arab States hate
the monarchies; most of the Arab States hate the Israelis and the Egyptians
because they don't hate the Israelis this year; and the Iranians generally
hate Arabs because they're Arabs, not Persians. In addition to all this,
Lebanon looks like a wasteland since just about everyone is using it as a pin
cushion to work out their differences.

In spite of this, don't let anyone tell you different - oil is the focus. 
That's not to say that these other issues are just passing fancies. Its a 
matter of the have-nots wanting what the have's have or the have's just 
wanting more. Economics, not politics is calling the shots.


Military Balance

The recent conflict has left the area in a very fluid state, to say the least.
In spite of the drubbing they took, the Iraqis still possess a large fighting
force even if most of them are now on foot. How many men remain in uniform
and how much equipment is still in Iraqi hands is unknown. They were able to
save the majority of their aircraft by flying them over the border into Iran.

To the east of Iraq is Iran; not one of our closest allies by any stretch of
the imagination. They appear to be perched like vultures; waiting to pounce on
any opportunity. They field a 750,000 man army, but modern mechanized
equipment is limited or in disrepair.

                                                                  [Page 154]

Another potential antagonist is Syria. They have never really cared for the
rich royalty of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. After all, Syria doesn't have much
oil to speak of - see, that oil issue again! They only went along with the
coalition, not being as shortsighted as Jordan, because they knew Iraq
couldn't win. There was a lot of money to be had from those same rich Arabs.
They have a 400,000 man army, with the equipment to back them up. While always
considered a bit suspect militarily, they can't be overlooked.

With the exception of Israel and Egypt, the other Arab States field rather
small forces.


Geography

This is a desert region, pretty much hot, flat and generally barren. The 
cities are situated on the coasts, with the exception of the Tigris-Euphates
valley (the fountain of life - a bit of irony) that runs through most of Iraq.
The topography of Iran is, however, quite different. It's fairly mountainous
and water is plentiful.


The Conflict

Still licking her wounds from the last war and bitter about the UN imposed
sanctions, Iraq allies with Iran (that was part of the plan all along) and
launches a renewed offensive into Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. They have managed
to "buy" off Syria who decides to sit this one out.

As part of the standing US Persian Gulf force, you must hold the line while
the RDF is staged into the region.

DESIGNER'S NOTES


The Plan

It was a bit scary when MicroProse's President, Bill Stealey, originally
proposed a sequel to the highly successful Gunship. The first thought that
came to mind was, how could we possible ever top that product?

After the smelling salts were passed around, we started to kick around a few
ideas. That really got the creative juices flowing, and it started to seem 
like a great idea - we now wished we had suggested it first.

We knew that the new simulator had to be much broader in scope than the
original. It would have to include most of the neat helicopters that the Army
(sorry Marines, we'll give you equal time in a later scenario) currently have
in their inventory, plus the ones that are still on the drawing board. This
futuristic perspective is where the 2000 in the title comes from.

We were lucky in one respect. Early on, we guessed that the Army would select
the Boeing/Sikorsky version of the LHX, now designated the AH-66A Comanche.
We knew if we went in that direction, we were committed, since the Army wasn't
going to make its final selection until April of 1991. You know what they
always say - I would rather be lucky than good.

We also wanted to exapnd into the operational components of multihelicopter
command. Not that flying a single helicopter can't be fun (after all, we did
retain that capability), it's just that there's more to helicopter operations.

We tried to go to extremes to capture the "realism" of helicopter combat.
Real action doesn't take place at 2,000 feet. It happens right next to the
ground. You feel like you're going to suck the leaves off the trees as you
fly by. This is why Gunship 2000 is the way that it is. We wanted you right
next to the ground, weaving in and out of the canyons and between the hills
just like the real pilots.

We made the "bad" guys act like bad guys, to a point - we still wanted you to
have fun. After all, this is supposed tobe fun, not work. We only took a few
liberties with the realism.

The selection of the Persian Gulf was made, believe it or not, long before the
actual conflict erupted in the region. It's not that we have a corner on

                                                                  [Page 164]

crystal balls; the region has been a hotbed for years. It was really a pretty
easy call. It's lucky the real thing worked out as well as it did. We never
intended to capitalize on the conflict; we're happy to strictly deal in
"simulating" the actions.

The selection of Central Europe as the other theater was not an attempt at any
political statement, or a prediction of impending doom and gloom. It's just
that the US has a large standing fore in the region, in spite of the forces
transferred to the Persian Gulf. Since Gunship 2000 is a simulation, we're
simulating what could happen IF, and only IF, a war did break out. The terrain
found in the region also gave us the chance to show off Gunship 2000's new
3-D system.


The Team

Many people contributed to the making of Gunship 2000; I apologize to those
not specifically mentioned. It was a team effort, and we had a great team!

Early on, we realized that we certainly couldn't utilize the 3-D system from
the original Gunship and the 3-D system used in our other 3-D products, such
as F-19 and F-15II, didn't provide a low level view of the terrain. We just
had to design a new system.

This is where Darrell Dennies worked his magic. Darrell started on the system,
now dubbed Topographical 3-D, back in February of 1990. He developed an 
entirely new concept to emphasize and accent the terrain where helicopters
operate. The results of his efforts speak for themselves. The worlds are rich
in color and depth of detail. The terrain features aren't just painted on the
ground, they actually "fit" into one another as they do in real life. You can
actually look through the railroad tunnel to the other side! The terrain also
includes fills and "fancy" patterns on the ground and even the trees. In the
campaign game, the structures destroyed in previous missions are still 
destroyed when you find them again; the train even moves along the railroad
tracks. This system is the most complex 3-D model yet developed by MicroProse;
it's probably superior to anything you've seen.

Darrell also programmed all of the "flight" related functions. He never ceased
to amaze us all. One moment there could be a problem with a function or 
feature, and before you could bat and eye, Darrell had it corrected or added
to the game. There wasn't anything Darrell couldn't fix or, somehow, squeeze
into the program.

                                                                  [Page 165]

The mission generation system was developed, and for the most part designed,
by Detmar Peterke. He had the patience and insight to interpret my obscure
concepts into something that would work. It wasn't easy coming up with a
system that would generate challenging missions that could still be fun. He
developed the "action area" system that's used for selecting options. Detmar,
with the help of Dave McKibbin, also "tweaked" all of the nifty animations
into the game.

Detmar applied an "artist's eye" to his programming; this touch is reflected
in the "look" of the game's starting and ending sequences. It's not often
that you find this rare combination of talents.

Speaking of art, we couldn't have been more fortunate than to have Mike Reis 
as a member of the team. He spent many long, tiring hours designing and
drawing all of the terrific art. The screens aren't just scanned images or
touch ups of other people's art, they're original and hand drawn. His art has
the look of real "live imagery"; you get the feeling that you're standing in
the room or sitting in the tent. That's a lot of pixels and colors to worry
about!

I know Mike often wanted to say "not you again" whenever we walked into his
office with another change or idea, but he put up with constantly critiquing
of suggesting changes to the art. It's a good thing he's not thin-skinned;
he probably would have "skinned" us many times over - and deservedly so.

I would be remiss in not thanking Max Remington for his terrific 3-D objects.
He outdid himself again! Max is known as the "machine" around these parts.
Whatever you ask for, he produces, no matter how complex or obscure. The
helicopters in Gunship 2000 are the most complex objects we've ever included
in a simulation; and, it's not like he had the luxury of working in an
environment of unlimited capacity - he still had to make it fit.

Jeff Briggs wrote all of the music that you hear during the game. He did a 
great job in capturing and setting the "mood" of the game. He had to write
them all as original compositions, and had to try to make them fit within the
presentation of the game. This wasn't an easy task. In many cases he had only
concepts to work form.

Ken Lagace along with Jim McConkey and Scott Patterson produced all of the
game's sound effects. If you're lucky enough to have a Roland or AdLib
sound card, you can experience the exciting sounds of helicopter flight and
combat.

                                                                  [Page 166]

Iris Idokogi and her staff of thousands (just kidding, the printed material
looks so good, you would think it really took that many people to develop it)
are to thank for the printed material. They're the group that usually gets
the least amount of time. We designers always try to wait until the last 
minutes to finish writing the manual. Fortunately, Iris is persistent, and she
doesn't let us get away with too much.

I tip my hat to the quality assurance folks; they have the toughest row to hoe
They are tasked with finding all of the things that don't work. No one is ever
happy to see or hear from them, but their job is a key part of the process.
Chris Taormino and the gang did a great job in keeping all of us honest.

After all that, it leaves the design element of the game - that's me. I did
what all designers do at MicroProse - research & develop the scope and flow
of the game, and basically annoy everyone else. I also wrote the documentation
with the help of Sean Gallagher, and developed all of the charts, tables and
miscellaneous text.

One part of the game i really enjoyed doing, at least I thought so when I 
started it, was designing the terrain and layouts for the 6 worlds in Gunship
2000. Darrell developed a number of tools specifically for this portion of
the game that made my life easier. About 150 unique tiles were created for the
worlds. Each world has over 4,000 "tiles" that are linked together to make the
terrain look uniform. I started to dream about these tiles; I was smart enough
not to tell my wife that she had been displaced in my dreams.

The whole idea behind the game was to capture the essence of helicopter combat
and to present it in an enjoyable, entertaining format. I believe we were
successful. Only you can truly judge the results.
