~~~~~~~~~~~~

the desert where fortunes are won and lost at the turn of a card. VIDEO

and work exactly like the video slots in the Las Vegas casinos.

VIDEO VEGAS entertains the beginner and challenges the pro. it is perfect
for your next party or sharpening your gambling skills before that Las
Vegas holiday! If you are already familiazr with casino games, just boot up
the disk and play. For a more detailed description of the games and playing
strategy, take a few minutes to read through this manual. The section on
Blackjack contains valuable information that could help you become a winner
on that next trip to the casino. Have fun and good luck!

GETTING STARTED - THE VEGAS STRIP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before you begin take a few minutes to study the enclosed Reference Card.
It details the VIDEO VEGAS operating instructions for your computer. Then
go ahead and start the program. You will see an animated view of the Vegas
Strip, with the casinos in all their neon splendor. To get in on the action
bring up the menu of VIDEO VEGAS games. you will start with a bankroll of
$1000. Your bankroll (win or lose) will go with you when you change from
one game to another.

LUCKY 7 SLOT MACHINE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you first walk into any casion, the first thing you see are the slot
machines. They seem to be everywhere, with people dropping coins into the
slot and pulling the handle as fast as they can. Slot machines have earned
the name one-armed bandit for their reputation of taking a lot more money
than they pay back! With this reputation, you might wonder why o many
people play slot machines? The answer is simple; people play slots because
they are fun. It is hard to resist these glittery machines with spinning
reels of cherrys, plums, bells, 7s, bars, etc. The clink-clink-clink of
silver dollars falling when someone hits a jackpot can be heard halfway
across the casino.

The LUCKY 7 slot machine in VIDEO VEGAS is the classic 3-reel dollar slot
found in every Las Vegas casino. You can bet from 1 to 3 dollars. You can
also play without changing the bet. The coins will fall into the slot and
the handle will drop setting the reels in motion. The reels spin and stop
one at a time. If you hit a winning combination, the machine drops your
winnings into the tray at the bottom. A list of the winning combinations
and payoffs can be called at any time. The rate of payoff is approximately
98% which means the machine pays back roughly 980 dollars for every 1000
dollars put into it. These odds are about as good as you will find anywhere
in Las Vegas.

DRAW POKER
~~~~~~~~~~
The VIDEO VEGAS DRAW POKER game is just like the video poker machines that
you find alongside the regular slot machines in the casino. You can bet 1
to 5 dollars. You can also play without changing the bet. You are delt 5
cards face up. The object of the game is to get a winning poker hand. You
can discard as many of the original five cards as you like and draw new
ones to imporve your hand. You can select any card you want to discard by
turning it face down. If you accidently select a card that want to hold,
simply turn it face up. When the discards are selected, request new cards
from the dealer. You win when you have one of the hands shown below. A list
of payouts for each hand may be requested. Here is a description of the
winning poker hands, a Royal Flush is the highest and a Pair is the lowest:

ROYAL FLUSH - Ten, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace all of the same suit.

STRAIGHT FLUSH - Any five consecutive cards all of the same suit.

4 OF A KIND - Four cards of the same rank (number).

FULL HOUSE - Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.

FLUSH - Any five cards of the same suit.

STRAIGHT - Five consecutive cards of mixed suits.

3 OF A KIND - Three cards of the same rank.

2 PAIR - Two cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.

PAIR - Two cards of the same rank. Only pairs of Jacks or better (Jacks,
Queens, Kings, and Aces) are winners.

KENO
~~~
The game of Keno is similar to Bingo in that the object of both games is to
match numbers on a card with numbers drawn at random. The big difference is
that the numbers on a Bingo card are preset, but in Keno you choose the
numbers you think will be winners.

The KENO layout has 80 numbers. You bet 1 to 5 dollars. You can also play
without changing the bet. When the bet has been placed, you will be
prompted to select or mark from one to fifteen of the 80 numbers on the
layout. When a number you like is highlighted, select it. A check mark will
appear at each selected number. You may change your mind by clearing a
number that is already checked. You may also clear all marked numbers and
start over.

When you have marked the numbers that you think are winners, play the card.
Twenty numbers will be drawn at random and lighted on the Keno board.
Whether you win or lose depends on how many of your marked numbers are hit
on the draw. For example, if you marked 8 numbers, you must hit at least
five of them to win anything at all; this pays $9 on a $1 bet. If you hit
all eight numbers, you win $20,000 on the $1 bet. While a 20,000 to 1
payoff may sound pretty good, the odds against hitting all eight numbers is
over 200,000 to 1. You may select a list of all the payouts at any time.

As it turns out, the odds of winning at Keno are very poor. You will win
more often when you mark fewer numbers, but the payouts are much smaller.
The big payouts are really a long shot. Fortunately, you can play the 
VIDEO VEGAS version without risking real dollars!

BLACKJACK
~~~~~~~~~
Blackjack is one of the few casino games where skill plays an important
part in winning or losing. By playing skillfully, you can virtually
eliminate the odds favoring the dealer.

The game is simple to play, but there are more rules and options than the
other VIDEO VEGAS games. When you select BLACKJACK from the MAIN MENU, you
will see a screen showing the House Rules. These rules of play are
identical to those used in many Las Vegas casinos. The one option that
varies from casino to casino is the number of decks used in the deal. In
VIDEO VEGAS you may select from 1 to 4 decks. The cards will be shuffled
and you will see the Blackjack table with the deck placed at the right side
of the screen. your current bankroll appears right above the deck. All of
the playing options and messages are displayed in the windows at the
bottom.

You place your wager before each hand is delt, the minimum bet is $2 and
the maximum is $20. Only even numbers are allowed to avoid small change
payouts. You cannot make a bet that is larger than your bankroll.

The Deal
~~~~~~~~
You (the player) and the dealer are dealt two cards each. The dealer always
has one card dealt face down, this is called the hole card or down card.
When you get your cards, you must add up the total of your hand. Each card
has a point value. Tens, Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth ten points each.
Aces can be counted as one or eleven points. All other cards are counted at
face value; a Three is worth three points, a Seven is worth seven points,
etc.

The object of the game is to get a hand that totals 21 points, or as close
to 21 as possible without exceeding 21. When you exceed 21 points, you bust
(lose automatically). If you do not bust, and your total is higher than the
dealer's total, you win the amount of the bet. For example, a $2 bet would
win $2. If you total matches the dealer's total, you tie (or push) and
neither win nor lose the bet.

Natural Blackjacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If your first two cards add up to 21 exactly (an Ace and any ten-value
card), you have a natural Blackjack which is an automatic winner. No only
do you win, but the payoff is at three to two odds! You win $3 on for each
$2 bet. Your natural Blackjack cannot lose, but it can be tied by a dealer
natural. When the dealer has a natural Blackjack and you do not, you lose
even money (a $2 bet loses $2) unless you have made an Insurance bet (which
will be explained later). All natural Blackjacks are settled immediately
and you go on to the next hand.

Player's Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When no natural Blackjacks appear on the deal, it is your turn to choose
one of the following options:

1) "Stand" or stand pat. This means you are satisfied with the cards in
your hand and do not want any more.

2) "Hit" or draw another card. you should take a hit when you are not
satisfied with the point count of your hand. The dealer will give you
another card each time you request a hit. You can take as many cards as you
want as long as the total does not exceed 21. If you take a hit and exceed
a total of 21, you bust and lose automatically. The bet will be deducted
from your bankroll and you will move on to the next hand.

3) "Double" or double down. With this option the amount of the bet is
doubled and you receive one additional card. You will not be allowed to
take more than one card. This is a very good bet when your firs two cards
total 11 points.

4) "Split" your hand. This option is available only when your first two
cards are a pair. The pair of cards is split into two separate hands (Hand
1 and Hand 2) and the bet is doubled (since you will be playing two hands).
The dealer will hit the first card of your pair. You can stand, hit, or
double just as you would with hands that are not split. You cannot re-split
a pair on a hand that has already been split once. When Hand 1 is
completed, play moves on to Hand 2. If you split a pair of Aces, you will
receive only one card on each of your Aces. Also, if either of your Aces is
dealt a ten-value card, you do not have a natural Blackjack. The only time
you can have a natural Blackjack is on the initial deal.

Dealer's Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you have acted on your hand, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer will
expose his hole card and play according to the following rules:

1) If the dealer's point count is less than 17, he must take additional
cards until the total is at least 17.

2) When the dealer total is 17 or more (with Aces counted as 11), the
dealer must stand.

3) If the dealer busts (and you have not), you will automatically.

When the dealer is finished with his hand, the wager is settled. If your
point total is higher than the dealer's, the amount of the bet is added to
your bankroll. If the dealer's total is higher, the bet is subtracted from
your bankroll. When the totals are equal, you push and the bankroll is
unchanged.

Insurance
~~~~~~~~~~
When the dealer's up card is an Ace you will be asked if you want insurance
against a dealer Blackjack. This is an additional wager of half of your
original bet. You are betting on whether or not the dealer has a natural
Blackjack.

If you take the insurance bet and the dealer's hole card is a ten-value, he
will show his natural and you lose your original bet (unless you push), but
you do win 2 to 1 odds on your insurance bet. If the dealer does not have a
natural, you lose your insurance bet and the hand is played out in the
usual manner. In the long run, the player will win more by never taking an
insurance bet (unless he is an expert card counter).

Blackjack Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There have been numerous books written on the strategy of winning
Blackjack. Even though the game is simple to play, the correct decision of
whether to hit, stand, double, or split is often very subtle and difficult.
you must take into account not only your own hand but also the card showing
in the dealer's hand as well. Expert Blackjack players even keep track of
the cards as they are dealt so they can estimate the probability of high or
low numbers remaining in the deck. You may not want to go to that extreme
but there are some things you should consider if you want to improve your
winnings.

A hand that contains an Ace can be counted two ways. For example, an Ace
and Eight total either 9 or 19 points depending on whether you count the
Ace as one or eleven. Any hand that can be counted two ways is called a
soft count. A hand that can be counted only one way (without busting) is
called a hard count. A soft count gives you more flexibility because you
can take a hit without busting the hand.

Whenever you are dealt an initial hard count of 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16, you
chances of winning the hand are poor because you are likely to bust if you
take a hit. Yet if you don't hit, you cannot beat the dealer (unless he
busts). Likewise, if the dealer's up card is showing a Three, Four, Five,
or Six, his chances of winning are reduced. It is these combinations of
player count and dealer up card that are the most difficult to play
correctly.

Here are some guidelines to follow when playing your hand:

1) Stand on hard counts of 17 or more.

2) Stand on hard counts of 12 to 16 if the dealer's up card is Two through
Six, outherwise hit on these counts.

3) Double on a count of 11 always. Double on 10 unless dealer is showing a
ten-value or an Ace. Double on 9 when the dealer is showing Two through
Six.

4) Always hit hard count os 10 or less except when it is appropriate to
double.

5) Always split a pair of Aces or Eights. Never split a pair of Fours,
Fives or Tens. Generally split other pairs when the dealer is showing Two
through Six.

6) Always stand on a soft holding of Ace-Eight or Ace-Nine.

7) On other soft counts, you should hit. If the dealer is showing a Three,
Four, Five, or Six, you should consider doubling.

This basic playig strategy will not automatically make you a winner, but it
can improve your chances. Remember, the odds are stacked in favor of the
casino.

Card Counting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Expert Blackjack players always use some type of card counting system to
improve the odds. It has been proven that a player can gain an advantage
over the casino by keeping track of the cards that are played and modifying
his basic playing strategy based on the cards remaining in the deck.

The details of card counting vary from one system to another, but the basic
theory is the same for all. The player's chances of winning depend on the
cards remaining in the deck. When the deck has an unusually high proportion
of Aces and ten-values, the player has a slight advantage. When the deck
has more low cards (Twos through Sevens) than high cards, the casino has
the edge. A deck that is rich in Aces and ten-values is more likely to
produce natural Blackjacks or pat hands (19 or 20) on the next deal. The
dealer and player have an equal chance of getting one of these winning
hands, but only the player gets paid 3 to 2 odds on a natural. The player
can also double on a 9, 10 or 11 count knowing that there is a better
chance of receiving a 10. The dealer must take a hit on 12 to 16 and
therefore is more likely to bust when the deck is rich in ten-values. By
adjusting the basic playing strategy, increasing the bet when the odds are
favorable, and making a minimum bet when the odds are poor, the player will
profit in the long run.

It is impossible to remember every card that has been played, so you should
select a system that is easy to use and remember. It the simpler systems,
the player counts only the Aces and ten-values. If half of the deck has
been played but less than 8 ten-values were dealt, then the remaining cards
are rich in ten-values, giving the player an advantage. If more than 8
ten-values were dealt, the remaining cards favor the dealer. Likewise, you
would expect to see one Ace for every thirteen cards played. If more than
thirteen cards are dealt without an Ace appearing, the remaining cards are
rich in Aces. When the deck is rich in both Aces and ten-values, the player
should double or triple his bet.

A more accurate card counting system is to assign a plus or minus value to
certain cards and then keep a running point-count as the cards are played.
In this system Aces and ten-values are worth minus one (-1). Threes, Fours,
Fives, Sixes, and Sevens are worth plus one (+1). Do not count Twos,
Eights, or Nines. When the cards are shuffled, the running count starts at
zero. As the cards are played, the count will be plus or minus depending on
the cards dealt. A positive running count (+5 or more) indicates a deck
that is favorable to the player. When the running count is negative (-5 or
less), the deck favors the dealer.

VIDEO VEGAS BLACKJACK has a special built-in feature to help you learn card
counting. Before each hand is played, you can get a status report of the
running point-count and the cards that have been played.
