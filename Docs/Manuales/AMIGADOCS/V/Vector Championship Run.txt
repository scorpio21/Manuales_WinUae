GAMEPLAY
--------

VECTOR CHAMPIOSHIP RUN FEATURES FAST FORMULA ONE ACTION , WITH VECTOR
GRAPHICS THAT ARE SIMPLY STUNNING !

YOUR FINELY TUNED CAR IS CONTROLLED BY A MOUSE OR A JOYSTICK CONNECTED TO
THE RELEVANT PORT ON THE 16 BIT MACHINE . THE DESIRED CONTROL METHOD IS
SELECTED BY PRESSING  'J' ON THE KEYBOARD , WHICH TOGGLES BETWEEN THE TWO
OPTIONS . 

USING THE MOUSE CONTROL METHOD , PRESSING THE LEFT HAND BUTTON ACCELERATES
THE CAR  , AND PRESSING THE RIGHT HAND BUTTON ACTIVATES THE BRAKE . MOVING
THE LEFT OR RIGHT WILL MOVE THE CAR IN THAT DIRECTION .

USING THE JOYSTICK CONTROL METHOD , PUSHING UP ON THE JOYSTICK ACCELERATES
THE CAR , AND PULLING BACK ON THE JOYSTICK APPLIES THE BRAKE . MOVING THE 
JOYSTICK LEFT OR RIGHT WILL MOVE THE CAR IN THAT DIRECTION .


THE RACES FEATURE EXACT SCALE REPLICAS OF THE FOLLOWING INTERNATIONAL
CIRCUITS :

SILVERSTONE .
IMOLA .
MONACO .
DETROIT .
TRANWELL .
SAN MARINO .


ON THE SELECTION SCREEN , CLICKING ON AUTO OR GEARS ALLOWS YOU TO SELECT
BETWEEN A MANUAL OR AN AUTOMATIC THREE SPEED GEARBOX . IF GEARS IS
SELECTED ,  PRESSING 'A' ON THE KEYBOARD SELECTS A HIGHER GEAR , AND 
PRESSING 'Z' SELECTS A LOWER GEAR . SMOOTH GEAR CHANGING REQUIRES A 
DETAILED  KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAR'S CAPABILITIES .

CLICKING ON RACE OR SOLO DETERMINES WHETHER THE COMPETITOR BEGINS IN THE
GRAND PRIX , OR PRACTICES ON THE CIRCUIT WITHOUT ANY OTHER COMPETITORS . 
SINGLE PRACTICE IS VALUABLE FOR LEARNING HOW TO CONTROL THE CAR , ALTHOUGH 
TECHNIQUES SUCH AS OVERTAKING AND SLIP STREAMING CAN BE DEVELOPED BY
RACING .

ONCE THE GEARBOX AND RACE SCENARIO HAVE BEEN DECIDED , CLICKING ON THE 
HIGHLIGHTED TRACK BEGINS THE RACE .



RACING 
------

AS A NEW COMPETITOR , YOUR CAR HAS BEEN PLACED TENTH ON THE GRID AT THE
BACK OF THE PACK . BEING ONE OF THE FIRST FOUR TO PASS THE CHEQUERED FLAG
EARNS YOU THE RIGHT TO PROGRESS TO THE NEXT RACE IN THE DRIVERS
CHAMPIONSHIP . 

IF YOU ARE NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE PLACED IN THE FIRST FOUR , THE RACE 
WILL CONTINUE UNTIL ALL OF THE OTHER TEN COMPETITORS HAVE PASSED THE
FINISH LINE .

AFTER THE STARTING LIGHTS , EACH LAP TIME IS RECORDED TO MONITOR YOUR
PROGRESS , ALTHOUGH THE CAR IS ABLE TO ACHIEVE FASTER LAPS AS WEIGHT IS
LOST IN SPENT FUEL .

THE POSITION OF YOUR CAR IS INDICATED BY A FLASHING POINT ON THE MAP , WITH
THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF YOUR COMPETITORS SHOWN AS SOLID COLOURED POINTERS .

THE RACE CAN BE FROZEN AND UNFROZEN BY PRESSING 'P' AND THE GAME CAN BE
RE-STARTED BY PRESSING 'Q' .

CHAMPIONSHIP RUN HAS THE BEST 'FEEL' OF ANY FORMULA ONE RACING GAME .
ONE LAP AND YOUR HOOKED FOREVER !!
