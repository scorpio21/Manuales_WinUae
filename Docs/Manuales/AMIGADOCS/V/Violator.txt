THE AIM OF THE GAME
-------------------

Fly your Apache helicopter over enemy territory. Everything is deadly and
everthing fires back.

Collect bonus weapons, extra lives and smart bombs from icons dropped by
shooting enemy helicopters.  More powerful weapons will destroy enemy craft
with less hits.  Smart bombs will cause many hits worth of damage.  Some
large enemies may need more than one smart bomb.

At the end of each level is a large opponent will attack.  Beyond this is
the "stage complete" sign.
