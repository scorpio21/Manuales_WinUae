                      FULL MANUAL FOR VIZ
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
                           THE GAME 
                           ~~~~~~~~ 
 
Through the magic of microchip technology you are about to be  
whisked from your dull, drab (or if like me Teddystacker - living  
room) bedroom to the town of Fulchester to take part in a  
spectacular race between Viz favourites,Johnny Fartpants,Buster  
Gonad and Biffa Bacon.Others to look out for will include the Fat  
Slags,Mrs Brady,The Parkie,Spoilt Bastard,Aldridge Prior,Bertie  
Blunt,Finbarr Saunders and Sid The Sexist. 
 
The race will of course be covered by FTV'S own Roger Mellie. 
 
The game begins in the changing room where you choose your  
character using the joystick.Press "FIRE" to select the character  
of your choice. 
 
The race takes place over five sections,Country,Town,Building  
Site,Beach and Disco.The object is to win all five  
sections.Should you lose one, you will have to do it again. 
 
If your character falls over,off a cliff,or off the screen, he  
must wait for a short while before returning to the race.For  
every fall he receives a shame token.Three of these and he is out  
of the game. 
 
Lane discipline will be maintained by the referee,Rodney Rix, who  
will throw bricks at anyone leaving their lane. 
 
Each of the three characters has his own special powers to help  
him complete the course,and each contestant has two bonus levels  
on which they can gain tokens for use later. 
 
                           BIFFA BACON 
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Biffa's abbrasive no-nonense style makes him a favourite to win  
the race.Indeed, his face-punching,teeth-kicking antics have  
established young biffa as a firm favourite among less  
intelligent Viz readers. 
 
Biffa bashes his way through many obstacles using punch  
power.Press fire and biffa exchanges power tokens for bunches of  
five, walloping all and sundry out of the way. 
 
For special power hold down "FIRE" button for about one  
second,release and press it again and Biffa becomes convinced  
that someone has "SPILLED HIS PINT!" Needless to say he immediately  
goes into a uncontrolled fighting frenzy. 
 
BONUS LEVEL ONE 
 
"Pint Drinking" is by means by which Biffa accumulates his power. 
Wiggle the joystick and Biffa will drink a pint. 
 
BONUS LEVEL TWO 
 
Bricks rain down on Biffa.Move the joystick up to BUTT them,  
right to PUNCH them or down to KICK them, thus obtaining tokens. 
 
 
                       JOHNNY FARTPANTS 
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Probably the most notorious Viz characters of all, Johnny owes his  
success to a windy bottom.Indeed his pumping Pranks have become  
legend,while his underpants have become brown and  
dirty.Anyway,with his diet of pickled eggs, Johnny will try to  
win the race using chuff power. 
 
Hold down "FIRE" button for about a second,release,and press  
again to unleash Johnnys Super Power - a massive curry-induced  
"MEGA PUMP". 
 
Press "FIRE" once and Johnny releases a bottom Burp which propels  
him forwards, and over obstacles. 
 
FIRST BONUS LEVEL 
 
Waggle your joystick and Johnny will use his special anal  
inflation technique to blow up balloons.(But dont over-fart it,or  
the balloon - and your bonus will blow away) 
 
SECOND BONUS LEVEL 
 
By wiggling the joystick,Johnny is Pump-propelled up the special  
farting scale, winning tokens as he goes. 
                        
 
                         BUSTER GONAD 
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Regular readers of VIZ willhave guessed how buster progresses  
through the game.He uses his plum power,bouncing along astride  
his massive nuts.Press "FIRE" and exchange a token for one Buster  
Ball Bounce. 
 
Or use buster's special powers + hold down the "FIRE" button for  
about a second,release it and press it again and Buster carts his  
Bollocks along in a wheelbarrow for extra speed. 
 
BONUS LEVEL ONE 
 
Buster gains power tokens by Pancake Flattening,using his bulbous  
balls to flatten lumps of dough produced by the pancake  
machine.Just waggle the joystick and Buster drops his plumbs (but  
make sure that the pancake is flat or it will not count). 
 
BONUS LEVEL TWO 
 
Wiggle the joystick and Buster bounces higher and higher.The  
higher he goes,the more his scrotes ache, but the more tokens you  
gain.
