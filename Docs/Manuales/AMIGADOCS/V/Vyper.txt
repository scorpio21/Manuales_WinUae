PREAMBLE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A hush fell as the Base Commander entered the makeshift briefing area and
walked purposefully to the front of the room. All eyes were on him as he spoke.

"Our worst fears have been confirmed. According to our latest intelligence and
scouting reports, the Yark fleet has commenced its major offensive against the
Federation planet line. As you well know, due to the sabotage effort made in
our docking bay and crew quarters, only 20% of our forces remain in fighting
condition."

Several personnel winced at the reminder of the devasting effects that the
pre-programmed droids had when the explosives that were hidden in them ripped
through machine and man alike. Most of the surviving pilots that were able to
make the briefing had been out on patrol or in other parts of the base during
the catastrophe. Bitter memories of slain comrades were fresh in the minds of
everyone in the room.

"Although we were hit hard, it seems that most of our other bases in this
quadrant were able to stop the sneak attacks before any damage was done. They
will not however be able to spare any ships for our sector. It is up to you to
individually go up against the Yark fighter squadrons and prevent them from
outflanking this perimeter's defense line."

"The odds will be tough. Each of you will have to face 100 waves of enemy
fighters with greater than 20:1 odds each time before you get a chance at their
main battleships. Watch yourselves, because Yark fighters come in fast and
furious and don't stop for anything."

"Tough indeed, but not impossible. You are the best trained fighter pilots in
the galaxy, no Yark attack computer can match you if you stay sharp. Yarks can
be predictable so keep moving, and don't get caught in a situation where
there's no where to go. Analyze their patterns and find out a strategy."

"That's all I have to say. You know your mission. Good Luck....."

graphics, and 100 levels of play allow Vyper to give you many hours of

We hope you enjoy this and future products from TopDown.


GETTING STARTED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To start up Vyper, power up your Amiga and insert the game disk at the system
Workbench prompt.

While the game is automatically booting, it might be a good idea to make sure
your Amiga is hooked up to the monitor for audio output. Although the Amiga
monitor's speaker will suffice, you won't get the full benefit of Vyper's sound
effects unless your computer is hooked up to an audio system capable of
reproducing stereo sound.

If you wish to play with a joystick, it should be plugged into the second mouse
port.

After a short wait, Vyper's title screen will appear and remain on the screen
until you press a key, or joystick button. If no user action is detected, the
game will automatically enter into a self-playing "demo" mode. To exit, press
the ESC key.

SELECTION SCREEN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vyper has several different parameters and options that can be adjusted and
activated in order to customize your game. These are displayed in the selection
screen, as shown below, and can be highlighted by moving the joystick up or
down, using the up/down cursor keys, or pressing the appropriate function key.
The current highlighted option can be selected by pressing the joystick button
or hitting the RETURN key.

	Initial Level: 01	<----->
	Start 1 Player Game	F1

at. This value can be adjusted from 01 to 50 with the left/right cursor keys or
joystick.

Start 1 Player Game and Start 2 Player Game begins play with the indicated
number of particuipants at the appropriate level. Each player starts with three
Vyper fighters, the game is usually over when the last ship is gone. In a two
player game, users continue their turns until they have completed a level or
until all ships have been lost, after which the next player faces another wave.
The current player is indicated by the flashing "PLAYER 1" or "PLAYER 2" text
above the score and number of ships remaining.

finished viewing the table, you can return to the selection screen by pressing
the joystick button or any key.

GAME CONTROLS

A joystick in port 2, or the left/right arrow keys in combination with the
spacebar (firing), gives either player full control over Vyper. There are no
additional keyboard commands to remember during normal game play, however the
following commands perform functions that are at times useful.

	ESC: Exits game, and returns to selection menu.
	P: Pause Game. Resume play by pressing again.
