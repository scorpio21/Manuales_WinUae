                            VOYAGER FROM OCEAN
                            ------------------

SCENARIO
--------
THE ROXIS(ENEMY) HAVE GATHERED THEIR RESORSES ON THE TEN MOONS OF SATURN.
STARTING ON JANUS,EACH SUCCESSIVE MOON IS DEFENDED BY DEADLIER TROOPS
GUARDING A MORE LETHAL ARRAY OF WEAPONRY.ONLY ONE GUY IN THE UNIVERSE IS
BRAVE AND FOOLISH ENOUGH TO TRY AND TAKE THEM OUT:LUKE SNAYLES-CONVICT,EX-
PILOT, ... PSYCHOPATH.

ALL EARTH'S DEFENCE FORCES HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED,SO SNAYLES IS THE LAST
HOPE.TRAVELLING IN HIS SMALL CRAFT AND EQUIPPED WITH LIMITED FACILITIES,HE
MUST DESTROY ALL OF THE AGGRESSORS ON EACH MOON,IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE
INSTALLATIONS AND PROGRESS TO THE NEXT VIA A "WARP GATE".ALONG THE WAY HE
CAN SCOOP EQUIPMENT PODS TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE HIS WEAPONRY AND OTHER
FACILITIES.

THE MISSION BEGINS...

GAMEPLAY
--------

EACH OF THE TEN MOONS OF SATURN ARE BEING USED BY THE ROXIS FORCES TO
DEVELOP MASSIVE WEAPONS FOR A FINAL ASSAULT UPON EARTH.

STARTING FROM THE FIRST MOON,JANUS AND PROGRESSING THROUGH MIMAS,ENCELADUS,
TETHYS,DIONE,RHEA,TITAN,HYPERION,LAPETUS AND PHOEBE,EACH SUCCESSIVE MOON IS
MORE HEAVILY DEFENDED.THERE ARE 80 HOSTILE CRAFT DEFENDING EACH MOON,ALL OF
WHICH MUST BE DESTROYED TO RENDER THAT MOON INACTIVE,AND TO OPEN THE PORTAL
FOR TRANSPORTATION TO THE NEXT.

INITIALLY,YOUR TANK-TYPE VEHICLE WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH JUST BASIC LASER
FIRE,AN ON BOARD COMPUTER FOR DATA REFERENCE AND A SHORT RANGE RADAR.BASIC
READINGS FOR SHIELD LEVEL,SPEED,ALTITUDE,FUEL,HEADING,TURRET ELEVATION AND
CURRENT CO-ORDINATES WILL BE DISPLAYED AT ALL TIMES.ADDITIONALLY,ABOVE YOUR
CONSOLE WILL BE DISPLAYED VIEW CO-ORDINATES,ENEMIES LEFT TO DESTROY AND
CURRENT SCORE.

AS YOU PROGRESS YOU CAN "SCOOP" ENERGY PODS(BY DIRECT CONTACT WITH YOUR
CRAFT) WHICH WILL ENHANCE VARIOUS FACETS OF YOUR WEAPONRY/DEFENCES.ONLATER
MOONS,THERE WILL BE A POD CONTAINING THE CONVERTER ENABLING THE SWITCH
BETWEEN YOUR CRAFT FROM TANK TO SKIMMER.AT ANY TIME DURING PLAY,YOU CAN CALL
UP VISUAL REFERENCE FROM COMPUTER TO INDICATE THE TYPES AND LOCATIONS OF
PODS STILL UNCOLLECTED ON THE CURRENT MOON.

SOME OF THE HOSTLIE CRAFT ARE MORE INTELLIGENT THAN OTHERS,ESPECIALLY ON
LATER MOONS-YOUR COMPUTER CAN BE USED TO GIVE INFORMATION OF ALL THE
AGRESSORS CURRENTLY AROUND.YOU MAY FIND TOO,THAT SOME CRAFT MAY NEED TO BE
HIT MORE TIMES THAN OTHERS IN ORDER TO DESTROY THEM.

IF A CAMERA(UP TO FOUR) IS SCOOPED,IT CAN BE DROPPED BY AT ANY TIME ON THAT
MOON.THIS WILL ENABLE YOU TO LOOK AREAS WHERE YOU MAY NOT BE NEAR.THE
CAMERAS ARE ALSO EQUIPPED WITH LIMITED-EFFECT LASERS WHICH ENABLES YOU TO
SHOOT CRAFT REMOTELY.

IF A DECOY IS SCOOPED,THIS CAN BE USED ONLY ONCE.ONCE JETTISONED FROM YOUR
CRAFT,IT WILL DIVERT THE ENEMIES' FIREPOWER AWAY FROM YOU FOR A LIMITED
PERIOD:USE WHEN ONLY ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY!

VARIUOS OTHER
PIECES OF EQUIPMENT ARE AVAILABLE,THE USAGE OF WHICH WILL BE DISCOVERED ON
COLLECTION.NOTE,HOWEVER,THAT CERTAIN WEAPONS HAVE LIMITED AMMUNITION-CONSULT
THE WEAPONRY DATA COMPUTER FOR INFORMATION REGARDING "SHOTS LEFT"

WHEN ALL 80 CRAFT ON A MOON HAVE BEEN DESTROYED,THIS WILL ACTIVATE A PORTAL
WHICH MUST BE FOUND BEFORE THE AUTOMATIC SELF-DESTRUCTION OF THE
INSTALLATIONS ON THAT MOON ARE INITIATED.DIRECTIONAL GUIDES WILL APPEAR ON
YOUR CONSOLE TO AID YOUR SEARCH FOR THE PORTAL.ON DECOVERY,YOU MUST
IMMEDIATELY ENTER THE PORTAL,WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED FROM ONE SIDE,AND
WARP THROUGH TO THE NEXT MOON.THE PASSAGE OF THIS,HOWEVER IS NOT
STRAIGHTFORWARD,AND YOU MUST NEGOTIATE THE 3-D PATHWAY SAFLEY.COLLISION WITH
THE WALLS OF THE PATHWAY WILL RESULT IN A LOSS OF SHIELD STRENGTH.

IF YOU PROGRESS THROUGH TO,AND MANAGE TO DEFEAT,THE TENTH MOON,PJOEBE,YOU
WILL HAVE CONQUERED THE ROXIS FORCES AND CAN HEAD HOME TO A HEROE'S WELCOME.

RADAR
-----
 LIGHT BLUE - INANIMATE OBSTACLES
 
 DARK BLUE - EQUIPMENT PODS

 WHITE - AIRBORNE CRAFT

 RED - GROUND BASED CRAFT

 MAGENTA - MOST HOSTILE CRAFT

 FLASHING DOTS - MISSILES,MINES,ETC.

HINTS & TIPS
------------

 1. WHEN IN TANK MODE,KEEP MOVING

 2. KEEP FLYING,WHEN IN SKIMMER MODE,TO A MINIMUM AS THIS CONSUMES MUCH FUEL
 
 3. WHEN A MOON IS COMPLETED,FIND THE PORTAL QUICKLY

 4. AVOID LARGE OPEN SPACES FOR PROLONGED PERIODS,IE FIND COVER

 5. AS SOON AS YOU ARRIVE ON A NEW MOON,CHECK ALL APPROPRIATE DATA ON YOUR
    PLANET
