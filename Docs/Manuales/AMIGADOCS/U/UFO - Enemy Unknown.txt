MAIN MENU
---------
After selecting the language, and passing the copy protection, you will be
given a menu with 3 options
LOAD SAVED GAME - Allows you to restart a saved campaign
BEGIN NEW GAME - Allows you to start a new campaign.  You will have to     
                 select the difficulty level which has very little effect  
                 on the game itself.  As far as I can tell, the only thing 
                 which changes with the difficulty level is the number of  
                 aliens per ship.  You will then be shown a map of the     
                 earth and asked to pick a spot for your new base.  It     
                 doesn't matter where you place your base at the beginning.
                 The UFOs are everywhere anyway.  You might want to place  
                 it near one of the major funding nations, such as the USA.
                 Once you select a site, you will be asked to name your    
                 base.  Just type in any name.  Your first base comes wit

  THE EARTH DISPLAY
  This is a large representation of the earth.  Here you 
  will monitor all alien activity.  Alien ships will show up as red        
  crosses.  Your shops show up as yellow diamonds.  Landed UFOs show up as 
  green Xs.  UFO crash sites show up as white Xs.  Your bases show up as   
  aqua rectangles.  Terror sites are pink.  It is here that you direct your
  alien-fighting operations.  Of course, you have to wait for a UFO to show
  up.  Once it does, you can send an interception craft after it either by 
  clicking on the base from which you wish to send the craft.  This will   
  allow you to only send the ships which are in that particular base.      
  Simply select a READY craft and click on the UFO you  wish the craft to  
  pursue.  It will follow it as far as the radar can detect  the UFO.      
  Often, the UFOs go out of radar range and you must return to base.  You  
  can also select the INTERCEPT button explained below.  While one of your 
  craft is out, you can click on it to change its orders or to get a report
  on its condition.  The information you are given is
  Type of Craft and Its Numbe
  Status > What the craft is currently doin
  Base > The base it belongs to
  Speed > The craft's current spee
  Maximum Speed > The craft's maximum spee
  Altitude > The altitude of the craft
  Fuel > What percent of the craft's fuel tank is not used up
  Weapon-1 > Craft's first weapon    Rounds > The ammo for weapon-
  Weapon-2 > Craft's second weapon   Rounds > The ammo for weapon-

  ä-----------------------------------------------------------------
  
  RETURN TO BASE - Will send the craft directly back to its home base

  SELECT NEW TARGET - Allows you to select a new target for the craft

  PATROL - Orders the craft to remain in its position and look for UFOs. 
           This slightly increases the range of detection, especially i
           the craft is patrolling outside radar range
  If the craft was following a UFO and the UFO escaped radar range, the
  information will be the same, but the buttons below will change slightly
  The first button will remain RETURN TO BASE.  The second button will now 
  be PATROL, and the third button will be GO TO LAST KNOWN UFO POSITION. 
  This will send the craft to the last position the UFO was in before
  targeting was lost

  TIME AND DATE - This simply displays the current time and date.  At the end
  of each month you will be given a progress report from the major         
  contributors to the XCom project.  You will either get a funding increase
  or decrease.  If you successfully wiped out a lot of UFOs, you will      
  probably get an increase.  If you let a lot of them by, or if there were 
  many terror sites, you will lose funding.  If you have two horrible      
  months in which you have a major funding drop, you will lose the game and
  the aliens will have won

  ROTATE EARTH - This lets you rotate the earth in any one of four           
  directions

  ZOOM IN - This lets you get a closer look at the area which is currently in
  the middle of the earth display

  ZOOM OUT - This lets you see more of the earth at a time

  TIMING BUTTONS - These control how fast time flows.  At 5 seconds, events  
  happen very slowly.  At 1 day, the events happen so fast you cannot see  
  them.  Whenever you are doing some tricky maneouvers, put the timing at 5
  seconds.  If you are simply waiting for UFOs or are building something,  
  you might want to select 1 day.  All the events still occur, you just    
  can't see them developing

  INTERCEPT BUTTON
  ----------------
  By clicking on this button, you will get a list of all your              
  available craft at all your bases.  The craft's type and number will be  
  listed, as well as the base at which it currently is and its status.  In 
  the last column, the number of craft weapon, soldiers and heavy weapons  
  platforms which are assigned to that craft are also displayed.  The      
  different states for craft are
  Rearming - New weapons are being installed or old weapons are being      
             reloaded
  Refuelling - The craft is being refuelled before the next fligh
  Repairs - The craft suffered damage which must be repaired before the    
            next flight
  Ready - The craft is reloaded, refuelled and 100% repaired.  Only the    
          craft in this state may be sent on missions. 
  Out - The craft is currently out of the base on a mission
  Once you select a Ready craft, you then select the destination, be it a  
  Way Point (not any special destination), a UFO or a crash site

  GRAPHS BUTTON
  -------------
  This will give you a number of graphs displaying things such as UFO
  activity, XCom activity, funding and income.  The buttons across the     
  top determine what the graphs displays.  The buttons down the left side  
  vary according to what the graph is.  The different graph choices across 
  the top are (from left to right)

  UFO Activity in Countries - Same as UFO Activity in Areas, except that   
  the buttons down the left side represent specific funding countries
  XCom Activity in Areas - Graphs your activities in the different         
  geographical regions of the world.  The buttons down the left side     
  represent the different areas.  Again, it is possible to have more than
  one graph at the same time

  XCom Activity in Countries - Same as XCom Activity in Areas, except the  
  buttons down the left side represent funding countrie

  BASE GRID - This is a 6 X 6 grid showing all the buildings and facilities
  in the base which is currently being displayed.  Most building take    
  only one square.  Hangars take 4 squares.  Buildings which ar
  currently being built are outlined with dotted lines and have 
  number on them.  This number is how many days remain until the facility
  is completed.    
 
  BASE INFORMATION - This area simply shows the name of the base which is
  currently being displayed, its general location, and the total funds
  available to the XCom project

  BASE SELECTION BUTTONS - These buttons are used to select which base you
  wish to display.  They are in fact miniature grids of those bases.  The
  little green squares are existing building at that base and the red
  ones are buildings which are in construction.  You can only have eight
  bases in total

  BUILD NEW BASE BUTTON - This will allow you to set up an entirely ne
  base somewhere in the world.  When you click this button, you will be
  asked to select a location for the new base.  Just click on the new
  location and you will be told the general location of your site, and   
  the cost for setting up a new base in that area.  The costs vary
  depending on the area, but there is not enough of a difference to
  make too big a difference.  Once you OK'ed the new base, you wil
  be asked to name it.  Just type in a name.  You will now be presente
  with an empty base grid, and asked to place your access lift.  The
  access lift is just a formality (for more information, see             
  TECHNOLOGIES).  Make sure you pick a location somewhere in the middle,
  or at least on which is not by any edge.  Now your new base is set u
  and you are ready to start developing it. 
      
  BASE INFORMATION BUTTON - This option will display a number of bar
  graphs with information about your base.  The graphs will be

    Base Name - Display's Name of Current Base
    Base Selection Buttons - Allow you to select the base for which you
    are viewing the information

    The first three graphs are measures of how many people of each kin
    you have against the number currently available.  The graph will be
    a solid bar if all your people of that kind are available.  It will
    start becoming hollow (just a line outline) if any of those people
    are assigned.  In other words, the filled part is the number available 
    while the hollow part is the number used or assigned.  The two parts   
    together is how many people of that kind you have, total. The most     
    people of any kind that the graph will shot is 150.  NOTE:  This doe
    not mean that you can only HAVE 150 people of each kind, just tha
    the graph can only show 150

    Soldiers - The number of XComs
    Engineers - The number of engineers for production
    Scientists - The number of scientist for research
    The next five graphs are measures of how much space of each kind you   
    have against the total space of that kind.  The graph will be
    a solid bar if all the space of that kind is available.  It will
    start becoming hollow (just a line outline) if any of that space
    is assigned.  In other words, the filled part is the space available   
    while the hollow part is the space used or assigned.  The two parts    
    together is how much space of that kind you have, in total.  The most
    space of any kind that the graph will show 300, except for hangars of  
    which it will show only 8.  NOTE:  This does not mean that you can
    only HAVE 300 of each space, just that the graph can only display 300
    Living Quarters - All personnel need a space to live.  Therefor
    you must have enough living quarters to fit all your scientists
    engineers and soldiers.  For more information on Living Quarter
    see TECHNOLOGIES

    Stores - All the equipment for the XComs at a base must be kept i
    special storage space.  For more information on General Stores se
    TECHNOLOGIES

    Laboratories - Research projects need laboratory space for the
    scientists to work in.  Each scientist assigned to a research
    project take up one space.  For more information on Laboratorie
    see TECHNOLOGIES

    Work Shops - Manufacturing and production of alien technologies
    required workshop space.  Each engineer assigned to a project wil
    take up one work shop space.  In addition, all the production item
    take up a certain amount of space as well, depending on the item
    For more information on Work Shops and production items se
    TECHNOLOGIES

    Hangars - Each XCom craft at the base requires a hangar, otherwis
    it cannot be built.  Each craft takes up one hangar
    Defence Strength - The aliens may eventually decide to retaliate 
    against the XComs and attack one of their bases.  When this happens,
    base defences either destroy the invading UFO or at least lesse
    the number of aliens which will attack you.  This value depends
    simply on what defences you have installed.  For the different
    types of defences, see TECHNOLOGIES
    The final two graphs are just a measure of how good your radar syste
    is.  Since the radars only have a CHANCE of detecting UFOs, the mor
    the better, I suppose (Don't really bother building more, as one of
    each kind is enough).  You can have up to 5 of each kind, but there i
    really no reason to have that many
    Short Range Detection - The number of Short Range Radars you have
    Long Range Detection - The number of Long Range Radars you have,     
    times two.

    OK Button - Simply returns to the BASES menu
    TRANSFERS Button - Allows you to see all the items which will be
    arriving at the base.  This includes things which were purchased
    and transfers from other bases.  It also displays how long (in hours
    it will take for the items to arrive

    STORES Button - Allows you to see what is in your general stores.  Al
    the items currently in your possession at this base are displayed,
    along with the quantity of that item and the number of general store 
    space each item uses

    MONTHLY COSTS Button - Allows you to see the monthly cost for th
    entire base under the following categories
    Craft Rental          Cost Per Unit      Quantity        Tota
    SKYRANGER...............$500,000............X..............
    INTERCEPTOR.............$600,000............X..............

    In other words, for each Skyranger you have at this base, you pay    
    500,000 dollars monthly.  For each scientist you employ, you pay 
    salary of 30,000 dollars monthly.  The base maintenance is just the
    total of all the maintenance costs for all the buildings at the base 
    (for maintenance costs for specific facilities, see TECHNOLOGIES)
    The income figure is your monthly funding from all the funding       
    nations.  The total figure is your total monthly bill, being a
    total of the craft rental, salary and base maintenance figures

    SOLDIERS BUTTON - This will present you with a list of all the soldiers
    assigned or otherwise, at this base.  You will be given their name,
    rank and the craft on which they are currently assigned (if any).  I
    you select one of the soldiers, you will get a character sheet which

      which the scientists are making with each research project.  The
      progress goes, from worst to best:  Unknown, Poor, Average, Goo,
      Excellent

      NEW PROJECT BUTTON - Clicking on this button will give you a list of
      all the new research projects which you can have.  The number of
      research project you have will depend on how many UFOs you have  
      successfully explored with the XComs, and what types of UFOs you
      explored.  Some projects are only available after you research
      other ones.  These "research trees" are shown below.  To start
      a new project, click on one of these topics, be it weapon, alien
      corpse, live alien (with containment facility), or equipment
      You will then be asked how many scientists you wish to assign to
      this project.  Use the UP arrow to add scientists, and the DOWN
      arrow to decrease the number of scientists.  Click OK when yo're
      done.  You can increase or decrease the number of scientists after
      a project is started by clicking on that project.  You will again
      be given the opportunity to change the number of scientists
      involved in that project.

    Items in brackets (tanks/hovertanks) are in parentheses because they
    are not really researched.  You just get to manufacture them after you
    have researched the item above the entry in parentheses.  Alien Alloys
    are involved in two "research trees", therefore they appear twice in
    two different series.  Equipment and weapons which do not allow yo to 
    research any new things are not listed here.  For detailed descriptions 
    of all items see TECHNOLOGIES

      MANUFACTURE BUTTON - This allows you to produce researched alien          
      artifacts and technologies for use by the XComs.  Alien technologies   
      cannot be bought, they must be manufactured by engineers at one of you 
      bases.  For manufacturing you need engineers, work shops and researched 
      technologies.  When you click on manufacture, you will get a screen
      with the following things
      Engineers Available - The number of engineers who are not assigned to
      manufacturing projects yet.
      Engineers Allocated - The number of engineers who are assigned to
      manufacturing projects.

      Workshop Space Available- Each work shop is 50 space units.  Each
      engineer assigned to a project takes up one unit of work shop space.
      Also, each project takes up a certain amount of base work shop space

      (see chart below).  This is simply how much space is still availabe.
      Current Funds - Your current money.

     Then there are these six columns:
      ITEM - The names of the manufactring projects currently underway will
      be listed here.

      Engineers Allocaed - The numbers of engineers assigned to each project
      will be shown under this column.

      Units Produced - If you decided t manufacture more than one unit of 
      a certain item, the number which has already been completed and is
      available for use will be displayed under this heading. 

      Total to Produce - You can decide to manufacture more than one of some
      item.  The total number which will be produced of this item will 
      displayed under this heading
  
      Cost Per Unit - Each item you decide to manufacture costs a certain    
      amount of money to produce.  The unit cost will be displayed here.   
      If you multiply this by the Total to Produce, you will get the total   
      cost

      Days/Hours Left - Each manufacturing project takes a certain amount o
      time to complete (see chart below).  This time is measured in        
      engineer hours.  In other words, the number of engineer hours neede
      to complete the project, divided by the number of engineer assigned  
      to the project will give you the time it will take the engineers t
      complete their work.  This is what appears under this heading

      NEW PRODUCTION BUTTON - This button will allow you to start a new
      manufacturing project.  When you click this button, you will be give
      a list of all the items which have been researched and can be        
      produced.  Select what you want from the list.  You will now be give
      a screen with this information
      Number of Engineer Hours per Unit - This is a measure of how long i
      takes to produce one unit of the item you selected.  Engineer hour
      divided by the number of engineers you assign to the project will
      give you the time it will take to produce this project.  Note tha
      this is per unit

      Cost Per Unit - Manufacturing alien technologies costs money.  Thi
      is how much money you will have to come up with for each unit      
      before manufacturing will even begin
      Work Space Required - This is the base work shop space required b
      the item that will be manufactured.  This does not increase wit
      quantity, so this is always the same for a certain item, no matte
      how many you want to produce.  In addition, the each engineer wil
      take up one unit of work shop space

      Below this will be a listing of all the special materials required t
      produce this item (if any).  This could include alien alloys, UF
      power sources, Elerium-115, and UFO Navigation.  If the item does
      require some special materials, a small chart will show up which wil
      simply show you what item the project needs, how much of each item,  
      and how much of each item you have in your stores.  When you ar
      sure that you have enough room, money, and special materials for thi
      project click the START PRODUCTION BUTTON.  Otherwise click CANCEL

      START PRODUCTION BUTTON - This will let you begin the project.       
      Before that happens you will have to select the number of engineer
      you wish to assign to the project, and the number of units of th
      item that you wish to manufacture.  Use the up arrows to increase
      the number of engineers or number of units, use the down arrows t
      decrease them.  You will also be told how much work shop space yo
      have available and how many engineers are available.  Click OK t
      start the production using the values you set in this screen.
      Click STOP PRODUCTION to cancel the entire project

FIGHTING ALIEN
--------------
The destruction of UFOs takes place in two ways.  The first is the air-to
air combat between UFOs and interception craft from the XComs.  This wil
either destroy the UFO totally, or disable it.  The second and mos
important is the ground exploration by the XCom soldiers themselves.  The
will explore landed UFOs, crash sites, terror sites and alien bases while
blowing away all sorts of nasties with their new alien technology.  Th
ground XComs, after a successful mission, will retrieve alien technolog
from the UFOs.  This includes live aliens, alien corpses and alien weapons.

  AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT
  -----------------
  To fight a UFO in air-to-air combat, you must first detect it with you
  radars.  The UFO will then appear as a red plus.  To fight the UFO, you
  must send interception craft after it.  The UFOs are quite elusive, so   
  you might find it hard to catch up to it.  Once an interception craft
  targets a UFO, it will follow it as far as the radar range allows.  Once
  the UFO escapes radar range, the tracking will be lost and you will have 
  to send your craft back to base.  When a UFO is detected by radar, the
  following little screen will be shown
  UFO-??

  Size - A general outline of the type of UFO it is.  It does not explain
  what its mission is, or exactly what kind it is.  The 5 different
  possibilities are:  Very Small, Small, Medium, Large, Very Large
  Altitude - How high the UFO is flying.  The five possibilities are
  Ground, Very Low, Low, High, Very High.  It the UFO is on th
  ground, you can send in the XCom soldiers directly, without
  having to shoot it down with a fighter craft.  However, there
  may be more aliens aboard landed UFOs than there are on crash
  sites

  Heading - The general direction in which the UFO is flying (North
  Southwest, etc.

  Speed - The UFO's speed in knots
  CENTRE ON UFO BUTTON - Centres the view on the UFO and sets the time flo
  to five seconds at a time
  CANCEL - Ignores the UFO.  Doesn't centre on it and doesn't change the
  time flow
  If you happen to have already researched and built a Hyper-Wave Decode
  at a base along with your radars, you will be given the above            
  information, as well as this
  Craft Type > The exact type of craft it is.  The possible types are
  Small Scout, Medium Scout, Large Scout, Terror Ship,
  Abducter, Battleship, Harvester, Supply Ship.  Fo
  explanations of these types, see TECHNOLOGIES
  Race > The main race of aliens aboard the ship.  The main races are
  Floaters, Snakeman, Mutons, Sectoids and Ethereals.  Each of thes
  races usually have some extra help if they are on larger ships. 
  These are

  Floaters and Reaper
  Sectoids and Cyberdisk
  Mutons and Celatid
  Snakeman and Chryssalid
  Ethereals and Silacoids and Sectopod
  The one on the left is the main race, while the ones on the righ
  are the "help" they bring along on bigger ships.  For explanation
  of all the aliens races, see the enclosed PCX files.

  Mission > The mission that the aliens are on.  The possible missions are
  Alien Abduction, Alien Retaliation, Alien Base, Alien Harvest
  Alien Research, Alien Supply, Alien Terror, Alien Infiltration
  For explanations of these missions, see TECHNOLOGIES

  Zone > The general area of the world to which the aliens are headed
  If and when a fighter craft catches up to a UFO, the two crafts will     
  begin air-to-air combat.  Make sure your craft has adequate weapons
  You will get a screen like this

  Minimize - This small square in the corner allows you to minimize th
  entire combat window.  This can only be done during standoff mode (When
  ou are not attacking the UFO in any way).  When you click this, th
  window will disappear, and the tactical view will come on again.  Yo
  will see the UFO and fighter craft together, moving in some direction
  This is useful if you want to send more craft to fight the UFO at once,
  since you can have more than one craft per UFO

  W-1 - Here will be shown a picture of your first weapon.  Below it is 
  number.  This number is the number of ammo rounds you have for tha
  weapon

  W-2 - Here will be shown a picture of your second weapon.  Below it is 
  number.  This number is the number of ammo rounds you have for tha
  weapon

  W-1 Range - This line shows you what kind of a range your first weapon   
  has.  In order to be able to fire that weapon at the UFO, the UFO mus
  be at least touching the line which comes from the first weapon pictur
  out into the middle of the radar.  Once the UFO is within range, an
  you have selected one of the attacking buttons, the weapon will be
  fired

  W-2 Range - This line shows you what kind of a range your second weapon  
  has.  In order to be able to fire that weapon at the UFO, the UFO mus
  be at least touching the line which comes from the second weapon       
  picture out into the middle of the radar.  Once the UFO is within      
  range, and you have selected one of the attacking buttons, The weapon  
  will be fired

  Radar - This simulated radar simply shows you the position of th
  UFO compared to the position of your craft.  Your craft is th
  arrow on the bottom, while the UFO is the circle near the top. 
   
  Messages - This displays combat messages such as "UFO destroyed",
  "UFO crash lands", "INTERCEPTOR damaged" or "INTERCEPTOR destroyed"
  Stand off - Selecting this button instructs your craft to have 
  stalemate with the UFO.  In other words, the craft will attemp
  to keep a safe distance from the UFO.  If the UFO is faster, i
  still might catch up to the craft.  This is useful if you are
  bringing in extra craft to help with the UFO
  Standard Attack - Instructs the craft to attack the UFO withou
  getting too close to it.  This is useful if you have a rang
  advantage over the UFO
  Cautious Attack - Instructs the craft to attack the UFO but try t
  get more away from it.  This is useful if the UFO has gotten i
  close to your craft and is pounding you
  Aggressive Attack - Instructs your craft to try to move closer to th
  UFO and attack it. 
  Disengage - Instructs your craft to abandon the fight and run awa
  on the UFO
 
  UFO Info - Shows you a close-up picture of the UFO along with some
  measurements.  This could help you identify the UFO (I don't kno
  why you'd like to)

  Damage Indicator - This representation of your craft will begin t
  fill up red if your craft is damaged by UFO fire.  When the entire     
  craft becomes red, it is destroyed.  If it is even a bit red after
  the UFO is beaten, it will have to be repaired upon its return to
  the base (before it can fly again)
  Proximity to UFO - Displays the distance between craft and UFO i
  numbers

  Once the UFO is destroyed, it will probably leave a crash site,
  unless you had powerful enough weapons to totally destroy it.  I
  it does leave a crash site, you might want to send your XCom soldier
  down to investigate it to recover some alien technologies.  T
  send the XComs, equip a transport craft with some equipment and 
  crew, and send it to the crash site.  Upon arrival, the craft wil
  land at the crash site.  You will not be presented with a strateg
  combat screen like this

  problem of height.  There are up to 4 levels to the mission, dependin
  on how big the UFO is.  When you first start, you will have your firs
  soldier selected.  To move him, click on the destination square wit
  the left mouse button.  You can either move one square at a time fo
  added caution, or you can click all the way on your destination. 
  Each soldier is limited in how far he can move by his Time Units. 
  Each move of one square costs 4 time units.  You can also simply tur
  in a certain direction by selecting a square which is in the directio
  you wish to turn, and clicking the right mouse button.  This is usefu
  when you are trying to find aliens, because you actually have to be
  looking in the direction of the alien to see it.  You can select th
  current soldier (the one you are moving, since you can only move one at
  a time) either by using the next soldier buttons or left clicking      
  over the picture of the soldier to who you want to switch.  You can    
  have up to two items ready at a time, one in each hand.  To use an     
  item, click on its picture in one of the two item windows.  You will be
  given a choice of what you wish to do with that item, an accuracy      
  percentage (the percent chance of that particular type of shot actually
  hitting the target you select) and the number of time units it will    
  take to use that item in that particular way.  The time unit cost is in
  fact a percentage of that soldier's maximum time units.  Once you      
  select the type of attack, click on the target alien (or soldier,      
  depending on the item) and click the left mouse button.  If the alien  
  is in sight (you have a line of fire) the item will be used, and it    
  might kill or at least hurt the alien as long as it hits.  You can only
  attack aliens which are in that soldier's line of sight.  The aliens   
  are invisible to you until one of your soldiers actually "sees" it.  To
  "see" an alien, you have to be close enough to it, and be facing in the
  right direction.  If you can see any aliens, flashing numbers will     
  appear in the bottom right corner of the strategy view.  Each number   
  represents one alien "seen".  Certain items such as mind probes can be 
  used on aliens who are not in that soldier's line of sight as well as  
  aliens which are in his line of sight.  However, all guns must have a  
  clear path to the alien in order to shoot it.  Once you have finished  
  all your moves, click the end turn button to allow the aliens their    
  moves.  If any aliens are within range of any of your soldiers, they   
  will probably shoot at them.  Of course, the aliens will sometimes     
  miss, but unless you have some armour for your soldiers, they will     
  often die with just one shot.  At the end of the aliens' turn, you will
  get your next. Oftentimes, aliens which you "saw" the previous turn hid
  somewhere, so you will have to find them again before you can shoot    
  them.  You can scroll the strategy display by putting the mouse cursor 
  by the edge in the direction of which you wish to scroll and pressing  
  the left mouse button.  All mission, whether they be crash sites or    
  alien bases, end when either all the aliens or soldiers are dead.  At  
  the end of the mission, you will get a score.  Basically, if you killed
  all the aliens, you will get a good score.  Points are gained for such 
  things as killed aliens, recovered alien technologies, and recovered   
  alien corpses.  In certain missions, there are some special point      
  values (such as for saved citizens during a terror site).  You lose    
  points for things such as killed soldiers and citizens killed by aliens
  (only during terror sites)

  Move 1 Level Up Button - If you are standing on a structure such a
  stairs or an elevator, clicking on this button will make you move on
  level up.  Also, if you are equipped with flying suits, and yo
  are currently flying low or are standing  on the ground, use this to   
  fly higher up.  However, it takes 8 time units to move up one level

  Move 1 Level Down Button - If you are standing on a structure such a
  stairs or an elevator, clicking on this button will make you move on
  level down.  Also, if you are equipped with flying suits, and yo
  are currently flying up off the ground, use this to get back down t
  earth.  However, it takes 8 time units to move down one level

  See 1 Level Up Button - This moves the strategy display one level up. 
  If there are some aliens on levels above you, you can use thi
  to target them (if they are in the line of fire).  You can interac
  fully with the level above you with this.  For example, you can switc
  the view up one level (if you are standing by stairs or an elevator)
  left click where you want to go on that higher level and your soldie
  will move towards the stairs or elevator and automatically climb up fo
  you

  See 1 Level Down Button - This moves the strategy display one level down
  If there are some aliens on levels below you, you can use thi
  to target them (if they are in the line of fire).  You can interac
  fully with the level below you with this.  For example, you can switc
  the view down one level (if you are standing by stairs or an elevator)
  left click where you want to go on that lower level and your soldie
  will move towards the stairs or elevator and automatically climb down  
  for you

  Consult Map Button - This gives you an overhead view of the nearby area
  On this map, aliens show up as blue circles, while the XComs show u
  as yellow circles.  The map only shows the current level.  To move th
  map either a level up or down, use the up and down arrows on the lef
  side of the map display.  The number on the right side of the displa
  shows the level you are looking at, where 0 is ground level.  To center
  on something, left click it.  You can then click OK to exit, and th
  strategy display will be centered on the square you clicked on.  Thi
  is useful when flashing numbers appear indicating alien you can see
  but they are too far away to see on the strategy display and it is a   
  pain in the ass to try and scroll the display to try and find the
  sucker.  With the map, you can quickly find him, click on him, switc
  back to the strategy display and let him have it

  Duck Button - This button allows the current soldier to duck.  Doin
  this will lessen the chance of an alien spotting the soldier. 
  However, if an alien is already in sight of the soldier, ducking wil
  not do very much

  Inventory Button - This button takes you to the inventory screen.  Her
  you can put items into your hands, transfer items from hands to
  to backpack, reload weapons and drop and pick up items from the ground
  Doing any of these operations costs time units, depending on what i

  You can still come back to the previous soldier either by clicking th
  next button until you go all the way through your soldiers again, o
  by left clicking him on the display

  End & Next Soldier Button - Clicking this button acts just like the
  next soldier button, except that if you use this button, the only wa
  to get back to the soldier whose turn you just ended is to left clic
  his picture in the strategy display.  Clicking the next soldier butto
  until you go through all the soldiers again does not work.  The soldie
  whose turn you ended is taken out of the queue
  See Levels Up Button - This button allows you to see the levels up abov
  you.  However, unlike the other buttons, it only lets you see, not
  interact with the levels above

  Options Button - This simply gives you some game play options, as wel
  as letting you save your game
  End Turn Button - Clicking this ends all XCom turns and gives the alien
  their chance to kick your butt
  Abort Mission Button - Clicking this allows you to abort the mission. 
  To successfully abort, you must have all your XComs in the craft
  when you decide to abort a mission.  All soldiers out of the craft
  when you abort are said to be missing in action and are treated as i
  killed

  TUs - This number shows how many time units the soldier has.  Time unit
  decrease with each step the soldier takes.  They are fully replenishe
  every new turn

  He. - This value shows the soldiers health.  This determines how muc
  punishment he can take and how long he can survive if he has suffere
  a fatal wound

  St. - This value is the soldier's energy or stamina.  It also decrease
  with each step the soldier takes, but at a slower rate.  However, i
  also replenishes slower, returning at a rate of 17 points per turn
  Mor. - This value shows the soldier's morale.  If the mission is no
  going well, or if it is very long, the morale will start to go down. 
  If it gets very low, the soldier will panic.  This means that he wil
  drop his weapon on the ground and run in a totally random direction
  Bar Graphs - diplay the time units, stamina, health and moral            
  graphically

  Rank Symbol - Clicking on this brings up a character sheet for the       
  soldier.  The different attributes are
  Time Units - How many steps the soldier can take every tur
  Energy - Also how many steps the soldier can take every tur
  Health - How much punishment the soldier can take
  Fatal Wounds - The number of fatal wounds the soldier has suffered.
  Fatal wounds will eventually kill the soldier.
  Bravery - How the soldier acts when things are not going wel

  Alien Researc
  -------------
  ALIEN ORIGIN
  It is clear that we are fighting a losing battle on earth.  The alie
  hordes are overwhelming in number.  The best we can do is slow down thei
  progress.  The only hope for humanity is to tackle the aliens at thei
  source.  Our research seems to indicate a nearby base of operations      
  within our solar system.  Aliens indicate this place to be the centre of
  an ancient civilisation that pre-dates Human history.  We must locat
  this place as soon as possible.  However, we need to capture and
  interrogate an alien leader to gain more detailed information.  The
  larger UFOs probably contain at least one alien leader

  THE MARTIAN SOLUTION
  Our research now points to Mars as the base of alien operations.  The
  base is well hidden, and contains all the manufacturing and clonin
  facilities to fuel the infiltration of earth.  It also seems to contai
  a controlling computer of some kind that controls the whole operation
  It seems that the hive-like alien society has some kind of 'queen bee'
  This is their fundamental weakness - if we can eliminate the 'brain' the
  the body will die.  We must step up our research efforts before it is to
  late.  In order to progress we must capture the highest ranking aliens -
  the commanders - which only reside in alien bases

  CYDONIA OR BUST
  It is now clear that the alien hordes are being controlled from a
  underground base in Cydonia - which is an unusual area of Mars featurin
  five sided pyramids and a large formation resembling a human face
  Cydonian civilisation once flourished on Mars many millions of years ago
  but we do not know why it died out or what the connection is with th
  latest alien activity there.  Whatever the explanation we must send a
  expedition to Cydonia.  This is the only way that we can defeat the    
  aliens.  We must destroy the controlling master 'brain'.  We will need a
  avenger craft equipped with the most awesome destructive power at ou
  disposal.  There is nothing more we can learn here - we must await th
  outcome of the Cydonian assault. 

  ALIEN RESEARCH
  The alien research mission is used for collecting basic data on eart
  and its inhabitants.  Small vehicles are predominantly used, wit
  occasional landings in deserted areas.  This type of alien activit
  poses the least threat to XCom, with little concern from government
  or the public

  ALIEN SUPPLY
  Once an alien base is constructed then it is resupplied on a regula
  basis by a special supply vessel.  If one of these vessels is detecte
  while landing then it is certain that an alien base is nearby
  ALIEN TERRO
  When the aliens terrorise a city they will deploy some special forces    
  with awesome powers.  Civilians will be directly threatened, and
  governments will be forced to evacuate whole areas.  The main purpos
  behind this activity is to generate sufficient public hysteria so tha
  governments will threaten the XCom project

  ALIEN INFILTRATION
  Earth governments can be infiltrated by alien agents which are human i
  appearance.  This can result in official contact between aliens an
  governments at the highest level.  The climax of this activity i
  characterised by intense UFO activity in the vicinity of major cities
  The aliens will attempt to sign a pact with an earth government b
  offering knowledge of their superior technology.  In return th
  government will allow the aliens to conduct their activity unhindered
  This alien mission represents the worst threat to XCom.  If a governmen
  agrees to a pact then its funding will cease

  ALIEN ABDUCTION
  This is the most insidious form of alien activity.  The abduction b
  aliens is widely reported, despite the aliens' attempts to erase th
  experience from their victims' memories.  Abductees report bein
  subject to humiliating physical examinations, including impregnatio
  of alien foetuses and bizarre genetic experiments.  The purpose behin
  this activity appears to be linked to genetic mutation and manipulatio
  of the aliens' own genetic material.  This activity causes great alarm
  and occurs in populated areas or cities

  ALIEN RETALIATION
  If XCom interceptors are being particularly successful in shooting dow
  UFOs then the aliens may take some retaliatory action.  This coul
  result in a direct attack against an XCom base.  However, the alien
  have to find an XCom base in order to attack it, and provided UFOs
  are kept away then there should be little danger of an assault

  ALIEN BASE
  Aliens will construct secret underground bases in remote locations
  After some initial reconnaissance flights some intense UFO activit
  will occur as the base is being built.  These bases are known to
  contain experimental labs for human abductees, and supplies for furthe
  activity in the region.  The presence of alien bases will generate a
  large amount of reported alien activity without the presence of UFOs. 
  In order to locate a base, an XCom craft must patrol an area for a fe
  hours to stand some chance of detection

  ALIEN HARVEST
  The aliens have many uses for earth's fauna.  Animals are abducte
  secretly, and returned with various organs removed.  Cattle mutilation
  are predominantly reported along with UFO sightings.  This type of alie
  activity causes great concern by governments and considerable anxiet
  amongst the population.  This type of activity occurs mainly in farming
  land.  The theory behing the 'alien harvest' suggests that alien race
  originally 'seeded' the planet with its flora and fauna, and now they
  have returned to reap the harvest they have sown

  UFO Component
  -------------
  UFO POWER SOURCE
  The power source of alien craft is an anti-matter reactor which use
  Elerium (element 115) to generate powerful gravity waves as well a
  other forms of energy.  The conversion of matter to energy is a
  incredible 99% efficient, therefore tiny quantities of elerium ca
  produce huge amounts of power.  This unit can be reproduced easily usin
  alien alloys

  UFO NAVIGATION
  Alien craft use sophisticated computers to navigate on earth and throug
  space.  The system is based on optical processors arranged in networ
  fashion.  The control interface is relatively simple - the navigato
  controls the direction of gravity waves generated by the power source t
  move the craft in any direction.  The system can be used easily b
  humans, and it can be reproduced using alien alloys and other components

  UFO CONSTRUCTION
  Alien craft consist of three main components - a power source, a       
  navigation system and a hull built from alien alloys.  The hull i
  specially designed to allow gravity waves to be directed and controlled
  In addition a small quantity of Elerium is required to fuel the powe
  source.  Once the principles of construction are understood, and th
  functions of each component are known, then it is possible to build thes
  types of craft

  ALIEN FOOD
  These chambers contain various enzymes which are used to digest the bod
  parts of cattle, other animals and even humans.  The liquid is the
  consumed as ready digested food - probably direct to the bloodstream
  This suggests a certain dependence on earth for food - a symbiosi
  between earth and alien society

  ALIEN ENTERTAINMENT
  The most likely function of these spheres is recreational.  The psioni
  circuitry stimulates various centres of the brain.  The effect is simila
  to halluciogenic drugs.  This is the only evidence that the aliens hav
  any cultural or recreational pastimes. 

  ALIEN SURGERY
  This surgical equipment uses laser cutters to extract certain bod
  parts from cattle and other animals.  The widespread cattle mutilation
  can be accounted for by this bizarre alien activity.  It is likely tha
  these parts are used for nutritional or genetic purposes

  EXAMINATION ROOM
  In the past many thousands of people have claimed to have been abducte
  by aliens, sometimes repeatedly.  The truth is far more horrific.  Human
  are abducted, researched and monitored.  The best specimens have geneti
  material extracted.  Women have human-alien hybrid foetuses implanted
  and then removed several months later.  Who knows what sinister motive
  the aliens have

  ALIEN ALLOY
  Alien craft are constructed from special alloys with unique properties
  They are extremely light and durable, and can be moulded by electro
  magnetic methods.  This material can be reproduced and used in many kind
  of manufacturing processes
