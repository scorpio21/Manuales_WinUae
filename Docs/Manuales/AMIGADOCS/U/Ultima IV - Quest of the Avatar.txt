THIS IS FROM THE GATE SPELL, I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW THE MOON GATES WORK.
ONLY THAT THEY DO. ONE LAST THING ON THE MOONGATES. IF YOU GOTO THE MOONGLOW
GATE AND STAND ON THE GATE, WHEN THE TWO MOONS GO DARK, SEARCH AND YOU WILL
FIND THE BLACK STONE.

I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN MORE THEN ONE SPELL LIST WRITEN BUT THIS ONE WILL
INCLUDE THE HINTS IN SPELL CASTING THAT THE GAME WILL GIVE YOU.

LADDER DOWN SILK, MOSS (DE)             MOVES PARTY DOWN ONE IN DUNGEONS

  A FEW NOTES ON THE SPELLS. AWAKEN ONLY WAKES UP ONE MEMBER AT A TIME.

  THERE ARE FOUR ENERGY BARRIERS:
  (S)LEEP, (P)OISON, (F)IRE, AND (L)IGHTNING
(LIGHTNING IS UNPASSABLE, THE OTHERS CAST THOSE
SPELLS UPON THE MEMBER ENTERING)..
YOU WILL BE PROMPTED FOR WHICH ONE YOU WANT.
IN CASTING OR DISPELLING A ENERGY BARRIER YOU MUST STAND NEXT TO THE
SPOT YOU WANT TO CAST IT.

JINX SPELL WILL CAUSE A RANDOM NUMBER OF THE ENEMY TO FIGHT AMONGEST THEM
SELVES.. SEEMS TO WORK BEST ON GREMLINS.

KILL SPELL WON'T KILL TWISTERS OR REAPERS ON THE FIRST SHOT.
SOMETIMES OTHER MONSTERS CAN AVOID THE KILL SPELL BUT THESE ARE THE ONES
THAT DO IT EVERYTIME TREMMER IS GREAT FOR A MASS KILL, IT EFECTS ALL
TYPES OF ENEMIES!

QUICK GIVES RANDOM QUICKNESS EACH TURN, MAGES SEEM TO BENIFIT MOST FROM
THIS SPELL.

SOME LISTS STATE THAT YOU NEED MORE THEN ONE ITEM TO MAKE THE SPELL LIKE:
QUICK NEEDS TWO BLOODMOSS TO WORK.. THIS IS ALL UNTRUE IN
EVERY CASE! IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT LOOK FOR THE CLUES IN THE GAME ABOUT IT.

THE MOON GATES WORK LIKE THIS. WHEN THE GATE APEARS IT STAYS FOR TWO PHASES
OF THE MOON ON THE FIRST PHASE IT WILL MOVE YOU TO THAT NUMBER GATE - 1 (IN
TE CASE OF IF YOU ARE AT MOONGLOW, IT WILL TAKE YOU TO GATE 8 (MAGINCIA)).

ON THE SECOND PHASE IT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE GATE NUMBER + ONE. (IF YOUR IN
MAGINCIA, YOU'LL GOTO MOONGLOW).

:%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%:

1]  GET THE CHARACTER REF. SHEET AND THE TWO OTHER DOC FILES THAT GO WITH
    THE GAME.  READ THEM!

2]  SETTING UP YOUR CHARACTER.  ACCORDING TO RICHARD, NICE GUYS WILL HAVE AN
    EASIER TIME.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE GAME KEEPS TRACK OF HOW NICE A GUY
    YOU ARE.  SO, WHEN ANSWERING THE SET-UP QUESTIONS, KEEP KINDNESS &
    HONOR IN MIND.

3]  FRIENDS:  THERE ARE PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY WHO WILL JOIN YOUR PARTY.
    I SOON GOT TIRED OF TALKING TO EVER DAMN PERSON.
    HERE ARE THE NAMES TO LOOK FOR AND IN WHAT TOWN YOU MAY FIND THEM.
    THEY MAY NOT CHOOSE TO JOIN YOUR PARTY, BUT THAT'S UP TO THEM.
   IOLO (BRITAN), JAANA (YEW), JULIA (MINOC), SHAMINO, G(I FORGET),
   CATHERINE.
    - NOTE:  SHAMINO IS IN THE TOWN OF SKAA BRAE -
    -  AND:  GEOFFIEX IS IN THE TOWN OF JHELOM.. -
   AND DUPRE.  USUALLY THEY WILL BE STANDING AROUND WITH THREE OTHER PEOPLE
   AROUND A FIRE OR SOMETHING.  YOU WILL NEED ALL THE FRIENDS YOU CAN GET.

-> DUNGEONS:  WRONG, SHAME, DECEIT, ETC.  SECRET ENTRANCE TO 8TH LEVEL OF    
   DUNGEONS IS FOUND BEHIND LB'S CASTLE. - - - :

 -> A TRICK I USE IS GOING DOWN TO THE EIGHTH LEVEL THROUGH LB CASTLE AND
    FINDING A CRYSTAL BALL TO RAISE ME.  THEN I GET KILLED AND BROUGHT BACK
    BY LB.  I LOSE MY MONEY, BUT EVERYONE IS FULLY HEALED AND I KEEP THE
    EXPERIANCE & RAISED STATS.

  -> ANOTHER SLY MOVE IF A MEMBER OF YOUR PARTY IS DEAD, IS TO DO THIS:
   1. GET $300 FOR TREASURE ROOM IN LB CASTLE (IF POISONED SLEEP AT SEER).
   2. GET PERSON REENCARNIATED AT HEALTH.
   3. HAVE HPS RESTORED BY LB.

  -> ASK LB ABOUT HIS HEALTH TO GET YOUR HPS RESTORED.

 -> IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE TO WIN A BATTLE WITH A WATER MONSTER
    BEFORE A PIRATE SHIP WILL COME BY.  TRY IT AND SEE IF IT WORKS.
    SHIPS ARE FUN.


4]  TOWNS:  HERE IS A PARTIAL LISTING OF TOWNS:  PAWS, BRITAN, TRINSIC,
            YEW, ABBY, MINOC, VIRTUE, MAGINCIA, AND LYCAEUM.
    AGAIN, I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB OF WRITING THINGS DOWN,
    THESE ARE ONLY THINGS I AM REMEMBERING.

    SPECIAL TOWNS:  SKAA BRAE SELLS HERBS USED FOR SPELLS!
    -------------:  VIRTUE SELLS TORCHES, GEMS, AND KEYS!
        - - -    :  PAWS SELLS HORSES ($300).



5]  SHRINES:
      HONOR, COMPASSION, EXPERIANCE, SACRIFICE, LOVE, JUSTICE, & TRUTH.
      YOU MUST HAVE THE PARTICULAR RUNE TO ENTER A SHINE.  ONCE YOU ENTER A
      SHRINE YOU WILL HAVE TO MEDITATE.  START WITH 1, THEN THE NEXT TIME
      YOU COME BACK DO 2, AND SO ON.  IT WILL ASK YOU MANRA: AFTER YOU
      MEDITATE.  I AIN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TYPE THERE.


6]  RUNES: (SAME AS SHRINES)
     HONOR -      TRINSIC
     SACRIFICE -  MINOC
     LOVE -       ABBEY
     JUSTICE -    YEW
     COMPASSION - BRITAN
     TRUTH -      LYCAEUM
    THE RUNES ARE FOUND BY (S)EARCHING AN AREA (USUALLY A BATH ROOM,
    INN ROOM, CLOSET AREA, END OF HALLWAY, JAIL CELL,  ETC).

    THE BELL OF COURAGE IS FOUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN (A WATER ISLAND)


7]  SECRET DOORS:  SECRET DOORS (AND YOU WILL BE VERY SURPRISED TO SEE HOW
     MANY THERE ARE!) ARE EASILY SPOTTED BY A LITTLE DOT (HI-RES) IN BETWEEN
     THE BRICKWORK IN A WALL.  SIMPLY WALK THROUGH THE WALL WITH THE DOT.
     THERE ARE SEVERAL SECRET DOORS IN LB'S CASTLE AND IN THE TOWNS.
     (LB: GUARD'S ROOM, ABOVE HEALING, PRISON CELL, ETC)


8]  ADVENTURE TIPS:

 A] MONEY:  GETTING MONEY FAST MAY HELP YOU GET SOME GOOD ARMOUR AND BETTER
    YOUR INITIAL CHANCES FOR SURVIVAL.  AN EASY WAY OF GETTING ABOUT $500
    IS BY OPENING ALL THE CHESTS FOUND IN THE SECRET ROOM (GUARDS ROOM) IN
    LB'S CASTLE.

 -] SPEND MONEY CAREFULLY, BUT DON'T CARRY IT AROUND.  YOU WILL LOSE IT IF
    YOU DIE.  BUT YOU'RE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR WEAPON & ARMOUR (SO INVEST THE $).

 -] SELLING THINGS BACK TO THE DEALERS IS A BAD IDEA AS THEY BUY IT BACK FOR
    1/2 PRICE.

 -] BE CAREFUL WHEN FIGHTING THIEVES, ROGUES, OR PIRATES AS THEY WILL STEAL
    YOUR MONEY.


 B] POISON:  POISON IS THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR DEATH.  LEARN WHAT
    MARSHLAND LOOKS LIKE AND AVOID IT!  REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN HEAL YOURSELF BY (H)OLE
    UP AND CAMP.  TO CURE (SPELL C) POISON, MIX B & C (YOU HAVE ABOUT TWO
    CURES TO START OUT WITH).  ANOTHER WAY TO CURE POISON IS TO ALSO GET
    SLEEPED BY A TRAP OR MAGIC FLOOR (SEER IN LB CASTLE).  OR YOU CAN ALWAYS
    PAY $100 AT A TOWN HEALER.

 -] AVOID SPIDERS IN DUNGEONS AS THEY WILL POISON YOU.


->  BE WARY OF TRAPS IN DUNGEONS (FIGHT MODE) - YOU CAN STEP SOMEWHERE AND A
    WALL MIGHT OPEN UP OR FIRE MAY SPRING UP, OR A BRIDGE MIGHT DISAPPEAR.

FIRST STEP IN ULTIMA IV:  VISIT TOWNS WHILE IN THE TOWNS TALK TO EVERYONE.  
AFTER A BIT YOU WILL DEVELOP A NEAT NACK FOR STOTTING THE MAIN WORDS IN WHAT 
THEY SAY SO YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING OUT OF THEM WITH LITTLE TROUBLE.  (EX: I 
WATCH THE SEAS.  SEAS?  YES, ETC)
[1] FIND PEOPLE TO JOIN YOUR PARTY.
[2] ASK PEOPLE ABOUT THE RUNES (USUALLY A RUNE TO EACH TOWN).
[3] ASK PEOPLE ABOUT THE MANTRAS (SHRINES ARE USELESS WITHOUT THEM).

[ASSORTED TIPS:]
 --------------

[] DON'T RISK BEING SUNK BY PIRATE SHIPS.  SAIL UP AND KILL CREW.
[] USE HORSEPOWER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE (ESP. AFTER YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING
   AWHILE).  THIS IS BECAUSE THE GAME REMEMBERS EVERY TIME YOU FLEE FROM
   BATTLE.  THIS WAY YOU CAN OUTRUN THE ENEMY BEFORE YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THEM.
[] IF YOU CAN'T WALK THROUGH A SPACE (MAGIC SQUARE) THEN DISPELL THE MAGIC!
[] YOU CAN HOLE-UP AND CAMP WHILE IN THE OCEAN BY JUST EXITING AND H.
   THEN B.
   (NOTE: IF YOU'RE AMBUSHED AND WIN THE BATTLE, YOU HAVE TO GET THE CHEST
   BEFORE YOU CAN REBOARD)
[] GIVE BLOOD WHILE AT THE HEALERS AS THIS MAKES YOU A NICE GUY.
[] GIVE MONEY TO BEGGARS AS THIS WILL TOO.
[] DON'T "APPROPRIATE" CHESTS THAT AREN'T YOURS (SIGH) AS IT WILL COUNT
   AGAINST YOU.

[] WHEN BUYING SPICES YOU CAN PAY ONLY $1 FOR THEM, BUT THAT TOO MAKES YOU
   LOOK BAD (ROTTEN ISN'T IT?).
[] BE SURE TO GO DOWN A WHIRLPOOL IF YOU GET THE CHANCE.  THIS IS ABOUT THE
   ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A BOAT INTO THE SEA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CONTINENT.
   (AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET TO THE CITY OF COVE)
[] TO GET A SEXTANT CHOOSE OPTION D AT THE THIEVES GUILD ($900).
[] HORSES ARE $100 EACH (# MEMBERS).
[] SOMETIMES (MAYBE MY IMAGINATION) BUT YOU DON'T SEE THE SECRET DOORS
   (DOTS) THE FIRST TIME.  A PEER INTO A GEM OR JUST REENTERING THE ROOM
   MAY CLEAR THIS UP.
[] THE MOONS WILL CHANGE BY THEMSELVES (NOT ANY RELATION TO COMMANDS), SO IF
   YOU'RE WAITING ON A MOONDOOR, DON'T JUST SIT THERE AND HIT SPACE + REPT.
   THIS WILL ADVANCE YOUR # OF MOVES AND ALSO GIVE MONSTERS A CHANCE TO BE
   BORN AND FIND YOU.
[] IF A MEMBER OF THE PARTY IS POISONED, ONE WAY OF FIXING HIM IS TO LET
   HIM OPEN ALL THE CHEST YOU FIND.  THIS WAY HE WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
   OF GETTING SLEPT (THUS CURING THE POISON).
[] THE BUCC'S DEN (LOVE THE NAME!) WEAPON SHOP SELLS MAGIC BOWS & WANDS.
   ($2000 AND $5000 RESPECTIVELY)
[] TORNADOES SEEM TO ONLY MOVE YOU A COUPLE OF PLACES + HURT YOU.

                    ]]]]] CHAPTER 1: POLITICAL HISTORY [[[[[

     THE DARK AGES OF BRITANNIA IS THE NAME GIVEN TO THAT LONG SPAN OF
TIME WHEN THE INFAMOUS TRIAD OF EVIL STALKED THE LANDS AND CHALLENGED ALL
FOR THE SUPREMECY OF THE SOUL.
     THE FIRST ERA OF THE DARK AGES CAME TO AN END WITH THE DOWNFALL OF
THE EVIL WIZARD MONDAIN AND HIS MANY MINIONS, AS CHRONICLED IN ULTIMA I.
THE LORDS OF THE LANDS WERE WEAK AND SCATTERED, RENDERED INEFFECTIVE BY
FACTIONAL WARS.  IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THE VALIANT EFFORTS OF AN ITINERANT
ADVENTURER THAT THE FOUL MONDAIN WAS TRACKED TO HIS HIDDEN LAIR AND SLAIN.
     BUT A FEW YEARS OF RESTLESS PEACE FOLLOWED MONDAIN'S DOWNFALL.  SO
LONG HAD THE WORLD SHUDDERED BENEATH MONDAIN'S YOKE THAT MANY FOUND IT HARD
TO BELIEVE HE HAD BEEN REALLY VANQUISHED.  IN TRUTH, HIS TEACHINGS DID NOT
DISAPPEAR.  MONDAIN'S APPRENTICE MINAX ROSE TO POWER SOON THEREAFTER TO
CHALLENGE THE FLEDGLING CITY-STATES THAT WERE BEGINNING TO EVOLVE.  THE
TERRORS HAD BEGUN ANEW.
     MINAX'S POWERS UPON MATURITY GREATLY EXCEEDED THOSE OF HER EVIL MENTOR.
WITH THESE POWERS SHE WAS ABLE TO RAIN WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION UPON THE PLANET,
TWISTING AND CORRUPTING EVERYTHING.  HER FOUL WEB SPREAD THROUGH TIME ITSELF,
ENSNARING ALL WHO SOUGHT TO OPPOSE HER.  FINALLY, THERE AROSE A HERO OUT OF
LEGEND WHO DARED FACE MINAX IN HER OWN FIERY CASTLE AND DESTROY HER.  THUS 
ENDEDTHE SECOND ERA OF DARKNESS, AS TOLD IN ULTIMA II.
     TWENTY YEARS OF WELL-EARNED TRANQUILLITY ENSUED AND PROSPERITY FAVORED 
THE LAND.  THEN DISTURBING OMENS APPEARED, FOLLOWED BY THE MYSTERIOUS 
APPEARANCE OF A FIERY ISLAND.  THE TALE OF THE THIRD ERA OF THE DARK AGES IS 
TOLD BY IOLO THE BARD IN ULTIMA III - WHEREIN LORD BRITISH, SOVEREIGN OF AN 
INCIPIENT EMPIRE IN THE LAND OF SOSARIA, CALLED FORTH THROUGH TIME AND SPACE 
FOR HEROES OF THE PEOPLE TO ASSEMBLE.  FOUR DIVERSE ADVENTURERS ANSWERED THIS 
CLARION CALL.  TO THEM FELL THE GEAS OF THE DOOM OF EXODUS.  LONG THEY LABORED
ON THE TRAIL OF THE MYSTERIOUS EXODUS, THROUGH MANY A DEEP DUNGEON WHICH 
SEARED THEIR SOULS.  TO THIS DAY, EACH MEMBER OF THAT TEAM BEARS THE MARKS OF 
THEIR JOURNEY.  WITH THE AID OF THE MYSTICAL TIME LORD THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL 
IN BYPASSING THE GRREAT EARTH SERPENT AND GAINING ACCESS TO EXODUS' ISLAND 
FORTRESS.  THE VERY BRICKS OF THE FORTRESS ROSE UP AGAINST THEM, AND GREAT IS 
THE BARD'S TALE OF THEIR STRUGGLE TO REACH THEIR MORTAL FOE.  OF THE FINAL 
CONFRONTATION NOT ONE OF THEM WILL SPEAK, SAVE TO SAY THAT THE EVIL IS GONE 
FROM THIS PLANE.  SO PASSED THETHIRD MEMBER OF THE TRIAD OF EVIL AND WITH 
THIS DEATH, SO PASSED THE DARK AGES OF BRITANNIA.
     FROM THE RUBBLE OF SOSARIA, LORD BRITISH WAS ABLE TO UNITE ALL THE 
MAINLAND AND A FEW OF THE ISLANDS UNDER HIS ONE RULE.  THIS NEW EMPIRE OF 
BRITANNIA BROUGHT MUCH SOUGHT-AFTER PEACE AND PROSPERITY TO ITS SUBJECTS.  
MANY OF THE ANCIENT POCKETS OF EVIL WERE DESTROYED, SO THAT THE ONLY REMAINING
HAZARD TO WAYFARERS WAS THE OCCASIONAL STRAY BAND OF MARAUDING ORCS OR HILL 
GIANTS.  MOST OF THE LANDS WERE MAPPED, ALTHOUGH FEW UNEXPLORED REGIONS STILL 
REMAIN.  WITH THE TRIAD OF EVIL DESTROYED, LORD BRITISH BECAME KNOWN FOR HIS 
DEDICATION TO RAISING THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF HIS SUBJECTS.  TO ASSIST IN THIS 
ENDEAVOR, THREE MIGHTY STRUCTURES WERE RAISED IN DISTANT PARTS OF THE REALM.  
ONE WAS THE LYCAEUM, WHEREIN LAY THE GREAT OBSERVATORY.  ANOTHER WAS THE 
EMPATH ABBEY WITH ITS OAK GROVES WHERE WISE MEN AND WOMEN MEDITATED UPON THE 
TEACHINGS OF THE ANCIENTS.  THE THIRD STRUCTURE WAS THE GREAT CASTLE OF THE 
KNIGHT'S ORDER OF THE SILVER SERPENT.  ONLY THE FLOWER OF LORD BRITISH'S 
CHIVALRY WAS INVITED TO JOIN THIS ORDER, WHICH EMBODIED THE HIGHEST IDEALS AND
EXEMPLARY BRAVERY.  THE REST OF THE LAND WAS DIVIDED AMONG EIGHT MAJOR TOWNS, 
EACH WITH ITS OWN POLITICAL FACTION.  NUMEROUS SATELLITE VILLAGES ALSO DOTTED 
THE COUNTRYSIDE BETWEEN THE TOWNS.  IN THIS MANNER WERE LORD BRITISH'S LANDS 
ORGANIZED.

                        ]]]]] CHAPTER 2: GEOGRAPHY [[[[[

     THE FINAL DESTRUCTION OF EXODUS ROCKED THE KNOWN WORLD.  MOUNTAINS ROSE;
LAND MASSES SANK.  MOST OF THE SURFACE AREA OF THE WORLD BECAME FUSED TOGETHER
INTO ONE LARGE MASS.  IT IS OVER THIS MAJOR CONTINENT - NOW CALLED BRITANNIA -
THAT LORD BRITISH RULES.  SOME NEARBY ISLANDS ALSO PAY HOMAGE TO HIM, WHILE
BEYOND THESE ISLANDS LURK UNCHARTED SHOALS AND RUMORED POCKETS OF EVIL.
     LORD BRITISH'S MAGNIFICENT CASTLE IS SITUATED IN THE CENTRE OF THE
CONTINENT, OVERLOOKING BRITANNY BAY.  THIS TALL BUILDING IS THE GREATEST
ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURE OF THE NEW AGE.  LOYAL SUBJECTS MAY PAY HOMAGE TO HIS
MAJESTY, AND RENEW FEALTY WHENEVER THEY ARE IN THE VICINITY OF HIS CASTLE.
NEARBY LIES THE ARTS CENTRE OF BRITANNIA - THE TOWN OF BRITAIN - WHERE BARDS
WEAVE TALES OF LEGENDARY DEEDS AND SERENADE VISITORS.
     TO THE NORTH OF THE CASTLE OF LORD BRITISH LIES THE GREAT MOUNTAIN RANGE,
KNOWN AS THE SERPENT'S SPINE.  THE PEAKS OF THIS RANGE ARE THE HIGHEST IN ALL
BRITANNIA.  DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS, A SMALL OUT-OF-THE-WAY PASS ALLOWS
KNOWLEDGEABLE TRAVELLERS TO SAVE MUCH TIME ON THEIR JOURNEYS.  BEWARE OF THE
ONE-EYED CYCLOPS AND FIERCE, TWO-HEADED ETTINS THAT INHABIT THIS RANGE.
     NORTHWEST FROM THE MOUNTAINS BEGIN THE VAST WOODS KNOWN AS THE DEEP 
FOREST. MANY A TRAVELLER HAS BECOME LOST AMONG THESE TALL, MAJESTIC TREES.  
IF THY FEET STRAY FROM THE BEATEN PATH, DO NOT DESPAIR, FOR WITHIN THE WOODS 
LIES THE BEAUTIFUL CITY OF YEW, HOME OF THE MYSTIC DRUIDS.  THE HIGH COURT OF 
YEW JUDGES ALL THE IMPORTANT CASES IN BRITANNIA AND IS FAMED FAR AND WIDE FOR 
THE WISDOM OF THE DECISIONS RENDERED HERE.
     NEARBY IS THE SPIRITUAL CENTRE OF BRITANNIA, THE FAMOUS EMPATH ABBEY.
WITHIN THESE HALLOWED WALLS, WISE MEN AND WOMEN STUDY THE ANCIENT WRITINGS OF
PAST MASTERS, AND MEDITATE UPON THE GREAT PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN THE UNIVERSE.
A GOOD MEDITATION - FOCUSING ON A PROPER MANTRA - WILL SOMETIMES YIELD 
VALUABLE VISIONS TO THOSE WHOSE PATIENCE AND POWERS OF CONCENTRATION ARE 
STRONG.  THE EXPERIENCE IS WELL WORTH SAMPLING.
     EAST OF THE DEEP FOREST LIE THE HIGH STEPPES OF BRITANNIA, FAMOUS FOR
BEAUTIFUL HORSES.  THE ONLY DIFFICULTIES A TRAVELLER MIGHT ENCOUNTER HERE ARE
BANDS OF THIEVING ROGUES AND UNFRIENDLY WIZARDS.  THE HIGH STEPPES BORDER AN
INTERIOR LAKE FABLED FOR MYSTERIONS DISTURBANCES.
     BEYOND THE HIGH STEPPES LIES THE FAMOUS BATTLEFIELD, KNOWN AS THE BLOODY
PLAINS, WHERE THE LAST MAJOR FORCES OF EVIL WERE VANQUISHED. ALAS, MANY OF OUR
BRAVE MEN PERISHED HERE IN THE FIGHT FOR VIRTUE. BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN THOU
PASSETH THROUGH THIS REGION. IT IS WHISPERED THAT, AT SOME PHASES OF THE MOON,
THE UNDEAD RISE AND FIGHT THE BATTLE AGAIN.
     LOST HOPE BAY LIES TO THE NORTH OF HERE, WITH THE STURDY TOWN OF MINOC
PERCHED ON ITS SHORE.  MINOC IS HOME TO SOME OF THE FINEST CRAFTSMEN IN THE
REALM.  THE TINKERS OF MINOC ARE KNOWN FAR AND WIDE FOR THEIR SKILL.  A
TIRED TRAVELLER WILL ALSO FIND A REFRESHING PLACE TO REST AT THE WAYFARER'S
INN.  THE NORTHEASTERN TIP OF BRITANNIA IS RATHER WILD.  THE TREACHEROUS
MARSHES, WITH THEIR NOXIOUS VAPORS THAT POISON THE UNWARY EXPLORER, ARE
HOME TO SWARMS OF LARGE INSECTS AND ALL MANNER OF VILE BEASTS.
     SOUTH OF LORD BRITISH'S CASTLE CAN BE FOUND A LARGE PLAIN, MOUNTAINS, AND A
DENSE FOREST. ON THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE CONTINENT IS THE MAGNIFICENT TOWN OF
TRINSIC, FROM WHENCE COME LORD BRITISH'S FINES PALADINS.  THE TAP IN TOWN HAS
SOME OF THE BEST BREW AROUND, AND THE BARTENDER IS A GREAT SOURCE OF CURRENT
GOSSIP.  BE SURE TO TIP HIM WELL!
     THE CLAWS OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BRITANNIA EMBRACE THE CAPE OF HEROES.
SLIGHTLY TO THE WEST LINE THE VALARIAN ISLES.  THE WALLED TOWN OF JHELOM
PROVIDES LORD BRITISH WITH THE BEST FIGHTERS AND ALSO HAS THE LARGEST INN OF 
THE REALM, WHERE THE SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING.
     THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE ORDER OF THE SILVER SERPENT IS ON AN ISLAND SOUTH
OF THE CAPE OF HEROES.  THIS WOODED FORTRESS WAS GIVEN TO THE MEMBERS OF THE
ORDER BY LORD BRITISH IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR OUTSTANDING SERVICE.  A VISIT TO
SERPENT CASTLE WILL IN STILL WITHIN THE TRAVELLER A TRUE FEELING FOR THE WAYS 
OF CHIVALRY.
     OFF THE WESTERN SHORE OF BRITANNIA IS THE ISLAND HOME OF THE DOUGHTY
RANGERS.  SKARA BRAE IS A BEAUTIFUL CITY AND SPACIOUSLY LAID OUT.  FOR THOSE
SUFFERING FROM RARE DISEASES OR GRIEVOUS WOUNDS, A MYSTICAL HEALER RESIDES
WITHIN THOSE WALLS.  THE HEALER WILL AID THE DESTITUTE AS READILY AS THE
WEALTHY, EXPECTING NO PAYMENT SAVE WHAT THE SUFFERER CAN AFFORD.
     IN THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF BRITANNIA LIES VERITY ISLE, FAMES AS THE HOME
OF THE LYCAEUM.  THIS PILLAR OF HIGHER LEARNING CONSTITUTES THE CENTRE FOR THE
SHARPENING OF THE FINEST MINDS IN BRITANNIA. THE LYCAEUM'S OBSERVATORY PROVIDES
LORD BRITISH WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COURSE OF THE HEAVENS AND
PROVIDES A VANTAGE POINT TO WATCH THE HAPPENINGS WITHIN HIS REALM.  ON THE
SOUTHERN END OF VERITY IS SITUATED THE FABLED TOWN OF MOONGLOW.  THE MAGI OF
MOONGLOW ARE CONSTANTLY IMPROVING THEIR SKILLS, BEING TIRELESS IN THE PURSUIT 
OF GREATER KNOWLEDGE OF THE MYSTIC ARTS.  WITHIN MOONGLOW, HOWEVER, CAN BE 
OBTAINED THE FINEST IN MYSTICAL REAGENTS.  THESE HERBS WILL HELP THOSE WITH 
MAGICAL SKILLS PREPARE AND CAST THEIR SPELLS.
     THIS THEN IS THE KNOWN REALM OF BRITANNIA.  SEVERAL SMALL VILLAGES ALSO 
DOT THE LANDSCAPE, BUT ALL ARE NOT RECORDED IN THE CHARTS OF THE REALM.  SOME 
OTHER ISLANDS OF VARYING SIGNIFICANCE HUG THE SHORELINE - MOST OF WHICH ARE
UNINHABITED AND BARREN.  THE ONLY ISLANDS THE TRAVELLER SHOULD BE CAUTIONS
ABOUT WHEN EXPLORING ARE KNOWN AS THE FENS OF THE DEAD.  DISEMBODIED WISPS,
 GHOSTS, LONG-DEAD LICHS, AND SAVAGE ZORNS HAVE BEEN REPORTED HERE.
     EXISTING MAPS ARE BY NO MEANS COMPLETE.  THERE ARE SAID TO BE OTHER
UNEXPLORED ISLES, WHEREIN ALL MANNER OF MOSTERS AND EVIL BEINGS RESIDE:
FLAME-BREATHING DRAGONS, MULTI-HEADED HYDRAS, HORNED DEVILS, FIERY LAVA 
LIZARDS A EVEN DREADED BALRONS ARE RUMOURED TO ROAM THE DISTANT SHORES.  
SOMEWHERE, OUT BEYOND CIVILIZATION IS ALSO REPUTED TO LIE THE RUINS OF THE 
LEGENDARY TOWN OF MAGINCIA, WHICH THE GODS DESTROYED FOR THE INSUFFERABLE 
PRIDE OF THOSE THAT DWELT THERE.  ALL OF THE MAGNIFICENT MARBLE PALACES AND 
GARDENS WERE DEVASTATED, AND THE RICH, HAUGHTY INHABITANTS REDUCED TO HAUNTING SPIRITS.  NO ONE HAS EVER
CNFIRMED THIS LEGEND, SO IT MAY JUST BE A FABLE TO FRIGHTEN THE WEAK OF HEART
AND INSTILL HUMILITY IN THOSE THAT OVERVALUE THEIR OWN WORTH.
     SEA TRAVEL ALONG THE COAST OF THE MAIN CONTINENT IS REASONABLY SAFE,
ALTHOGH A BOLD BAND OF PIRATES HAS BEEN RAIDING BRITANNIA OF LATE, TERRORIZING
THE POPULACE.  BEWARE, FOR THE PIRATES TAKE NO PRISONERS!  FARTHER OUT TO SEA
ROAM MANY MYTHICAL CREATURES. THE UNWARY VOYAGER WILL LIKELY ENCOUNTER GIANT
SQUIDS, NIXIES, POISONOUS SERPENTS, AND MYSTICAL SEAHORSES.  THE EVER-PRESENT
DANGER OF WHIRLPOOLS AND WATERSPOUTS MAKE SEAFARING A HAZARDOUS EXPERIENCE AT
BEST.
     IT IS HOPED THAT WITH THE NEXT EDITION OF THE HISTORY OF BRITANNIA,
TRAVELLERS WILL HAVE BROUGHT BACK MORE INFORMATION ON THESE UNEXPLORED REGIONS,
SO THAT THE MAP MAY BE COMPLETELY FILLED IN.  AS A FINAL CAUTION FOR THE WOULD
BE TRAVELLER - BEWARE OF THE MANY DUNGEONS AND THEIR DARK, SUBTERRANEAN
PASSAGES!

                       ]]]]] CHAPTER 3: FELLOWSHIP [[[[[

     UNDER LORD BRITISH'S RULE, EACH OF THE EIGHT TOWNS HAS DEVELOPED INTO A
CULTURAL CENTRE FOR ONE OF THE EIGHT MAJOR PROFESSIONS.  IN THIS MANNER, AN
ORDERLY SOCIETY HAS EVOLVED WITH LITTLE FRICTION BETWEEN THE DIVERSE
INHABITANTS.  NO ONE IS RESTRICTED TO THEIR TOWN OF BIRTH, AND ONE FREQUENTLY
FINDS PEOPLE OF VARIOUS PROFESSIONS VISITING A PARTICULAR TOWN.

     THESE ARE THE EIGHT MAJOR PROFESSIONS:

MAGE:   THE MAGI OF BRITANNIA GATHER IN MOONGLOW, NEAR THE LYCAEUM, WHERE THEY
CAN STUDY THE ANCIENT MYSTICAL SCROLLS OF THE LIBRARY. THE STRICTURES OF THEIR
PROFESSION PERMIT MAGI TO WEAR ONLY CLOTH ARMOUR AND CARRY EITHER A STAFF,
DAGGER, OR SLING.  UNCONFIRMED RUMORS INDICATE THAT THE HIGHEST ADEPTS HAVE
ACQUIRED THE USE OF ARCANE MAGICAL WEAPONS. THE PRIMARY WEAPON OF THE MAGE, OF
COURSE, IS MAGIC. AS THE MAGE BECCOMES MORE ADVANCED, MORE POWERFUL SPELLS CAN
BE WOVEN.  SOME OF THE GREATEST SPELLS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO LITERALLY SHAKE THE
EARTH, OR RAISE THE DEAD!

BARD:   THE BARDS OF BRITAIN ENTERTAIN THE PEOPLE WITH THEIR WONDERFUL BALLADS
AND TALES OF HEROIC DEEDS.  BARDS NOT ONLY CHRONICLE THE DEEDS OF VALOR, BUT
PERFORM THEM AS WELL.  THE WEAPON OF CHOICE FOR A BARD IS THE SLING, BUT THEY
MAY USE A CROSSBOW AT TIMES.  ALL ARMOUR SAVE THAT OF LEATHER IS SHUNNED BY
THESEMINSTRELLS, FOR THEY FIND METAL HARSH AND TOO NOISY FOR THEIR SENSITIVE
EARS.  THE BARD ALSO DABBLES IN MAGIC AND MAKES A FIND COMPAINON ON A LONG
JOURNEY.

FIGHTER:     FROM THE TOWN OF JHELOM HAIL THE MIGHTY FIGHTERS.  THEY PASS
THEIR LIES IN TRAINING AND HAVE THE USE OF ALL WEAPONS AND ARMOUR, THOUGH
MOST PREFER THE USE OF THE DOUBLE-EDGED BRITANNIAN SWORD, A DEVASTATING
WEAPON IN THE HANDS OF A SKILLED FENCER.  FIGHTERS HAVE LITTLE OR NO
MAGICAL TALENTS, FOR THEY BELIEVE ONLY IN THE USE OF ARMS AND FEAR THAT
MAGICAL TRAINING SAPS THE WILL AND CONCENTRATION OF A TRUE WARRIOR.  THEY
POSSESS A PARTICULAR AFFINITY FOR HORSES, AND ARE MOST USEFUL COMPANIONS ON
 TRAVELS TO UNCHARTED REGIONS.

DRUIDS:     THE DRUIDS ARE FIERCE FIGHTERS, ESPECIALLY WHEN DEFENDING THEIR
BELOVED GROVES.  THEY HOLD ALL TREES TO BE SACRED AND THEIR TOWN OF YEW LIES
DEEP IN THE WOODS. DRUIDS ARE ALSO IMPRESSIVE PRACTITIONERS OF THE MYSTIC ARTS
AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF HERBS IS WITHOUT PEER.  THEY MAY FIGHT WITH DIFFERET
TYPES OF BOWS, ALTHOUGH THEIR PREFERRED WEAPON IS THE MACE.  THE DRUIDIC
PHILOSOPHY FORBIDS THE WEARING OF METAL OF ANY KIND, SO LEATHER IS THEIR 
ARMOUR OF CHOICE.  THE DRUID'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAYS OF THE WOODLANDS MAKE 
THEM INVINCIBLE AS FELLOW TRAVELLERS.

TINKER:     THE TINKERS OF MINOC ARE BOTH HIGHLY SKILLED ARTISANS AND SUPERB
FIGHTERS.  THEY ARE GENERALLY SUSPICIOUS OF MAGIC, BELIEVING THAT ONLY
HAND-CRAFTED ARTIFACTS POSSESS TRUE VALUE, AND THUS USE IT SELDOMLY.  A TINKER
MAY USE ANY WEAPON, HOWEVER, THE DOUBLE-BLADED WAR AXE IS PREFERRED.  TINKERS
WILL USE ANY NON-MAGICAL ARMOUR.  A TRAVELLING PARTY WITH A TINKER ABROAD NEED
NEVER FEAR FOR REPAIR OF ANY METAL OR WOODEN ITEMS.

PALADIN:     THESE GREAT FIGHTERS LIVE IN THE TOWN OF TRINSIC IN THE SOUTHERN
PART OF BRITANNIA.  THEY ARE EXPERT IN ALL FORMS OF COMBAT AND WEAPON USE, AND
ARE ONE OF THE FEW PROFESSIONS THAT WILL MAKE USE OF MAGICAL CHAIN ARMOUR WHEN
IT IS AVAILABLE.  THEIR DEEP BELIEFS IN THE VALUE OF GOOD LEND STRENGTH TO 
THEIR MAGIC, WHICH THEY WIELD WITH A CERTAIN FLAIR.  PALADINS ARE THUS VERY 
FORMIDABLE OPPONENTS AND HIGHTLY VALUED ALLIES.

RANGER:     OFF THE WESTERN SHORE OF THE MAINLAND LIES THE FAIR ISLAND OF THE
RANGERS.  VENTURING FAR FROM THEIR RETREAT AT SKARA BRAE, THEY STRIVE TO 
IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS OF THE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE REALM.  RANGERS ARE 
WELL-VERSED IN WOODS LORE AND FIGHT FIERCELY WITH MOST WEAPONS, BUT SHUN ALL 
BUT LEATHER ARMOUR.  THEY ARE ALSO PROFICIENT MAGIC USERS AND FAULTLESS 
TRACKERS IN ANY WILDERNESS.

SHEPHERD:     IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER SHEPHERDS ARE SKILLED IN ANY FORM OF
WARFARE ON IN THE MYSTIC ARTS.  HOWVER, THEY ARE HIGHLY VALUED TRAVELLING
COMPNIONS FOR THEIR HUMILITY AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAYS OF THE LAND.

     A TRAVELLER IN BRITANNIA NEED NOT JOURNEY ALONE.  IN EACH TOWN ONE MAY -
INDEED ONE OUGHT TO - CONVERSE WITH ALL THE INHABITANTS.  IF THY PERSONAL
PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE IS CLOSE TO THAT OF THE TOWN, THEN THOU MAY ASK ON OF THE
RESIDENTS TO JOIN THY PARTY.  IF AMENABLE TO YOUR INVITATION, THIS PERSON WILL
TRAVEL WITH THEE, AID THEE, AND FIGHT WITH THEE.  HE OR SHE WILL STAY LOYAL TO
THEE ONLY AS LONG AS THOU STAY TRUE TO THY BELIEFS.  IF AT ANY TIME, THROUGH
ACTIONS OR DEEDS, THOU STRAY FROM THE PATH, THEY THY COMPANIONS WILL DESERT
 THEE TO THY FATE.  REMEMBER, THESE ARE FREE COMPANIONS - NOT SERVANTS OR
MERCENARIES.  SUCH IS THEIR FAITH IN THEE AS THEIR LEADER, THAT ALL GOLD
 AND SUPPLIES HELD BY THE PARTY IS GIVEN INTO THY CARE FOR THE GOOD OF
ALL.  USE THIS TRUST WISELY!


                       ]]]]] CHAPTER 4: MERCANTILE [[[[[

    THERE IS A THRIVING MERCHANT CLASS IN BRITANNIA. EACH TOWN AND VILLAGE HAS
ITS OWN SHOPS THAT SPECIALIZE IN LOCAL WARES AND SERVICES.  THE SEASONED
TRAVELLER WILL DISCOVER MANY DELIGHTFUL AND USEFUL ITEMS TO PURCHASE, AS WELL 
AS A WIDE VARIETY OF PLACES TO EAT AND SLEEP.
     THE MONETARY SYSTEM OF BRITANNIA IS BASED ON LORD BRITISH'S HERALDIC
CHARGE.  IT IS A GOLD COIN WITH A SILVER SERPENT CAST VERMEIL UPON THE GOLD.
THE PROCESS IS SO DIFFICULT THAT THE COIN HAS NEVER BEEN SUCESSFULLY
COUNTERFEITED OR DEBASED IN VALUE.  THIS COIN HAS BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF THE
REALM'S STABILITY AND IS UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED BY MERCHANTS. COINS OF THE REALM
ARE ALSO TO BE FOUND IN THE CHESTS THAT APPEAR FROM TIME TO TIME AND ARE FOUND
BELOW THE SURFACE IN THE DANK DUNGEONS. BEWARE, AS MOST CHESTS HAVE DIABOLICAL
TRAPS IN PLACE TO CONFOUND THIEVES.

HERE IS A PARTIAL LIST OF SOME OF THE MORE POPULAR SHOPS AND THEIR WARES:

WEAPONS SHOP:   HERE ONE MAY PURCHACE THE FINEST IN WEAPONRY THAT BLACKSMITHS
CAN FORGE.  DEPENDING ON THE SKILLS OF THE LOCAL ARTISANS, A SHOP MIGHT OFFER
THE FOLLOWING RANGE OF WEAPONS:

                          STAFF     SWORD
                          DAGGER    BOW
                          SLING     CROSSBOW
                          MACE      FLAMING OIL
                          AXE       HALBERD

    THE WEAPONS SHOPS ALSO OFFER LIBERAL TRADE-INS ON USED EQUIPMENT, ALTHOUGH
IF THY AXE IS GREATLY NOTCHED FROM BATTLE, DO NOT EXPECT MUCH FOR IT.

ARMOURY:    FINE ARMOUR MAY BE PURCHASED IN THE ARMOURIES OF BRITANNIA.  'TIS
JUST THE ITEM TO KEEP HIGHWAYMEN FROM SLIPPING A DIRK INTO THY RIBS! THE LOCAL
ARMOURY MAY OFFER ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SELECTION:

                                        CLOTH
                                        LEATHER
                                        CHAIN
                                        PLATE

     THE ARMOURIES WILL LIKEWISE OFFER TRADE-INS ON USED ARMOUR, ALTHOUGH MOST
WOULD NOT CONSIDER THEM LIBERAL.  BY THE TIME MOST FIGHTERS GET AROUND TO
SEEKING IMPROVED ARMOUR, THE OLD ARMOUR IS ALMOST COMPLETELY FALLING APART, 
AND ITS PRINCIPAL VALUE IS AS SCRAP FOR THE FOUNDRIES.

PUB:     THE SUBJECTS OF LORD BRITISH TRULY PRIZE THEIR PUBS, AND IT SHOWS IN
THE GRACIOUS HOSPITALITY TO BE FOUND IN ALL PUBLIC HOUSES.  MOST OFFER AN
EXCELLENT ARRAY OF DRINKS AND FOOD FOR THE WAYFARER. IT IS ALSO COMMONLY KNOWN
THAT THE BARTENDERS ARE INCURABLE GOSSIPS - IF ASKED THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND
OFFERED THE RIGHT PRICE - RARE NEWS MAY BE OBTAINED.  PUBLIC DRUNKENNESS IS
PROHIBITED THROUGHOUT THE LANDS OF BRITANNIA, SO TEMPER THY INDULGENCE WITH
WISDOM.

GROCERY:   LITTLE IS WORSE THAT BEING FAR FROM A TOWN AND FINDING THYSELF AND
ONE'S COMPANIONS STARVING TO DEATH BECAUSE THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE
EXPEDITION (THOU) HAS FORGOTTEN TO BUY ENNOUGH FOOD.  BE SURE TO LAY IN A
PLENTIFUL SUPPLY AT EACH OPPORTUNITY. THY FELLOW TRAVELLERS WILL MOST 
CERTAINLY BE APPRECIATIVE OF THY FORESIGHT.

THE HEALER:
    SOME TOWNS CONTAIN THESE INVALUABLE PLACES OF AID WHERE ONE MAY
GO TO BE HEALED WHEN SUFFERING FROM GRIEVOUS WOUNDS.  REMEMBER TO HEAL THY
COMPAINIONS ALSO, FOR A HEALTHY PARTY ENSURES SURVIVAL IN THE WILD REGIONS.  
THE HEALERS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO MAY CURE VICTIMS OF THE NOXIOUS VENOMS 
INFLICTED BY THE INHUMAN DENIZENS OF THE LAND.

INN:     THE NUMEROUS INNS OF BRITANNIA PROVIDE THE TIRED TRAVELLERS WITH A
COMFORTABLE NIGHT'S SLEEP, WHICH REFRESHES AND REVITALIZES EACH CHARACTER.
  THE CHARACTER OF THE INNS THROUGHOUT BRITANNIA VARIES, AS DOES THE PRICE.

HERB SHOP:    ALL PRACTITIONERS OF THE MYSTIC ARTS WILL SEARCH FAR AND WIDE TO
LOCATE THESE RARE SHOPS.  WITHIN THEM IS TO BE FOUND THE COMPONENTS - OR
REGEANTS, AS THEY ARE KNOWN TO ENCHANTERS - FOR SPELL MIXTURES.  WITHOUT THESE
MIXTURES, NO SPELL MAY BE CAST SUCESSFULLY. DUE TO THE RARENESS OF SOME OF THE
HERBS, MANY ARE NOT OFFERED FOR SALE REGULARLY, IF AT ALL.  THE KNOWN MAGICAL
REGEANTS ARE:

        SULPHUROUS ASH            BLOOD MOSS
        GINSENG                   BLACK PEARL
        GARLIC                    NIGHTSHADE
        SPIDER SILK               MANDRAKE ROOT

   CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO MIX THE HERBS IN THE CORRECT PROPORTIONS, SO AS NOT
TO WASTE THE VALUABLE INGREDIENTS.

GUILD SHOP:   THE THIEVES' GUILD HAS BEEN ESSENTIALLY DRIVEN OUT OF BRITANNIA,
BUT RUMORS PERSIST OF ITS EXISTENCE SOMMEWHERE IN THE OCEAN, PERHAPS ON ONE OF
THE UNCHARTED ISLANDS.  SOMEHOW THE GUILD MAINTAINS CONTACT WITH THE MAINLAND,
PERHAPS THROUGH THE BRAZEN PIRATES.  THE GOODS ONCE OFFERED BY THE GUILD WERE
QUITE EXPENSIVE, BUT INVALUABLE TO THE TRAVELLER WHO SOUGHT TO STRAY OFF THE
BEATEN PATH IN SEARCH OF NOVEL EXPERIENCES.

     THESE ARE THE MAIN SHOPS IN BRITANNIA.  A FEW OTHER PLACES EXIST THAT THE
WORTHY OF NOTE:

SHRINES:     HERE THE DEVOUT OF EACH TOWN MAY MEDITATE UPON THEIR PATH IN LIFE.
EACH SHRINE RESPONDS TO THE MEDITATION OF A DIFFERENT MANTRA (CHANT).
CONSISTENCY AND CONCENTRATION ARE THE KEYS TO MEDITATION.  ENLIGHTENMENT IS
ATTAINED ONLY THROUGH CARE.

THE SEER HAWKWIND:    RESIDING WITHIN LORD BRITISH'S CASTLE IS THE ROYAL SEER,
HAWKWIND. MANY ASPIRE TO TREAD THE PATH, BUT VERY FEW FIND THEIR WAY. SEEK THE
ADVICE OF THE SEER AS TO THY PROGRESS UPON THE PATH.  HE CAN LOOK INTO THY
HEART'S HEART AND READ THY PROGRESS OR FAILURE. HEED HIS ADVICE, FOR FEET THAT
HAVE STRAYED MAY BE BROUGHT BACK UPON THE PATH.


                     ]]]]] CHAPTER 5: TRANSPORTATION [[[[[

     THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES MOST TRAVEL HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY USE OF THE
FEET. WHILE THIS METHOD LENDS ITSELF TO SCENIC HIKES, IT IS A TERRIBLY SLOW 
WAY TO JOURNEY FROM ONE END OF A HUGE CONTINENT TO THE OTHER.  GETTING AROUND
BRITANNIA, WHICH MAY NEVER BE WITHOUT RISK, COULD SOON BECOME EASIER.
UNDER THE AUSPICES OF LORD BRITISH, STUDIES OF THE PROPERTIES OF THE
MOON GATES ARE BEGINNING TO YIELD A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE GATES'
MYSTICAL WORKINGS.  PEOPLE FORECAST THAT FUTURE CITIZENS WILL USE THESE
GATES AS A NORMAL MEANS OF DISTANT TRAVEL.  THE DESTINATIONS OF THE GATES
APPEAR TO BE RIGIDLY BOUND TO THE PHASES OF THE TWIN MOONS TRAMMEL AND
FELUCCA.  THE APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF THE GATES ARE DEFINITELY SO
LINKED.  THE LOCATION OF THE GATES ARE REPRESENTED ON MOST MAPS OF THE
REALM AS PHASES OF THE MOONS.  THE GATE ACTIVE IS INDICATED BY THE PHASE OF
THE MOON TRAMMEL.  ONCE A GATE IS ENTERED, THY DESTINATION IS INDICATED BY
THE PHASE OF THE MOON FELUCCA.

     BRITANNIA IS MARKED BY SIX TERRAIN TYPES, EACH WITH THEIR OWN FEATURES:

GRASS:     THE SMOOTHEST AND EASIEST TO TRAVEL ON, THE LUSH GRASS OF BRITANNIA
SERVES TO FATTEN ITS HERDS.  ONE MAY PASS HER WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT.

BRUSH:    LOW SCRUB GROWTH AND BUSHES WILL HINDER THY PROGRESS, PERMITTING THY
PARTY TO MOVE BUT AT THREE QUARTERS OF THEY NORMAL SPEED.  FINE TINDER FOR
CAMPFIRES MAY BE FOUND AT THE BASE OF THE LARGER SHRUBS.

FOREST:     THE GOING IS SLOW THROUGH DENSE WOODS, WITH THY SPEED CUT FULLY IN
HALF.  THE OAK SO DEARLY LOVED BY THE DRUIDS PREDOMINATES HERE, ALONG WITH
HEALTHY GROWTHS OF ASH AND BEECH.  THERE IS QUITE A LACK OF VISIBILITY IN THE
FOREST REGIONS.

HILLS:   HILLY TERRAIN, MUCH FAVORED BY THOSE WHO RAISE SHEEP, WILL SLOW THEE
DOWN CONSIDERABLY, SO MUCH SO THAT NONE BUT THE SURE-FOOTED MOUNTAIN GOAT CAN
MOVE AT MORE THAN A SNAIL'S PACE.

MARSH:
     THE MARSHES AND FENS ARE PARTICULARLY TREACHEROUS AND SHOULD BE
AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS.  WHILE PROGRESS IS ONLY SLOWED TO HALF ONE'S NORMAL PACE
BY THE MUCK UNDERFOOT, THE MARSHES GIVE OFF POISONOUS GASES WHICH CAN SEVERLY
HARM MEMBERS OF THE PARTY.

MOUNTAINS:     MOUNTAINEERING IS NOT A WELL-KNOWN SKILL IN BRITANNIA, SO THE
MOUNTAINS ARE CLOSED TO THE NORMAL TRAVELLER.  THERE IS ALSO A LACK OF
VISIBILITY OVER THE MOUNTAINS.

   HORSES MAY BE OBTAINED AND GREATLY SPEED TRAVEL ON LAND.  THE SAGES OF THE
LYCAEUM ARE REPUTED TO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A LIGHTER-THAN-AIR DEVICE FOR LORD
BRITISH, BUT IT WAS STOLEN SOME MONTHS AGO AND ITS WHEREABOUTS IS NOT KNOWN.
   SINCE WHILE TRAVELLING, THY PARTY MEMBERS' HIT POINTS MAY BE DIMINISHED BY
UNEXPECTED CONFRONTATIONS, EVERY SO OFTEN THOU SHOULD HOLE UP FOR THE NIGHT 
AND CAMP. IF THY REST IS NOT INTERRUPTED BY WANDERING CREATURES, THEN THY 
PARTY WILL BE GREATLY REFRESHED.
     AT SEA, MASTERFUL CONTROL OF THY SHIP IS NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL.  SHIPS
HAVE POWERFUL CANNONS, BUT THEY CAN ONLY FIRE BROADSIDE.  TO LEARN SEAMANSHIP,
THOU MUST UNDERSTAND THE WAYS OF THE WATER AND THE WIND.
     THE OCEAN IS MADE UP OF THREE TYPES OF WATER: LARGE WAVES MARK DEEP WATER;
SMALL WAVES INDICATE SHALLOW WATER; TIGHT RIPPLES SHOW WHERE LIKE SHOALS, TOO
SHALLOW FOR SHIPS TO PASS OVER.  REMEMBER THAT A CHANGE IN WAVE SIZE SIGNALS
APPROACHING LAND.  THIS WILL AID THY NAVIGATION.
     THE WINDS OF BRITANNIA BLOW VERY CONSTANT IN A GIVEN DIRECTION, THEN SHIFT
TO A NEW DIRECTION FOR ANOTHER LONG PERIOD.  THIS FACT ALLOWS THE SKIPPER OF A
SHIP TO SAIL STRATEGICALLY, IF THE SHIP IS FACING INTO THE DIRECTION OF THE
WIND, (SUCH AS SAILING EAST AGAINST AN EAST WIND) THEN THE SHIP'S PROGRESS IS 
AT ITS SLOWEST - 1/4 SPEED.  IF THE SHIP IS SAILING WITH THE WIND, (AS IN 
SAILING WEST WITHAN EAST WIND BEHIND THEE) THEN THE SHIP'S SPEED IS FASTER - 
3/4 SPEED. IT IS ONLY WHEN ONE TACKS ACROSS THE WIND THAT THE SHIP REACHES 
MAXIMUM SPEED, (SUCH AS SAILING NORTH OR SOUTH AGAINST AN EAST WIND) - FULL 
SPEED.
     STRIVE TO MANEUVER THY SHIP SO AS TO BRING EITHER THE PORT OR STARBOARD
BATTERIES TO BEAR BEFORE CREATURES OR PIRATES CAN CLOSE AND TRY TO BOARD.  THY
SHIP HAS ARMOUR WHICH, IF REDUCED TO ZERO, WILL CAUSE IT TO SINK AND THY PARTY
SHALL PERISH.  A CAPTURED PIRATE SHIP CAN BE USED IN PLACE OF A BADLY DAMAGED
SHIP.  PRACTICE NEAR SHORE UNTIL THOU DEVELOP SEAFARING LEGS.  THE SHIP'S
CANNONS ALSO SERVE FOR FIRING UPON LANDBOUND CREATURES.  BEWARE, SOME OF THE
LAND CREATURES HAVE THE POWER OF FLIGHT AND CAN PURSUE THEOVER THE WAVES!


           ]]]]] CHAPTER 6: WEAPONS AND THE ARMOUR OF THE REALM [[[[[

     WEAPONRY:

HANDS:
     IF THOU LOSE ALL OF THY WEAPONS, THIS IS WHAT THOU HAST LEFT.
ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE TO KILL SOME OF THE LESSER MONSTERS WITH THY BARE 
HANDS, THE ODDS OF SUCCESS TRULY ARE NOT VERY HIGH.

STAFF:    A SIX FOOT PIECE OF CARVED IRONWOOD THAT HAS BEEN MAGICALLY ATTUNED,
THE STAFF SOLD IN THE WEAPONS SHOP OF BRITAIN IS MORE FORMIDABLE THAN IT SEEMS.
IT IS THE FAVORITE WEAPON OF MAGI.

DAGGER:   TEN INCHES OF BEAUTIFULLY WORKED STEEL MAKE THE STANDARD BRITANNIAN
DAGGER.  THE TRADITIONAL BASKET HILT LOOKS VERY FUNCTIONAL.  A FAVORITE WEAPON
OF NOVICES.

SLING:     THE COMMON SLING IS FASHIONED FROM TWENTY-FOUR INCHES OF CLOTH,
FOLDED IN HALF, WITH A LEATHER CUP.  THE PROJECTILES - SMALL ROCKS - ARE 
EASILY COLLECTED, MAKING THIS AN INEXPENSIVE MISSILE WEAPON.  A PERENNIAL 
FAVORITE WITH TRAVELLERS DOWN ON THEIR LUCK.

MACE:     UPON THE 1 1/2 INCH THIK OAKEN STEM OF THE BRITANNIAN MACE RESTS A
GLOBE OF IRON STUDDED WITH KNOBS.  THE IMPACT OF THIS WEAPON HAS BEEN KNOW TO
SHATTER THE SKULLS OF ENEMIES OUTRIGHT.  A FAVORITE AMONG THE DRUIDS.

AXE:   WITH A DOUBLE-SIDED TWO FOOT BLADE, A WARRIOR WIELDING A BATTLE AXE CAN
REALLY WAGE WAR.  THE AXE IS A FAVORITE AMONG TINKERS, AS MANY OF THEM ARE
WORKERS OF WOOD AND METAL.

SWORD:     AH, A TRUE FIGHTER'S WEAPON.  FOUR FEET OF WICKED, BLUE STEEL WILL
STRIKE FEAR INTO THE HEART OF ANY OPPONENTS. THE SWORD IS AN AUTOMATIC 
FAVORITE AMONG FIGHTERS.

BOW:     A TRULY COMPETENT LONG-RANGE WEAPON.  GET THY ENEMIES BEFORE THEY CAN
GET THEE!  THE BRITANNIAN BOWS ARE MADE FROM THE FINEST YEW WOOD.  EACH 
LONGBOW IS HAND-RUBBED AND ORNAMENTED WITH HORN NOCKS ON THE TIPS.  A FAVORITE
AMONG THOSE WITH POOR ARMOUR.

CROSSBOW:
NOW HERE IS A REAL MISSILE WEAPON.  THE IMPACT OF THE CROSSBOW
WILL STOP A RAMPAGING TROLL.  THE CROSSBOW IS TRADITIONALLY MADE OF MAHOGANY
WITH CARVED MAPLE VENEER ON THE SIDES DEPICTING LORD BRITISH'S DEVICE, THE
SILVER SERPENT.  A FAVORITE AMONG BARDS FOR THE SINGING OF THE CROSSBOW'S
STRING.

FLAME OIL:     THE USE OF FLASKS OF FLAME OIL CONSTITUTES AN INNOVATION IN
BRITANNIA.  ANY OF THE EIGHT GREAT PROFESSIONS CAN USE IT.  THE WIELDER CASTS
THE IGNITED OIL IN A CHOSED DIRECTION, CREATING A CORRIDOR OF FLAMING OIL 
WHICH LASTS SEVERAL MINUTES.  ANY ENEMY ENTERING THE FIELD OF FLAMING OIL 
SUFFERS BURN DAMAGE FOR EACH TURN PASSED IN THE INFERNO.  A FAVORITE WEAPON 
AMONG THOSE BADLY HURT AND IN NEED OF DEFENSE - A LAST DITCH DEFENSE.

HALBERD:   SEVEN FEET OF STOUT WOOD TOPPED WITH A BLADE OF DEADLY STEEL.  THE
HALBERD REQUIRES EXCELLENT COORDINATION TO BE USED EFFECTIVELY. IT IS THE MOST
DEADLY OF WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF AN EXPERT, WHO USES IT TO STRIKE OVER THE
HEADS OF HIS FELLOWS.  A FAVORITE AMONG PALADINS.

     SEVERAL MAGICAL WEAPONS ARE SAID TO BE FOUND HITHER AND YON, BUT THE
LOCATION OF THESE ARE NOT KNOWN FOR CERTAIN.  IT IS SAID THAT PERCHANCE A
TRAVELLER MUST BE WORTH OF SUCH A WEAPON BEFORE IT WILL BECOME AVAILABLE.

     ARMOUR:

SKIN:      WHAT THOU ART LEFT WEARING WHEN THOU HAST NOW ARMOUR ATALL.
CLOTH:     PEASANT'S GARB FOR THOSF WHO CAN AFFORD NOTHING BETTER, OR THOSE
RESTRICTED BY THE VOWS OF THEIR PROFESSION FROM WEARING AUGHT ELSE.  A 
RELUCTANT FAVORITE AMONG MAGI.

LEATHER:     THE WORKHORSE OF NOVICE TRAVELLERS, LEATHER ARMOUR IS FOUND
THROUGHOUT BRITANNIA.  MANY OF THE PROFESSIONS ARE RESTRICTED TO LEATHER AS
THEIR BEST CHOICE.  A FAVORITE AMONG BARDS, DRUIDS, AND RANGERS.

CHAIN:   USED BY THOSE WHO CAN HANDLE THE WEIGHT OF CHAIN MAIL WHILE FIGHTING,
THIS ARMOUR OFFERS EXCELLENT PROTECTION.  ONLY THE FINEST STELL IS USED, WITH
DOUBLE THICKNESS ON THE SHOULDERS.  ALL LINKS ARE INDIVIDUALLY RIVETED FOR
STRENGTH.  A FAVORITE AMONG FIGHTERS AND TINKERS.

PLATE:   THE ARISTOCRAT OF THE ARMOURER'S CRAFT, PLATE AFFORDS MORE PROTECTION
THAN ANY OTHER CONVENTIONAL ARMOUR.  EACH SUIT IS TAILOR MADE TO THY SHAPE.  
THE COST IS NATURALLY SIZEABLE, BUT THE EFFECT IS INSPIRING.  A FAVORITE AMONG
PALADINS.

     AS IS THE CASE WITH WEAPONRY,, RUMORS ABOUND OF MAGICAL ARMOUR THAT WILL
WITHSTAND THE BREATH OF A DRAGON.  BUT WHO KNOWS?  PERHAPS THESE ARE BUT 
RUMORS SPREAD BY ORCS TO LURE FIGHTERS INTO ILLUSORY SEARCHES RESULTING IN 
DEATH.


                      ]]]]] CHAPTER 7: MAGICAL ARTS [[[[[

     MOST OF US UNDERSTAND ONLY THOSE THINGS THAT WE CAN SEE AND FEEL.  YET
THERE IS A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT CAN SEE THE UNSEEABLE, AND CAN FEEL
THAT WHICH HAS NO SUBSTANCE.  THE PERCEPTION AND USE OF THESE ETHEREAL FORCES 
IS CALLED MAGIC.  TO SOME IT IS AN ART, TO OTHERS A SCIENCE.  IT IS DIFFICULT 
FOR THIS HISTORIAN TO DESCRIBE THE ART WITH WHICH HE IS TOTALLY UNFAMILIAR.  
HE CAN, HOWEVER, COMMENT UPON WHAT PURPORTS TO BE THE SCIENCE.
     THE BASIS OF ALL SPELLCASTING IS THE PROPER MIXING OF THE NECESSARY
REAGENTS.  REAGENTS ARE THE PHYSICAL MATERIALS WHICH ARE SAID TO PROVIDE THE
INITIAL ENERGY TO BEGIN THE SPELL.  EACH SPELL USES A DIFFERENT REAGENT 
FORMULA.  THESE FORMULAS ARE JEALOUSLY GUARDED BY MAGIC USERS, FOR QUITE OFTEN
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH IS KNOWING A SPELL THAT THY OPPONENT 
KNOWS NOT.  FROM THE BILL OF FARE AT THE HERB SHOPS, THE OBSERVER CAN GLEAN 
THE NAMES OF THE REAGENTS: SULPHUROUS ASH; GINSENG; GARLIC; SPIDER SILK; BLOOD
MOSS; AND BLACK PEARL.
     FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE REPUTED TO BE TWO OTHERS, MORE POWERFUL STILL THAN
THOSE JUST LISTED. HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT FOR SALE ACCORDING TO THE PROPRIETORS
OF THE HERB SHOPS.  THEY ARE: NIGHTSHADE AND MANDRAKE ROOT.
     ONLY CERTAIN CLASSES OF THE EIGHT MAJOR PROFESSIONS HAVE ANY TELENT FOR
MAGIC.  SOME ARE QUITE STRONGLY ENDOWED, SUCH AS MAGI AND DRUIDS, WHILE THE
PALADINS, BARDS, TINKERS, AND RANGERS HAVE BUT A LITTLE POWER.  FIGHTERS AND
SHEPHERDS HAVE NO MAGICAL ABILITY AT ALL.  IN FACT, MAGI ARE SO TUNED TO THE
SPECIAL ENERGY THAT COMPRISES MAGIC THAT WHEN THEY CAST A SPELL, A BLUE AURA
GLOWS AROUND THEIR HEAD AND SHOULDERS.
     WHILE MOST SPELLS ARE REPUTED TO POSSESS EITHER OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE
ABILITIES, SOME ARE UTILITARIAN IN NATURE, SUCH AS LIGHT, OPEN AND VIEW 
SPELLS. THE RARE AEROMANCCER CAN HARNESS THE POWER OF THE WINDS.  AN ANCIENT 
SCROLL ON DISPLAY IN THE LIBRARY AT THE LYCAEUM TELLS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF 
ENERGY FIELDS CREATED BY MEANS MAGICAL.  IT LISTS THE FOLLOWING FIELDS AND 
DISCUSSES THEIR ROPERTIES.

SLEEP:     AGREEN FIELD THAT MAY BRING SLEEP TO ANYONE WHO PASSES THROUGH IT.

LIGHTNING:     A BLUE FIELD THAT SERVES AS AN IMPENETRABLE BARRIER WHICH
INFLICTS DAMAGE UPON ANY WHO TOUCH IT.

FLAME:     AN ORANGE FIELD THAT IMPARTS MASSIVE DAMAGE UPON THOSE FOOLISH 
ENOUGH TO CROSS IT.

POISON:     A VIOLET FIELD OF NOXIOUS VAPORS THAT POISONS ANYONE PASSING 
THROUGH WHO IS NOT QUICK TO HOLD THEIR BREATH.

     WHETHER THESE FIELDS MAY BE CONTROLLED BY MAGIC IS UNCERTAIN.  HOWEVER, 
THE SCROLL WAS CONCERNED WITH THE TALE OF A WIZARD'S BATTLE!  ONE CAN ONLY 
PONDER WHETHER THE WRITER SURVIVED THE ENCOUNTER.


                       ]]]]] CHAPTER 8: A BESTIARY [[[[[

BAT:     A NON-EVIL SUBTERRANEAN DWELLER FOUND IN THE DEEPEST CAVERNS, THE
PRINCIPAL DIET OF THE BAT IS ANIMAL BLOOD.  THEY ARE QUITE LARGE AND MAY 
ATTACK ANY WHO DISTURB THEIR REST.


CYCLOPS:     THESE EVIL GIANTS CAN HURL HALF-TON BOULDERS DOWN FROM THE 
HEIGHTS. EVEN A GRAZING HIT WILL DO CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO A MEMBER OF THY 
PARTY.  THE SERPENT'S SPINE IS SAID TO BE THE BEST HUNTING RANGE FOR THEM.

DRAGON:     THE DRAGON IS AN EVIL, FLYING SERPENT WHICH CAN CROSS WATER AND
BLAST SHIPS WITH HUGE FIREBALLS.  NOT MANY SHIPS CAN WITHSTAND
 A COUPLE OF PASSES BY AN ATTACKING DRAGON.

ETTIN:     THESE EVIL TWO-HEADED ABERRATIONS OF NATURE CAN CAST HUGE BOULDERS
DOWN UPON THY PARTY, CAUSING IMMENSE DAMAGE IT IS BEST TO TRY TO KILL THEM 
WITH LONG-RANGE WEAPONS AND SPELLS. A LARGE CLAN OF ETTINS IS SAID TO LIVE 
ALONG THE SERPENT'S SPINE.

GAZER:     THESE HYPNOTIC CREATURES SNARE THEIR PREY BY PUTTING THEM TO SLEEP.
THE DEEP FORESTS ARE THE FAVORITE HABITAT OF THESE EVIL, FLOATING EYES.

GHOST:     THE RESTLESS SPIRITS OF THOSE TRAPPED BETWEEN PLANES, GHOSTS CAN 
PASS THROUGH WALLS, SO USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN THEY ARE THOUGHT TO BE NEAR
BY.  EVIL GHOSTS ARE OFTEN FOUND IN RUINS, BATTLEFIELDS, AND CRYPTS.

GREMLIN:     THESE HUNGRY DENIZENS OF THE UNDERWORLD LOVE TO SNEAK UP TO 
UNWARY TAVELERS AND STEAL ALL THEIR FOOD.  DO NOT LET AN EVIL GREMLIN GET 
NEXT TO THEE!

HEADLESS:     ANOTHER EVIL BEING BEST SUITED TO TERROR AND DESTRUCTION, THE
HEADLESS IS INDEED A CREATURE OF NIGHTMARES.  MANY A TRAVELLER HAS FLED IN
ABJECT HORROR AT THE SIGHT OF THESE HEADLESS TORSOS BEARING DOWN UPON THEM.

HYDRA:     BEWARE OF THE EVIL BREATH OF THE MULTI-HEADED HYDRA!  THE MASSIVE
FIREBALLS CAN FRY MOST MEMBERS OF THY PARTY.

INSECTS:     IF THOU DOST STAY CLEAR OF THESE NON-EVIL VERMIN, THEY WILL NOT
BOTHER THEE.  MARSH ANMD DUNGEONS ARE THEIR FAVVORITE LOCALES. INSECTS CAN 
FLY, SO THEY CAN CHASE THEE OVER WATER.

LICH:     THIS UNDEAD SHADE OF A POWERFUL WIZARD CAN STILL CAST VERY POWERFUL
MAGIC SPELLS.  THE LICH IS A MOST DANGEROUS OPPONENT UNDER EVEN FAVORABLE
CONDITIONS.

LAVA LIZARD:     THESE REPTILIAN CREATURES LOVE FIRE AND DEWLL IN INFERNOS.  
IN COMBAT THEY HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO SPIT FLAMING LAVA THIRTY FEET, SO BEWARE 
THESE EVIL BEASTS!

MIMIC:     ONE OF THE MOST TREACHEROUS AND EVIL CREATURES IN ALL OF BRITANNIA,
THE MIMIC CAN ASSUME ANY SHAPE, ALTHOUGH THEY SEEM TO PREFER ASSUMING THE
LIKENESS TO TREASURE CHESTS.  UPON SPOTTING ONE, THE CARELESS TRAVELLER
GREEDILY RUSHES TOWARD THE CHEST.  WHEN THE TRAVELLER GETS CLOSE ENOUGH,
MIMIC CASTS OUT A POISONOUS VENOM.  WHEN THE TRAVELLER SUCCUMBS TO THE
POISON, THE MIMIC FEASTS UPON HIM.  THE ONLY KNOWN WAY TO DETECT A CHEST
MIMIC IS TO WAIT UNTIL IT GETS CURIOUS ENOUGH TO PEER OUT AT THE BY LIFTING
 THE LID OF THE CHEST.

NIXIE:     THESE AQUATIC FIRST COUSINS OF THE ANCIENT RACE OF ELVES RISE FROM
THE DEPTHS TO STRIKE TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF SEAFARERS.  THE EVIL NIXIES 
WIELDS HARP TRIDENTS WHICH CAN BE HURLED AGAINST A SHIP'S CREW FROM AFAR, 
CAUSING GREAT DAMAGE.

ORC:     WOULD THAT EVERY ORC HAD BEEN DESTROYED WITH THE FALL OF THE TRIAD OF
EVIL!  THEY BREED LIKE RABBITS AND STILL INFEST THE WOODS AND HILLS, THOUGH
 IN MUCH SMALLER NUMBERS THAT BEFORE.

PHANTOM:     THESE TRAGIC SOULS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY EVIL AND FORCED TO 
REENACT THEIR BATTLES THROUGHOUT ALL TIME.  THEY ARE BODILESS, BUT CAN BE 
DETECTED BECAUSE THEIR SWORDS AND SHIELDS REMAIN VISIBLE.  PHANTOMS ARE TOUGH 
OPPONENTS AS DYING IS MEANINGLESS TO THEM.

PIRATES:     TRULY THE DREGS OF BRITANNIA, MOST OF THESE CREWS HAVE DEATH
WARRANTS HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS.  REMBMBER THAT THE EVIL PIRATES TAKE NO
PRISONERS!  THEIR SHIPS ARE EQUIPPED WITH HEAVEY CANNONS, AND THE CREWS ARE
WELL-TRAINED TO QUICKLY MOVE THEIR LARGE GALLEONS INTO BATTLE POSITION.  IT 
IS A RARE SKIPPER INDEED THAT CAN SURVIVE A BROADSIDE DUEL WITH A PIRATE 
VESSEL. THY BEST HOPE IS TO "DOT THE T", OR TO CLOSE WITH THY ENEMY.  IF THOU 
ART ABLE TO DEFEAT THE CREW, THE SHIP ITSELF BECOMES THY PRIZE.  FOR CASTAWAYS
ON REMOTE IS LANDS, THIS IS THE ONLY HOPE FOR SALVATIONS

PYTHON:     THE VENOM OF BRITANNIAN PYTTHON IS HIGHLY POISONOUS.  THESE 
NON-EVIL CONSTRICTORS CAN SPIT THEIR FOUL VENOM A FULL ELEVEN PACES, AND 
SHOULD BE TREATED WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT.

RAT:
     THE COMMON GIANT RAT, WHILE NOT EVIL BY NATURE, WILL STILL ENTER HUMAN
CAMPS IN SEARCH OF FOOD.  THEY POSE A THREAT TO ANY DUNGEON EXPLORERS FOOLISH
ENOUGH TO STARTLE THEM.

REAPER:     THESE GRIM CREATURES STAND UPRIGHT ON TRUNK-LIKE BODIES AND WAVE
MANY TENTACLES AT THEIR PREY.  THE EVIL REAPER CAN ALSO REPUTEDLY CAST 
DIFFERENT ENERGY FIELDS, AND THUS IS CONSIDERED A MOST VICIOUS OPPONNENT.

ROGUE:     THE TOGUES THAT ARE TO BE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE LAND ARE OFTEN 
ESCAPED PRISONERS WHO NOW MAKE THEIR LIVELIHOOD AS HIGHWAYMEN BY ATTACKING 
TRAVELLERS. IF THEY GET NEXT TO THEE, THEY MAY PICK THY POCKETS.

SEAHORSE:     THESE MAGICAL CREATURES APPEAR QUITE FAIR AND ARE NOT EVIL, BUT 
IF OFFENDED THEY MAKE DEVASTATING ENEMIES.  THEY ARE POSSESSED OF POWERFUL 
MAGICAL AILITIES WHICH CAN WREAK HAVOC AMONG THY PARTY.

SERPENT:     THE SEA SERPENT IS AN AQUATIC RELATIVE OF THE DRAGON.  THE 
FIREBALL CAST BY THE SERPENT CAN SINK A SHIP LONG BEFORE IT HAS A CHANCE TO 
CLOSE WITH THE BEAST.  THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A SEA SERPENT IS TO ENGAGE IT 
IN CLOSE COMBAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  IT IS THY ONLY CHANCE, ALBEIT A SLIM 
ONE, TO SURVIVE THE ENCOUNTER.

SKELETON:     ANIMATED BONES, THE SKELETONS ARE THE UNDEAD INCARNATIONS OF A
VARIETY OF CREATURES.  THESE TOOLS OF EVIL STRIKE FEAR INTO ORDINARY 
TRAVELLERS. WITH THE PROPER ENCHANTMENT, HOWEVVER, THEY CAN BE DISPELLED.

SLIME:     DUNGEON WALLS FAIRLY OOZE WITH SLIME.  MOST SLIME JUST SITS THERE,
THIS EVIL VARIETY COMES AFTER THEE!

SPIDER:     BEWARE OF INADVERTENTLY WRECKING A SPIDER'S WEB AND THIS NON-EVIL

CREATURE WILL PROBABLY LEAVE THEE IN PEACE.  IF THOU SUFFER THE MISFORTUNE OF
CROSSING ONE, TAKE CARE TO AVOID THE VENOMOUS SPITTLE.

SQUID:     WHEN THE TENTACLES OF THE GIANT SQUID CLOSE AROUND A MAN OR A SHIP,
THE VERY POWER OF LIGHTNING IS RELEASED UPON THE PREY.  'TIS BEST TO TRY TO
DESTROY THE EVIL SQUID WITH CANNON FIRE BEFORE IT CAN ENGAGE THEE AT CLOSE
QUARTERS.

TROLL:     THESE LARGE AND EVIL CREATURES CAN HURL AXES - OF WHICH THEY CARRY 
A PLENTIFUL SUPPLY - WITH FRIGHTENING ACCURACY.  BEWARE THEIR TRICKS.  TROLLS 
ARE USUALLY FOUND IN HILLS AND MOUNTAINS.

WISP:  MORE INSUBSTANTIAL THAN MOST EVIL CREATURES, WISPS CAN ACTUALLY 
TELEPORT AROUND THE BATTLEFIELD AND ATTACK FROM ANYWHERE.  IT IS MOST 
DISCONCERTING TO BE INVOLVED IN AN ENCOUNTER THAT CONTAINS A WISP.

WIZARD:     NOT ALL MAGIC USERS FOLLOW THE PATH OF GOOD.  THESE EVIL RENEGADE
WIZARDS MAKE VERY DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES WHEN CROSSED.

ZORN:     ZORNS ARE THE ANTITHESIS OF EVERYTHING.  THEY PASS RIGHT THROUGH
WALLS AND OBSTACLES, AND NEGATE ALL NEARBY MAGIC.  IF AN EVIL ZORN CLOSES
WITH THE, THOU PROBABLY WILL NOT ESCAPE ITS EMBRACE.

     LORDS OF THE EVIL DOMINION:

BALRON:     IT IS BELIEVED BY SOME THAT ALL OF THESE MARSHALS OF EVIL WERE
DESTROYED WHEN THE TRIAD FELL.  IF ANY DO EXIST, IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ONE TO
QUIT LIFE ITSELF THAN TO FACE THE FURY OF A BALRON.  THE ANCIENT SCROLLS
DESCRIBE THEM AS FLYING CREATURES WHICH CAST DEVASTATING FIREBALLS AS
WELL AS WEAVE MASSIVE ENCHANTMENTS THAT ONCE FELLED ENTIRE ARMIES.

DEVIL:     THESE FLYING LIEUTENANTS OF EVIL MAY SWEEP OFF SHORE AND CHASE THEE
ACROSS THE WAVES.  THEY ARE POWERFUL MAGIC USERS AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL
COSTS.  DEVILS ARE PARTICULARLY FOND OF TORTURING THEIR VICTIMS WHEN THE
OPPORTUNITY ARISES.


                  ]]]]] CHAPTER 9: THE SKILLS OF COMBAT [[[[[

    THE HISTORIAN IS A MAN OF INTELLECTUAL PURSUITS AND THEREFORE LITTLE
ACQUAINTED WITH THE WAYS OF COMBAT.  FOR THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON SUCH
SKILLS, WE ARE DEEPLY INDEBTED TO THE MASTER AT ARMS OF THE ORDER OR THE 
SILVER SERPENT.
    BEFORE FIGHTING.  BE CERTAIN THAT THOU ART PROPERLY EQUIPPED FOR THE 
ENSUING FRAY.  DOST THOU HAVE THE PROPER WEAPON AND ARMOUR?  IF NOT, THEN THOU MUST
EQUIP THYSELF ANEW.  WHEN THOU COMMENCE TO READY A WEAPON OR WEAR SOME ARMOUR,
THOU WILT BE OFFERED A SELECTION OF SUCH ITEMS AS ARE AVAILABLE IN THY PARTY'S
COMMON POOL.  IF THOU DOST CHOOSE AN ITEM INAPPROPRIATE FOR THY CLASS THOU 
WILL BE ASKED TO SELECT AGAIN.
    INITIATING COMBAT.  WHEN THOU ART NEXT TO AN ENEMY, THOU MAY ATTACK IN THE
DIECTION OF THY FOE.  THOU WILT THEN BE ABLE TO VIEW THY COMBAT LOCATION, AND
BATTLE SHALL ENSUE.
    BEING ATTACKED.  IF THOU DOST NOT ATTACK A CREATURE, THEN ASSUREDLY THE
CREATURE WILL ATTACK THEE AT ITS EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY, ASSUMING THAT THE
CREATURE IS EVIL OR HUNGRY.
    HOW TO FIGHT.  EACH FIGHTER AND MAGIC USER WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR
SEPARATE ACTION.  THOU MAY ONLY ATTACK IN THE MAIN CARDINAL DIRECTIONS (NORTH,
EAST, SOUTH, AND WEST).  WHEN IT IS A FIGHTER'S TURN, THOSE WITH HAND WEAPONS
MAY ATTACK AN ADJACENT AREA BY SPECIFYING THE DIRECTION.  THOSE WITH MISSILE
WEAPONS MAY FIRE THEM ACROSS THE BATTLEFIELD BY DENOTING THEIR DIRECTION OF
FIRE.  MAGIC USERS CAN CAST A SPELL WHEN IT IS THEIR TURN.  AGAIN, ONLY SPELLS
FOR WHICH REAGENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED WILL FUNCTION.  THE SPELL MUST BE 
SELECTED AND THE DIRECTION FIXED.  MOST COMBAT SPELLS ARE FUNCTIONAL ACROSS 
THE FIELD OF BATTLE. ENERGY FIELDS, HOWEVER, CAN BE CAST ONLY IN AREAS 
ADJACENT TO THE CASTER.
    VICTORY.  WHEN ALL OF THE MONSTERS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, THOU WILT RETURN 
TO THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE.  IF THE MONSTERS WERE CARRYING ANY TREASURE, 
THIS WILL NOW BE AVAILABLE TO THEE.  CARE SHOULD BE USED IN OPENING ANY 
TREASURE CHESTS, AS THEY ARE FREQUENTLY TRAPPED.
    FLEEING.  THERE WILL COME TIMES IN THY QUESTS WHEN THOU WILT BE CONFRONTED
WITH SUPERIOR FORCES.  WHENEVER ONE OF THY TEAM IS NEAR DEATH, GUIDE HIM OR 
HER OFF THE COMBAT FIELD TO SAVE THEM.  IF THE TACTICAL SITUATION DETERIORATES
COMPLETELY, REMOVING ALL MEMBERS OF THE PARTY FROM THE FIELD WILL DISENGAGE 
THEE FROM THY ENEMY.  THERE ARE THOSE WHO WILL CALL THY ACTIONS COWARDLY, BUT 
A WISE LEADER WILL KNOW THE VALUE OF PRESERVING THE LIFE OF ONE'S FELLOWS.
    TERRAIN CONSIDERATIONS.  DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE TIME TO THE STUDY OF THE 
FIELDS OF COMBAT.  LOCATE DEFENSIBLE POSITIONS FOR THY PARTY, MAKING SURE TO 
MAINTAIN AN AVENUE OF ESCAPE SHOULD THE BATTLE GO BADLY.  REMEMBER OUR 
HERITAGE!  A FEW VALIANT FIGHTERS STRATEGICALLY PLACED IN A NARROW ROCKY PASS 
CAN STAND OFF AN ARMY NUMBERD IN THE THOUSANDS.
    WEAPON CONSIDERATIONS.  THERE ARE THREE DISTINCT CLASSES OF WEAPONS
AVAILABLE TO THE WARRIOR.  THEY ARE: MISSILE WEAPONS WHICH PERMIT THE STRIKING
OF FOES AT A DISTANCE; POLEARMS WHICH ALLOW ONE TO SMITE OFVER AN OBSTACLE OR
COMPANION; AND HAND TO HAND WEAPONS WHICH NECESSITATE ENGAGING ONE'S ENEMIES 
AT VERY CLOSE QUARTERS.
    ETHICS OF WAR.  DO NOT FEEL THAT IT IS THY BIRTHRIGHT TO SLAY EVERYTHING
THAT WALKS, FLIES, OR SWIMS.  THE CODE OF CHIVALRY STATES THAT BEFORE
ENGAGING IN COMBAT WITH A FOE, THE WARRIOR SHOULD ASK, "IS THIS FOE TRULY
EVIL?"  IF IT IS NOW, THEN THOU MUST NOT KILL IT, BUT STAND THY GROUND AND
FORCE IT TO RETREAT.  THE CODE IS THY TOUCHSTONE, FOR WITHOUT IT THOU ARE
 BUT A SPECK OF DUST IN THE WHIRLWIND OF CHAOS.


          ]]]]] CHAPTER 10: MODERN CIVILIZATION AND OUR UNIVERSE [[[[[

     WE HAVE JUST EMERGED FROM THE DARKEST PERIOD IN RECORDED HISTORY.  WITH 
THE VANQUISHING OF THE TRIAD OF EVIL.  WE NEED NO LONGER ANXIOUSLY WATCH OUR 
BACKS FOR FEAR THAT EVIL WILL FALL UPON US IN THE FIRST UNGUARDED MOMENT.  THE
STABILITY ACHIEVED BY THE NEWAGE SEEMS TO HERALD A GOLDEN AGE OF PEACE AND
PROSPRITY.
    WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE WILL INHERIT THIS NEW AGE?  SURELY OUR DESTINY IS NOT 
TO PERPETUALLY FIGHT AS WARRING TRIBES THROUGHOUT ALL TIME.  IS THERE NOT A 
HIGHER CALLING - ONE WORTHY OF OUR EFFORTS AND CAPABILITIES?
     IF ONE ACCEPTS THAT THE NEXT AREA OF HUMAN GROWTH SHOULD NOT BE FOSTERED
THROUGH AGRESSIVE TERRITORIAL EXPANSION, THEN A POSSIBLE ANSWER EMERGES - WE
MUST TURN INWARD.  OF LATE A SMALL GROUP OF INQUISITIVE PHILOSOPHERS AT THE
LYCAEUM HAVE BEEN ASKING SUCH QUESTIONS OF EACH OTHER.  WHILE THEIR MUSINGS 
SEEM QUITE RADICAL AND NEW, THEY ARE WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION:
     IS LIVING A LIFE OF VIRTUE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF CIVILIZATION, OR CAN
SOCIETY SURVIVE T
HE TEST OF TIME WITHOUT SUCH PRINCIPLES?
     HOW MIGHT WE ENSURE THE LONG-TERM CONTINUATION OF OUR NEW-FOUND PEACE?
WHAT SYSTEMS OF LAWS AND ETHICS WILL ENSURE THE CONTINUED HAPPINESS OF ALL OUR
PEOPLE?
     WHY DOTH EVIL STILL STALK THE WORLD AND CAN IT EVER BE TRULY VANQUISHED?
     IF THE PUBLIC SET OF ETHICS WHICH EVOLVED FROM THE DAYS OF PRIMORDIAL
SURVIVAL IS IMPURE, HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE A CLEAN FOUNDATION UPON WHICH TO BUILD 
A LIFE OF VIRTUE?
     GIVEN THE PREMISE THAT TO UNDERSTAND PURITY, ONE MUST STRIVE TO BE SO, 
HOW DOES ONE STRIVE FOR THAT WHICH CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD?
     IF OUR TRUE PURPOSE HERE IS TO ACHIEVE A BALANCE WITH OUR SURROUNDINGS - 
AS IS SUGGESTED IN THE ANCIENT SCROLLS OF THE LIBRARY - HOW CAN WE FACE NATURE
WITHOUT FIRST FACING OURSELVES?
     MEDITATION SEEMS TO HOLD THE KEY TO PERSPECTIVE.  IN THE TRANSCENDENTAL
STATE ONE IS FREED FROM THE SHACKLES OF MODERN LIVING.  THE WHOLE OF THE
UNIVERSE RESONATES WITH THEE, AND THOU DOST FEEL FOR ONCE AS IF THOU DOST 
BELONG TO A GREATER WHOLE.  YET ALL TOO SOON THE MEDITATION ENDS, AND THOU 
DOST RETURN FROM THIS BRIEF GLIMSE OF THE SUBLIME TO THE DAILY NEED FOR 
SURVIVAL.
     IT IS THE TIME FOR ALL TO PUT ASIDE THEIR WARLIKE WAYS AND BEGIN FIGHTING
THE EVIL THAT LURKS WITHIN THEMSELVES.  IT IS FAR TOO EASY TO SIT AND ESPOUSE
THE PATH OF VIRTUE, YET NEVER SET FOOT UPON IT.  THE ANCIENT RULE OF TREATING
OTHERS AS THOU WOULDST BE TREATED THYSELF TAKES ON NEW MEANING WHEN PUT IN THE
CONTEXT OF UNIVERSAL HARMONY.  WE MUST BECOME LIVING EXAMPLES OF OUR BELIEFS!
     HOW DOES ONE BEGIN TO FIRST WALK ALONG THIS NEW WAY?  DO ROAD MARKERS 
EXIST IF WE BUT OPEN OUR EYES TO SEE THEM?
     TO BE AT PEACE IN ALL AREAS IS A STATE ONLY ACHIEVED BY AN AVATAR.  IS
SUCH A STATE ATTAINABLE BY ANY HUMAN, FALLIBLE AS WE ALL ARE?  THE TRUE ANSWER
CAN ONLY BE FOUND BY THOSE WHO QUEST FORTH IN SEARCH OF IT - FOR WHO CAN SEE 
THE END OF THE PATH BEFORE BEGINNING THE JOURNEY?  YET IT IS ALSO WRITTEN THAT FOR
EACH PERSON THE PATH IS DIFFERENT.  PERHAPS THE SEEKER OF WISDOM AND ENLIGHTEN-
MENT SHOULD BEGIN BY VISITING LORD BRITISH, FOR HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAYS OF 
THE LAND IS GREAT.  CONVERSING WITH HIM MAY HELP ONE TO DETERMINE WHERE LIE 
THE CENTRES OF THE EIGHT VIRTUES OF THE AVATAR.
     MANY PHILOSOPHERS HOLD THE OPINION THAT THE PATH IS IN REALITY BUT A 
SERIES OF SEPARATE SMALL PATHS.  EACH MINOR PATH LEADS TO THE FULFILLMENT OF 
AN ASPECT OF OURSELVES.  TREADING ONE OF THESE MINOR PATHS MAY BE CONSTRUED AS
A LIFE'S GOAL, AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE DEBATED WHICH IS THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS TO 
FOLLOW. 
     YET IS NOT THE WHOLE MUCH GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS?  TAKE UP THE
CHALLENGE AND TREAD NOT ONE BUT ALL OF THE MINOR PATHS IN THY SEARCH FOR
ENLIGHTENMENT AND PERFECTION.  PERHAPS ONLY THEN WILL THOU FIND THE BEGINNINGS
OF THEGREAT PATH.  THE QUEST OF THE AVATAR AWAITS.  IT IS NOT THY HERITAGE THAT
THOU DOES SEEK, 'TIS THY DESTINY!

                         AS TOLD BY PHILPOP THE WEARY,

                       MAGICIAN TO THE COURT OF HIS MOST
                            SOVEREIGN LORD BRITISH.

     KNOW YE, O SEEKER OF THE MYSTIC WISDOMS, THAT THE WAYS OF MAGIC ARE 
DIVERSE AND STRANGE.  THERE EXISTS THE NEED FOR UTMOST CONCENTRATION AND THE 
HARVESTING OF THINGS MAGICAL IN ORDER THAT YE MAY HARNESS THE POWERS OF THE 
UNIVERSE. MANY ARE THE AEONS OF WISDOM CONTAINED IN THESE PAGES WHICH I WRITE 
FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY PUPILS, YET STILL THERE IS MUCH TO LEARN.


ALL MAGIC IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE USE OF MEANS BOTH HUMAN AND OF NATURE, FOR
TRUE MAGIC IS BUT THE MELDING OF HUMAN WILL AND NATURAL FORCE.  WITHOUT THE
HUMAN VOICE TO UTTER THE CHANT, NO SPELL MAY BE CAST.  YET WITHOUT THE PROPER
NATURAL CATALYST, NO SPELL MAY BE EFFECTIVE.  THUS MAGIC IS TWOFOLD, A BALANCE
STRUCK BETWEEN NATURE AND HUMANITY.  LET US EXAMINE BOTH ASPECTS HERE, BEGINING
WITH THOSE NATURAL SUBSTANCES, KNOWN AS REAGENTS, THAT LEND POWER TO THE WORDS
OF THE SPELLCASTER.
___________________________________________________________________________

SULPHURUS ASH:     SULPHUS IS THE SUBSTANCE FOUND IN NATURE THAT MOST USEFUL IN
THE GENERATION OF FIRE.  IT IS THE COLOR OF SAFFRON AND, WHEN BURNED, GIVES OFF
AN ODOR INDICATIVE OF ITS GREAT MYSTIC STRENGTH.  YET ITS TRUE POWER IS TO BE
FOUND IN THE SECOND BURNING - THAT IS, IN THE USE OF THE ASHEN RESIDUE OF
SULPHUR THAT HAS BEEN BURNED IN A CRUCIBLE FASHION FROM THE SKULL OF A BALRON.
SULPHUROUS ASH IS NOT AN UNCOMMON SUBSTANCE, HAVING BEEN A STAPLE OF THE
WIZARD'S PROFESSION THROUGH THE AGES.  IT MAY BE PURCHASED FROM ANY REPUTABLE
PURVEYOR OF MAGICAL GOODS AND IS USEFUL IN THE CASTING OF ENERGY FIELDS AND
MAGIC MISSLES, AS WELL AS IN SPELLS REQUIRING A QUICK BURST OF LIGHT OR A
SUSTAINED GLOW.

GINSENG:     LONG PRAISED FOR ITS STRENGTH-GIVING AND MEDICINAL PROPERTIES, THE
ROOT OF THE GINSENG PLANT IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZABLE FOR ITS FORKED SHAPE, AND
TO THOSE INITIATED IN THE MYSTIC WAYS, BY ITS OVERPOWERING ROSE-COLOURED AURA.
IT HAS BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES BY PEASANTS WHO CHEW IT OR BREW TEA FROM A
POWDERED PREPARATION OF THE ROOT IN ORDER TO GAIN STRENGTH AND STAMINA AS THEY
TOIL IN THE FIELDS.  WHILE COMMONLY FOUND THROUGHOUT BRITIANNIA, THE GINSENG
USED AS A COMPONENT IN THE CASTING OF SPELLS IS GENERALLY BLACK IN COLOUR AND
FOUND ONLY ON THE SLOPES OF THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS.  IT MAY BE PURCHASED IN
VIRTUALLY ANY SHOP THAT SELLS MAGICAL GOODS, AND IS MOST USEFUL IN SPELLS OF A
HEALING OR NARCOTIC NATURE, SUCH AS CURE OR SLEEP ENCHANTMENTS.

GARLIC:     EVEN THE MOST COMMON OF NATURE'S GIFTS TO OUR PEOPLE HAVE MAGICAL
PROPERTIES AS CAN BE WITNESSED BY THE POWER OF GARLIC.  THIS PUNGENT BULB IS
FOUND IN EVERY GARDEN IN THE LANDS OF BRITINNIA, AND NO STEW OR ROAST WOULD BE
COMPLETE WITHOUT ITS SHARP FLAVOR.  ITS AROMATIC NATURE MAKES GARLIC A POWERFUL
REAGENT IN THE CASTING OF MAGICAL SPELLS, AND IT IS USED IN ALL SPELLS OF THE
WARDING VARIETY - BE THEY THE WARDING OFF OF COMMON AND MAGICAL SICKNESS OR THE
REPELLING OF BEINGS ONCE DEAD.

SPIDER SILK:     THE MIRACLE OF SPIDER SILK LIES IN ITS TENSILE STRENGTH.
IMAGINE, IF YOU WILL, A GROWN MAN RELYING ON A STRAND OF CATGUT TO HOLD HIS
WEIGHT ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE.  A SPIDER RELIES ON THE FINEST OF THREADS TO DO
JUST THAT, AND ITS SILK NEVER FAILS IT.  WE SHOULD PRAISE THE FIRST WIZARDLING
WHO REALIZED THE MYSTIC SECRET OF SPIDER SILK, FOR IT IS TO HIM OR HER THAT WE
OWE THE KNOWLEDGE OF BINDING AND RESTRAINING SPELLS.  THE SILK OF THE DEADLY
ALBINO GHOUL SPIDER - BOTH THE MIMIATURE AND GIANT VARIETIES - HAS BEEN USED BY
ADEPTS THROUGH THE YEARS IN RITES OF MAGIC.  THE SPIDER FARMS OF THE SOUTH
PRODUCE PERHAPS A HUNDRED POUNDS OF THE SUBSTANCE EACH YEAR AND SELL IT TO THE
MERCHANTS OF MAGIC, WHERE IT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL WHO PLY OUR TRADE.  IT IS
SAID THAT EACH YEAR ONE WORKER DIES THE HORRIBLE DEATH INCURRED BY THE BITE OF
THE ALBINO GHOUL SPIDER TO ENSURE THE POTENCY OF THE SILK, ALTHOUGH NEVER HAS
THIS DELIBERATELY BEEN MADE TO HAPPEN.

BLOOD MOSS:     IS THE BANE OF FARMERS AND THE BOON OF MAGICIANS.  IT IS A KEEP
RED FUNGUS THAT ATTACKS THE CROPS OF THOSE WHO RAISE GRAIN, YET IT IS A VITAL
COMPONENT IN THE CASTING OF SPELLS.  AN ODDITY TO THOSE WHO SPEND THEIR LIVES
OBSERVING THE GROWTH OF THAT WHICH IS NOT ANIMAL IN NATURE - BLOOD MOSS GROWS
ONL IN THE DRYEST OF TIMES, WHEN ALL AROUND IT IS PERISHING FROM DROUGHT.  IT
CANNOT SURVIVE THE ABSENCE OF DIRECT SUNLIGHT, AND THUS PASSES FROM THE EARTH
EACH NIGHT, ONLY TO RETURN WHEN THE SUN BLAZES MERCILESSLY UPON THE LAND.  BLOOD
MOSS SEEMS TO FEED ONLY IN RIPENING GRAIN - IT CAN LAY WASTE TO AN ACRE OF CORN
IN SINGLE DAY AND VANISH WITHOUT A TRACE AS NIGHT FALLS, LEAVING NAUGHT BUT
FRUITLESS STALKS SWAYING IN THE COOL, NIGHT BREEZE.  THE MAGIC OF BLOOD MOSS IS
THOUGHT TO RESIDE IN ITS FLEETING NATURE, FOR IT IS USED IN THE SPELLS OF
MOVEMENT - FROM THE SIMPLEST LEVITATION TO MAKING THE VERY EARTH TREMBLE.  AS
HARVEST TIME COMES EACH YEAR, THE MERCHANTS SEND RUNNERS TO WAIT BY THE FIELDS
AND GATHER THE BLOOD MOSS.  FARMERS CONSIDER THESE RUNNERS UNLUCKY AND TRY TO
CHASE THEM FROM THEIR FIELDS, BUT ENOUGH SHOW PERSISTENCE THE ENSURE THEIR
MASTERS A PLENTIFUL SUPPLY BLOOD MOSS TO SELL.

BLACK PEARL:     THE BLACK PEARL IS THE MOST HIGHLY PRIZED OF ALL THE PEARLS:
WELL-FORMED ONES COMMAND A PRICE FROM JEWELLERS THAT WOULD BANKRUPT A SCORE OF
WIZARDS.  YET BLACK PEARLS ARE VITAL IN THE CASTING OF SPELLS THAT ARE HURLED
FROM THE MAGE'S PERSON AND MUST TRAVEL TO A FINAL DESTINATION.  FORTUNATELY FOR
OUR PROFESSION, EVEN RARER THAN A NORMAL BLACK PEARL IS ONE THAT IS PERFECTLY
SHAPED.  MOST ARE LOPSIDED AND LACK SYMMETRY - THE VERY QUALITY THAT MAKES THE
JEWELLER DESIRE THEM SO HIGHLY.  THIS ENSURES A READY SUPPLY FOR THE THAUMATURGE
- THE WEAVER OF MAGIC.  IT IS SAID THAT, UNLLIKE THE ORDINARY PEARL WHICH IS
FORMED INSIDE AN OYSTER WHEN IT SEEKS TO PROTECT ITSELF FROM A PIECE OF SAND OR
GRIT, THE BLACK PEARL ONLY FORMS WHEN THE SEED OF THE GREAT PEARL IS YET ANOTHER
PEARL OF MUCH SMALLER SIZE CAST ADRIFT BY THE DEATH OF ANOTHER OYSTER.

NIGHTSHADE:     NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE RANK-SMELLING PLANT OF THE SAME
NAME, THE MUSHROOM THAT IS ONLY FOUND IN THE DEEPEST, MOST REMOTE FORESTS.  IT
IS SAID TO BE QUITE VENOMOUS TO THE TOUCH OF ALL SAVE THOSE PRESENT AT ITS
HARVEST, THUS IT IS NEVER SOLD IN SHOPS AND IS AMONG THE SCAREST OF MAGICAL
REAGENTS.  TO OBTAIN IT, ONE MUST SEEK IN THE DEEPEST FOREST ON THE BLACKEST OF
NIGHTS WHEN NOT EVEN A MOONBEAM ILLUMINATES A SINGLE BLADE OF GRASS.  I KNOW NOT
OF THE PRECICE LOCATIONS WHERE THIS MYSTIC FUNGUS CAN BE FOUND, BUT THERE ARE
RUMORED TO BE THOSE IN THE LANDS OF BRITANNIA THAT KNOW THIS SECRET.  ITS CHIEF
MAGICAL PROPERTIES ARE CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF POISON AND THE CREATION OF
ILLUSIONS SO REAL THAT THEY CAN LAY THE MIGHTIEST WARRIOR TO THE GROUND.  SO
RARE IS THE NIGHTSHADE THAT IT IS PRIMARILY USED IN THE CREATION OF ONLY THE
MOST POTENT OF MAGICS.

MANDRAKE ROOT:     THE ROOT OF THE POISONOUS MANDRAKE PLANT IS INSTANTLY
RECOGNIZABLE BY ITS HUMAHN SHAPE AND ITS CRIMSON COLOUR.  IT IS SAID THAT THE
SAP RUNS BLOOD-RED WHEN THE PLANT IS CUT DOWN IN ORDER TO HARVEST THE ROOT.
LONG PRIZED FOR ITS NARCOTIC AND PURGING EFFECTS WHEN CONSUMED IN MINUTE
PORTIONS, THE MANDRAKE ROOT IS THE MOST POWERFUL KNONWN SUBSTANCE IN THE WEAVING
OF MAGICAL SPELLS THAT GIVE NEW SHAPE TO THE VERY WORLD AROUND US.  THE VARIETY
OF MANDRAKE ROOT USED IN THE MYSTIC ARTS IS FOUND ONLY IN THE MARSHY TERRAIN,
WHERE THE ROOT CAN THRUST DEEPLY INTO THE EARTH.  THE MORE EARTH THAT MUST BE
MOVED TO RETRIEVE THE MANDRAKE ROOT, THE MORE POTENT ITS EFFECT IN THE MAGIC OF
THE FINDER.  MANY YEARS AGO, WHEN OUR PEOPLE WERE BUT SCATTERED TRIBES OF
NOMADS, THE MANDRAKE WAS PLENTIFUL.  AS OUR PEOPLE HAVE TAMED THE LAND, HOWEVER,
AND THE PRACTICE OF THE MYSTIC ARTS HAS BECOME REFINED, THE MANDRAKE HAS ALL BUT
VANISHED FROM THE FACE OF THE LAND WE NOW CALL BRITANNIA.  IT IS NEVER SEEN IN
THE SHOPS OF THE TOWNS AND CASTLES, AND HARDLY EVEN SOLD PRIVATELY IF FOUND.
MANY OF OUR PROFESSION HAVE DEVOTED LIFETIMES TO THE SEARCH FOR MANDRAKE ROOT
WITHOUT EVER COMING INTO POSSESSION OF A SINGLE PIECE OF IT.

     THESE THEN ARE THE EIGHT MYSTIC REAGENTS USED IN THE WEAVING OF ENCHAMENTS.
SOME ARE READILY AVAILABLE, WHILE OTHERS ARE COSTLY OR MUST BE HUNTED AND
HARVESTED BY THE MAGE THAT INTENDS TO USE THEM.  GUARD WILL YOUR SUPPLY OF THESE
MAGICAL COMPONENTS, FOR WITHOUT THEM THERE CAN BE NO MAGIC.  USE THEM WISELY, AS
YE MUST USE THE FORCES THAT THEY UNLEASH.  REMEMBER THAT MAGIC IS TO BE USED
ONLY FOR THE THE CAUSE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FOR THE GREATER GOOD.  SHOULD YOU
USE THE MYSTICAL ARTS FOR PERSONAL GAIN OF VENGEANCE, BE PREPARED FOR THE
DESERTION OF YOUR POWERS.

                                     SPELLS
___________________________________________________________________________


AWAKEN:     SHOULD YOU OR ANY OF YOUR FOLLOWERS EVER BE SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO
COME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A MAGICALLY INDUCED SLUMBER, THE USE OF A SPELL OF
AWAKENING WILL OFTEN ALLEVIATE THE CONDITION.  IT IS A SIMPLE SPELL WHICH
MAY BE CAST BY THE BEGINNING STUDENT OF THE MYSTIC ARTS WITH LITTLE EFFORT
OR COST.  IT REQUIRES THE USE OF GINSENG FOR ITS HEALING QUALITIES AND
GARLIC IN ORDER TO WARD OFF THE COMING OF SLEEP UNTIL THE VICTIM'S BODY
HAS RETURNED TO ITS NORMAL CYCLE OF WAKEFULNESS AND REST.  BLEND THE TWO
REAGENTS CAREFULLY AND APPLY THEMIXTURE TO THE BROW OF YOUR SLEEPING
COMPANION AND CHANT 'LEVATE' LOUDLY.

BLINK:     MANY ARE THE OCCASIONS THAT THE THAUMATURGE NEEDS TO BE ELSEWHERE IN
VERY SHORT ORDER AND FINDS THAT NEITHER HORSE NOR SHIP NOR ANYH OTHER
CONVENTIONAL FORM OF TRAVEL IS OF SUFFICIENT PROMPTNESS FOR THE SITUATION.
MAGICAL MEANS OF TRAVEL MUST THEN BE USED, OF WHICH THE BLINK SPELL IS THE MOST
COMMON.  THIS SPELL DISASSEMBLES THE MAGE AND COMPANIONS AND REASSEMBLES THEM AT
A SPOT MANY LEAGUES DISTANT IN ANY CHOSEN DIRECTION.  THERE ARE MEANS OF TRAVEL
THAT COVER FAR GREATER DISTANCES THAN THE BLINK, BUT THEY ARE FAR MORE COSTLY
AND HAVE OTHER LIMITATIONS WHICH WE SHALL EXAMINE LATER IN THIS TOME.  THE BLINK
CAN ONLY MOVE THE PARTY DISTANCES PERCEPTIBLE TO THE MIND OF A COMMON PERSON.
     THE COMPONENTS NEEDED FOR THE CASTING OF A BLINK SPELL ARE SPIDER SILK AND
BLOOD MOSS.  THE BINDING POWERS OF THE SPIDER SILK PREVENT THE ESSENCE OF THE
TRAVELLERS FROM BEING SCATTERED DURING TRANSIT, WHILE THE BLOOD MOSS AIDS IN THE
MOVEMENT FROM ONE LOCATION TO THE NEXT.  EQUAL QUANTITIES OF EACH REAGENT ENSURE
THE PROPER WORKING OF THE ENCHANTMENT.  THE CONCENTRATION REQUIRED FOR BLINKING
IS SUCH THAT THE SPELLCASTER WILL MOST CERTAINLY FEEL THE EFFECTS, BUT NOT BE
LEFT EXHAUSTED.

CURE:     VENOMOUS CREATURES ABOUND THROUGHOUT THE LANDS OF BRITANNIA.  RARELY
ARE THEY EVIL, NATURE HAVING PROVIDED THEM WITH THEIR STING AS A MEANS OF
DEFENSE AGAINST LARGER PREDATORS, BUT WITHOUT PROPER ATTENTION WOUNDS CAN FESTER
AND LEAD TO THE DEATH OF A VICTIM.  FURTHERMORE, EVIL MAGES MAY CAST NOXIOUS,
POISONOUS ENERGY FIELDS DURING BATTLE OF ERECT SUCH BARRIERS TO PREVENT THE
VIRTUOUS FROM REACHING THEIR CACHES OR SANCTUARIES.  FORTUNATELY, THE GREAT
WIZARD JAANTH NOR DEVISED A COUNTERING MAGIC FOR THE EFFECTS OF ALL VENOM AND
RECORDED HIS FINDINGS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO USE.  THE CURE SPELL IS EFFECTED
BY THE USE OF A MIXTURE OF GARLIC AND GINSENG AND THE CALLING OF THE VICTIM'S
NAME TO SOOTH THE ENVENOMED SOUL.  THE CURATIVE POWERS OF THE GINSENG NULLIFY
THE EFFECTS OF THE POISON IIN THE VICTIM'S SYSTEM, WHILE THE USE OF GARLIC WARDS
OFF THE RETURN OF ANY VIRULENT RESIDUES THAT MAY LIE DORMANT IN THE BLOOD.

DISPEL:     ONE OF THE STAPLES OF THE WIZARD'S PROFESSION IS THE USE OF ENERGY
FIELDS.  WE SHALL DISCUSS THE CASTING OF SUCH FIELDS SHORTLY, BUT FIRST LET US
EXAMINE THE MEANS OF DISMANTLING THEM WHEN THEY ARE ENCOUNTERED.  ALGHOUGH THERE
ARE VARIOUS FORMS OF SUCH FIELDS, THEY ARE ALL CREATED WITH A SIMILAR MAGIC AND
THUS MAY BE DISPELLED WITH A SINGLE SPELL.  THE DISPEL ENCHANTMENT IS ONE OF THE
MODERATE DIFFICUTLY, FOR MORE EXHAUSTING THAN THE CREATION OF ENERGY FIELDS.
OFTEN TOUCHING THE FIELD MAY PROVE DISASTROUS, SO THE ENCHANTMENT MUST BE CAST
FROM AFAR AND THEN REQUIRED THE USE OF THE PRECIUOS BLACK PEARL NEEDED IN ALL
PROJECTILE SPELLS.  FURTHERMORE, SULPHROUS ASH IS NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE FLASH OF
POWER THAT BEINGS THE DISSOLUTION OF THE FORCES HOLDING THE FIELD TOGETHER.
FINALLY, THE WARDING POWERS OF GARLIC ARE ALSO EMPLOYED TO PREVENT THE FORCES
FROM REASSEMBLING AT THE SPOT WHERE THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY CONCENTRATED.  TO
EFFECT THE SPELL, SPEAK BACKWARDS THE COLOUR OF THE TYPE OF FIELD ENCOUNTERED.

ENERGY FIELD:     THERE ARE FOUR TYPES OF ENERGY FIELDS KNOWN TO THE
PRACTITIONER OF THE MYSTIC ARTS: SLEEP, POISON, FIRE, AND LIGHTING.  THEIR
EFFECTS ARE VARIED, BUT THE MAGIC USED TO ERECT THEM IS THE SAME IN EACH
INSTANCE.  ANY PERSON ATTEMPTING TO PASS THROUGH AN ENERGY FIELD WILL RUN THE
RISK OF EITHER FALLING ASLEEP OR BEING POISONED IN THE CASE OF THE FIRST TWO
TYPES; IS THE FIELD IS OF FIRE THEN THEIR FLESH SHALL BURN AS THEY PASS THROUGH
AN THEY SHALL FEEL MUCH PAIN AND ANGUISH; WHILE THE FIELD COMPOSED OF LIGHTNING
IS IMPENETRABLE.  THE CASTING OF ENERGY FIELD COMPOSED OF LIGHTING IS
IMPENETRABLE.  THE CASTING OF ENERGY FIELDS IS NOT DIFFICULT AND REQUIRES ONLY A
SMALL EXERTION ON THE PART OF THE SPELLCASTER, BUT THE FIELDS ARE ONLY EFFECTIVE
IN ENCLOSED AREAS SUCH AS SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES AND INSIDE OF ROOMS.  THE
REAGENTS NECESARY IN THE CASTING OF THESE ENERGY FIELDS ARE SULPHUROUR ASH FOR
THE BURST OF CREATION, SPIDER SILK FOR THE BINDING OF FORCES TO A SINGLE SPOT,
AND BLACK PEARL FOR THE LAUNCHING OF THE SPELL TO A SPOT AWAY FROM HE WHO WORKS
THE MAGIC.  IT WOULD BE A GRAVE ERROR INDEED TO CAST SUCH A SPELL WITHOUT THE
LATTER COMPONENT, FOR YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELF IN THE MIDST OF THE FIELD!

FIREBALL:     WHEN BESET UPON BY EVIL, THE SPELLCASTER HAS MANY OFFENSIVE TOOLS
AT HIS OR HER DISPOSAL.  WE HAVE DISCUSSED SOME OF THE INDIRECT MAGICS SUCH AS
ENERGY FIELDS, BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN MORE DIRECT ACTION IS REQUIRED.  THERE
IS A CLASS OF MISSLE SPELLS FOR SUCH OCCASIONS, OF WHICH THE FIREBALL SPELL IS
THE INTERMEDIATE ONE.  ALL SUCH SPELLS CALL FOR THE USE OF THE PRECIOUS BLACK
PEARL FOR ITS POWER IN THE LAUNCHING OF PROJECTILES.  IN THE CASE OF THE
FIREBALL, SULPHUROUS ASH IS ALSO CALLED FOR IN EQUAL PROPORTION FOR ITS POWERS
OF FIREFLASH ARE INTEGRAL TO THE CREATION OF FLAMING MISSILES.  SPEAK THE NAME
OF YOUR ENEMY WHEN THE SPELL IS CAST AND YOUR AIM SHALL BE UNERRING AND YOUR
ENEMY WILL BE DEVASTATED BY THE FLAMES OF THE MAGICAL FIRE.

GATE TRAVEL:     IN THE REPERTOIRE OF TELEPORTATION ENCHANTMENTS, GATE TRAVEL IS
BY FAR THE MOST POWERFUL.  THIS IS BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY UTILIZES THE REAGENTS AND
CHANTS OF MOST MAGICS, BUT ALSO THE POWER OF THE GATES OF THE MOONS THAT CONTROL
THE VERY OCEANS AND TIDES.  THE MOONGATES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT BRITANNIA, AND
APEAR ONLY AT CERTAIN PHASES OF THE TWIN MOONS TRAMMEL AND FULUCCA.  TO CAST THE
SPELL OF GATE TRAVEL, ONE MUST SPEAK THE NAME OF THE MOONS AS THE REAGENTS ARE
STIRRED.  AS THE ENCHANTMENT TAKES EFFECT, THE SPELLCASTER AND ANY COMPANIOUS
WILL BE INSTANTLY CARRIED TO THE LOCATION OF THE DESIRED MOONGATE.
     IT HAS BEEN A LONG-STANDING TRADITION AMONT THE PRACTITIONERS OF THE MYSTIC
ARTS TO ZEALOUSY GUARD THE SECRET OF THE COMPONENTS TO THE GATE TRAVEL SPELL.
IT IS SAID THAT REVEALING THESE REAGENTS WILL SEAL THE SUE OF THE GATES TO THE
ONE WHO DIVULGED THE KEY.  OF COURSE, NONE HAVE DARED TO SPEAK OF THEM FOR
FEAR OF LOSING ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AND EXHAUSTING SPELLS IN THE LORE OF
ENCHANTMENT.  THIS WRITER IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS BELIEF.

HEAL:     ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF THE GOOD AND TRUE PATH OF THE WIZARD IS THE
USE OF ENCHANTAMENT FOR BENEFICIAL ENDS.  WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE CURE SPELL WHICH
RENDERS VENOM AS HARMLESS AS THE PUREST OF WELL WATER, BUT THE MOST COMMON FORM
OF INJURY IS THE PHYSICAL WOUND RATHER THAN THE INTERNAL DISRUPTION BROUGHT ON
BY POISON.  SWORDS AND TALONS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE AND THE TOOLS OF JUSTICE ARE
OFTEN USED FOR UNJUST PURPOSES.  WHEN YOU OR YOUR COMPANIONS HAVE SUFFERED
PHYSICAL INJURY THAT HATH RENT OR SEARED THE FLESH, THE HEAL SPELL IS
INVALUABLE.  MIX SIMILAR QUANTITIES OF THE HEALING ESSENCE OF GINSENG WITH
INTEGRATING STRENGTH OF SPIDER SILK AND APPLY IT TO THE WOUND.  SPEAK THE NAME
OF THE VICTIM AND THE FLESH WILL BE HASTENED ALONG THE ROAD TO WHOLENESS.

ICEBALL:     ONCE AGAIN, THE INVALUABLE BLACK PEARL IS THE KEY TO THE CASTING OF
THE MISSILE SPELLS, OF WHICH THE ICEBALL IS THE SECOND MOST POTENT IN THE MAGE'S
ARSENAL.  UNLIKE THE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED FIREBALL SPELL, THE ICEBALL REQUIRES
ONLY THE USE OF MANDRAKE ROOT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BLCK PEARL.  THE
NECROMANTIC MANDRAKE WILL BRING THE CHILL OF THE GRAVE UPON YOUR ENEMY AND THE
VERY BLOOD OF THE VICTIM WILL FREEZE AS IF IT WERE MIDWINTER.  ICE IS HEAVY AND
THE TOLL OF CASTING THIS SPELL IS EQUALLY WEIGHTY.  ALL BUT THE STURDIEST OF OUR
PROFESSION WILL NEEDS TAKE REST AFTER CASTING BUT A PAIR OF THESE POTENT
ENCHANTMENTS.  REMEMBER TO SPEAK THE NAME OF YOUR INTENDED VICTIM AS YOU
CAST THE REAGENTS ALOFT, LEST YOUR EFFORTS BE FOR NAUGHT.

JINX:     THERE ARE BUT TWO ENCHANTMENTS MORE POWER AND DIFFICULT THAN THE JINX
SPELL, AND BUT ONE OF SIMILAR POTENCY.  WHEN FACED WITH A CLOSELY PACKED HORDE
OF ENEMIES, MIX TOGETHER EQUAL QUANTITIES OF BLACK PEARL, DEADLY NIGHTSHADE, AND
THE CRIMSON MANDRAKE ROOT TO CAST AT YOUR OPPONENTS.  CALL TO THEIR ATTENTION
THE VULNERABILITY OF THEIR BACKS AND WEAVE THE MAGIC.  THEY SHALL TURN AND SMITE
EACH OTHER AS IF EACH WAS ALONE IN A CROWN OF MORTAL FOES.  THE BALCK PEARL
SHALL CARRY YOUR SPELL TO THEIR VERY MIST, WHILE THE HALLUCINATORY MIGHT OF THE
NIGHTSHADE WILL CONFOUND THEM BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF COMMON SENSE.  MANDRAKE
ROOT LENDS THE POWER OF CONVICTION TO THEIR MISCONCEPTIONS.  THE DURATION OF THE
ENCHANTMENT IS VARIED, BUT THROUGHOUT ITS COURSE THE SPELLCASTER WILL BE
REMINDED OF ITS POTENCY BY THE PRESENCE OF A GLOWING "J".  BE WARNED, HOWEVER,
THAT THE CASTING OF THE JINX SPELL REQUIRES GREAT EXERTION.

KILL:     THE KILL SPELL IS THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE MISSILE ENCHANTMENTS.  IT
IS THE FAVORITE OF EVIL WIZARDS AND ITS USE IS PROHIBITED BY MOST TEACHERS OF
THE MYSTIC ARTS.  NEVERTHELESS, WHEN FACED WITH A FOE OF SINGULAR STRENGTH AND A
TRULY EVIL NATURE, THE WISE MAGICIAN WILL PREPARE A MIXTURE OF THE HIGHLY TOXIC
NIGHTSHADE AND THE MERCURIAL BLACK PEARL AND SPEAK THE TRUENAME OF THE ENEMY
WHILE CASTING THE REAGENTS TOWARD THE FOE.  AS THE LAST SYLLABLE OF THE CHANT
FADES, ALL OF THE TARGET'S VITAL ORGANS SHALL CEASE TO FUNCTION FOR THE SPACE OF
SEVEN HEARTBEATS.  THIS IS USUALLY FATAL, ALTHOUGH SOME BEINGS OF EXCEPTIONALLY
HARDY CONSTITUTION WILL SURVIVE A SHIGLE KILL SPELL.  THE ENCHANTMENT MAY BE
WOVEN SEVERAL TIMES, BUT TAKES A FIERCE TOLL ON THE ENERGY AND CONCENTRATION OF
THE CASTER.  IT IS EASIER TO DISPEL A FIELD OF VIBRANT ENERGY THAN IT IS TO STOP
THE FUNCTIONING OF A LIVING BEING.

LIGHT:     THE ENCHANTMENT OF LIGHT IS A TRIVIAL ONE, OFTEN THE VERY FIRST SPELL
AQCQUIRED BY THE BUDDING SORCEROR.  IT REQUIRES BUT A PINCH OF SULPHUROUS ASH,
WHICH IS A PPLIED TO THE END OF A STAFF AND GENTLY BLOWN UPON UNTIL IT BEGINS TO
GLOW WITH A SOFT YELLOW LIGHT.  THE SPELLCASTER MUST CONCENTRATE BRIEFLY ON THE
IMAGE OF A CANDLE AND EXPEND A SLIGHT AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO START THE MAGICAL
GLOW.  FROM THEN ON IT WILL BURN SOFTLY UNTIL, THE REAGENT IS CONSUMED, LIGHTING
THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGES WHERE THE THAUMATURGE TREADS.  THERE ARE TWO PRINCIPAL
AVANTAGES TO THE USE OF LIGHT SPELLS IN PLACE OF ORDINARY TORCHES: THEY ARE
UNAFFECTED BY ALL BUT MAGICAL WINDS OR BREEZES; AND THEY DO NOT SMOKE AND CAUSE
ONE'S EYES TO SMART.  MANY A WARRIOR HAS SUFFERED GRIEVOUSLY BECAUSE HIS EYE
SWERE SHUT BY THE STING OF A WEALTH OF TEARS.

MAGIC MISSILE:     THERE ARE GENERALLY VERY FEW IF ANY SPELLS THAT ARE LEARNED
EARLY IN THE PRACTICE OF WIZARDRY WHICH ARE BOTH USEFUL AND EAGERLY SOUGHT AFTER
BY THOSE DABBLING IN THE MYSTIC ARTS.  THE BEGINNING THAUMATURGE ALMOST ALWAYS
YEARNS FOR SPELLS THAT DEVASTATE OR CREATE STARTLING EFFECTS.  THE WEAVING OF
WEATHER OR THE MASTERY OF SHORT VERTICAL TELEPORTATIONS DO NOT IMPRESS
ONLOOKERS. THE ONE SIMPLE SPELL THAT DOES TRULY INSPIRE AWE AT LITTLE EXPENSE TO
THE SPELLCASTER IS THE MAGIC MISSLE.  IT REQUIRES THE USE OF TWO PARTS OF
SULPHUROUS ASH TO ONE PART OF BLACK PEARL IN THE CASTING, AND IT WILL CAUSE A
TREMENDOUSLY BRIGHT FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT TO STRIKE AN ENEMY.  WHILE NOT VISIBLY
MARKED, THE ENEMY WILL SUSTAIN A FAIR AMOUNT OF INTERNAL DAMAGE, SAID BY THE
CYNICAL TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY FRIGHT MORE THAN BY POWER.  THE MAGIC MISSLE IS A
USEFUL ENCHANTMENT IN BATTLE, BUT IF IS MORE SPECTACULAR THAT EFFECTIVE AND
WILL NOT DETER MOST ENEMIES LARGER THAN THE SPELLCASTER WHO WIELDS IT.

NEGATE:     WHEN FACED WITH A GREATER OR MORE TELLING MAGIC THAN ONE'S OWN, THE
PRACTITIONER OF THE MYSTIC ARTS MAY DECIDE IT BEST FOR ALL INVOLVED TO SUSPEND
EVERYONE'S USE OF THAUMATURGY FOR A SHORT TIME.  AT THIS TIME ONE SHOUD INVOKE
THE POWERS OF THE NEGATE SPELL BY MIXING GARLIC WITH ITS WARDING CHARACTERISTICS
TOGETHER WITH THE EXOTIC MANDRAKE RIPE WIKTH MYSTIC POTENCY.  TO THIS BLEND ADD
BUT AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF SULPHUROUR ASH TO PROVIDE THE SPARK OF FISION AND SPEAK
YOUR OWN NAME BACKWARDS.  ALL MAGIC SHALL INSTANTLY CEASE SAVE THE ENCHANTMENT
OF NEGATION ITSELF WHICH IS MANIFESTED BY THE VISION OF A GLOWING 'N' HOVERING
BEFORE YOUR EYES.  THE NEGATE SPELL WILL LAST ONLYH A BRIED TIME, WHICH SHOULD
BEUSED FOR EITHER THE ANNIHILATION OF YOUR ENEMIES OF FOR THE JUDICIOUS
REMOVAL OF YOUR PRESENCE FROM THE TROUBLED SPOT.

OPEN:     THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN ALL BEINGS WERE FAIR AND JUST.  THE
PRINCIPAL VESSEL USED FOR THE TRANSPORT OF ONE'S WORLDLY POSSESSIONS IS THESE
TIMES WAS THE WOODEN CHEST, WHICH IS STILL THE POPULAR MEANS.  BUT SINCE THE
COMNG OF THE EVIL ONES AND THEIR LASTING INFLUENCE ON THE INHABITANTS OF OUR
FAIR LAND, THE PRACTICE OF PLACING OBNOXIOUS AND SOMETIMES LETHAL TRAPS ON THE
LOCKS OF CHESTS HAS BECOME QUITE COMMONPLACE.  VIRTUALLY ALL FOLD USE SUCH
DEVICES, EVEN THE DENIZENS OF THE UNDERWORLD WHO GUARD NAUGHT BUT ILL-GOTTEN
WEALTH.  TO BYPASS THESE SISISTER MECHANISMS THE THAUMATURGE NEED BUT UTTER THE
CHANT "APPAR UNEM" AND SPRINKLE A MIX OF SULPHUROUS ASH AND BLOOD MOSS ON THE
OFFENDING LOCK.  THE FLASH OF THE SULPHUROUS ASH POWERS THE MOVEMENT POTENTIAL
OF THE BLOOK MOSS AND THE LOCK WILL OPEN ITSELF SAFELY, LEAVING THE CONTENTS OF
THE CHEST AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE SPELLCASTER.

PROTECTION:     THERE ARE TIMES DURING THE HEAT OF BATTLE WHEN ONE FINDS THE
BEST FORM OF OFFENSE TO BE NAUGHT BUT A GOOD DEFENSE.  WHEN HARD-PRESSED BY
FIERCE ANTAGONISTS, THE WISE MAGICIAN WIL MIX TOGETHER THE REAGENTS SULPHUROUS
ASH, GINSENG, AND GARLIC AND INVOKE THE SPELL OF PROTECTION.  THE WHOLESOME
QUALITIES OF THE GINSENG, TOGETHER WITH THE REPELLENT STRENGTH OF THE GARLIC,
SERVE TO SHIELD THE WIZARD AND ALL COMPANIONS FROM THE ONSLAUGHT OF THEIR
ENEMIES.  SUCH PROTECTION IS NOT ALWAYS EFFECTIVE, BUT MAY BE OF GREAT USE.
SULPHUROUS ASH PROVIDES THE MYSTIC FIRE THAT FUELS THE INFCANTATION, AND ALSO
SERVES TO STARTLE ONE'S OPPONENTS WITH AN INITIAL FLASH AS THE SPELL BEGINS TO
FUNCTION.  PROTECTION IS NOT A SIMPLE SPELL, BUT NEITHER IS IT AN EXCEPTIONALLY
STRENOUOUS SPELL TO CAST.  ITS DURATION IS SHORT, AND DURING THE COURSE OF ITS
SHIELDING THE MAGE WILL BE REMINDED OF ITS EFFECTS BY A GLOWING 'P' HOVERING
BEFORE HIS OR HER EYES.

QUICKNESS:     THE SPELL QUICKNESS IS ONE OF THE MOST UNPREDICTABLE YET
POTENT SPELLS IN THE WIZARD'S COLLECTION OF ENCHANTMENTS, AND ONE OF THE MOST
TELLING ON HIS OR HER COMPANIONS.  WHEN CAST DURING BATTLE, THE QUICKNESS SPELL
WILL HEIGHTEN THE NATURAL DEXTERITY OF ONE'S FELLOWS TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THEY
WILL MOVE TWICE THEIR NORMAL AGILITY - AT TIMES THEY WILL BE ABLE TO LAND TWO
BLOWS AGAINST THEIR FOES INSTEAD OF THE CUSTOMARY SINGLE STRIKE DURING A ROUND
COMBAT.  THE PRICE IS AGE, FOR THE RECIPIENTS OF THE EXTRA SPEED INCURRED BY THE
USE OF QUICKNESS WILL AGE BRIEFLY WHILE UNDER THE SWAY OF THE ENCHANTMENT... YET
MOST FEEL THAT AN OCCASIONAL GREY HAIR IS BUT A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR THE
ADVANTAGE OF DEALING TWICE THE NUMBER OF BLOWS THAT ONE MIGHT RECIEVE.  THE
REAGENTS FOR THE QUICKNESS SPELL ARE FIERY SULPHOROUS ASH, GINSENG, AND VOLATILE
BLOOD MOSS.  THE BLOOD MOSS PORTION IS DOUBLE THE OTHERS, FOR MOVEMENT IS THE
CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE SPELL.  THE SULPHUROUS ASH LENDS THE FLASHES OF ENERGY
NEEDED BY THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE ENCHANTMENT, WHILE THE HEALING POWERS OF
GINSENG PREVENT THEM FROM AGING SO RAPILY AS TO BECOME GREYBEARDS AFTER A SINGLE
ENCOUNTER.  THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE QUICKNES SPELL, THE SPELLCASTER WILL BE
REMINDED OF ITS EFFECTS BYH THE VISION OF A BRIGHT, GLOWING 'Q'.

RESURRECT:    MANY ARE THE MONSTERS AND TERRORS THAT DWELL BENEATH THE SURFACE
OR IN THE FORESTS AND MARSHES OF BRITIANNIA.  EVEN GROUPS OF MOST VALIANT AND
FIERCE WARRIORS ARE SUBJECT TO LOSSES TOO TRAGIC TO BEAR.  IF A COMPANION IS
SLAIN BY AN ENEMY, ALL IS NOT LOST IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED OF
MAGES.  THERE EXISTS THE MEANS TO BRING BACK A COMPANION FROM THE LAND OF THE
DEAD - NOT AS A UNHOLY ONCE-DEAD BEING - BUT AS A LIVING, BREATHING CREATRE OF
FLESH AND BLOOD RESTORED TO LIFE, ALBEIT IN AN EXTREMELY WEAKENED CONDITION.
EACH WIZARD MUST NEEDS DETERMINE THE COMPONENTS OF THIS ENCHANTMENT THAT WORK
BEST WITH THEIR OWN MAGIC, FOR THE COMBINATION IS SAID TO BE UNIQUE TO EACH
SPELLCASTER.  WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT WEAVING THIS THE MOST POTENT OF ALL

ENCHANTMENTS IS THAT IT REQUIRES THE SPELLCASTER TO SCATTER THE REAGENTS TO
COVER THE VICTIM'S BODY WHILE CALING OUT THE NAME OF THE SLAIN COMPANION IN A
VOICE OF THUNDER.  THIS MAGIC IS EXTRAORDINARILY TAXING, AND RARE IS THE MAGE
WHO CAN CONTINUE TO WEAVE PELLS WITHOUT REST ONCE THIS ENCHANTMENT HAS BEEN
SUCCESSFULLY CAST.

SLEEP:     THERE ARE MOMENTS IN THE LIVES OF EVERY PRACTITIONER OF THE MYSTIC
ARTS WHERE DISCRETION IS TRULY THE BETTER PART OF VALOR.  NOT ALL FOES ARE TRULY
EVIL AND DESERVING OF ANNIHILATION - VERILY, SOME ARE BUT BEASTS OF THE FIELD
SEEKING PROVENDER AND ARE ENTITLED TO LIFE AS MUCH AS YOUR OR I.  YET, UNCHECKED
THESE CREATURES POSE AS GREAT A THREAT TO ONE AS A SCORE OF RABID ORCS.  IT IS
IN SUCH SITUATIONS THAT THE WISE THAMATURGE WEAVES A SLEEP SPELL AND LEAVES HIS
OPOSITION IN DEEP SLUMBER WHILST VACATING THE CURRENT LOCATION.  THE SLEEP SPELL
IS TRULY A SERIOUS ENCHANTMENT THAT REQUIRES A FAIR AMOUNT OF MENTAL ENERGY TO
CAST, BUT IT IS NOT OF SUCH IMPORT AS TO LEAVE THE SPELLCASTER BREATHLESS OR
EXHAUSTED.  TO SEND YOUR FOES TO THE LAND OF SLUMBER, MIX A DOUBLE PORTION OF
SPIDER SILK WITH SOME GINSENG AND CHANT "DUERME" AS YOU SPRINKLE THE REAGENTS
INTO THE AIR.  FEAR NOT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE INTENDED VICTIMS, FOR
THE BINDING POWER OF THE SPIDER SILK WILL ENFOLD THEM FROM AFAR, WHILE THE
HEALING GINSENG WILL GENTLY WRAP THEM IN DEEP SLEEP.

TREMOR:     THE TREMOR SPELL IS A VERY POTENT MAGIC INDEED.  FEW SPELLS ARE AS
EXHAUSTING AND NONE SAVE RESURRECTION HAVE A MORE STRKING OR DRAMATIC EFFECT.
CAREFULLY BLEND PORTIONS OF SULPHUROUS ASH WITH BLOOD MOSS AND MANDRAKE ROOT AND
CAST IT AT THE FEET OF YOUR OPONENTS WHILST SHOUTING AS LOUDLY AS POSSIB
LE.  THE VOLATILE SULPHUROUS ASH SHALL FURNISH THE FLASH OF POWER TO THE MOVEMENT
POTENTIAL OF THE BLOOD MOSS AND THE MANDRAKE ROOT WILL LEND RAW NECROMANTIC
FORCE TO THE SPELL.  THE VERY EARTH WILL TREMBLE AND QUAKE BENEATH THE FEET OF
YOUR ENEMIES AND THEY WILL FLY IN TERROR, SAVE THOSE THAT ARE SWALLOWED UP
ENTIRELY BY THE VERY GROUND ITSELF.  NO SPELL IN THE LORE OF THE MYSTIC ASTS HAS
A MUCH POWER TO STRIKE FEAR INTO THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THOSE THAT SUFFER ITS
MIGHTY IMPACT.  BUT USE THIS ENCHANTMENT WISELY, FOR IT WILL LEAVE YOU WEAK AS A
NEWBORN BABE.

UNDEAD:     EVER SINCE THE COMING OF THE EVIL WIZARD MONDAIN AND HIS HELLISH
OFFSPRING, THE LANDS OF BRITANNIA HAVE BEEN PLAGUED BY THE RETURN OF CREATURES
ALREADY SLAIN.  THESE ONCE-DEAD BEINGS TAKE MANY FORMS, THE MOST COMMON BEING
THE ANIMATE SKELETONS OF ORCS AN GOBLINS, OR THE GHOULISH FORMS OF FLESH-EATING
CORPSES THAT HAVE BEEN SUMMONED FROM THE LAND OF SHADES TO WREAK HAVOC ON THE
LIVING.  THESE APPARITIONS ARE COWED BY THE LIGHT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FIGHT AS
WARRIORS IN A TRANCE.  NONETHELESS, THEY ARE HARD TO KILL AND NEVER TIRE IN
BATTLE AND THUS MAY JEOPARDIZE EVEN A SEASONED BAND OF ADVENTURERS.  EACH MAGE
KNOWS A FORM OF TURNING THEM ASIDE WHEN ENCOUNTERED, BUT THE COMPANIONS OF SUCH
MAGICS ARE PERSONAL AND DEPEND ON THE SPELLCASTER.  YOU MUST USE YOUR KNOWLEDGE
OF THE PROPERTIES OF MAGICAL REAGENTS TO DETERMINE WHICH TWO WILL LEND FORCE TO
YOUR ENCHANTMENT OF UNDEAD TURNING.  WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND THE PROPER MIXTURE,
CAST IT AT YOUR FOES WHILE CHANTING THE NAME OF WHAT ONCE WERE WHEN THEY TROD
THE EARTH IN LIFE.

VIEW:     THE LANDS THAT WE NOW CALL BRITANNIA IN HONOR OF THOSE WISE AND JUST
INFLUENCE OF LORD BRITISH ARE VAST IN SCOPE AND HOLD MANY UNCHARTED REGIONS.
ALTHOUGH CARTOGRAPHERS HAVE TRAVELLED ALL THE CIRCUMFERENCES OF THE MAIN
CONTINENT, MANY INTERNAL TRACTS HAVE YET TO BE ACCURATELY RECORDED, WHILE THERE
ARE NUMEROUS ISLANDS RUMORED TO EXIST TO THE SOUTHEAST WITH NARY A CHART TO SHOW
THEIR LOCATION.  HERE THE PRACTITIONER OF THE MYSTIC ARTS HAS A GREAT ADVENTURE
OVER THE WANDERER OR SEAFARER IN THAT VIEW SPELL MAY BE WOVEN WHEN THE NEED
ARISES.  THE VIEW INCANTATION IS OF MIDDLING DIFFICULTY AND INVOLVES THE USE OF
HALLUCINATORY NIGHTSHADE AND POWERFUL MANDRAKE ROOT.  MANDRAKE LENDS POWER TO
THE ENCHANTMENT WHILE NIGHTSHADE PROVIDES A MYSTIC OVERVIEW OF ALL THE LANDS
WITHIN THE RANGE OF A SIMPLE BLINK SPELL.  SIMPLY BLEND THE REAGENTS AND SPEAK
OUT THE NAME OF THE REGION WHICH YOU TRAVEL.

WIND CHANGE:     NOT ALL BRITANNIA IS ACCESSIBLE ON FOOT, AND OFT TIMES THE
WIZARD WILL FIND THE NEED TO EMBARK ON A SEA VOYAGE TO REACH SOME CERTAIN
DESTINATIONS IN THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH.  ONCE ABOARD SHIP, MOST VOYAGERS FIND
THEMSLVES AT THE MERCY OF CAPRICIOUS NATURE WITH HER EVER-CHANGING WINDS. THIS
IS NOT TRUE FOR THE PRACTITIONER OF THE MYSTIC ARTS, HOWEVER, FOR THOUGH MAGICAL
MEANS ONE MAY CONTROL THE VERY DIRECTION OF THE WIND, ALBEIT FOR BUT A SHORT
SPAN OF TIME.  WIND CHANGE IS NOT A TAXING ENCHANTMENT; INDEED A POWERFUL WIZARD
CAN CAST IT ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT TRIVIAL AS OPENING TRAPPED
CHESTS OR EFFECTING MINOR TELEPORTATIONS...  SIMPLY
 MIX SULPHUROUS ASH FOR POWER AND BLOOD MOSS FOR MOVEMENT TO COAX THE WIND TO A MORE FAVORABLE DIRECTION.
SPEAK THE NAME OF THE PATRON OF WINDS AND CALL OUT THE DIRECTION DESIRED AND THE
WIND SHALL CHANGE AT YOUR BIDDING.

XIT:     WHEN TRAPPED IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH, WEARY AND BATTERED WITH A LONG
ROAD AHEAD TO THE SURFACE , THE USE OF AN XIT (EXIT) SPELL CAN BE BENEFICIAL.
THIS ENCHANTMENT IS BUT ONE OF THE MIDDLING FORMS OF TELEPORTATION, QUITE
SIMILAR IN COST AND NATURE TO THE BLINK SPELL.  IT TOO DISASSEMBLES THE PARTY
AND REASSEMBLES IT ON THE SURFACE OF BRITANNIA, AND THUS REQUIRES VERY SIMILAR
COMPONENTS TO THE AFOREMENTIONED BLINK ENCHANTMENT.  ASIDE FROM THE MOVING BLOOD
MOSS AND THE BINDING SPIDER SILK WHICH ENSURES THE SAFE PASSAGE OF THE
DISINCORPORATED PARTY, XIT REQUIRES THE USE OF SULPHUROUS ASH TO PROVIDE THE
FLARE THAT GUIDES THE PARTY FROM THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS TO THE WORLD OF
SUNLIGHT.  WHEN CONFUSING THE XIT SPELL, THE THAUMATURGE SHOULD TRYTO ENVISION
THE ACTUAL ENTRANCE TO THE UNDERWORLD USED TO GAIN THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE AT
THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPEDITION BELOW GROUND.  SUCCESSFUL CASTING OF THE XIT
SPELL WILL SURELY RETURN THEM TO THAT SELFSAME SPOT.

Y (UP):     THE TWO MOST ELEMENTARY FORMS OF TELEPORTATION BOTH HAVE STRONG
NAMES AND MAY BE USED ONLY WHEN UNDERGROUND.  THE MORE DIFFICULT OF THE KNOWN BY
THE LETTER 'Y' IN HONOR OF THE MAGE YENTHAK GNOR, WHO FIRST CRAFTED THE
ENCHANTMENT. YENTHAK GNOR DISCOVERED THAT A BLEND OF BLOOD MOSS AND SPIDER SILK
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SPOKEN NAMES OF THE MOONS WOULD CAUSE ONE WHO UTTERS IT
TO BE LIFTED UPWARD THROUGH THE VERY SOIL TO THE NEXT HIGHEST LEVEL OF A
DUNGEON. THE SPIDER SILK HOLDS THE PARTY TOGETHER DURING THEIR TRANSIT, WHILE
THE BLOOD MOSS MOVES THEM EVER CLOSER TO THE MOONS.

Z (DOWN):     THE 'Z' OR DOWN SPELL IS PERHAPS THE SIMPLEST OF ALL THE
TELEPORTATION SPELLS.  IT REQUIRES THE SAME COMPONENTS AS THE 'Y' OR UP SPELL -
THESE BEING BLOOD MOSS FOR MOVEMENT AND SPIDER SILK FOR ITS BINDINGS QUALITIES -
BUT REQUIRES HALF THE MENTAL ENERGY AND CONCENTRATION ON THE PART OF THE
SPELLCASTER DUE TO THE NATURAL TENDENCY OF ALL BODIES TO MOVE DOWNWARD.  THE
ORIGIN OF THE NAME IS UNCERTAIN, BUT IS BELIEVED THAT THE LETTER 'Z' IS THE
FIRST LETTER OF UNPRONOUNCEABLE TRUENAME OF THE LORD OF THE UNDERWORLD, A DEMON
OF MUCH POWER.  TO EFFECT THE SPELL, THE SPELLCASTER MUST SCATTER THE REAGENTS
AND CHANT "BAJA" IN STENTORIAN TONES.  THE LOWER THE TONALITY OF THE CHANT, THE
HIGHER THE PROBABLITY OF THE PARTY MOVING DOWN ONE LEVEL OF A DUNGEON.


IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE LETTER 'Z' IS THE FIRST LETTER OF UNPRONOUNCEABLE
TRUENAME OF THE LORD OF THE UND---------+

* SPECIAL NOTE: TALKING WITH THE PEOPLE FOUND IN THE GAME IS ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT FEATURES OF ULTIMA IV TO MASTER. IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SOLVE
THY QUESTS WITHOUT TALKING TO VIRTUALLY ALL PEOPLE IN EACH TOWNE. EACH PERSON
WITH WHOM THOU DOST TALK IS CAPABLE OF FULL CONVERSATION. THEY CAN BE ASKED
ABOUT THEIR "NAME," "JOB," AND "HEALTH." YOU MAY "LOOK" AGAIN AT THEIR VISUAL
DESCRIPTION. FROM THIS INFORMATION THOU SHOULDST BE ABLE TO DISCERN WHAT ELSE
THEY MIGHT KNOW, HINTED AT DIRECTLY BY USE OF THE PRECISE WORDS IN THE CONVER
SATION. E.G., IF THOU WERE TO ASK DUPRE ABOUT HIS "JOB" AND HE WERE TO
RESPOND "I AM HUNTING GREMLINS," THOU MIGHT THINK TO ASK HIM ABOUT "HUNTING" OR
"GREMLINS" - ABOUT EITHER OF WHICH HE MIGHT OFFER SOME INSIGHT.

     EACH OF THESE PEOPLE MIGHT ASK OF THEE A QUESTION AS WELL; BE SURE TO
ANSWER THE QUESTION HONESTLY, FOR DISHONESTY WILL BE REMEMBERED AND NOT REFLECT
WELL UPON THEE FOR THE REST OF THE GAME. OFTEN THOU SHALT NOT KNOW WHAT TO ASK
A TOWNSPERSON UNTIL THOU HAST BEEN TOLD BY ANOTHER: E.G., IOLO THE BARD MIGHT
TELL THEE TO ASK SHAMINO THE RANGER ABOUT SWORDS. EVEN IF THOU HADST MET
SHAMINO EARLIER THOU WOULDST HAVE TO SEEK HIM OUT AGAIN IF THOU DOST WISH THAT
KNOWLEDGE.

     SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT THOU SHALT MEET MAY BE WILLING TO BECOME THY
TRAVELLING COMPANIONS. IF THOU DOST WISH FOR A CHARACTER TO BECOME A PLAYER IN
THY PARTY, THOU MUST ASK THEM TO "JOIN" THEE. 'TIS MOST WISE TO STRENGTHEN THY
PARTY AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE, UP TO THE SEVEN COMPANIONS THOU SHALT NEED TO
COMPLETE THE GAME. WHEN THOU ART THROUGH WITH A CONVERSATION, THEN SPEAK THE
WORD "BYE" AS AN ACCEPTED MEANS OF POLITELY ENDING THY CONVERSATION.

     BE SURE TO KEEP A JOURNAL OF THY TRAVELS! MANY OF THE CLUES TO SOLVING THE
QUESTS OF ULTIMA IV ARE CONTAINED IN THE VARIOUS AND DIVERSE CONVERSATIONS THOU
MIGHT HAVE WITH THE VARIOUS TOWNFOLK.  IT WOULD BE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO SOLVE
THIS GAME WITHOUT SOME MEANS OF REFERRING BACK TO PRIOR CONVERSATIONS HELD
DURING PLAY.

     BE SURE TO THOROUGHLY EXPLORE THE CITIES AND TOWNES! MANY OF THE QUESTS
WITHIN ULTIMA IV ARE CONTAINED ENTIRELY WITHIN INDIVIDUAL CITIES. 'TIS WISEST
TO SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME SEEKING OUT THE ANSWERS THAT LIE HIDDEN IN EACH
ONE OF THE VARIOUS TOWNES OF BRITANNIA, BEFORE MOVING ON TO ANOTHER.

     MAGICAL ABILITY IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PROFESSION AND INTELLIGENCE OF
THYSELF AND THY TRAVELLING COMPANIONS. MAGICAL STRENGTH IS TWICE THE
INTELLIGENCE OF THE SPELLCASTER, WITH POTENTIAL MODIFIED BY PR
OFESSION. THEENCHANTMENT POTENTIAL OF THE VARIOUS PROFESSIONS IS:

MAGE - FULL                     RANGER - ONE HALF
DRUID - THREE FOURTHS           TINKER - ONE FOURTH
BARD - ONE HALF                 FIGHTER - NONE
PALADIN - ONE HALF              SHEPHERD - NONE
