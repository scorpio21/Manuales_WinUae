 Congratulations! Doubtless you have succeeded in completing a large 
part of Utopia: The Creation of a Nation. Now here is a completely new
challenge to tax novices and experts alike. This data disk offers ten
completely new challenges that will take you to undiscovered worlds
where the odds are really stacked against you. If anything the aliens 
are meaner, the terrain harder and the peasants are really revolting!

On this expansion disk you will find:

Ten new interesting and exiting levels.
Ten strange and uniformally evel alien races, each equipped with more
formidable weaponry and supirior tactics.
Stunning new graphics for each of the ten new worlds.
New difficulties to hamper your colony development, such as lack of
food, scarity of resources and less efficient buildings.
Intrguing data on each of the alien races waiting to be gathered by
your own spies.
Challenging new terrains to tax even the most experienced of players.

LOADING THE UTOPIA SCENARIO DISK
--------------------------------
Doubtless you will be eager to get started, and fortunatly loading
Utopia: The New Worlds could not be simpler.

Amiga and ST
------------
All you have to do is replace you original second disk with the new 
data disk, and then load as normal. Whenever you are prompted to 
insert the second disk, simply insert your new data disk. It really is 
as simple as that.

PC
--
If you are playing from floppy disk, simply replace the original data disk
with the new data disk. When you attempt to now load a scecario, you
will be presented with a new list. Simply select the one you wish to play
in the usual manner, and you are off. If you wish to install Utopia: The 
New Worlds on the hard drive, the insert your expansion disk into the 
default drive and type `Install'(Return). From this point, simply 
follow the instructions that will be presented on the screen.

You can play the different scenarios in any order you wish, but we
would recommend that you play them in the order in which they are
presented on your screen. In comparison with the original, which we 
would grade from Level One to Level Ten, the New Worlds could be 
graded as beggining at Level Four, and going though to Level Four-
teen. This is so that even if you have not managed to complete the 
original you will still be able to explore some brilliant new terrains and
aliens. Good luck-new adventures await!
