UNREAL is a fantasy arcade game composed of 8 levels, with 5 in 3D and 3 in 2D.
  You must save Isolde (The Princess) from the evil hands of Polymorphic 
  (The Evil Dude with the flaming head)- To accomplish this feat, you will be faced 
  with diverse test of strength and logic while trying to get the high score.

You fail in your mission once you energy level reaches zero.  To help 
compensate for the loss of energy, you will receive a 50 point energy bonus
as you pass from one level to the next.



I. KEYBOARD FUNCTIONS

Once you load the game (I assume you know how to stick the disks in the 
                        appropriate drives)
 
You access the main menu-
 
F1 : SOUND EFFECTS OR MUSIC - You need 1 meg for sound effects, and music
                            - 512k systems only play music

F2 : This option gives you a SUB-MENU which contains parts of games that you 
     have already saved.

F3 : Direct Loading of the saved game NUMBER 1

F4 : Direct Loading of the saved game NUMBER 2
 
F5 : Direct Loading of the saved game NUMBER 3
 
* When you enter a game which has already been saved, you will be in the 
  TRAINING MODE- Therefore no score will be kept-

You can save a part of the game at the end of the 2D or 3D screens.
UNREAL gives you 3 saves.
 
F1-Save 1
F2-Save 2
F3-Save 3

"P" or "SPACE BAR" pause the game while "ESC" abandons this part of the game.
 
 
 
II. 3D SCREENS...
 
When the screen appears in 3D, you are flying on the back of a copper dragon.

1- SCREEN PRESENTATION
 
   Icon at top left - Force of Weapon
   Number in top center - Score
   Number at top right -Energy of Dragon

2- The dragon can fly in 8 directions -N-S-E-W-NW-NE-SE-SW- You can figure
   out for yourself which way to move the joystick to get those directions.

3- You can destroy your enemies by pressing the fire button of the joystick.

4- You must avoid all obstacles (trees, bridges, etc..) because your dragon
   will lose energy. Collision with the objects causes a loss of energy.


**BONUS**

From time to time, you will see yellow crystals on the ground. If you gather
them, you receive bonus points.  A bonus message will appear on the screen.


  EXTRA WEAPON -This increases the force of your weaopn by 1 degree (there 
                are 12 degrees of force in the 3D part of the game.)  If you               you hit an obstacle violently, you will lose a degree of force.
                hit an obstacle violently, you will lose a degree of force.

  EXTRA SHIELD -This revives the energy of your dragon when necessary.
 
  YOU ARE 
  UNTOUCHABLE  -This bonus gives you invulnerability for a few seconds 
                while the dragon is flashing.  During this bonus, if you 
                hit an obstacle, you do not lose energy.

  EXTRA SCORE  -Your score increases by 5000 points




5 - DANGER SIGNALS
 
In addition to bonus messages there are a certain number of danger indicators.

  LOW SHEILD -Your energy is weak, be careful!
 
  CATCH BONUS -A crystal will soon appear, catch it!
 
  YOU HIT SOMETHING -You have bumped into something.
 
  YOU CRASHED -You have violently hit an obstacle and you lose a degree of
               force
 
  GO LEFT     -Advice to move left
  
  Go RIGHT    -Advice to move right




III. 2D SCREENS
 
This time the hero is alone, without the dragon.  To complete the level, you 
must move from left to right, but you have the option of moving from right to 
left.  Yout must destroy or avoid your enemies, because they will destroy your
energy.  Be careful not to fall from a cliff, because you will use up a lot of 
force (jump just at the right moment).


1- PRESENTATION OF THE SCREEN
 
The screen is presented in the same manner as the 3D part.
  
TOP LEFT - Represents the weapon that you have in your hand. When it flashes
           the magic sword is about to disappear and you will have a normal
           sword.
 
TOP CENTER - Indicates your actual score.
 
TOP RIGHT - Indicates the energy that you are using.



2- MOVEMENT
 
The HERO can go in 8 directions-
 
 N- Jump straight up
 NE- Jump Towards Right
 E- Go EAST (RIGHT)
 SE- Hero bends down
 S- Hero bends down
 SW- Hero bends down
 W- Go WEST (LEFT)
 NW -Jump Towards Left

When you press the Joystick button, the hero uses his sword.

**BONUS**
 
Like the 3D part, pick up the crystals from the ground when you kill one of 
your enemies. These crystals increase your energy, if needed. Certain actions
will give you a magic sword.




IV. END OF A LEVEL
 
1- When you have finished a level, the message "CONGRADULATIONS" will appear.
   When you move to the next level, you will receive 50 energy points.
 
2- At the end of each level is a SAVE MENU which gives you the possibility 
   to have 3 different saves on Disk 2.

3- When you lose a screen, you will see the message "PRESS FIRE TO TRAIN"
   You may begin again, but the game will not register your score.
