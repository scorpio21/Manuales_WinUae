       Greetings to: Lord Thor, Big Thruster, Fletch (ESI),
                     Phantom (RSI), Goobug, 

       Thanks to: Vision Factory for a GREAT crack!!!, 
                  The Rogue (for comments about the 688

Loading the Game
----------------

 *  Locate the ON switch for your Amiga computer
 *  Next, locate the disk drive 
 *  Put USS John Young disk 1 in df0: and disk 2 in df1:
 *  The game should boot up automatically.

WHOEVER MODIFIES OR ALTERS THESE DOCS WILL GET HIS/HER ______________
PLEASE LEAVE IT INTACT!  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

I tried to run the game from WorkBench but for some reason it doesn't
work. Also, there is a HELP script located on the second disk of USS
which will format a SAVE GAME Disk, and install the game of a hard disk.
I installed the game on my hd but it didn't work! All of the required
files were copied, and assigns made by the HELP script. The screen goes
blank and that is it. All my background tasks were running, but I couldn't
get back to Workbench and had to re-boot.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, so I'm back with new docs, and again for a war game. USS John Young is
navy war ship simulation that is similar is someway to the good old board
game of 'Battle Ships'. Great grafx (over 700K packed!) and a big range of
enemy vessels, including civilian and military planes, submarines, oil rigs,
and even your own sea port! Enough of this...lets get to the game...

Upon booting you will be asked a question to verify if you have the original
or not (thanks to Vision Factory we don't have to worry about that) just hit
return. There is a whole bunch of gadgets, gauges, switches, lights etc that
are not used inthe game, so if you think I missed something, think again.

 To get to one of the rooms you can either use mouse to click on the 
 text, or use number keys either above your keyboard or on the numeric
 keypad. Also, the Speed and Direction Bar can be moved with mouse by
 clicking on the Move Left and Move Right arrows, you can use a joystick
 to move (move it to the right or left) and up to accelerate and down to
 deccelerate. There is also compass, which I didn't include on the 
 diagram above (try to make a circle using letters or '/' '\' !!!!) It 
 lets you see in what direction you're going (below it, degrees are given)
 use compass together with radar (more info on radar below) when you see 
 a ship north-east on the radar turn your ship, so that the compass is
 pointing north-east.

 [1] - Torpedo, there are four torpedo tubes on your ship.

  [=] Fire  - to launch a torpedo.

  [=] Load  - to load a torpedo into a tube and prepare it to launch.
  
        Colors of the light above the LOAD button:
    
           Yellow - empty tube (not loaded)
           Dark Green  - ready to fire (already loaded)
           Red - Firing (right now!)
           Blue - wait, in the process of firing (!?)  

       
    /___  __  ___\     Left arrow - aim left  
    \            /     Right arrow - aim right
                       Middle - aim middle (home position)

   To sink a ship:
   Move the direction pointer (located on the top of the control pannel) 
   so that it is pointing at the target, to see if you have him in range
   look on the bottom under Target Info where is says (in green): 
                                     
                                     DI  (distance)    
                                     HD  (heading)
                                     SP  (speed)

   If you move the pointer on the target and you see orange numbers appear
   on next to DI,HD,SP, hit LOCK, that will follow the target. 

!! Few tips here: Never fire torpedos if 'DI' number is higher than 6000!
   (you have to experiment with that number, because you might actually hit
   a ship from that far) the torpedo will not reach it. Also, if the SP and
   HD is zero (0) forget about it, it is either a mine or a marker, it is
   not moving! If the objective of the mission is to destroy Mines, use
   missiles, because I never sank a mine with a torpedo (or maybe I did
   but didn't pay attention to it.) ********* AT LEAST THREE TORPEDOS ARE
   REQUIRED TO SINK A SHIP ********
 
    
  [=] Auto  -  Automatic 'Follow Target' after torpedo is fired.
   
  [=] Lock  -  Lock on to a target, follows it as the target moves.

  [=] Un    -  Unlock the lock feature.

 [2] - Gun/Missile 

   You have two gun shells, 180 mm, and 410 mm. Click on the gadget that
   shows a small shell and a bigger one, to switch sizes. The 410 is more 
   effective, and if you want to use it, use it on a ship or a rig that
   has no weapons. Timing is crucial in this game. If you're too slow in
   deciding what to use you're dead! I used the 180 mm gun to shoot down
   and airplane (by the way, it was a civilian plane! ooops! but who to 
   hell flies in a war zone!?) 

   | -      +        This is used to specify how far you would like the
   | - ===           cannon shell to go. Set it up just above the middle 
   | -      -        for best shots. You might want to expriment with that
   | -               to get the desired distance.


  [=] Sh - tells you how many shells you have left.
  [=] St - Status, either RDY for READY, or LAD for LOADING. 

  [=] Computer Missile

  ON - turns the launcher on, OFF - turns the laucher off. 
   
  Raises the missile launcher, aim at a target (using joystick) make sure
  it has a black box around it, and hit a button. BOOOOOOMMMM! 
  100% Effective. Shame you get so little of them...(keep on reading
  to find out how to get more missiles!!!!) 

  Remeber to turn OFF the launcher when you're finished!

 [3] - Depth Charge

  Not much here, hit LOAD to load the depth charge, hit DROP when it 
  says READY. 

  The bar in the middle is used to specify the depth where you want to
  drop the charge. Next to is is a sonar, that shows you what is underwater.
  GREEN LINE - on the bottom of the sonar represents the bottom of the sea.
  RED LINE - Submarine, move the bar on the side so that the two lines are
  inbetween the RED LINE and Drop Depth Charges, when the line disappears
  it means you sunk the sub. 
          
 [4] - Motor Control

  Whole bunch of gadgets, switches etc. The only thing that is useful here
  are the ON/OFF switches for the radio. By pulling the second switch down
  to the ON position you turn the radio on. REC - receives the message,
  which is all scrambled. You can change the frequency by clicking on the
  numbers (Mhz.) 

 [5] - Damage Report 

  What do you mean I have to repair the ship? Yes, this is a simulation, 
  remember! Here are the things you'll have to repair after a attack:

  Gun, Deck, Radio, Radar, Pumps, Motor, Echo-Sounder, Leakage, Computer,
  Weather (?), Missile, Satellite, Scanner, Torpedo, Sonar, Depth-Charges,
  Screw (?), Compass, Rudder.

  All those things are used on the ship in some way. For example, lets say
  you attacked a convoy and got shot few times, after you sank the ships
  you go on radar and you don't see shit! Well, go and repair Radar, or
  you might go on AREA MAP and won't see any changes...fix satellite! 
  Also, it fucks you up alot when you're ready to fire missiles at a 
  BattleShip and you can't turn the missiles on! Computer fucked up, go and
  fix it!

  You can also repair your SEA PORT if you got that far...sometimes you can
  see it is on fire then fix it.

  [=] Super Structure - tells you in % the condition of your ship, 
                        100% Excellent, 60 % you're dead!                           
  
  [=] Sp. Parts - spare parts, needed to fix your ship.


 [6] - Navigation 

  There is a weather map on the left side, beats the hell out of me what
  is the use for it since Weather has no effect on the game play. 

  You're a little dot in middle of the Radar (circle), the crosses (+)
  around you are the enemies.
  
  [=] Radar, the most important tool on your ship! Has three (3) bars on
      the right side from which, two (2) are yellow and one (1) red. Used
      to see objects from different distance. (Like in F/A-18 Inteceptor)
      Top bar is the closest, lets say 5 miles range, second is 10-20 miles,
      third 50 miles. You switch the range by clicking on the bar.

 [7] - Area Map

  Satellite view of the area you're in. Shows you the land, sea, 
  your harbors (red), you (black), enemy ships on the whole map (white dots)
  
  From here you decide where you wanna go. Maybe to your harbor, or for 
  some BIG FISH!

  
 [8] - Score

  Tells you how much money, points, and ships sunk you've got. Next to 
  each ship it tells you how many you sank.

  Here are the ships I sunk before I wrote these docs:

    Tank  Ships  8               Military aircraft 1
    Civil Ships  5               Civil airacraft   1
    Cannon Boats 3               Submarines        7
    Cruisers     14              War Ships         9
    Battle Ships 6               Mines             7
    Mine Layers  0               Destroyers        0
    Tank Ships   7 

  All these numbers are real, and I have the game saved for later
  retrieval. You might say, well you don't even have that many weapons!
  Next section tells you how to get more of them...

 [9] - Port control

  This is a neat feature of USS John Young, I didn't expected this to be
  included. You can go to your own harbor and BUY weapons, food, men, spare
  parts, fuel, oil etc...you can also fix your harbor if you see it is on
  fire. There is a long and frustrating procedure to get into the harbor.
  Perfect timing, and coordination is required. 

  First, locate the closest harbor to you using the AREA MAP. Then go there.
  As you get closer and closer to the land you will see green land, and
  harbor slowly appearing. Go straight at it! not too fast not too slow. When
  you get really close to the harbor so that you can see the ship and the
  crane in the harabor, slow down and stop. It is very important that you 
  don't just crash into the harbor (I did once) REMEMBER: YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSE
  TO GO ALL THE WAY DOWN, STOP BEFORE THE HARBOR, AND CLICK THE "PORT CONTROL
  BUTTON TO SEE IF YOU'RE CLOSE ENOUGH!!! IF IT DOES NOT WORK MOVE CLOSER, 
  SLOWLY!!!!!!! UNTIL A NEW MENU APPEARS!!!!

  When the menu appears there is a keypad there that looks like this...

              -----------
              -----------
              
              7  8  9  BA
              4  5  6
              1  2  3  TR 
              0   RET  BR
    
  There is a whole bunch of tools on the right side, gun shells, oil, fuel,
  men, food, spare parts etc...click on the item you would like, then click
  on the numbers on the keypad to say how much you want, then click on the 
  TR (I believe) button to buy, and BR to sell. BA used for BACK SPACE.

 
               That is it...wish ya good luck...- Sycon        
        
P.S. Well, I see that people don't appreciate docs so these might be my
     last docs. I'll give it about a week and I might update these docs
     if I discover something new.
