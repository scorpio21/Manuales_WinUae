			  QUICK REFERENCE CARD

AMIGA

Loading
1) Use Kickstart version 1.2 to start your computer.
2) When you are asked for a Workbench disk, eject the Kickstart disk and 
   replace it with your Uninvited game disk.
3) Double-click on the Uninvited disk icon.
4) Use preferences to make sure the time, date, and printer settings are set
   correctly.
5) Double-click on the Uninvited game icon to start the game.

PRINTING

You man have occasion during the course of the game to use a printer. Due to
space restraints, not all of the printer drivers available have been included
on the Uninvited game disk. if you wish to use your printer with Uninvited, you
will need to copy the appropriate printer driver from your Amiga Workbench disk
to the Uninvited disk. Follow the instructions that came with your Workbench
disk.

SAVING GAMES

You can save your game in progress at any point. To do so, you will need a
formatted storage disk. Follow the standard procedure as outlined in the Amiga
documentation BEFORE you start the game. You will not be able to format a disk
once the game has started.

When you want to save your game in progress, select SAVE or SAVE AS from the
PROJECT menu. The first time you save a game, the two commands act identically.
You will see this requester appear.

Click on the name under which you wish to save the game, or click in the text
area and type a file name. The requester shows the files on the internal disk
drive (DF0:) by default. You can look at a list of all files on the external
drive (or any other connected drive) by typing the drive specification and
clicking OK. For example: type DF1: and click OK to see all the saved games on
the external drive. When you have either selected or typed a file name, click
OK to do the save. The two commands -- SAVE and SAVE AS -- differ on subsequent
uses. Once you have saved a game the first time, selecting SAVE will save the
current game over the old game automatically. You will not have to bother with
file names. If you want to save your game under a new name or to a different
drive, you need to select SAVE AS, which requires you to supply a file name.

LOADING GAMES

Uses the same requester as the SAVE AS command, except that you won't have to
type unless you wish to switch drives. Simply click on the name of the file you
wish to load and click OK.

CONTROLLING THE GAME

All of the commands work exactly as described in the manual. Whenever reference
is made to pressing the "button," you whould use the left-hand mouse button.

THE WINDOWS

While the windows in the Amiga version differ in appearance from thos in the
manual, they act in essentially the same manner. The only difference is that
you cannot double-click in the title bar to expand a window to full size
screen.

THE MENUS

The Amiga version of Uninvited includes two menus to allow you to control the
game.

The ABOUT menu tells you a little about the programmers, artists, and designers
involved in the creation of the game. You may want to select an item from this
menu, just for fun.

The PROJECT menu is essentially the same as the File Menu described in the
manual. It contains the following items:

NEW: 	  Start a new game from the beginning. You will be prompted to save the
          game in progress if you haven't done so.

LOAD:	  Load a saved game.

SAVE:	  Save the game in progress.

SAVE AS:  Save the game in progress with a new name.

QUIT:	  Quit the game - you are asked if you want to save the game if you
          haven't already done so.

==============================================================================

Welcome....
	You poor, poor, youngster. What a pity about your nice automobile. And
I think I smell a storm coming too. You must come inside and dry off. Perhaps
we can have you for dinner.
	Before I can show you around, you should take a look at the enclosed
Quick Reference Card. Follow the procedures carefully and you will see just how
uninvited you are. Go ahead and do it now; I'll wait. I have plenty of time to
kill.
	Welcome back. As an uninvited guest, you will probably see things you
have never seen before, so I am going to give you a little tour. Be careful not
to wander off by yourself; some of my other guests haven't eaten in rather a
long while.

	The first sight to greet you as you enter will be this strange
artifact:

          			CLICK TO CONTINUE

In this house, we call it the command window. The message you see means that
there are things you need to know, but there isn't room for the whole message
in the text window. You need to use the rat...I mean mouse...to point to the
box and click the selection button so you can see more of the message. What?
Oh, the text window is that window at the bottom of the screen. It looks like
this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------!-!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------!-!
 Good evening. You have been summoned as the Uninvited.                     ! !
                                                                            ! !
 LOOK-OUT! The last thing you remember before the darkness rushed up to     ! !
 claim you is your brother's startled cry. You managed to swerve            !-!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------!-!

You will learn more later. For now, just do as I say and we will continue.
Point to the indside of the command window and clidk the selection button on
your mouse until the command window changes to look like this:

         !-----------------------------------------------------!
         !   EXAMINE    !   OPEN     !   CLOSE   !   SPEAK     !
         !-----------------------------------------------------!
         !  OPERATE     !    GO    !  HIT   !  CONSUME         !
         !-----------------------------------------------------!

This is called the command window because it is the source of all your power in
this house. To give a command, simply point to the one you want and click the
selection button. Usually these commands will be used to affect something or
someone in the room you are in. For instance, if you think back to the scene of
your accident, you should see somthing like the image below.

To examine the car, point to the word EXAMINE and click the button. Then click
somewhere in the picture.

	The description will appear in the text window.

	As you already know, any time there is more text than the text window
can hold, the command window will metamorphose into its "Click to Continue"
form. If you wish to view the past, use the text window's scroll bar to move
back through the last few windows of text. Merely point to the white box to the
right of the window, hold down the selection button, and move the box up or
down.

	Because you are new here, I will explain a few other things to you.

This window is called the EXITS window.

                                !----------------!
                                !     EXITS      !
                                !----------------!
                                !                !
                                !  !--!          !
                                !  !--!          !
                                !                !
                                !----------------!

It is very important to you as you explore, since it shows at all times which
way to run....I mean which way is out. The white box in the window represents
an exit. In this case, at the scene of your unfortunate accident, it is the
door on the driver's side of the car. Usually, you can use a door by
double-clicking (click the selection button two times quickly) directly on the
door in the picture, but occasionally there will be doors that you cannot see.
Those doors will usually be shown in the EXITS window.

This little window marked SELF is you.             !-----------!
                                                   !    SELF   !
	                                           !-----------!

Now don't get panicky--all that means is that if you need to EXAMINE yourself
or OPEN yourself (not as disgusting as it sounds -- it's how you take
inventory) you use the SELF button as the object of the command. Note that the
inventory window is one of the windows open when the game begins. We'll get to
it a little later.

	Now, if you will follow me, I will attempt to get you out of that poor,
broken-down car and up to the front door of the house. After that, well, strnge
things can happen when you arrive unannounced.

GETTING STARTED

	Look at the picture carefully. You might want to examine any loose
objects. You can distinguish "objects" from other items on the sceen by
clicking on them. If an item turns color, then it is an object with its own
properties. For instance, point to the steering wheel and click the selection
button. Since it changed color, you know that it is a separate object from the
rest of the car. If you want to learn more about it once it is selected, just
click on the EXAMINE command in the command window. The description will appear
in the text window.
	If I were you, I'd get out of the car soon; I think I smell gas. To get
out, select the OPEN command.

Then click on the car door. That should open it. Another way to open the door
is to click on OPEN and then on the small white box in the EXITS window. And
yet another way is to double-click on the door itself.
	By the way, try not to move the mouse when you are clicking on an exit,
or the computer will think you are trying to move the door...and we frown on
that sort of thing around here.

Now click on GO and then click in the open door or on the white square in the
EXITS window. You now find yourself on the doorstep, ready to come in for a
visit.

You might want to stop and see if there is any mail to bring in. To do this,
click on OPEN in the command window and then click on the mailbox. A contents
window will open.

If you see anything you want to take with you, you need to put it into your
inventory.

	To take an object, just point to it, hold the selection button down,
"drag" the object into the inventory window and release the button. If there is
more in the window than meets the eye, use the scroll bars to see more. Be sure
you are aware of what you carry...you may need anything at a moment's notice.
	
	The window labeled INVENTORY contains everything you are carrying. You
can move the window around on the screen if you prefer it out of your way. You
can also cause it to change its form; you can make it larger or smaller. If you
are a true novice, you might want to consult the guide to computer lore that
came with your machine for more information about dealing with windows. One
intriguing property of the INVENTORY and text windows is that they can be
increased in size by double-clicking in their respective title bars.
Double-clicking on the title bar a second time will revert the window to its
original form. I told you this was a strange house.

The INVENTORY window can be closed by clicking in the "close box" in the upper
left corner. You can restore the window to the screen by clicking on the OPEN
command and then on SELF.

	The OPEN command is very powerful. As you saw in the case of the
mailbox, it allows you to see behind the surface of things. Never be fooled by
an object's appearance. Use the OPEN command to reveal the inner workings of
things.

COME ON IN....IF YOU DARE

	Well, here you are. Your poor car has had it and your brother is gone.
Now what? At least there's a house you can try for help. After all, what can
happen. There's no such thing as a haunted house...is there?
	Raise your trembling hand and give the knocker a try. If you're lucky,
someone will be home. If you're luckier, maybe they won't be.

COMMANDS

EXAMINE - Allows you to look carefully at something or someone. Select EXAMINE
and then click on the object, person, or thing to be examined.

SHORT CUT: Nearly everything except exits will be examined if you double-click
on them. This may save time in critical situations.

OPEN - Use this command to open doors, boxes, safes, other people's pockets,
etc. Select OPEN, then click on whatever you want to open. OPEN SELF to see
your inventory. OPEN is often a synonym for "look inside," and can be used as
such.

SHORT CUT: Doors (when unlocked) will open if you double-click on them. Other
objects may or may not.

CLOSE - CLOSE is the opposite of OPEN.

SPEAK - If you want to speak, use this command. Select SPEAK, then click on the
person or thing you wish to speak to. Use this to talk to other characters, to
cast magic spells, or to talk to yourself when you get nervous.

OPERATE - OPERATE may be the most powerful command at your disposal. You use
OPERATE to make things work. For instance, to dial a phone (too bad the lines
are down), select OPERATE, then double-click on the phone. To light a match (if
you had any), OPERATE the match on the matchbook. If you want to unlock a door,
click on the key, then on OPERATE, then on the door (or, in some cases, the
lock). To pay money to a person or thing, select the money, then click on
OPERATE, then click on the object or person you wish to pay. OPERATE will often
work where nothing else will, so be sure to try it before you give up on a
situation.

GO - Use GO to go through a door or other exit. Select GO, then click on the
picture of the door or on its representative square in the EXITS window.

SHORT CUT: Double-click on the doorway or exit in either the picture or the
EXITS window.

HIT - Use this only in self-defense or if you feel the need to break something.
Select HIT, then click on the target of the blow. Don't hit anything unless you
are sure it won't hit back.

CONSUME - If you get hungry and you find food, select CONSUME, then click on
the food. Do be cautious, though, no telling how long it's been lying around.

THE FILE MENU

NEW - Starts a new game

OPEN.. - Opens a previously saved game.

SAVE - Saves a current game.

SAVE AS... - Saves your game under a new name.

QUIT - Give up and go home.

Use SAVE AS whenever you wish to save a game with a new name. SAVE will save
your current position as whatever "filename" you gave the last time you used
SAVE AS. You can start a saved game by selecting OPEN from the file menu ans
choosing your saved game from the list displayed.

	You should always QUIT when you are done playing. That way, you are
given a chance to save your game before you leave.

	Other menu commands and special features specific to different machines
are detailed on the enclosed Quick Reference Card.

THE OUTCOME

	How does survival strike you? If you play really well, we might let you
get out of the house. If you want more than that, well, rewards come to the one
that earns them....if you can get your hands to stop shaking, then come on
in...we're waiting.
