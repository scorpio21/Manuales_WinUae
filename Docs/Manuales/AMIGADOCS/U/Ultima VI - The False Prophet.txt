THE MAIN MENU

When you type "Ultima6," an introductory sequence will begin.  Read all text
messages that appear and press any key or click in the message box to move on
to the next message or screen.  (Press <escape> if you want to bypass this
sequence altogether.)

When this is over, the main menu will appear, listing five options--
Introduction, Create a Character, Transfer a Character, Acknowledgements, and
Journey Onward.  To select one of these options, click on it with the mouse.
From the keyboard, use the arrow keys or numeric keypad to highlight the one
you want then press return, or type the first letter of the option's name.

The first time you play, you will want to go directly to Create a Character.
Here, you can type in your character's name and select his or her Sex and
Portrait.  Go on to the next portion of the character creation system by
clicking on the Continue box (or by typing "C").  This will take you to a
series of questions.  Answer by selecting the A or B response to each
question.  The way in which you answer determines the kind of character you
get.

When your character is complete, you will automatically be taken to the
Introduction.  This will tell you what the game is about.  If you want to
watch this again later, select Introduction from the menu.

If you've played Ultima IV or Ultima V, you may want to bring your character
from one of those games over to Ultima VI.  Transfer a Character allows you to
do that.  Select this option and follow the directions on the screen, then
click on the Transfer button and you're ready to use your old character in the
new game.

Acknowledgements tells you who did what in the creation of Ultima VI.

Journey Onward takes you directly into the Ultima VI game.  Select this option
when you're ready to play.

SCREEN LAYOUT

The Map
The largest region, in the upper left, is the map.  This shows the world you
are moving through, with the view centered on you (or another member of your
party if it's their turn).

With a mouse, move your characters around by positioning the pointer over the
map until it becomes an arrow pointing in the direction you wish to move.
Then click the left button.  Some actions ask you for a target location.  (You
may have to say where you want to drop an item, for example).  To select a
location, click on it with the left mouse button.

If you don't want to use a mouse, move by pressing one of the arrow keys, or
one of the eight keys around the 5 on the numeric keypad.  These keys are also
used to select target locations--move the crosshairs on the screen to the
desired location and press <enter> to initiate the action.

You can pass your turn and do nothing by positioning the mouse pointer over
your character and clicking the left mouse button or by pressing the space
bar.

The Status Display In the upper right-hand corner of the screen is the
status display.  At the top of the display, the current position of
Britannia's sun and the positions and phases of the two moons in the sky are
shown.

Beneath this is a roster of all the members of your party, along with each
character's figure and current hit points.  A character whose hit points are
printed in red is hurt badly; one whose hit points are green is poisoned.

When a party has more than five characters, arrows appear at the top and
bottom of this part of the screen.  Click on these arrows to scroll up and
down through the list of party members.  The + and - keys can also be used.

If you click on a character's name, you will be shown their portrait and
statistics.  The higher a stat, the better.  Strength determines how much a
character can carry, and how effectively they can strike with bludgeoning
weapons.  Dexterity determines how quick they are (faster characters get to
move and/or attack more often), and how effective they are with non-
bludgeoning weapons as well as crossbows, bows, and other missile weapons.
Intelligence determines the character's bargaining ability and effectiveness
as a spellcaster.

The next two stats show pairs of numbers--the current number of points the
character has, and the maximum possible.  Magic points determine how many
spells can be cast.  For instance, a spell of the fourth circle uses four
magic points.  Health determines how much damage the character can take before
being killed.  Each hour, you recover a number of magic points equal to your
current level.  Health can only be regained by rest or healing.

The next statistic in the list is Level, which indicates how powerful a
character has become through experience gained in past adventures.  The last
stat, Experience, determines when a player is ready to progress to the next
level by meditating at a shrine.

To view a character's Inventory, click on one of the figures to the left of
the roster.

On the left side of the inventory display is a figure showing all equipment
that is readied for immediate use--either held in the character's hands, or
being worn.  If you are holding something that requires both hands, such as a
crossbow, you will not be allowed to put anything in the other hand.  Below
this figure is the current weight of all readied items, and the maximum weight
the character can have readied.

On the right side of the inventory display are all other items carried by the
character.  The total weight being carries is listed here, along with the
maximum weight the character can have in inventory.  To ready or unready an
item, just click on it with the left mouse button.  To look inside a container
in your inventory, such as a bag or a chest, just click on it.  Click on it
again to return to the main inventory display.

At the lower right, the character's current combat mode is displayed (see
"Begin/Break Off Combat," below).

At the lower left of the status display are five buttons.  From left to right,
their functions are:  show previous character, return to party display, switch
between portrait and inventory displays, show next character, and change
combat mode.  Again, without a mouse, press the following key with the
corresponding icon picture:

Key    Icon of
1      Man with arrow pointing left
2      Group of men
3      Head
4      Man with arrow pointing right
5      Two swords

To use the inventory display from the keyboard, press the <tab> key to move
the crosshairs to the status display.  You can then move to any item or button
with the arrow or numeric keypad keys, and press <enter> to select it.
Pressing the <tab> key again will return the crosshairs to the map.  The
function keys F1 through f8 will switch the display to show the different
members of your party.  (If you don't know the positon of a character in your
roster, the + and - keys allow you to show the next and previous characters.)
F10 will return to the main party display.  The asterisk (*) key will toggle
between a character's portrait and inventory displays.

The Message Scroll
At the lower right of the screen is the message scroll.  All text describing
things you see and hear, as well as the results of your actions, is displayed
here.  When a message is too long to fit on the scroll, a flashing, downward-
pointing arrow appears ont he bottom of the scroll.  Press the space bar or
click ont he message scroll to view the rest of the message.

The Command Icons
Underneath the map are ten command buttons.  The main commands in Ultima VI
can be selected either with the mouse or the keyboard.  To use a command from
the keyboard, simply press the first letter of its name. With the mouse, move
the pointer to the command button you want to use and click the lefft mouse
button.  Then select the object or person you want to use the command on.

For frequently used commands, such as Get, Look, Attack or Move, you can set
up a default commmand for use with the right mouse button.  Click the right
button on a command, and a blue line will appear under it.  From then on,
clicking the right button on any shape on the map or in your inventory display
will execute that command on that object.  You can change the default command
at any time.  For all functions other than executing the default command, the
left mouse button should be used.  The ten main commands are:

ATTACK (A) is used to fight monsters, animals, or people, or to attempt to
destory objects.  After choosing the Attack command, choose a target on the
map that is in range of the weapon you have readied.

CAST (C) allows you to cast magic spells.  You must have a spellbook readied,
and have enough magic points and reagents available to cast the desired spell.
When a character tries to Cast a spell, the spellbook will be shown in the
status display, listing the names of all the spells they have learned.  Each
name is followed by the number of times that spell can be cast with the
reagents in inventory.  To page through the spells, click on the blue arrow
buttons below the list or use the left and right arrow on the keyboard.

You cast a spell by clicking on its name, or by selecting it with the up and
down arrows and pressing <enter>. Typing the first letter of each syllable of
the spell also works.  For instance, to cast the Repel Undead Spell - AN XEN
CORP - you could type AXC and press <enter>. Some spells require you to
specify whom or what you are casting them on.  Simply select a target on the
map or in your inventory.

There is one special spell, the Help Spell, whih requires no reagents.  This
will return you instantly to Lord British's Castle.  It should only be used in
the most desperate of situations, however, as it will usually cost your party
many experience points.

TALK (T) lets you converse with the people you encounter in the game.  You can
also speak with some shrines and statues, and with the other members of your
party.  You must select the character on the map you wish to speak with.
Their portrait will appear in the status display while they are speaking.

You talk by typing single words on the keyboard and pressing <enter>. All
words may be abbreviated to the first four letters (e.g., "elephant" may be
abbreviated to "elep").

Most people will respond to the words "name," "job," and "bye." (The "bye"
command ends a conversation. You can accomplish the same thing by pressing
<enter> without typing anything.) Some people will also respond to the words
"join" and "leave," allowing you to add members to your party (up to a maximum
of eight) or remove them.

During the course of conversation, people give you an idea of what they're
interested in talking about.  If you have the help function on, as it is when
you start the game, the subjects they want to talk about will appear in a
different color on the screen; if help is off, you've have to figure out the
key words in their conversations.  However, be aware that some people will
respond to other subjects, if you ask them.

LOOK (L) allows you to identify anyone or anything in the location you select,
on the map or in your inventory.  This command can be used to read books,
signs and gravestones or to examine paintings. It will also give information
on the effectiveness of weapons and armor.  When you use the Look command on
an object you are adjacent to, you will search it.  This will reveal the
contents of chests, bags, crates, barrels, etc. It will also let you find
hidden items or secret doors.

GET (G) lets you pick up an object on the map. You must be standing next to
it. If it isn't too heavy, it will be put into your inventory.

DROP (D) can be used to lighten your load by getting rid of items you no
longer need.  First select the item in your inventory, then choose a spot on
the map to place it.

MOVE (M) is used to push an item or to move it between charaters in the party.

If you select an item on the map, you can sometimes push it to an adjacent
squrea to get it out of your way. If it's something alive, though, it may not
always let you! Moving an item into a square with a chest, barrel, or crate
will place the item inside it.

This command can also be used to move things in and out of containers or from
one character to another. To move an item to another character, click on them
on the map.  When you buy a new spell, you must move it into your spellbook
before you can cast it.

USE (U) operates any object that has some function. Among other things, it
will let you open and close doors and chests, enter or exit ships, climb
ladders, milk cows, mount horses, light or extinguish fires, look into
telescope or crystal balls, ring bells, eat or drink food and beverages, or
play musical instruments.  After using a musical instrument, you play it with
the numbers 0 through 9, and press <enter> when finished.

REST (R) lets your party set up a camp and recover health and magic points.
You will be asked how many hours you wish to rest, from 1 to 9, and who will
stand guard.  Select a character on the map display, or press <escape> to have
no guard. A chracter will not regain hit points if they are out of food, or if
they stand guard. If you are ambushed while resting, however, your party will
not be awakened unless you have someone on guard! You can only rest on land.
At sea, this command repairs your frigate. Multiple 'rests' may be required to
repair a ship completely.

BEGIN/BREAK OFF COMBAT (B) switches back and forth between party mode and
combat mode. In party mode, the members of your party automatically follow you
around.  In combat, each character will behave according to the combat mode
you have selected for them on their inventory dispaly. Characters in Front,
Rear, or Flank modes will position themselves in a formation centered around
you. Characters in Assault mode will attack the nearest enemy, while those in
Retreat mode will avoid combat.  Chracters in berserk mode will charge and
attack the strongest foe.  Lastly, if you select Command mode for a character,
you can control their actions each turn, just as you do for your own
character. You can change a character's combat mode at any time, even in the
middle of a battle.

KEYBOARD COMMANDS

Ctrl-S saves the game. You will be asked if you really want to save the game.
Type "Y" to save or "N" to cancel the command and keep playing.
Ctrl-R restores the game to the last saved position.  As in the case of the
Save command, you will be asked to replay "Y" or "N"
Ctrl-Q quits the game and exits to DOS. Make sure to save the game first if
you want to return to the same position later!
Ctrl-H toggles help mode on/off.
Ctrl-Z toggels sound and music on/off.
1 through 8 place a member of the party in solo mode.  In this mode, you can
move that character around and perform whatever actions you wish, while the
rest of the party remains motionless.  Note that you can't talk to people or
use ladders, dungeons entrances, or moongates in solo mode - you must be in
party mode.
0 (zero) exits solo mode and returns to party mode.
Esc aborts most functions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I, Lord British, write this exhortation in my own hand that you, my virtuous
Champion and Avatar, might gain a full appreciation of the significance of the
times which face us.  Though evil has often raised its rebellion head, I fear
we now face a threat far greater than any yet encountered.  In the past, you
and your companions have risen faithfully to the challenge, undaunted by
overwhelming odds, unwavering in your adherence to the Path of Virtue.  We
place our trust in you once more.

As though seeking vengeance against the Light, the forces of Darkness have
renewed their malevolent aggressions.  Not content to remain in their own
realm, daemonic emissaries from the Underworld have begun making incursions
into our land.  It is fortuitous that you have returned to Britannia in these
perilous times.  Study well the words which follow, for they are essential to
your quest.  And that quest is essential to the continued existence of the
human race.

For more than a fortnight I have dictated my thoughts and admonitions to the
venerable Moebius, Keeper of the Libraries of the Lycaeum.  He has
scrupulously recorded my every word, and when called upon, made illustrations
to aid your understanding.  I have affixed my seal to this letter to assure
you that these are indeed my words.  Take them to heart.  Heed my counsel.

Gird yourself with the infinite wisdom of Truth, Love and Courage, for at the
end of your quest lies a destiny foretold in ancient times:  "One shall arise
who possesses the strength of an army, the vision of a prophet and the heart
of a saint.  This Great One will bring an end to the struggle between the
Darkness and the Light."

Pray that you are, indeed, the One, for should you fail, the Light of life
will surely be extinguished and Darkness will reign forevermore.

Lord British
Sovereign of Britannia



THE CHRONICLES OF BRITANNIA

My sojourn upon the shores of Britannia began many generations ago.  Long ago
did I uncover the secrets of the moongates which brought me here from my
distant homeland, even as they now bring you.  As you well know, we who pass
through the gates to Britannia, though we be in this world are not of it.  It
is for this reason, I suspect, that we are immune to the ravages of time
during our stays here.  Remember, however, that we remain ever mortal, albeit
seemingly ageless.

At the time of my arrival here, this place was known as Sosaria, a region
comprised of numerous warring city-states and feudal fiefdoms.  It was not
long before my affinity for order, peace and prosperity had earned me the
title of Lord British, ruler over the city-state of Britain, and ultimately
Lord of Britannia.  Under my guidance the land and its people have prospered
and grown, though not without challenges from the forces of Evil.

THE AGE OF DARKNESS AND THE FOUNDING OF BRITANNIA

Thrice during ancient times did beings of a foul nature seek to conquer my
domain.  Thrice did you answer my call for a champion.  Thrice was evil
thwarted.

THE TALE OF ULTIMA I

First was the perverted sorceror, Mondain, who slew his own father that he
might gain immortality and advance his dark dominion over the land.  It was
against Mondain that you first answered my call, travelling through the
moongate to put an end to Mondain's shadowy plans.

THE TALE OF ULTIMA II

The triumph of good was short-lived, for Mondain left behind an apprentice and
consort named Minax, a cold-blooded young woman whose ambition was exceeded
only by her thrist for blood.  Entire legions of evil creatures responded to
her commands, bringing misery to the inhabitants of Sosaria.  Again, you rose
to the challenge, slaying Miinax's vile minions by the hundreds until at last
she too met her fate at your hands.

THE TALE OF ULTIMA III

Mondain and Minax had devised a treacherous scheme to assure their immortality
throughout time.  They had created an offspring known as Exodus, neither man
nor machine, yet embodying every evil impulse they possessed.  Rising from the
murky depths of the Great Ocean, Exodus unleashed an assault of vengeance upon
the world.  Were it not for your keen wit and determination, Exodus would
surely have brought utter devastation to our land.  Aided by the enigmatic
Timelord, you foiled the mighty Exodus, bringing an end to the Cycle of Gloom
begun by Mondain so long ago.

In this manner did you thrice respond to my call for valor and overcome the
Triad of Evil.  The peace and security brought about by your acts of bravery
led the city-states to band together and form the nation of Britannia,
submitting to my just rule as British, Lord of Britannia.

THE ASCENT OF THE AVATAR,
as Related in Ultima IV

With the passing of gloom and despair from the face of Britannia, the citizens
flourished.  Edicts went forth from my hand which were designed to foster both
the material and spiritual growth of the society.  I established great centers
of learning where the arts and sciences could be developed and appreciated.
During this era of renaissance, eight major townships were built upon the
foundations of the former city-states, each dedicated to the study and
fostering of a single virtue.  These towns stand as symbols of great fortitude
to this day.

All great cultural movements require role models to help society maintain
proper focus.  I therefore issued the challenge for such an individual to step
forward and show the people the way of virtue.  You responded in a fashion
which befits your integrity and pure heart.  Undertaking the task of
unraveling the concepts of spirituality, you discovered the great Codex of
Ultimate Wisdom and attained the title of 'Avatar,' the human embodiment of
virtue.

The newly discovered Codex was raised from the bottom of the Great Stygian
Abyss in order that we might study its teachings.  But our acquisition of the
Codex changed the physical, as well as the spiritual, landscape of the world.
A fiery new island, the Isle of the Avatar, rose from the depths of the Great
Sea, and in the violent birth of this isle, an immense underworld chamber
opened up!  When this cataclysm had passed, a shrine was built on the Isle of
the Avatar to house the Codex forever.

THE SUBVERSION OF THE SHADOWLORDS,
as Related in Ultima V

The acquisition of the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom from the deep recesses of the
underworld created a karmic imbalance in the universe, resulting in the
emergence of three sinister Shadowlords from the shards of the black jewel of
Mondain.  These grim agents of darkness were the very antitheses of virtue.
Their trickery and deceit allowed them to imprison me in their underworld
dungeon and, in a perversion of justice, compelled the leaders of Britannia to
oppress the people.  The once noble Lord Blackthorn became the human agent who
fulfilled their evil intent.

However, following your instincts and the admonitions of the Codex, you
applied the principles of truth, love and courage against the Shadowlords and
the corrupted Blackthorn.  Your efforts allowed me to banish them and their
agents from the realm of light.  Thus was I restored to my consecrated throne.

However, my return to the surface world set off a great tectonic upheaval,
resulting in the collapse of the cavernous underworld in which I had been
imprisoned.  Many aftershocks and cataclysmic disasters befell the world for a
period of time after that, though eventually all was restored to normal.

TODAY:  THE THREAT OF THE GARGOYLES

Though long believed to be mythological creatures, the existence of Gargoyles
was discovered shortly after the first expedition to the geologically unstable
underworld.  At first, they seemed content to remain in their subterranean
domain, but recently they began appearing in our world, seemingly bent on
doing us great harm.

These diabolical nemeses have begun to seize our holy shrines and places of
enlightenment.  Scores of homes and villages in our land have been destroyed
during nocturnal raids mounted by the daemonic fiends, while countless others
stand empty and deserted.  Local and government militias have organized in
opposition to the calamitous invasion from below.  Whole brigades of skilled
warriors from Serpent's Hold have clashed with these tireless foes on the
field of battle, but to no avail.

The Gargoyles' methods suggest that they are searching for something of great
value.  It is even rumored that they may seek your destruction, though why
this should be so is not known to us.

I urge you, my Champion and Avatar, to study the pages that follow, in part to
ensure your own survival.  But even more, heed my words that you may
understand the condition of our world and the plight of our people against the
unrelenting Gargoyles.



THE KINGDOM OF BRITTANIA

As the Lord of Britannia, I have devoted myself to fathoming the beauty and
variety of this land.  But one must not forget that the landscape has been
stained with the blood of many a brave warrior who, for want of control over
it, fell victim to its perils.  Those who have seen the Bloody Plains in the
northeast know of what I speak.  So, take care in your journeying lest you
fall prey to the seductive charm of the land, only to learn its deadly secrets
while lost in contemplation.

THE GREAT CENTERS OF POWER AND LEARNING

The Castle of Lord British
Chief among the places in Britannia, my keep overlooks the town of Britain
from the protected flanks of the Serpent's Spine.  Visitors to the castle will
find evidence of my many interests and hobbies within its marbled halls.

Though my authority extends from the throne to the most remote regions of the
kingdom, none shall be turned away who come to me for counsel in their time of
need.  And forget not, Avatar, that I have prepared a room for you in my
castle that you might find a place of rest from your long journeys abroad.

The Lycaeum
The world's greatest storehouse of knowledge and wisdom is contained within
the walls that form the Lycaeum.  Poised upon the northwestern slopes of
Verity Isle, the Lycaeum's libraries, laboratories and academies of learning
are a haven for the seeker of truth.  Four times each year the Inner Circle of
Mages congregates within the labyrinthine chambers to exchange esoteric
secrets.  Whilst in the area, do not fail to visit the observatory where
astronomers create many fine lenses through which to view the heavens.

Empath Abbey
Home to the Brotherhood of the Rose, Empath Abbey serves as a retreat for
those engaged in contemplation and reflection.  Flanked by the oaks of the
Deep Forest on one side and by the sea on the other, the Abbey sits as a
lighthouse of peace in the northwestern region of Britannia, near the town of
Yew.  Well schooled in the vintner's craft, the brothers and sisters of the
Abbey produce some of the land's finest wines, thus assuring their financial
security and sustaining their monastic lifestyles.

Serpent's Hold
A bastion of honor, valor, and triump, Serpent's Hold is the castle
headquarters of the Order of the Silver Serpent and the training center for
Britannia's armed militia.  Many noble and brave warriors have set forth in
our defense from this garrison on the Isle of Deeds.  The most skilled of
these warriors, grizzled veterans all, have selflessly returned to instruct
the new recruits in the ways of attack and defense.  Recently, a dozen squads
of the finest from Serpent's Hold went out to attack the camps of the invading
Gargoyles.  Few returned to tell about it.

THE PRINCIPAL TOWNS

When the Great Council met after the collapse of the Triad of Evil, it was
decided that each of the main towns of Britannia should adopt one of the
fundamental principles of virtue as its focus of learning.  Each of these
eight towns, the former city-states of Sosaria, has taken great care in
fostering its guiding principle of virtue--they stand apart as the true jewels
in the crown of Britannia.  The traveller will find a sacred shrine dedicated
to the chosen principle of virtue near each town.

Moonglow, founded on Honesty
On the southern tip of Verity Isle, the town of Moonglow welcomes those of
faithful heart and noble intentions.  Mages and scholars frequent this
seagoing port because of its proximity to the libraries of the Lycaeum and
because its accomodations and services are among the most reasonably priced in
the land.

Britain, founded on Compassion
Centrally located on the shore of Britanny Bay, the town of Britain is the
site of the castle from which I rule.  It is also host to multitudes of
travellers and to purveyors of goods of all kinds.

The adventurer will surely appreciate the hospitality shown by Britain's
compassionate citizens.  The shops, inns and armouries of Britain are much
renowned and frequented by all who prepare for and return from long journeys.
The historic Wayfarer's Inn is considered a second home to many a road-weary
adventurer.

Jhelom, founded on Valor
Many of Britannia's most esteemed warriors have emerged from the town of
Jhelom in the far southwestern region of the kingdom on the main island of the
Valorian isles.  Lodging, supplies, armaments and a prosperous shipbuilding
industry are to be found in this bustling town by the sea.

Yew, founded on Justice
Second in size only to Britain, the town of Yew is the judicial and legal
heart of the kingdom, being home to the Supreme Court of Britannia.  Druids
and philosophers have long gathered under the shade trees of the Deep Forest
surrounding Yew, exploring the subtle nuances of justice and righteousness.
While visiting Yew, one will find a fine pub and a fully equipped armoury and
apothecary.

Minoc, founded on Sacrifice
Stretched across the mouth of Lost Hope Bay in northern Britannia, Minoc has
commited itself to the plight of the needy and homeless.  Minoc is also well
known for its artisans who excel in the crafts of metalworking, armouring,
glassworking, and clock making.

Trinsic, founded on Honor
The honorable paladins who make their homes in the idyllic town of Trinsic are
noted for their courage and devotion to truth.  Situated just north of the
Cape of Heroes in the south lands, Trinsic provides many fine goods and
services to the traveller, including a stable where the finest steeds are
available to speed you along your way.

Skara Brae, founded on Spirituality
It has oft been said that Skara Brae, close by the mystic forest of
Spiritwood, is the spiritual center of Britannia.  But the word "spirit" has
many meanings, and only some of the town's inhabitants--notably the healers,
magicians, and priests--concern themselves with matters of the soul.  Others
in the area have a different meaning in mind--those inclined to take advantage
of Skara Brae's fine winery!

New Magincia, founded on Humility
Having been destroyed in ancient times for its haughty pride, New Magincia was
rebuilt by a more humble people who favored the simple ways of farming and
rural life.  With the passage of time, an industrious village has grown atop
the ruins of the old town.  Those who would revel in their own pride should
take special note of the lesson of New Magincia.

OTHER LOCATIONS OF NOTE

Buccaneer's Den
Lives there a soul who has not heard of the notorious pirates and thieves of
Buccaneer's Den?  In spite of its ill repute, many travellers have found this
island village east of Paws to be a great source of exotic goods.  The ships
that frequent its harbor bring unusual artifacts from far and wide.

Cove
Nestled in the mountains just south of Lost Lake, Cove is home to many
magicians, healers and alchemists.  One will also find there a shrine
dedicated to the Avatar's pursuit of Virtue.

Paws
This quaint coastal village lies halfway between the towns of Britain and
Trinsic, where the weary traveller can obtain food, shelther and a change of
horse.  The mysterious islands known as the Fens of the Dead can barely be
seen offshore near Paws.  In these Fens, mages ofttimes seek the rare mandrake
root and nightshade so necessary to their potent concoctions.

The Bloody Plains
Site of one of Britannia's most savage wars, this desolate region lies
sandwiched between two great swamps across the mountains northeast of the
village of Cove.  The bloodstained soil serves as a timeless memorial to the
thousands of brave soldiers who met their fate there.  Mages know this area as
another of the few paces where they can find mandrake root and nightshade.

The Isle of the Avatar
This enigma of nature rose from the sea when the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom was
brought up from the depths of the Great Stygian Abyss.  The great subterranean
upheaval that gave it birth left the large island dotted with volcanic
craters, steaming fumaroles, and a ready supply of sulfurous ash.  Few are
brave enough to risk the hazards of this place--even to behold the Codex in
the Shrine of the Avatar.

The Palace of Blackthorn
Few nowadays venture near this monument to evil, but rumors abound that the
mad wizard Sutek has taken refuge in the former abode of Blackthorn, the
defamed ally of the vanquished Shadowlords.  What Sutek might be doing there,
none can say.



THE CITIZENRY

The citizens of Britannia are a diverse people who have survived many
challenges to the rule of Order.  Their ancestry can be traced to a time
before the Sosarian city-states were formed, a time when a loose confederation
of druids and mages flourished alongside a meek but industrious agricultural
populace.  Relics of ancient times can be found throughout the land and traces
of the ancient language of the land can be found throughout modern Britannia.

In your travels you will no doubt come upon the occasional sign or placard
written in a curious runic script.  Passed down from one generation to the
next, this written runic language is directly descended from the language of
the druids of old.  Though strange and seemingly indecipherable, the process
of interpreting runic script is really quite simple.  The key (ULT6LANG.DOC)
will enable the traveller to translate runic characters into his native
tongue.

INTERACTING WITH THE CITIZENS

Whether talking to the farmer in his field or to one of the scholars at the
Lycaeum, one will be impressed with the eloquence and diversity of interests
possessed by the people of Britannia.  Their good-natured dispositions are a
result of several generations of relative peace brought about by the natural
focus on the principles of Virtue.

When meeting someone for the first time, it is customary to ask them their
name and job.  In most cases, a Britannian will be more than willing to
discuss a variety of subjects and be most eager to answer questions you may
post to him.  Do not fail to take note of the things you are told during these
coversations, for even the words of the humblest farmer or beggar may provide
needed guidance in your journey through the land.

Many Britannians will do far more than offer advice and information, however.
If asked to join your party, the more adventuresome in the realm will
accompany you on your quest.  Stalwart allies can mean the difference between
victory and defeat, so choose your party members wisely.

Merchants buy and sell a variety of goods and services, offering you the
opportunity to stock up on needed supplies or build up cash reserves.  Enter a
shop and tell the proprietor you wish to buy something and you will very
likely find the item you desire.  Offer to sell the proprietor an object in
your possession and you may find him an eager trading partner.

The commerce of the nation is a source of pride to all Britannians and a
subject worthy of detailed treatment here.

COMMERCE

A complex system of interdependency among many professions and crafts drives
all commercial activity in Britannia.  This interdependency ensures that
Britannia remains a growing nation, well supplied and prepared against times
of shortage and hardship.

Farming
Since the times before our great societal expansion, farming and animal
husbandry have been the cornerstones of the Britannian economy.  It is the
farmer who grows fine grains for the baker and the baker who makes our bread.
It is the rancher who tends the cattle for meat and dairy products, keeping
our stores and pubs filled with the necessities of life.  In like manner, the
shepherd supplies wool to the makers of cloth who, in turn, enable the
clothiers to ply their trade.  In these and many other ways, Britannian owes
its livelihood to the persistent laborers of the soil.

PROFESSIONAL MERCHANTS

The merchants of Britannia strive to provide satisfactory goods and services
to their customers.  The professional symbols emblazoned upon the signs which
hang outside their shops attest to their willingness to assist the traveller..
at least during business hours.

Armouries (Serpent)
Britannia's armouries are a key factor in the security and prosperity of the
land.  Providing both armaments for the valiant and employment for armourers
and blacksmiths, these shops offer high quality armour and weaponry of many
types.  Most armourers will gladly repurchase used equipment, though usually
at prices far lower than originally paid for them.

Stables (Horseshoe)
The seasoned traveller understands what a godsend a steed can be on lengthy
and treacherous journeys.  Stables are usually found in smaller towns and
villages, or at private residences where the owners may be willing to offer
you a fine horse at a fair price.

Markets & Pubs (Mug and Bowl)
Most of the major towns in Britannia have at least one shop dedicated to
caring for the traveller's need for food and supplies.  The wise traveller
will learn to examine the varied inventories carried by different merchants,
making note of the shopkeepers who stock rare and unusual items--one never
knows when such knowledge may be of use.  In pubs, the traveller may partake
of a refreshing glass of ale or a fine meal of pheasant and mutton.  The
service will often be accompanied by the melodies of a cheerful minstrel, and
pub owners are known for their willingness to take part in a friendly chat.

Healers (Ankh)
The vast wildernesses of Britannia, though rich in beauty, also hold hidden
dangers capable of causing travellers injury or illness.  Luckily, many towns
have professional people trained in the medicinal arts.  Healers can turn back
the ravages of swamp poison or heal wounds earn in battle.  Some physicians
claim that their healing arts have been enhanced and augmented by magic, to
the point that they can resurrect the dead!

Magic shops (Vial)
These occult apothecaries are quite interesting to visit.  Their oddly
decorated shelves are often strewn with vials of strangely colored potions,
queerly glowing staves and scepters, and a cornucopia of herbal and mineral
reagents useful in the mage's work.  since many of the items offered are both
rare and expensive, their availability will vary from town to town, so the
travelling mage will want to make special note of those things offered in the
places he visits.

Inns (Candle)
Inns provide safe, restful accomodations where travellers can retreat after a
long, hard day.  Many inns even offer fine dining facilities on-site.  Prices
will vary from place to place, but even the most inexpensive inn is a welcome
home away from home for the weary adventurer.

Shipwrights (Anchor)
Several of the port towns along the shores of Britannia boast of craftsmen
renowned for their dedication to the construction of safe, dependable sea
vessels.  Whether you need a small skiff to get upriver, or a mighty sailing
vessel for open sea travel, the local shipwrights will be more than happy to
discuss terms.  It is wise to pay attention to information about local sea and
wind conditions before setting out in a new craft.

Guilds (Key)
It is not uncommon for members of certain professions to organize themselves
into guilds which cater to the specific needs of their membership.  Such
guilds have been set up in a number of towns.  The guilds provide professional
adventurers with many of the things they need for journeys into the wilderness
and deep dungeons.

Tailors (Scissors)
Nowhere is the interdependence of Britannia's craftspeople more in evidence
that in the field of tailoring.  Thread must be spun and taken to weavers.
Weavers, having made cloth from the thread, deliver it into the hands of
clothiers.  Clothiers turn bolts of fine fabric into clothes fit for kings.
Find your place in this process and you may profit.  Seek out the tailors of
Paws if you desire a wardrobe of the highest quality.

Fletchers & Bowyers (Arrow)
Many are the fletchers and bowyers of Britannia, but none are held in higher
esteem than those of the town of Britain.  The ingenious engineering and high
quality of their arrows, bolts, bows, and crossbows is known through the land.
This is due mainly to the great skill of the master bowyer, Iolo Fitzowen,
proprietor of Iolo's Bows.  Iolo and his apprentice, Gwenneth, can be of great
assistance to archers.



THE CALL TO ADVENTURE

Adventuring in the savage lands of Britannia is no life for the timid, nor is
it a profession for those lacking resolve.  Consider carefully before taking
up the gauntlet I cast before you, for the path to your destiny is fraught
with peril and adversity.  The elite corps of stout-hearted souls who accept
my challenge must be disciplined, determined and willing to sacrifice all.
But even more, they must be devout followers of the path of virtue.  Learn now
the ways in which my chosen adventurers apply their talents to the tasks
before them.

THE WAY OF THE FIGHTER

Many celebrated fighters are trained in the art of combat at Serpent's Hold.
There are, however, a few warriors of humble origin who have not the benefit
of such training.  These acquire skills on the field of battle, earning high
acclaim for heroic deeds of valor.  The true value of a fighter is found not
in his training, but in his heart; it is exemplified not in his knowledge, but
in his accomplishments.

The fighter typically possesses great strength and endurance, complements to
his natural instincts and boundless courage.  His proficiency with many
weapons makes him a walking arsenal, ever ready for battle.  The fighter
prefers to mount his attack from the front line position, a strategy which
well serves his inclination to wield mighty bludgeoning weapons and lethal
two-handed swords.

As a novice fighter grows in experience, his strength and dexterity naturally
increase, allowing him to employ more effective combinations of weapons and
armour.  Enjoying the company of rangers and paladins, the fighter should
likewise associate himself with a mage or a bard who can supplement his great
physical attack with long range weaponry and the tools of magic.

THE WAY OF THE BARD

Poet and minstrel, tinkerer and athlete, user of magic and noble adventurer...
These all describe the multi-talented bard.  Though not as physically imposing
as the fighter, the bard is usually more dextrous and agile, being both quick
of mind and of foot.  Sure hands and nimble fingers serve the bard well as he
untagles knotty puzzles and picks "unpickable" locks.

Often an accomplished archer, the bard is also acquainted with the ways of
magic, making him a most versatile gladiator on the field of battle.  He often
chooses to aply his combative skills from the rear of the melle where he can
let his arrows and fiery magic missiles fly toward beleaguered targets in the
front.  Whether in the heat of battle or in the quagmire of a wizard's
mischievous riddle, the well-rounded bard is an indispensable ally to the
adventurer's quest.

THE WAY OF THE MAGE

All well-travelled adventurers have at one time or another been mystified by
the mages of Britannia.  Never to be forgotten is the sight of a cloaked
figure performing an odd dance in a distant clearing.  Puzzling indeed is the
whispered transaction between a mage and an apothecary as the magician
acquires the plants and animal parts that are the raw materials of his trade.

Seeing what cannot be seen, hearing what no man hears, communing with beings
not present... What ancient spirit possesses the mage that his mind constantly
dwells on things not perceived by the common man?

One never chooses to become a mage--one is born a mage, having from birth
exhibited magical inclinations and abilities which defy rational explanation.
A mage usually spends his early years studying the esoteric writings and
diagrams contained in the libraries of the Lycaeum or poring over bottles and
boxes of exotic herbs and minerals found in its laboratories.

The tools and weapons of the mage are found in his spellbook, which never
leaves his side.  This tome is filled with pages of cryptic runes which
descripbe the auspicious times, places and methods for various types of
sorcerous work.  The illusions and spells at the mage's command often cast him
in the role of equalizer when a party of adventurers finds itself in an
otherwise one-side conflict against a megalithic foe.  From a well-protected
position at the edge of the battle, the mage makes the necessary preparations
and utters the mysterious incantations to unleash the force of his chosen
spells against an unsuspecting foe.

Certain skilled mages possess remarkable power over nature and matter, being
able to create and destroy living and inanimate things at will.  The deeper
secrets of the mage will be discussed later in this treatise--such secrets are
not for the eyes of all men...

THE WAY OF THE AVATAR

Embodying the fortitude of a fighter, the quickness--and quick-wittedness--of
a bard and the mystic insights of a mage, you have spent long years mastering
the principles of virtue.  Many are the times you have savored the syllables
of the mantras and the spicey scent of incense during morning meditation.  But
you are equally stirred by the sounds and smells of combat, being as much at
hom eon the field of battle as in a solemn shrine.

A paragon of integrity, you have always south total understanding of the world
around you, often journeying to the libraries of the Lycaeum or conferring
with the scholars of Moonglow and Yew.  However, your love of scholarly
pursuits does not weaking your ties to the world outside the cloistered halls
of academe.  Your devotion to your companions and those in need is total, and
you are ever aware that the principles of virtue are designed to guide us in
our relationships with our fellow man.

Your path offers both great risk and grand reward, but you are concered with
neither.  Driven to follow this, the highest path, by forces unknown and
unknowable, you follow the Way of the Avatar to whatever end destiny has
decreed.

ADVENTURING AS A PARTY

Even the most valiant and powerful adventurer cannot stand alone against all
of the obstacles that will block his path.  Banding together with other
likehearted fellows will give you the strength of numbers, and, of equal
importance, a diversity of talents which can be drawn upon along your way.
The Avatar joined by the fighter, bard and mage makes for a most imposing and
formidable team.

Putting their trust in your wisdom and skills, party members usually move as a
group toward a common objective.  There may be times, however, when an
individual party member may set out on his own path whilst the remainder of
the party awaits his return--it is often prudent to send someone ahead to
scout a trail, for example, or to test the integrity of a decaying bridge
which hangs tenuously over a thundering river.  However, as the acknowledged
leader of the group, you may at any time summon back individuals who have set
out on their own, regrouping the party for further travel.

An adventuring party accumulates many things during its travells--things
purchased or found in the towns and countryside, and treasures collected from
the corpses of fallen foes.  Travelling is often made easier if provisions and
equipment are distributed evenly amongst the party members.  The well-
organized party works together, sharing with each other the things they carry,
aiding each other on their long journey.

GETTING AROUND IN BRITANNIA

The frequent traveller in Britannia learns to avail himself of the various
means of transport which can be obtained.  Acquiring a fine steed from the
village stables, you will soon learn that such a mount will not only improve
the quality of travel from town to town, but also give you a decided advantage
in combat against those who would impede your progress.  When a quest requires
crossing the high seas, sailing vessels of various types may be obtained from
the shipwrights that do business along the coastal ports of call.  It has even
been said that some adventuresome souls have learned a way to travel in a
craft that is lighter than the air itself, but these rumors, though
widespread, remain unconfirmed.

THE PARTY IN CONFLICT

Without fail, the travelling party will be set upon by people and creatures
whose sole purpose is to cause mayhem and sorrow.  Let the traveller beware.
When entering into mortal combat against one of the myriad creatures of the
land, learn to measure its strength and speed, nothing both its tactics and
endurance.

One creature may attempt to bludgeon you senseless, while others attack you
from afar with hurled weapons.  Many of the mythical beings you'll encounter
will use magic and illusions in their efforts to subdue you.  If you can
survive their attacks and deal punishing blows of your own in return, you will
share the victor's right to search their fallen corpses for whatever bounty
they carry.

It is useful to devise strategies that will increase the party's chances of
survival in combat.  Before combat begins, each party member can be assigned a
field position (frontal attack, flanking maneuvers or long range rear
position).  When the party comes under attack, the party members will move
automatically to their predetermined positions and fight according to the
strategy they've been assigned.

As effective as predetermined combat positions are, you may choose not to
assign each party member a particular strategy.  In this case, your allies
must act independently in combat.  Situations may even occur in which a member
of the party becomes a berserker.  When this happens, he will simply charge
and attack the most formidable opponent in sight.

A special note is in order for spellcasters.  While invoking magic spells will
give you a decided advantage in battle, not all creatures will be affected
by them in the same manner.  Therefore, you must learn to use your magical
talents judiciously, lest you waste valuable reagents and psychic energy.

THE PARTY AT REST

As a party becomes weary from the fatigue of a long journey and many battles,
it can set up camp in a safe place away from the hustle and bustle of town.
The burning campfire will take the chill out of the cool night air while the
party members eat some of the provisions they carry in their packs, perhaps
enjoying a round of storytelling or song.  With bellies full, the travellers
should take a few hours sleep to ready themselves for the challenges of a new
day.  Sleep provides an opportunity for much needed healing to the injured and
battle-weary adventurer.

It is wise to let one of the party members stand guard while the others sleep
so that he may awaken them if trouble approaches in the night.  Since the
grou's guard gets no sleep, he should be allowed to rest the following night
while another stands guard.

EXPERIENCE AND THE LEVELS OF ATTAINMENT

The much-travelled adventurer will face many opportunities to explore new
places, talk with people, solve puzzles and complete quest.  As you do these
things, experience will lead to increased physical strength, dexterity and
intelligence, giving you greater capacity to fulfill your destiny.

You can only gain a true appreciation of such increases by returning to one of
the Shrines of Virtue and engaging in reflection and meditation.  To meditate,
learn the mantra of the shrine of your choice.  Then talk to the shrine and
follow its instructions.



COSMOLOGY

There exists an extraordinary cosmic association between the gravity of the
moons and the delicate fabric of time and space.  As though pulling the
strings of some cosmic marionette, the moons cause radiant moongates to appear
on the land below.  Step through one of these shimmering corridors of light
and you will be transported to a new time or place.  Moongates generaly appear
at locations where fragments of extraterrestrial rocks called "moonstones"
have been buried.  There are at least two types of moongates--blue and red.

Blue moongates, generated by moonstones, generally focus on destinations in
but a single world--the world in which they appear.

Their power, awesome though it may seem, is limited, allowing the traveller to
teleport only from the location of one moonstone to that of another.  The
moonstone the user travels to is determined by the phase of the moon that
appears directly overhead in the sky.  Through experimentation and
observation, the moongate trveller can correlate the phases of the highest
moon with the destination the gate will select.

Red gates, generated by the powerful obsidian Orb of the Moons, can send the
traveller anywhere in Britannia.  In fact, the holder of this black stone can
teleport to worlds other than his own.  I, Lord British, have used the red
gates often, but there is, no doubt, much more to be learned about these
gates.

LAST WORDS

Consider carefully the thoughts I have set down in this treatise.  Refer back
to these words often, that you may better understand your experiences as you
journey throughout the land.

You are advised to keep a personal journal of your experiences.  Make notes of
conversations with the good citizens of Britannia.  Record information found
on signs or read in books or scrolls.  Keep track of the location of
provisions--items that seem unnecessary at one time may become useful at
another.  They may hold information vital to your quest.

Finally, I must share with you news but recenty received from the scholars of
the Lycaeum.  In compiling information about the daemonic Gargoyles invading
our land they have begun to detect a pattern.  It appears that our foes are
trying to capture the Shrines of Virtue found near the major towns.  The
moonstones are now in their possession, and, as each new shrine falls, a stone
is placed on the altar there.  To prevent anyone from removing the stones, the
gargoyles have erected impenetrable force fields around the altars.  Go to the
shrines at your earliest opportunity, free them and seek guidance at the
altars through prayer and meditation.

I urge you, my Avatar, to uncover the dark purposes of the gargoyles before
the last shrine falls.  I fear you may be Britannia's last hope.

THE SECRET KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAGE

Powerful as the alien moongates are, they are by no means the only forms of
magic you will encounter in Britannia.  The mages of this land possess much
aracane knowledge and have many abilities beyond those of common fok.  Using
keen intuition, endless experimentation and the rigorous study of ancient
tomes, amges have learned to harness the creative and destructve forces of
Nature.

The mage's principle tool is his spellbook, a collection of incantations and
alchemical formulae which empower him in marvelous and often unexpected ways.
Learn now the inner secrets of spellcasting, information reserved for the
elite society of sorcerors.

THE ARCANE ART OF SPELLCASTING

Magical energy is structured as eight concentric spheres, each composed of
networks of light connected to he physical plane by unseen bonds.  The
spellcaster stands within the center sphere, extending his hands to the outer
shells of light where he manipulates the energies to suit his pleasure.  In
one hand, he holds his spellbook, open to the page containing the description
of his chosen incantation.  In his other hand, he cluthes a vial containing
herb and mineral reagents, the mixture serving as the catalyst for his spell.
Thus prepared, he utters the incantation, fusing matter and energy into a
display of power.  The spell has been cast, leaving the caster drained in
spirit, but fulfilled in accomplishment.

This simple explanation fails to exphasize botht he risks involved in
spellcasting and the skill necessary to harness the forces of magic
successfully.  Two cautionary notes are in order here:

First, even though a spell may appear to be cast successfully, there is some
chance that it will not accomplish its intended purpose, or that it will do so
in only a partial manner.  In some cases, a spell will fail to hit its target
due to forces and ethereal eddies unseen by the human eye.  Also, certain
creatures are immune to some spells, requiring the spellcaster to find other
means to defeat them.

Second, some spells affect only one person or creature while others affect all
peole or creatures in the vicinity.  Take care when casting a spell which acts
on an area rather than an individual target--if you or your friends are in the
affected area, you will be touched by the spell's power as surely as your
inteded victim!

THE ALCHEMY OF SPELLCASTING

The prepartion of a spell's reagents is performed at the moment of
spellcasting, thus allowing the chemical reactions to reach their peak even as
the appropriate mantra is uttered.  Some reagents are relatively common herbs
and minerals, available at any magic shop.  Others must be sought after
diligently, often requiring the mage to travel to distant and inhospitable
places in search of an obscure fungus or root.

These are the reagents necessary to the casting o magic:

Black Pearl
One oyster in ten thousand will yield a black pearl suitable for spellcasting
purposes.  It is usually crushed to a fine, iridescent powder before being
combined with other reagents.  The black pearl is used as a kinetic
propellent.

Blood Moss
"Moss," is may be called, but blood moss is, in reality, a fungus gathered in
the enchanted forest of Spiritwood.  There it is found growing under the
loose, dead bark of fallen trees.  Blood moss is used to enhance mobility and
movement.

Garlic
This common household spice is effective in warding off evil spirits and
negating black magic.  Preparations for use generally involve grinding the
washed cloves of garlic between two flatirons until they are reduced to a
pungent paste.

Ginseng
The wizened physicians of ancient Sosaria wrote often of the curative powers
of this bitter root.  Prepare a syrupy, pure extract by reboiling forty times
with clear mountain water, letting the mixture develop a strong, acrid odor.

Mandrake Root
The most sought after herb of the spellcaster, mandrake root grows along the
loamy banks of stagnant swamps.  Once found, mandrake must be dug up carefully
so as not to damage the tap root, for it is in the root that the greatest
concentration of active ingredients is found.  Carefully remove the tough,
outer skin, again giving special attention to the sensitive tap root.  Using a
fine-toothed silver fork, comb out the cottonlike fibers that make up the
root's heart.  The combed matting is boiled in pure water for no more than one
hour, after which is it dried thoroughly and stored in a tightly sealed jar.
When used in a spell, mandrake root increases the power of the desired
enchantment.

Nightshade
This hallucinogenic mushroom is often the critical ingredient in spells that
create illusions or poisonous effects.  Sprouting in swamps, and only in the
dark of night, this mushroom is easily distinguished from the others by the
way its stalk bruises when crushed.  Retain only the fungal cap and discard
the tough stalk.  The spores housed in the underside of the cap provide the
active ingredient and can be chopped into a fine mincemeat or boiled into a
bitter tea.

Spider's Silk
It takes many spider webs to make a full ounce of spider's silk, but the
binding power it adds to spells makes the effort well worthwhile.  Though the
web of any spider will do, one can reduce collecting time by scraping off the
fine silken hairs that cover the webs of giant spiders.  Rumors have been
heard of a cave where spider silk can be found in abundance.

Sulfurous Ash
This product of violent volcanic eruptions, sulfurous ash adds high levels of
energy to the spells which require it.  It is recommended that freshly
collected ash be sifted through a fine mesh sieve, ensuring consistency and
easy mixing.

LINGUA MAGICA:  THE SPELLCASTER'S WORDS OF POWER

The meanings of the syllables that form the incantations uttered by mages durin
spellcasting have been passed down from one Britannian generation to the next.
The mage's apprenticeship begins when he learns these potent syllables.  The
next task is to learn the proper way to speak the syllables.

It is important that the mage first prepare himself mentally by meditating on
the sound of his breathing, projecting his soul into a sublime state of
concentration.  To speak an incantation properly, the spellcaster draws a deep
breath, followed by a determined, forceful enunciation of each syllable.  The
entire breath should be fully expelled on the speaking of the final syllable.

The 26 syllables and their general meanings are as follows:

Syllable               Meaning      Syllable               Meaning
An ............. Negate/Dispel      Nox ................... Poison
Bet .................... Small      Ort .................... Magic
Corp ................... Death      Port ........... Move/Movement
Des ............... Lower/Down      Quas ................ Illusion
Ex ................... Freedom      Rel ................... Change
Flam ................... Flame      Sanct ..... Protect/Protection
Grav ............ Energy/Field      Tym ..................... Time
Hur ..................... Wind      Uus ................. Raise/Up
In ......... Make/Create/Cause      Vas .................... Great
Jux ......... Danger/Trap/Harm      Wis ........... Know/Knowledge
Kal ............ Summon/Invoke      Xen ................. Creature
Lor .................... Light      Ylem .................. Matter
Mani ............ Life/Healing      Zu ..................... Sleep

These syllables are combined to form the incantations used when casting
spells.  A list of spells can be found in the file ULT6SPLS.DOC.  This list,
while not necessarily complete, collects all of our current knowledge of the
ways of magic.

Mages with little training and experience are limited in the spells they can
cast.  As a spellcaster grows in stature, penetrating the mysteries of the
higher circles of magic, he gains the ability to cast more powerful spells.
Great power is not without cost, however.  When he casts a spell, the mage
experiences a drain in magical power equal to the level of the circle of that
spell.  Thus, a simple first level spell drains one point while a fifth level
spell, more difficult to cast, drains five.  The caster's magical power
returns within a few hours.

THE IMPLEMENTS OF BATTLE

No brave adventurer, knight or common traveller should venture into the
hostile regions of Britannia without an appropriate selection of armour and
weponas.  Whenever possible, wear strong armour, a helm and shield, magical
rings, tunics or amulets, and, of course, carry an effective weapon.

BODY ARMOUR

Foolish is the adventurer who embarks on a quest without the best armour he
can afford.  Several different types of armour are available--everything from
inexpensive and relatively ineffective cloth to costly but highly protective
plate.  The armourers of Britannia will gladly allow you to examine their
wares.  Take advantage of this and acquire the armour best suited to your
abilities and fighting style.

Helms
An unprotected head is sure to be the target of any shrewd opponent's sword.
Helms are available in a variety of leather and metal forms, and one should be
worn at all times when combat seems likely.

Shields
Unless wielding a heavy, two-handed weapon, the warrior should carry a shield
with which to parry and block his opponent's attacks.  Shields are constructed
of wood or metal and vary greatly in shape and weight.

WEAPONS

The variety of types and uses of weapons exceeds full explanation in this
treatise.  Still, the proper choice of weapons is the single most important
decision a warrior makes before setting out to do battle.  In all cases, as
your finances and opportunities allow, choose weapons which deliver the most
powerful damage at the greatest range.

Daggers
Useful for stabbing and cutting in close-quarter fighting and for throwing in
long range combat, the dagger is a most convenient and lightweight weapon to
keep on hand.

Main gauche
Similar to a dagger, the main gauche also sports defensive hand protectors
that can be used to parry an opponent's attack.  Unlike a dagger, a main
gauche cannot be thrown.

Swords
The warrior's chief weapon, swords come in two varieties:  short swords, and
two-handed swords.  Despite their name, short swords are formidable weapons--a
good thing, for only the strongest adventurers can wield the hefty two-handed
swords.  Always examine a sword closely before buying it, paying particular
attention to its weight and the force with which it will deliver a blow.

Missile weapons
A complete battle strategy must include the use of weapons which can be shot,
thrown or hurled from a great distance toward advancing opponents.
Lightweight, hand-held items such as daggers, spears, axes or flasks of
flaming oil can be most effective in times of need.  Bows and crossbows are
capable of firing with tremendous force, but they require the use of both
hands and cannot be used effectively at point blank range.  Some clever
travellers have even been known to carry slings so they can drive off
aggressors with hurled stones.

Bludgeoning weapons
While the effectiveness of cutting and thrown weapons is determined by the
dexterity of the user, bludgeoning weapons, like clubs, depend upon the
strength of the wielder.  The mace is favored by many knights, whereas the
two-handed hammer has been used by the mightiest of warriors to deal a
crushing blow to the foe.

Polearms
A polearm is generally a stout wodden or metal staff topped by a metal cutting
or bludgeoning fixture.  The morning-star, a variation on this theme, consists
of a staff with a chain attached to one end, and attached to the chain, a
heavy, spiked bludgeon.  Morningstars, halbers and other polearms are prized
for the damage they are capable of doing and for their long reach.
Unfortunately, polearms are unwieldy weapons which are most effective in the
hands of a user possessed of great strength and dexterity.



A BESTIARY

Numerous and diverse are the beasts that inhabit the plains, forests,
waterways, and dungeons of Britannia.  Attempts to catalog them all have met
with only limited success--such an endeavor requires the researcher to put his
life in grave peril in order to make his observations.  Therefore, much of
what follows is information collected from first hand accounts of travellers
and adventurers who have managed to return with their tales.

Acid Slug:  Though seldom encountered except in the darkest corners of the
dampest caves, this featureless creature will secrete its corrosive juices on
anything you possess that is metal, thus dissolving it.  Painful but
superficial skin burns may result from contact with the acid while it eats
away at your armour.  Conventional weapons have little effect on the monster,
whereas a flame will send it fleeing.

Alligator:  Care must be taken whilst wading in the murky swamps which are the
home of this aggressive man-eater.  Possessiong great physical strength, this
fearsome lizard can inflict heavy damage with a single blow from its mighty
tail.

Ant, giant:  The shifting desert sands conceal these warrior insects all too
effectively.  Beware their powerful mandibles, capable of crushing a man in an
instant.

Bat, giant:  Equipped with keen hearing and night vision, these large, winged
rodents are swift and efficient in their nocturnal attacks.  Though difficult
to hit, their fur-covered bodies are extremely vunerable to damage.

Bird:  Generally posing no serious problem to the traveller, these swift,
delicate creatures can peck annoyingly about the head if they are disturbed or
threatened.

Cat:  Among the most common of domesticated beasts, the cat is often found
prowling about alleys and storefronts, looking for bits of food or hapless
mice.

Corpser:  Found only in deep, labyrinthine caverns, these hellish, tentacled
ghouls drag their screaming victims into subterranean dens.  What fearful end
awaits the poor captive none can say.  Only a burning flame has been known to
have any effect on these creatures of the dark.

Cow:  A fine source of meat and dairy products, the complacent cow is a common
sight on most farms.

Cyclops:  This hulking, one-eyed titan fears no one.  Possessed of remarkable
strength, it wields a mighty oaken club when it isn't hurling large boulders
as its foes.  The earth trembles as this giant lumbers about its domain, or so
say those who claim to have survived an encounter with a cyclops.

Daemon:  This most wicked and formidable of foes is not to be underestimated.
Overwhelming strength, skill and intelligence make daemons nearly unbeatable.
Possessing magical powers rivaling the most powerful of mages, the daemon can
summon hordes of his brothers to assist him in killing or possessing his
victims.  Being already undead, the daemon has little fear of death.  You are
forewarned!

Deer:  These graceful athletes of the forest can be spotted dashing through
the shadows on sunlit afternoons.  Deer are a good source of food, but be
aware that the antlers they sport can do significant damage.

Dog:  Though related to the vicious wolf, the common dog poses far less of a
threat than his wild counterpart.  As much at home in the field hunting
rabbits as at the dinner table of its master, the dog should be respected, but
not feared.

Dragon:  How many myths have been built around this winged, fire-breathing
holdover from Britannia's distant past?  Even the strongest warrior has been
known to wilt under the intense magical flames and noxious fumes that pour
from the enraged beast's nostrils.  Though mortal, dragons are extremely
difficult to kill.  It is, therefore, a wonder that some bold souls have
actually managed to steal eggs from a dragon's nest to satisfy the culinary
delights of wealty town dwellers!

Drake:  Smaller than their cousins, the dragons, but no less ferocious in
battle, drakes are usually found in the company of their more formidable
relatives.  In a battle against a dragon, one must be ever mindful of the
deadly drakes.

Gargoyles:  Frequently confused with daemons, the gargoyles are a little
understood race of beings.  Only fragments of information have made their way
back from expeditions to the underworld habitat of these creatures.  We do
know that there are two classes of gargoyles--a dominant, winged variety and
smaller, wingless drones.  The larger gargoyle is a daunting opponent,
possessing very high intelligence and impressive magical powers.  But, the
smaller drones are not to be ignored, for their attack is deadly, despite
their apparent lack of magical ability.  Scholars at the Lycaeum are
feverishly analyzing all incoming information regarding these perplexing
creatures.

Gazer:
How this monstrosity evolved is anybody's guess, for gazers are among the most
unusual creatures found in the realm.  They are usually spotted hovering above
the ground in dungeons, searching for creatures they can mesmerize with their
multiple eyes.  One experienced adventurer claims that gazers emit a strange
buzzing sound as they move about.  Remain alert when you suspect the presence
of a gazer, as it is constantly on the alert for prey.

Ghost:  Ghosts are generally found in cemeteries and other places of the dead,
though their movements are all but unlimited.  These ethereal spirits pass
easily through solid walls and other obstacles, making them difficult to chase
and difficult to elude.  Though they do not possess great strength, their
mobility and ability to use magic make them a force to be reckoned with.

Gremlin:  Unimpressive in battle, gremlins usually roam in packs and will
attempt to overcome you through sheer force of numbers.  Given the chance,
these persistent creatures will take whatever food you are carrying in your
pack, distributing it amongst themselves in a frenzy of feeding.

Headless:  The product of a wizard's failed experiments, these wretched
creatures somehow manage to sense the location of their quarry and strike with
unnatural accuracy.  Do not fall prey to pity, for a headless would as soon
strangle you with its bare hands as accept your mercy.

Horse:  Being both strong and swift, these companions of the trail are
invaluable when time is of the essence and one's strength is at an end.  The
traveller should obtain a steed early in his adventuring.  Occasionally, you
may spy a majestic wild stallin roaming the broad plains, but catching and
taming it is another thing.

Hydra:  The putrid quagmire of the swamp is the spawning ground of this
botanical nightmare.  Survivors of the Great Battle on the Bloody Plains tell
of driving the enemy into the adjacent swamplands where the carnivorous hydras
completed their mission of destruction.  While fearsome, hydras also bring
good luck, of a sort--when one finds a hydra, the valued nightshade mushroom
can usually be found close by.

Insects:  These pesky, flying nuisances can be quite bothersome if stirred up
by the careless explorer.  A single buzzing swamp fly can be annoying; a
biting swarm can leave the traveller depleted and exhausted.

Mimic:  Disguised as abandoned treasure chests, these masters of illusion wait
patiently for passing adventurers whose greed exceeds their wisdom.  if you
take a moment to observe questionable chests from a safe distance, the mimic
may reveal its true nature by spitting venom in your direction.

Mongbat:  Resembling a monkey as much as a bat, these winged anomalies are
swift and powerful in their attacks.  Though seldom encountered except in the
deepest dungeons, encountering one in the dim subterranean light can unnerve
even the stoutest among you.

Mouse:  This timid rodent seldom ventures from its lair except under cover of
night, and then only in search of crumbs of food.  Cheesemakers are especially
wary of the nocturnal activities of these otherwise benign creatures.

Rabbit:  Though quite shy and non-threatening, these long-eared creatures are
the bane of farmers, whose crops attract them in hordes.

Rat, giant:  These voracious, overgrown rodents have evolved over the
centuries in the dank, inhospitable sewers that honeycomb the levels below
some castles.  Having grown immune to most poisons, they are difficult to
exterminate.  Even a single bite from one of these giants can cause disease or
plague.

Reaper:  A remnant of an ancient enchanted forest swallowed up long ago in a
cataclysmic upheaval, the reaper at first appears as a solitary tree trunk
rooted in the dungeon rock.  Closer examination reveals a grim intelligence
which lashes out with long, gnarled branches and magical bolts of destruction.
But, the resourceful adventurer can turn the threat of the reaper into the
evening's campfire, ofttimes uncovering hidden treasure in the process.

Rotworms:  Born of the decaying detritus which carpets the swamplands, these
loathsome invertebrates are more nuisance than threat--a pass of your torch
across their path will usually keep them at bay.

Scorpion, giant:  Is there anyone who has not flinched at the sight of an
angered scorpion, its stinger poised to inject its victim with deadly venom?
You are advised to keep moving when confronted by one of these armoured
nightmares, lest you perish where you stand.

Sea Serpent:  Like its land-bound cousin, the dragon, a sea serpent will
attack the seagoing traveller with magical fireballs and violent physical
swipes of its long tail.  The wise sailor avoids this nasty beast.

Sheep:  Among the most docile of the beasts of the field, flocks of these
highly beneficial creatures serve the common good by providing wool to the
garment- and rug-makers and fine mutton to the pubs.

Silver Serpent:  Since the days of ancient Sosaria, the silver serpent has
been a part of our lives.  Its form has been found etched on tomb walls, and
ancient monuments have been found which were crafts in its image.  Yet, a
recent scouting brigade claims to have seen a dead silver serpent of
incredible size near a gargoyle encampment.  The scouts observed for a time
and, upon their return, reported that the gargoyles milked the slain creature
of its venom and even ingested the fluid thus derived before entering battle.
This ritual act seemed to give the gargoyles a short-term increase in
aggression and strength, though causing their death in the end.  Whether the
drinking of venom actually increased the gargoyles' strength is currently the
subject of some debate at the Lycaeum.

Skeleton:  The expressionless, hollowed eyes of the skeleton belie the malice
that animates this otherwise lifeless latticework of bone and sinew.  Conjured
up by the malcontented mages bent on mischief, these creatures--the restless
remains of fallen warriors--are both fearless and tireless in battle.

Slime:  This shimmering, amorphous mass seems more an oddity than a threat
when first encountered.  Constantly dividing and recombining, it seeks to
surroung the traveller who happens upon its swamp or dungeon lair.  Though
susceptible to damage from ordinary weapons, the experienced adventurer is
always ready to use fire against the ooze's subtle maneuvers.

Snake:  Emerging from their rocky lairs at the first morning light, these
reptiles spend their days basking in the sun, warming their cold-blooded
bodies so they can strike swiftly at their unsuspecting prey.  They can even
spit poisonous venom from several yards away with accuracy that is both
horrifying and deadly.

Spider, giant:  Though they spin their lethal webs deep inside dark lairs,
spiders of this gargantuan variety often venture forth in search of prey.
They are capable of inflicting painful bites or spitting their toxic sputum
from great distances.  But they are not invincible, and can be killed with a
few well-placed blows.

Squid, giant:  The dreaded scourge of all mariners, this horror of the high
seas is legendary for its ability to destroy a large sailing vessel with its
dextrous tentacles and crushing beak.  It being exceedingly strong and
durable, one should avoid confrontations with this nemesis of the deep.

Tangle Vine:  Though this plant resembles a common hedge of briars and
thistles, wary adventurers take care to avoid tangle vines.  The sharp thorns
that adorn this creeping foliage radiate from a well-protected central flower
pod.  As if the swiftly growing limbs weren't threat enough, the flower pod
gives off a sleep-inducing fragrance whenever it is threatened.

Troll:  The brutish troll takes perverted pleasure in hiding beneath bridges
so it can terrorize the unsuspecting traveller.  Fortunately, trolls are
relatively weak and they lack endurance, so they pose only a moderate threat
when encountered.

Wisp:  Often mistaken for harmless, forest firefly, the nocturnal wisp can
both mystify and antagonize the adventurer.  Though only causing minor harm in
any single attack, its uncanny ability to dance about the field of battle,
striking at will, can lead to serious cumulative injury.

Wolf:  Both revered and feared, this canine lord stalks the high plains and
forest alike on its quest for survival.  Never, ever, put this wary beast in a
threatening situation!  Its bite is far worse than its mournful howl.
