FIRST HIGH REGARDS GOTO -RYGAR-FOXY-UNDERTAKER-FOR THEIR COOL DOX...

NEXT I HAVE TYPED IN ALL (WHAT I THINK) ARE THE DOX NEEDED TO PLAY THIS
GAME..SO HOPE THEY ARE OF USE TO YOU GUYS..AND REMEMBER IF YOU THINK THIS GAME
IS COOL ENOUGH TO PLAY -BUY THE ORIGINAL-


THE MASTER CONTROL PANEL.
-------------------------

THE MASTER CONTROLS PANEL IS NOT THE BRAINS,NOR IS IT THE HEART OF UMS
II,RATHER, AS THE NAME IMPLIES, IT IS THE PLACE WHERE A MYRIAD OF VARIATIONS
MAY BE ADJUSTED,MODIFIED AND TWEAKED SO THAT THE SIMULATION MAY BE TAILORED TO
BE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE, FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE USER WOULD LIKE TO SIMULATE AN
ESPICIALLY RAINY MONSOON SEASON,OR ACCELERATE THE RATE OF SCURVY(ATTRITION)
AMONG SAILORS,THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PLACE TO DO IT.

.MCP FILES
----------

ALL OF THE SETTINGS OF THE MASTER CONTROL PANEL CAN BE SAVED AND RE-LOADED AT A
LATER TIME,THESE FILES,WHICH END WITH THE .MCP FILE EXTENSION,CAN BE SAVED OR
LOADED FROM THE `MODIFY` MENU(SEE CHAPTER 2 DETAILS) WHEN A SCENARIO IS FIRST
LOADED,THE PROGRAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY LOOK FOR ,MCP FILE OF THE SAME NAME.-FOR
EXAMPLE- IF THE SCENARIO ABCDEF.DAT IS LOADED,THE PROGRAM WILL ATTEMPT TO LOAD
THE CORRESPONDING .MCP FILE -ABCDEF.MCP-ALSO SAVED IN THE .MCP FILES ARE
VARIOUS USER PREFERENCES,SUCH AS DISPLAYING THE TEMPERATURE IN CENTIGRADE OR
FAHRENHEIT,DISTANCES IN MILES OR KILOMETRES AND THE USERS NAME FOR THE 4
VIEWING LEVELS.

THE MASTER CONTROL PANEL INTERFACE.
-----------------------------------

TO ACCESS THE MASTER CONTROL PANEL SELECT -MASTER CONTROL PANEL- FROM THE
-MODIFY MENU-(SEE CHAPTER 2). THE MASTER CONTROL PANEL CONSISTS OF 4 GROUPS OF
BUTTONS. CLICKING THE MOUSE ON ANY OF THE TOP ROW OF BUTTONS (EXCEPT EXIT) WILL
CHANGE THE LABELS OF THE 3 OTHER GROUPS OF BUTTONS. CLICKING THE MOUSE ON THE
2ND ROW OF BUTTONS WILL CHANGE THE LABELS OF THE 2 REMAINING GROUPS OF
BUTTONS.CLICKING THE MOUSE ON THE LEFT SET OF BUTTONS WILL CHANGE THE LABELS ON
THE RIGHT GROUP OF BUTTONS,AND ONLY THE RIGHT GROUP,CONTAINS VALUES THAT THE
USER MAY CHANGE. THIS METHOD OFMENU SELECTION REPLACES HUNDREDS OF DIALOG
BOXES.

CHANGING BUTTON VALES (ATARI ST/AMIGA) -(DIDNT PUT IN MAC OR IBM VAL)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

TO CHANGE A VALUE DISPLAYED ON A BUTTON FROM THE RIGHT HAND GROUP ON THE
ST/AMIGA -CLICK ON THE BUTTON UNTIL IT IS HIGHLIGHTED- THEN PRESS THE LEFT HAND
MOUSE BUTTON..(FROM NOW ON SHOWN AS -LMB- OR -RMB-) TO DECREASE THE VALUE OR
THE RMB TO INCREASE THE VALUE.EVERY VALUE IN THE MASTER CONTROL PANEL HAS A
MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUE. THE VALUE STOPS WHEN IT HAS BEEN REACHED.

THE MASTER CONTROL BUTTONS.
---------------------------

THE MASTER CONTROL PANEL (NOW SHOWN AS MCP) IS SET UP IN A TREE STRUCTURE.THIS
IS TO SAY THAT CHANGING THE SELECTED TOP BUTTON WILL CAUSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO
APPEAR IN THE SUBORDINATE GROUPS OF BUTTONS.

THE CHART BEGINNING DESCRIBES THE LOCATION OF ALL BUTTONS ON THE -MCP- AND
INCLUDES A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIABLE STORED....

GROUND MOVEMENT.
----------------
GROUND UNITS MAY BE ASSIGNED A MOVEMENT ORDER AND A DEFENSIVE ORDER AS WELL AS
UP TO 7 WAYPOINTS. THE MOVEMENT ORDER ORDER,EITHER MARCH-FORCED MARCH-ATTACK-OR
ASSAULT INDICATES THE FORMATION THAT THE GROUND UNIT WILL ASSUME WHEN MOVING
FROM ONE POINT ON THE MAP TO ANOTHER. WHEN THE UNIT HAS REACHED ITS
OBJECTIVE(THE LAST ASSIGNED WAYPOINT) OR THE UNIT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO IT BY
THE DEFENSIVE ORDER.

ONLY THE ORDERS THAT A UNIT HAS SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES TO CARRY OUT WILL BE
ACTIVE.EACH ORDER COSTS A SET NUMBER OF SUPPLY POINTS PER STRENGTH POINT.THE
COST,IN SUPPLY POINTS,FOR EACH ORDER CAN BE SET BY THE USER IN THE ORDERS COST
AND EFFECT. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COST OF A GROUND UNIT ASSUMING -ASSAULT-
FORMATION IS 3 SUPPLY POINTS, AND THE UNIT HAS 4 STRENGTH POINTS, IT IS
NECESSARY FOR THE UNIT TO HAVE AT LEAST 12 SUPPLY POINTS TO BE ISSUED THIS
COMMAND. THESE CALCULATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT BY THE COMPUTER BEFORE THIS DIALOG
BOX IS PRESENTED AND ILLEGAL ORDERS WILL NOT BE SELECTABLE.

SETTING WAYPOINTS
-----------------
AFTER A UNIT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED A MOVEMENT ORDER(IT IS NOT NECCESSARY FOR A UNIT
TO BE ASSIGNED A DEFENSIVE ORDER;A UNIT NOT ASSIGNED A DEFENSIVE ORDER WILL
DEFAULT TO SCREEN) AND CONTINUE HAS BEEN SELECTED THE CURSOR WILL TURN FROM AN
ARROW TO A SOLID BLACK CROSS HAIR. A LINE WILL EXTEND FROM THE UPPER LEFT HAND
CORNER OF THE UNIT TO THE CURSOR. POSITION THE CURSOR ON THE DESIRED WAYPOINT
AND PRESS THE LMB TO SET A WAYPOINT. PRESS THE RMB TO END SETTING WAY-POINTS
. THE USER IS NOT ALLOWED TO SELECT AN ILLEGAL WAYPOINT. TO DETERMINE THE
ACTUAL ROUTE THAT A UNIT WILL TRAVEL FROM WAYPOINT TO THE NEXT,DEPRESS -ALT-
KEY. THE ROUTE WILL APPEAR AS A SERIES OF DARKENED AND FLASHING BOXES.THIS IS
HANDY METHOD FOR DETERMING LEGAL MOVES ACROSS RIVERS.

(ILLEGAL WAYPOINTS)- GROUND UNITS MAY NOT TRAVEL ACROSS COASTAL SEA,SHALLOW SEA
O DEEP SEA MAP SQUARES(EXCEPT WHEN BEING TRANSPORTED BY NAVAL UNITS) GROUND
UNITS MAY NOT CROSS RIVERS OR CANALS EXCEPT IN MAP SQUARES THAT ALSO CONTAIN
EITHER A -TRACK-PATH-RAILROAD-OR HIGHWAY.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEATHER.
--------
WEARE CONCERNED ABOUT WEATHER PRIMARILY FOR 2 REASONS; 1- HOW WEATHER EFFECTS
MOVEMENT OF UNITS; 2- HOW WEATHER CONTRIBUTES TO ATTRITION OR THE LOSS OF A
UNITS STRENGTH.
RAIN-SNOW-WINDS-STORM FRONTS AND TEMPERTURES DO NOT JUST HAPPEN, RATHER THEY
ARE GENERATED DYNAMICALLY FOLLOWING A DETAILED SET OF RULES.AND, LIKE ALL
IMPORTANT FACTORS IN A SIMULATION, THE USER MAY ADJUST THE VARIABLES AND CHANGE
THE OUTCOME.

PRESSURE ZONES.
---------------
NOTE A LETTER `L` CIRCLED MEANS A -LOW  PRESSURE ZONE-
............. `H` ............... -HIGH PRESSURE ZONE-

THE FIRST FACTOR IN ALL WEATHER CALCULATIONS IS THE LOCATION OF THE HIGH
PRESSURE AND LOW PRESSURE ZONES. WHEN A SCENARIO IS FIRST CREATED HIGH PRESSURE
AND LOW PRESSURE ZONES ARE PLACED ON THE MAP IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO PLACING
UNITS. AS SIMULATED TIME ELAPSES THESE PRESSURE ZONES MOVE ABOUT THE GLOBE. AS
THESE PRESSURE ZONES MOVE THEY CREATE AND MODIFY STORM FRONTS AND WIND
PATTERNS.
PRESSURE ZONES MOVE IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION F THE PREVAILING WINDS OF THE
LOGTITUDE OF WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY LOCATED. THE PREVAILING WINDS MAY BE SET
IN 20 DEGREES LONGTITUDIAL BANDS USING THE MASTER CONTROL PANEL(MCP) FOR
EXAMPLE, IF THE PREVAILING WINDS FOR 30 DEGREES NORTH TO 50 DEGREES NORTH HAVE
BEEN SET TO `EAST TO WEST`, THEN A PRESSURE ZONE LOCATED 37 DEGREES NORTH NORTH
WILL MOVE IN WESTERLY DIRECTION. USING THE MCP THE USER MAY REVERSE THE
PREVAILING WINDS AT THESE LONGTITUDES AND THE SAME PRESSURE ZONE WOULD NOW MOVE
IN THE OPPOSITE,OR EASTERLY DIRECTION. IN ADDITION,WIND PATTERNS MAY BE SENT
AUTOMATICALLY REVERSE WITH THE CHANGE OF SEASONS.
FURTHERMORE,THE DIRECTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF PRESSURE ZONES IS AFFECTED BY THE
LOCATION OF OTHER NEARBY PRESSURE ZONES.HIGH PRESSURE ZONES MOVE TOWARDS LOW
PRESSURE ZONES.

WIND DIRECTION OBVIOUSLY AFFECTS THE MOVEMENT OF SAIL POWERED NAVAL UNITS(HOW
THE WIND EFFECTS THESE UNITS IS ADJUSTABLE VIA THE MCP)THE 2 FORCES THAT,IN
TURN,EFFECT WIND DIRECTION ARE; 1-THE LOCATION AND PROXIMITY OF PRESSURE
ZONES...AND 2- THE PREVAILING WIND PATTERNS AT A SPECIFIC LONGTITUDE.
IF THERE ARE NO PRESSURE ZONES, WIND WOULD MOVE IN STRAIGHT EAST TO WEST,OR
WEST TO EAST LINES. IT IS THE LOCATION AND TYPE, OF PRESSURE ZONES THAT CHANGE
WIND PATTERNS.

PRESSURE CAUSE WIND PATTERNS TO BE SHAPED INTO A SPIRAL,,OR CORIOLIS EFFECT
SHAPES,ABOVE THE EQUATOR,HIGH PRESSURE ZONES CAUSE A CLOCKWISE EFFECT AND LOW
PRESSURE ZONES CAUSE A COUNTER-CLOCKWISE EFFECT. THESE PATTERNS ARE REVERSED
BELOW THE EQUATOR.

THE RANGE OR DISTANCE WHICH PRESSURE ZONES EFFECT PREVAILING WIND PATTERNS(AS
WELL AS STORM FRONTS)MAY E ADJUSTED VIA THE MCP. THIS IS DONE BY CHANGING THE
VALUE FOR THE VARIABLE `SIZE OF PRESSURE ZONE MATRIX SQUARES` THIS NUMBER
ADJUSTS THE SIZE,IN KILOMETERS,OF THE SQUARES THAT COMPRIMISE THE PRESSURE ZONE
MATRIX. APRESSURE ZONE MATRIX IS SET TO 5 SQUARE 2 DIMENSIONAL ARRAY.FOR
EXAMPLE, IF THE VARIABLE IS SET TO 100 KILOMETERS THEN A PRESSURE ZONES RADIUS
OF EFFECT WOULD BE 250 KILOMETERS(A DIAMETER OF 500 KILOMETERS CENTRED ON THE
LOCATION OF THE PRESSURE ZONE).

4 FACTORS EFFECT THE TEMPERATURE OF A SPECIFIC LOCATION; 1- THE LONGTITUDE OF
THE LOCATION..2- THE GENERAL CLIMATE GROUP OF THE LOCATION..3-THE CURRENT
SEASON..AND 4- IF THE LOCATION IS OVER SEA OR LAND.

THE GLOBE IS DIVIDED IN LATITUDINAL TEMPERATURE ZONES OF 20 DEGREES EACH,THE
AVERAGE OR THE BASE TEMPERATURE FOR EACH OF THE ZONES MAY BE SET VIA THE MCP.
THIS BASE TEMPERATURE IS THEN CHANGED BY THE USER VIA THE MCP AS WELL.THESE
MODIFYING CLIMATE TEMPERATURE MAY BE EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE NUMBERS,FOR
EXAMPLE, IF THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE AT A CERTAIN LOCATION IS 60 DEGREES
FAHRENHEIT,THE LOCAL CLIMATE IS MEDITERRANAEN, AND THE CLIMATE MODIFIER FOR
MEDITERRANEAN IS +7 THEN THE RESULT WOULD BE 67 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

THIS NUMBER IS FURTHER MODIFIED BY THE SEASONAL DIFFERENCE. LIKE THE CLIMATE
MODIFIERS,THIS MAY BE EITHER A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE NUMBER THAT IS ADDED TO THE
RESULTS OF THE PREVIOUS CALCULATIONS. IT IS ASSUMED THAT SPRING ENCOMPASSES THE
MONTHS OF MARCH-APRIL-MAY:SUMMER JUNE-JULY-AUGUST; FALL SEPTEMBER- OCTOBER-
-NOVEMBER;WINTER DECEMBER-JANUARY-FEBUARY. THE SEASONAL MODIFIERS MAY BE
CHANGED VIA THE MCP...FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE CURRENT SCENARIO DATE IS JULY 15, AND
THE SUMMER SEASONAL MODIFIER IS +12 THE TEMPERATURE AT OUR PREVIOUS
HYPOTHETICAL LOCATION WOULD NOW BECOME 79 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

THE LAST VARIABLE USED TO DETERMINE TEMPERATURE IS A MODIFIER FOR LAND OR
SEA.THIS LAST NUMBER REFLECTS THE TENDENCY OF WATER TO RETAIN HEAT IN WITER AS
EARTH DOES IN THE SUMMER.THE 2 NUMBERS,ONE FOR LAND AND ONE FOR SE,MAY BE
EITHER A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE NUMBER. THEY MAY BE CHANGED BY THE USER VIA THE
MCP. THIS NUMBER IS THEN ADDED TO THE PREVIOUS CALCULATIONS AND THE RESULTANT
NUMBER IS THE TEMPERATURE AT THIS LOCATION.

TEMPERATURES FOR LOCATIONS ON THE MAP MAY BE VIEWED BY CHECKING THE
`TEMPERATURE` OPTION IN THE WEATHER DISPLAY BOX. TEMPERATURE AT ONE LOCATION
MAY BE VIEWED BY POSITIONING THE CURSOR OVER THE DESIRED LOCATION AND CLICKING
THE MOUSE BUTTON WHILE PRESSING THE -SHIFT- KEY. TEMPERATURES MAY BE DISPLAYED
IN EITHER CENTIGRADE OR FAHRENHEIT BY CHECKING THE DESIRED OPTION IN THE
WEATHER DISPLAY BOX.

STORMS AND STORM FRONTS.
------------------------

STORM FRONTS ARE CAUSED WHEN THE RADIUS OF EFFECT OF A HIGH PRESSURE ZONE
OVERLAPS THE RADIUS OF EFFECT OF A OW PRESSURE ZONE. IF THE TEMPERATURE AT THE
LOCATION IS ABOVE FREEZING(32 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. 0 DEGREES CENTIGRADE) THE
THUNDER STORM SYMBOL WILL BE DISPLAYED AT THE LOCATION. IF THE TEMPERATURE AT
THE LOCATION IS BELOW FREEZING, THE METEOROLOGICAL SYMBOL FOR SNOW WILL BE
DISPLAYED. IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE FOR ONE STORM FRONT TO PRODUCE BOTH,RAIN AND
SNOW.
 
AFTER THE FRONTS HAVE BEEN DETERMINED,THE CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION FOR EACH MAP
SQUARE AFFECTED BY THE FRONTS IS CALCULATED. THIS IS DONE BY COMPARING THE
CLI-MATE PREIPITATION % FOR THE PERTINENT LOCATIONS TO A RANDOMLY GENERATED
NUMBER, THE CLIMATE PRECIPITATION %(OR THE CHANCE THAT IT WILL RAIN OR SNOW FOR
A GIVEN CLIMATE TYPE) MAY BE ODIFIED USING THE -MCP-

CLIMATES.
---------

THERE ARE 12 DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLIMATES;TROPICAL-MONSOON-SEMI/ARID-ARID-
-MEDITERRANEAN-SUB-TROPICAL-MARINE-CONTINENTAL-COOL-SUB/ARTIC-HIGH ALTITUDE-AND
POLAR. EVERY LOCATION ON THE GLOBE BELONGS TO ONE OF THESE GROUPS.THESE
CLIMATES EFFECT PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE(SEE ABOVE).USING THE -MCP- IT IS
POSSIBLE TO REDEFINE THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE CLIMATE GROUPS. FOR EXAMPLE,IT IS
POSSIBLE TO SET THE CLIMATE PRECIPITATION % TO 99% FOR ARID,THIS WOULD OF
COURSE,RESULT IN RAINFALL IN WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE A DESERT AREA.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPECIAL SQUARES-PORTS AND FORTS.
--------------------------------
A SPECIAL SQAURE IS A MAP SQUARE THAT CONTAINS EITHER A NATIONAL CAPITAL,A
PROVINCIAL CAPITAL,A PORT,A TOWN OR FORTIFICATIONS. SPECIAL SQUARES HAVE
NAMES-THOUGH IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR A SQUARE TO HAVE A UNIQUE NAME-AND ARE
CONTROLLED EITHER ONE OF THE PROVINCES THAT MAKE UP NATIONS(AND THEREFORE
CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE RESOURCES OF THAT NATION)OR ARE DECLARED
`UNCONTROLLED` AND WILL BE OCCUPIED BY THE FIRST MILITARY UNIT THAT ENTERS THE
SPECIAL SQUARE.

FROM THE -MAIN MENU- IT IS POSSIBLE TO -GOTO- ANY SPECIAL SQUARE FROM ANY POINT
ON THE MAP,SELECTING THIS OPTION FROM THE MENU WILL PRODUCE THE -GOTO-DIALOG
BOX. CLICK ON THE DESIRED SPECIAL SQUARE TO SEE ITS CO-ORDINATES. DOUBLE CLICK
ON THE SPECIAL SQUARE TO GO TO THOSE CO-ORDINATES IMMEDIATELY. TO THE LEFT OF
THE SPECIAL SQUARE LIST IS A LIST OF ALL PATHS IN THE WORLD. THIS FUNCTIONS
IDENTICALLY TO THE SPECIAL SQUARE LIST.

SPECIAL SQUARE INFO
-------------------

TO RECEIVE DETAILED INFO ABOUT A SPECIAL SQUARE (NOW SHOWN AS -SS-).POSITION
THE CURSOR OVER THE DESIRED SPOT ON THE MAP AND PRESS THE -LMB-AND LEFT SHIFT
KEY TOGETHER. A DETAILED DIALOG BOX WILL NOW APPEAR DISPLAYING INFO ABOUT THE
LOCAL TEMPERATURE,CLIMATE,WIND DIRECTION AND CO-ORDINATES. CLICK ON THE `MORE
INFO` BOX TO RECEIVE DETAILED INFO ABOUT THE SPECIAL SQUARE.CLICK ON `CONTINUE`
TO EXIT THE BOX..IBM USERS MAY ALSO USE KEYS `M` AND `C` RESPECTIVELY FOR THE
SAME EFFECT.

FORTIFICATION LEVEL.
--------------------
THE FORTIFICATION LEVEL OF A -SS- IS USED TO INCREASE THE DEFENSIVE STRENGTH OF
UNITS LOCATED ON THE -SS-. THE FORTIFICATION BONUS IS A VARIABLE THAT MAY BE
CHANGED USING THE -MCP- THE HIGHER THE FORTIFICATION LEVEL, THE GREATER THE
BONUS.

CURRENT PORT CAPACTY.
---------------------
THIS NUMBER INDICATES THE MAXIMUM COMBINED STRENGTH POINTS OF SHIPS THAT MAY BE
DOCKED AT THIS SPECIFIC -SS- AT ONE TIME.FOR EXAMPLE,IF THE CURRENT PORT
CAPACITY OF A -SS- IS 10,ONE NAVAL UNIT WITH 6 STRENGTH POINTS AND ANOTHER WITH
4 MAY SIMULTANEOUSLY BE IN THE SAME SQUARE.HOWEVER,A THIRD SHIP,GIVEN ORDERS TO
MOVE INTO THIS -SS- WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ENTER. IF THE NAVAL UNIT IN
QUESTION IS UNDER HUMAN CONTROL. A REPORT WOULD BE ISSUED ASKING THE USER TO
MAKE NEW ORDERS FOR THE THIRD UNIT.

POTENTIAL PORT CAPACITY.
------------------------
PORT CAPACITY CAN BE EXPANDED BY USING A PROVINCES PRODUCTION POINTS,THE
COST,IN PRODUCTION POINTS,FOR INCREASING A -SS- PORT CAPACITY IS SET IN THE
-MCP-. THE POTENTIAL PORT CAPACITY INDICATES THE MAXIMUM PORT CAPACITY THAT
THIS -SS- CAN BE RAISED TO.

CURRENT PORT CAPACITY.
----------------------
THIS NUMBER REPRESENTS THE DEPTH OF THE DRAFT OF THE SHIPS THAT CAN HAROUR AT
THIS -SS-.THERE ARE 4 DRAFTS REPRESENTED BY THE NUMBERS 1-4; 1- VERY SHALLOW
DRAFT; 2- SHALLOW DRAFT; 3-DEEP-WATER; 4- VERY DEEP WATER. IN TURN, EVERY NAVAL
UNIT TYPE, WHEN CREATED, IS ASSIGNED A CLASS CORRESPONDING TO THE DRAFT OF THE
SHIP. FOR EXAMPLE, A SHIP WITH A UNIT TYPE CLASS 3(DEEP WATER) WOULD NOT BE
ALLOWED TO ENTER A -SS- THAT HAS A CURRENT PORT CLASS OF 2(SHALLOW DRAFT).

POTENTIAL PORT CAPACITY.
------------------------
PORT CAPABILITY CAN BE EXPANDED BY USING A PROVINCES PRODUCTION POINTS.THE
COST,IN PRODUCTION POINTS,FOR INCREASING A -SS- CAPABILITY IS SET IN THE -MCP-.
THE POTENTIAL PORT CAPABILITY INDICATES THE MAXIMUM PORT CAPABILITY THAT THIS
-SS- CAN BE RAISED TO. NO SPECIAL CAN HAVE A PORT CAPABILITY GRETARE THAN 4.

CAPTURE AND LOSS OF SPECIAL SQUARES.
------------------------------------
THE LOSS OF A -SS- ADVERSELY EFFECTS A COUNTRYS NATIONAL WILL.WHEN A COUNTRYS
NATIONAL WILL IS REDUCED TO ZERO THAT NATION SURRENDERS,INVERSLY,THE CAPTURE OF
AN ENEMYS -SS- INCREASES THE VICTORS NATIONAL WILL. THE AMOUNT OF INCREMENT,
AND DECREMENT CAN BE SET IN THE -MCP-.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEA POWER AND AMPHIBIOUS OPERATIONS.
------------------------------------

A SCENARIO MAY CONTAIN UP TO 40 DIFFERENT TYPES OF NAVAL UNITS. THE TOTAL
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL UNITS,HOWEVE, IS LIMITED PRIMARILY BY THE AVAILABLE
RAM.NAVAL UNITS,LIKE ALL UNITS IN UMS II ARE CONTROLLED BY A COMMAND HIERARCHY,
OR ORDER OF BATTLE.
FOR EXAMPLE ANY ORDERS GIVEN TO HARDY WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE PASSED ON TO THE
`VICTORY`-`EURYALUS` AND `NEPTUNE` (AS THESE SHIPS HAVE LESS SP THAN HARDY) ANY
ORDERS THAT ARE GIVEN TO NELSON WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE PASSED ON TO HARDY (SAME
APPLIES-HE`S GOT A HIGHER SP THAN HARDY) AND THROUGH HIM TO THE SHIPS UNDER HIS
CONTROL. THIS WILL BE ESPECIALLY USEFUL WHEN MAKING LARGE SCALE MOVEMENTS.

ACTIVATING A UNIT.
------------------
A SEA UNIT MAY BE ACTIVATED BY POSITIONING THE CURSOR ON THE LEFT HAND CORNER
OF A UNIT AND DOUBLE CLIKCING. IF MORE THAN ONE UNIT SHARES THIS MAP SQUARE
SELECT -NXT UNIT- TO ACTIVATE THE DESIRED UNIT. SELECTING -ISSUE ORDERS- WILL
CAUSE THE NAVAL UNIT ORDERS BOX TO APPEAR.

NAVAL ORDERS.
-------------
AT ALL TIMES A NAVAL UNIT IS CURRENTLY UNDER ONE OF 4 ORDERS. IN ADDITION TO
THESE STANDING ORDERS,THE UNIT MAY BE ASSIGNED UP TO 7 WAYPOINTS. THE NAVAL
UNIT WILL PROCEED FROM ONE WAYPOINT TO THE NEXT IN CONSECTUTIVE ORDER UNTIL THE
LAST WAYPOINT IS REACHED OR NEW ORDERS ARE ISSUED TO THE UNIT. IT IS NOT
NECESSARY TO ASSIGN A NAVAL UNIT ANY WAYPOINTS. A UNIT WITHOUT CURRENTLY
ASSIGNED WAY-POINTS WILL REMAIN IN ITS CURRENT LOCATION.

[NOTE] A SCENARIO MAY CONTAIN UP TO 40 DIFFERENT TYPES IN TOTAL, THESE 40 UNIT
TYPES MAY BE ANY COMBINATION OF NAVAL,AIR,MISSILE OR GROUND TROOPS. WHILE IT IS
QUITE POSSIBLE FOR A SCENARIO TO CONTAIN ONLY NAVAL UNITS, MOST SCENARIOS
CONTAIN ABOUT 10 DIFFERENT NAVAL UNITS.

WIND AND NAVAL MOVEMENT.
------------------------
THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND IN RELATION TO THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL OF SAIL
POWERED NAVAL UNITS EFFECTS THE SPEED OF THE NAVAL UNIT. THE AMOUNT OF THE
EFFECT IS DETERMINED BY THE SETTINGS IN THE -MCP-(UNDER MOVEMENT,SEA WINDS
MENU)

THE DEFAULT SETTINGS ARE; RUNNING 100%-BROAD REACHING 120%-REACHING 60%-CLOSE
HAULING 40%-AND DIRECTLY INTO THE WIND 20%. FOR EXAMPLE,A NAVAL UNIT TRAVELLING
FROM SOUTH TO NORTH,WITH THE WIND FROM THE SOUTH-WEST WOULD BE `BROAD-REACHIN`
AND WOULD RECEIVE ONLY A 20% MOVEMENT BONUS.

[NOTE] ONLY SAIL POWERED NAVAL UNITS ARE AFFECTED WIND DIRECTION.

AMPHIBIUS OPERATIONS.
---------------------
AMPHIBIUS OPERATIONS-CAMPAIGNS INVOLVING THE TRANSPORT OF GROUND UNITS ACROSS
BODIES OF WATER BY NAVAL UNITS-ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY UMS II. TRANSPORTING A
GROUND UNIT VIA A NAVAL UNIT IS ACCOMPLISHED IN 2 STEPS.

FIRST.
------
A NAVAL UNIT(WITH SUFFICIENT TRANSPORT CAPACITY) IS MOVED INTO A SPECIAL
SQUARE(-SS-)ARE THE ONLY PLACES ON A MAP THAT GROUND AND NAVAL UNITS MAY SHARE
A LOCATION. ALL GROUND UNITS HAVE A `LOAD VALUE` OR THE COST TO TRANSPORT THIS
UNIT THIS NUMBER IS SET FOR A PARTICULAR UNIT TYPE AT THE TIME THAT THE
SCENARIO IS CREATED. WHEN A NAVAL UNIT WITH `TRANSPORT CAPACITY`(ALSO SET FOR
EACH UNIT TYPE AT THE TIME THAT THE SCENARIO IS CREATED) ENTER A -SS- A `LOAD
UNIT BOX` APPEARS AND DISPLAYS A LIST OF ALL GROUND UNITS THAT THE NAVAL UNIT
HAS SUFFICIENT TRANSPORT CAPACITY TO CARRY. IF THERE ARE MORE THAN 5 GROUND
UNITS LOCATED IN THE -SS- THE `MORE` BUTTON IS ENABLED,SELECTING THIS BUTTON
WILL DISPLAY THE NEXT SET OF 5 GROUND UNITS. SELECTING THIS BUTTON AGAIN WILL
CONTINUE TO DISPLAY GROUND UNITS IN GROUPS OF 5. TO LOAD A GROUND UNIT CLICK
THE BUTTON THAT CONTAINS THE UNITS NAME,THE SYMBOLS <> WILL APPEAR ON EITHER
SIDE OF THE UNIT NAME TO INDICATE THAT IT HAS RECEIVED ORDERS TO BOARD
TRANSPORT.

SECOND.
-------
TO UNLOAD A GROUND UNIT THAT IS BEING TRANSPORTED BY A NAVAL UNIT,WHILE GIVING
MOVEMENT ORDERS TO THE TRANSPORTING NAVAL UNIT,POSITION THE CURSOR OVER A LAND
SQUARE THAT IS ADJACENT TO A WATER SQUARE AND PRESS THE -RIGHT SHIFT- KEY AND
LMB TOGETHER. THE UNLOAD UNITS BOX WILL APPEAR. CLICK THE MOUSE ON THE BUTTON
THAT CONTAINS THE NAME OF THE UNIT,OR UNITS THAT YOU WISH TO UNLOAD AT THIS
PLACE. UNIT/S SO SELECTED WILL APPEAR WITH A DASH(--) ON EITHER SIDE OF THE
UNIT NAME.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUPPLIES AND TRANSPORTATION.
----------------------------

SUPPLIES.

SUPPLIES ARE THE CURRENCY THAT MILITARY UNITS EXPEND AS THEY ASSUME DIFFERENT
FORMATIONS AND MOVE ABOUT THE MAP. THE COST TO ASUME EACH MILITARY FORMATION IS
SET BY THE USER IN THE FORMATION COST AND EFFECT BOX. NOTE IN THE DIALOG BOX.
THE LEFT AND RIGHT HALF OF THE BOX HAS BEEN DIVIDED FOR DISPLAY PURPOSES.

IF THE COST IN SUPPLY POINTS FOR EVERY MILITARY FORMATION IS SET TO ZERO THEN
SUPPLY WILL HAVE NO IMPORTANCE OR EFFECT ON A SIMULATION. IT IS THROUGH THIS
DIALOG BOX THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPLY IN A SIMULATION IS ET.

REDISTRIBUTE SUPPLIES.
---------------------
WHEN 2 OR MORE UNITS OCCUPY THE SAME MAP SQUARE, SUPPLIES CAN BE EXCHANGED
BETWEEN THEM. THIS IS NECESSARY TO RE-SUPPLY UNITS AND TO LOAD SUPPLIES ON TO
TRANSPORT UNITS FOR MOVEMENT.

THE `RE-SUPPLY` OPTION IS SELECTABLE FROM THE UNIT MOVEMENT COMMAND BOX(SEE
GROUND MOVEMENT-SEA MOVEMENT..ECT) IF THIS BUTTON IS SELECTED THE RE-DISTRIBUTE
SUPPLIES BOX WILL APPEAR WITH A LIST OF ALL UNITS THAT SHARE THE SAME MAP
SQUARE,SELECTING `MORE` WILL CAUSE THE NEXT GROUP OF 5 UNITS TO BE DISPLAYED IN
THE BOX.

TO TRANSFER SUPPLIES BETWEEN UNITS,DECREMENT THE STORE OF SUPPLIES OF THE FIRST
UNIT BY CLICKING THE DOWN ARROW. THE SUPPLIES WILL BE ADDED TO THE TOTAL OF
`UNCLAIMED SUPPLIES` AT THE TOP OF THE DIALOG BOX. TO ADD THESE SUPPLIES TO THE
SECOND UNIT,CLICK ON THE UP ARROW FOR THAT UNIT. THE SUPPLIES WILL BE DEDUCTED
FROM THE UNCLAIMED TOTAL AND ADDED TO THE 2ND UNIT. SELECT `DONE` WHEN
FINISHED.

ALL UNCLAIMED SUPPLIES ARE DESTROYED.
THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF SUPPLIES THAT ANY UNIT CAN CARRY IS 99 SUPPLY POINTS.

SPOILS.
-------
TO THE VICTOR THE SPOILS. WHENEVER A UNIT HAS BEEN ELIMINATED IN BATTLE THE
VICTORIOUS UNIT WILL RECEIVE ALL THE ELIMINATED UNITS SUPPLIES THAT IT CAN
CARRY.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMBAT.
-------

COMBAT OCCURS WHENEVER THE DISTANCE BETWEEN  2 HOSTILE UNITS IS LESS THAN THE
CURRENT VALUE OF `CONTACT BETWEEN HOSTILE UNITS` AS SET IN THE -MCP-. THIS
DISTANCE IS USUALLY 20 KILOMETERS, HOWEVER, THE USER MAY CHANGE IT FOR EACH
SCENARIO.

THE METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE VICTORIOUS AND DEFEATED UNITS, AS WELL AS THE
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES SUSTAINED ARE DEFINED BY THE USER.

FOLLOWING COMBAT,THE MORALE LEVEL FOR THE VICTORIOUS UNIT IS RAISED BY 1 POINT.
FOR EXAMPLE, A UNIT DETERMINED TO BE VICTOR WHO PREVIOUS TO COMBAT HAD A MORALE
LEVEL OF 5;-STALWART- WOULD BE RAISED TO A MORALE LEVEL OF 6;-DETERMINED-. A
DEFEATED UNITS MORALE LEVEL IS REDUCED BY 1 POINT. FOR EXAMPLE; A UNIT
DETERMINED TO BE THE DEFEATED UNIT WHO PREVIOUSLY HAD A MORALE LEVEL OF
-WAVERING- WOULD BE REDUCED TO A MORALE LEVEL OF 3;-SHAKEN-.

FOLLOWING COMBAT,THE EXPERIENCE LEVEL FOR `BOTH` UNITS ARE RAISED BY 1
POINT,FOR EXAMPLE;A UNIT WHO PREVIOUS TO COMBAT HAD AN EXPERIENCE LEVEL OF
5;-IRREGULAR- WOULD BE RAISED TO AN EXPERIENCE LEVEL OF 6;-REGULAR-.

THE UNIT SUFFERING THE GREATEST NUMBER OF CASUALTIES-AS MEASURED IN STRENGTH
POINTS- WILL BE FORCED TO RETREAT. THE COMPUTER WILL MOVE THE UNIT IN THE
OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM WHICH ATTACKED. IF THE ATTACKER IS VICTORIOUS IT WILL
CONTINUE WITH ITS PREVIOUS ORDERS. IF EITHER UNIT IS IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE WITH
ITS PREVIOUS ORDERS AND IS UNDER `HUMAN` CONTROL THE USER WILL BE ASKED TO
ISSUE NEW ORDERS TO THE UNIT.

REPORTING HOSTILE CONTACT.
--------------------------

IF EITHER OF THE CONTROLLING NATIONS OF THE ATTACKING OR DEFENDING UNIT HAS HAD
THE `SHOW REPORT` OPTION SET ON. A REPORT ON THE APPROPRIATE NATIONAL
STATIONARY WILL BE DISPLAYED ON SCREEN.

ON AMIGA THE REPORTWILL ALSO APPEARIN THE SPECIFIED TYPEFACE FOR THAT NATIONS
REPORT,AS BELOW.

IF THE OPTION `PRINT REPORTS` HAS BEEN SELECTED THE REPORT WILL ALSO BE SENT TO
PRINTER. IF THE OPTION USE STATIONARY HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN SELECTED THE REPORT
WILL BE PRNTED IN GRAPHICS MODE ON THE STATIONERY SHEET. IF THE OPTION FORM
FFED(OR SEPERATE PAGES ON SOME COMPUTERS) HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SELECTED, THE
PRINTER WILL AUTOMATICALLY ADVANCE THE PAPER TO THE NEXT SHEET BETWEEN REPORTS.
 
-------------------
1. HOSTILE UNITS ARE DEFINED AS UNITS BELONGING TO THE ARMED FORCES
ORGANISATION OF 2 DIFFERENT NATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AT WAR.

2. THIS VARIABLE IS ACCESSED UNDER THE -PROXIMITY- MENU OF THE -MCP-.THE
DISTANCE TO INITIATE COMBAT IS DEFINED IN KILOMETERS.

3.THE MORALE LEVEL FOR A UNIT IS EXPRESSED AS A NUMBER BETWEEN 0-9 WITH 0 BEING
THE LOWEST POSSIBLE VALUE.THE INITIAL MORALE LEVEL FOR A UNIT IS SET AT THE
TIME THAT THE UNIT IS CREATED.

4.THE EXPERIENCE LEVEL -IS SET EXACTLY AS THAT ABOVE- (MORALE)

-----------------------------------------

UNIT NAME.
----------
THIS IS THE UNIT NAME AS IT APPEARS IN THE NATIONAL ORDER OF BATTLE,OR ARMED
FORCES ORGANISATIONAL CHART.[NOTE] THIS NAME DOES NOT HAVE TO BE UNIQUE.

CURRENT STRENGTH OF UNIT
------------------------
THIS NUMBER IS THE CURRENT STRENGTH,BEFORE HOSTILE CONTACT,OR BATTLE AS
MEASURED IN STRENGTH POINTS(SPs). THIS IS AN ARBITARY NUMBER,DECIDED BY THE
SCENARIO DESIGNER,BASED ON THE FIELD STRENGTH OF THE UNIT AND RANGES FROM 1-99.
WHEN THIS NUMBER IS REDUCED TO ZERO,FOR WHATEVER REASONS,THE UNIT IS ELIMINATED
FROM THE NATIONAL ORDER OF BATTLE AND IS NO LONGER DISPLAYED ON THE MAP.
FURTHERMORE,THE UNITS CONTROLLING NATION IS SUBJECT TO A CORRESPONDING LOSS OF
NATIONAL WILL. SEE -MCP- FOR SETTING THE EFFECT OF THE NATIONAL WILL CAUSED BY
THE LOSS OF THE UNIT. IN THIS EXAMPLE THE 101ST AIRBORNES STRENGTH IS 10 SPs.

TECH LEVEL EFFECT
-----------------

EVERY UNIT IS CREATED WITH A TECHNOLOGICAL LEVEL THAT RANGES FROM (0) STONE AGE
TO WORLD WAR III FUTURE (18). THE ATTACKERS TECH LEVEL IS COMPARED TO THE
DEFENDERS TECH LEVEL AND THE SUPERIOR UNIT IS AWARDED A BONUS BASED ON THIS
NUMBER.

TECH LEVEL ADVANTAGE
--------------------
THIS NUMBER IS THE BONUS AWARDED TO EACH UNIT THAT HAS A SUPERIOR TECH
LEVEL.THIS BONUS IS MULTIPLIED FOR EVERY TECH LEVEL THAT THE SUPERIOR UNIT HAS
ABOVE THE INFERIOR UNIT. THIS BONUS IS USER DEFINED AND MAY BE SET IN THE -MCP-

TECH LEVEL EQUATION MODIFIER
----------------------------

WILL BE IN EITHER SCREEN,-DEFEND-HOLD AT ALL COSTS FORMATIONS. EVERY UNIT
TYPE(GROUND,SEA,AIR,MISSILE OR ORBITAL) HAS A PREDEFINED NUMBER OF FORMATIONS,
AND EACH FORMATION HAS A PRE-DEFINED COMBAT BONUS. THE VALUES OF THESE BONUSES
ARE SET FOR THE USER(SEE BELOW). IN THIS EXAMPLE THE 101ST AIRBORNE IS IN
ASSAULT FORMATION AND THE BONUS FOR THIS INFORMATION IS 150%. THE EFFECT OF
ORDERS BONUS,MINUS 100% IN ORDER TO GET THE NET CHANGE,IS MULTIPLIED BY THE
RUNNING TOTAL.
[NOTE] THIS NUMBER MAY BE LESS THAN 100% AND THEREFORE IS NOT A BONUS AT
ALL,BUT RATHER A LIABILITY.

EFFECT OF ORDERS EQUATION MODIFIER
----------------------------------
THIS NUMBER,SET IN THE BATTLE EQUATION(SEE BELOW),REPRESENTS THE WEIGHTING OF
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EFFECT OF ORDERS BONUS.FOR EXAMPLE,IF THIS NUMBER IS SET

EVERY UNIT TYPE(THERE MAY BE UP TO 40 DIFFERENT UNIT TYPES FOR EVERY
SCENARIO)HAS BEEN CROSS-INDEXED WITH ITS ABILITY TO ATTACK(OR DEFEND) IN THE 16
TERRAIN TYPES.
THIS IS SET UP AT THE TIME THE SCENARIO IS CREATED. IN THIS EXAMPLE. THE UNIT
TYPE,AMERICAN PARATROOPERS,IS CROSSED-INDEXED WITH ATTACKING ACROSS ROUGH
TERRAIN AND THE RESULT(90)MINUS 100% IN ORDER TO GET NET CHANGE, IS MULTIPLIED
BY THE RUNNING TOTAL.
[NOTE] THE TERRAIN TYPE OF THE DEFENDING SQUARE DETERMINES THE TERRAIN TYPE.
THE SAME CALCULATION IS MADE FOR THE DEFENDING UNIT, THOUGH A DIFFERENT TABLE
IS USED FOR CALCULATING THE EFFECT OF TERRAIN ON DEFENSE.

TERRAIN EFFECT EQUATION MODIFIER
--------------------------------
THIS NUMBER,SET IN THE BATTLE EQUATION(SEE BELOW)REPRESENTS THE WEIGHTING OF
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TERRAIN EFFECT BONUS.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THIS NUMBER IS SET TO 100(100% OF THE RESULT OF THE
