      2. Info:
      ~~ ~~~~~
      The Ultimate Quiz Volume #1 was created using Amos 1.3 and then
      later updated using Amos Pro. V2.0

      Compiled with Amos Pro Compiler V2.0


      -------------------------------------------------------------------


      3. Hardware requirements:
      ~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      The Ultimate Quiz has been tested on:

      A500 1.3   (GVP HD + Fast Ram)
      A500+/A600 (standard models)
      A1200      (Standard model)
      A1200      (120mb hard disk & External floppy drive)
      A4000/040  (2 meg Chip & 16 Meg Fast ! + Hard Disk)

      It runs 100% on the above (to my knowledge) and you shouldn't
      have any problem running it on your Amiga no matter what
      model you are using.

      (I would suggest 1 meg minimum though).

      Running this game on an accelerated Amiga (eg. A1200) will not
      effect the game in any way you will be pleased to learn.


      -------------------------------------------------------------------


      4. Loading Instructions:
      ~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      From WorkBench: Just double click on the games icon.
      From CLI      : Just type in the games filename and press Return.
      (The games filename should be Quiz)

      All the Quiz.Data files must be located in the same Directory
      as the game file.
      (i.e.. ALL files copied to same destination.)

      Hard Drive owners please refer to the Install.Doc thanx.


      -------------------------------------------------------------------


      5. THE ULTIMATE QUIZ Volume 1:
      ~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~

      (PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS)
      ----------------------
      This game is played by using your Mouse in the mouse port.

      You will see the AGAS Logo screen scroll up and fade after
      a short pause.

      Then the Intro Screen and music should be next. Skip this
      with the left mouse button.

      After a short moment, the Question Block Loader Screen will
      appear on the screen.

      From here you can select any of the TEN question blocks.


      (LOADING QUESTIONS)
      -------------------
      To load them in, just position the pointer (hand) over your choice
      and press the left mouse button.
      (The pointer will automatically be replaced over the Knowledge
      Button each time you this screen appears.)

      Select any button and you will be whisked away (Aaaahhh !)
      to the main game screen.

      Now from here you can either click on the HELP Button or anywhere
      else to start the game.


      (THE HELP BUTTON)
      -----------------
      If selected, you will be greeted with a neat vertical scrolly text
      message on the screen.
      You can quit this by holding down the left mouse button.
      Or it will quit itself when the message is complete.
      You will then be returned to the main game screen once again.


      (STARTING A GAME)
      -----------------
      If you click anywhere else other than the Help Button then this
      message will appear on the main screen window ...
      
                         GAME ON - PRESS START

      You will also notice that the START Button is flashing and that
      the mouse pointer is limited to that button only.

      To display the questions - press the left mouse button when the
      START Button is flashing.

      O.K. The first question & three answer options will now appear
      on the screen in a typewriter kind of fashion !

      You will notice that the three answer options are colour coded
      to match the A,B and C Buttons at the bottom of the screen.

      The mouse pointer will now be positioned above the A,B & C buttons.
      You can now select your answer by pressing the left mouse button.

      You are limited to the amount of time you take to answer each
      question.


      (THE TIMER)
      -----------
      The Timer Bar will start to scroll away whilst playing some
      countdown music AFTER the question has been printed on screen.
      This gives you time to read the question before countdown begins.

      The Timer & Music will stop when you have either run out of time
      or if you select A,B or C.

      You will be told on screen whether you have answered correctly,
      wrongly or if you ran out of time.


      (SCORING)
      ---------
      You start each game with:

      0 points
      3 credits

      If you answer a question correctly then you will gain 10 points.
      If you answer a question wrongly then you will lose 1 credit !
      If the Timer runs out then you also lose 1 precious credit !

      A total of 1000 points are available in each block played.
      10 points * 100 questions.

      I have added a HiScore option.
      The HiScore starts at 0000 points for each block.
      Each Question Block has its own HiScore so you can come back 
      after playing another block and the HiScore will still be there.

      Each question is picked at random. This means you won't ever play
      them in the same order any time you play. This gives the game a
      longer lasting appeal I think.

      This also means that you have a chance of beating the HiScore
      instead of only getting so far into the Quiz and getting stuck 
      at the exact same spot each time.


      (GAME OVER)
      -----------
      The Game Over screen only appears when you have no more credits or
      if you have attempted all 100 questions.

      Your Rating will be shown at the bottom of the screen too.

      The HiScore will only reach 1000 points maximum for each block.
      Can you do it ?

      That's basically it !

      Click on START when its flashing to play the next question.
      Click on A,B or C to answer it.
      Watch out for the Timer.
      Watch out for your Credits.
      Try and reach a new HiScore.

      Good luck !  (but) Most of all .... have loads of fun !
      (Oh and don't forget to get a grown up to help you with the
      tricky bits !!!)


      -------------------------------------------------------------------


      6. Version & Updates:
      ~~ ~~~~~~~ ~ ~~~~~~~~

      V1.00 - NEVER RELEASED !

              unpacked !  (I don't know why I didn't do this previously !)

              bug-free !
              Loads of re-written routines to help speed up game play.

              NEW Exclusive coding for F1 LICENCEWARE release.


      -------------------------------------------------------------------


      7. PAL/NTSC
      ~~~~~~~~~~~
      This version does NOT run properly on an NTSC (60 Hz) Amiga !

      My screens are stretched beyond the bottom of the screen on NTSC.
      The reason I used 640 * 256 was that my screens looked crap on
      only 640 * 200 !!!

      For NTSC users - Please get hold of a 50/60Hz utility that will
      enable you to play this game on 50Hz. 
      (A1200/A4000 owners can do this using the set-up menu.
      Hold down both mouse buttons on boot-up.  Change system to 50Hz)

      Andy Gibson:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Well that's me I guess !  What can I say ? 
      I decided to code my own quiz game after playing some really crap
      ones !  I set out a task to have my quiz game include 1000
      >>RANDOM<< Questions each with 3 answer options !  Little did I know
      the task I had set myself was to be a huge one !

      I started on the coding and graphics etc. and then wrote some of
      the question blocks.

      I then asked friends to help out with the game and for any input.
      The response was amazing to say the least.
      (As you will see from the list of names below of everyone who helped
      to create this game today).

      I hope you like it.   You can contact me at:

      Alan Carter:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~
      I can't thank this guy enough !

      I was having problems working out a random question routine for
      my quiz and I wrote to Alan for some help after playing his
      BATDOG GAME on Amiga Computing's coverdisk.

      About three days later came the complete code and examples of
      how it should be done !  What a guy.

      Alan is now a commercial coder and has started work on a new
      commercial release !  Most of his work can be found in the great
      F1 LICENCEWARE library.  eg. ART SCHOOL and TOUCH N GO.  Both get
      very high ratings and even made it to coverdisk demos.

      Buy 'em from F1 LICENCEWARE today.

      Alan is also the chappy behind the famous BATDOG game.

      (I have removed Alan's address from this file due to him being too
      busy to deal with any time wasters - hope that helps Alan, oh and
      good luck with the commercial releases - speak to ya soon m8)

      ==================================================================

      George Burnett:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Now George is just a newcomer to the Amiga. He is, however, not
      new to Star Trek and Doctor Who amongst other video titles.

      Who else then should I turn to for help with compiling a load of
      Star Trek and Doctor Who questions ?

      After a while George appeared at my door holding loads of A4 paper
      containing loads of questions. 

      I said, "Thanx mate ... " and I shut the door in his face ... 
      only kidding ... I took the questions first !!!   Boom Boom ! 

      (Thanx m8, I'll see ya on Saturday as usual)

      ==================================================================

      Andy Strachan:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Andy is a big fan of Star Trek The Next Generation.
      One night he offered to write 100 questions for this quiz !

      I couldn't believe it ... he actually wanted to sit down for hours
      and compile loads of questions.    I mean ... who would ?

      I thought I was hearing things and decided to clean my ears out
      with a cotton bud !  However, I pushed it in too far and it popped
      out my mouth !  I must ask Paul Daniels for a job some day !

      Time passed and passed and soon the big day came (ooerr!).
      Andy appeared .... maybe he should ask Paul Daniels for a job !

      (Andy has now left the Amiga to play with his PC - game daft !)

      ==================================================================

      Jim Allan:
      ~~~~~~~~~~
      At the last minute Jim offered  100 RED DWARF Questions  and also
      100 Questions on  THE HITCH HIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY  which I 
      accepted gladly.

      Originally I had no plans to include anything at all to do with 
      those subjects !

      However, Jim with his usual charm, a few cans of Lager, managed to 
      persuade me to do so !

      These will now replace the VERY EASY and VERY HARD blocks.   :-)

      A few days later Jim arrived with loads of A4 and loads of Lager !

      I'vsh gotsh a shore headsh - burp ! - Cheersh mate ! - hiccup ! -

      (Jim is currently working on new music modules and a DATA disk for
      the forthcoming ULTIMATE QUIZ Volume II !!! - more later)

      ==================================================================

      John Traynor:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
      John compiled all the ASTRONOMY Questions for this release.

      Again this was a last minute decision and a good one at that.

      These brill' questions now replace the FICTION block.   :-)

      I can remember the time when John took me up to a dark field and
      pulled out his large .... Telescope (ooops !) and pointed it towards
      Saturn.

      I looked into the telescope and informed John that all I could see
      was darkness !     John slapped his thigh and then my face !
      I had forgotten to remove the lens cap !    heheheh!

      (John is now at colledge learning the arts and crafts of making
      guitars - he is also a very talented Bass Guitar Player - I kid
      you not - Just waiting for the big time. Good luck m8 see ya soon)

      ==================================================================


      Thanx to everyone that was involved in the completion of this game.
      Without you all ..... this game would have been STANDARD !
