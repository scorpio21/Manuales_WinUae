                              OPERATION COM*BAT

Typed by AMAZON for LSD.


MOUSE AND KEYBOARD CONTROLS

All OPERATION COM*BAT actions are controlled via the mouse.  The left mouse
button initiates actions, while the right mouse button displays menus.
The keyboard is used to input specific MODEM AND OPPONENT PARAMETERS,
filenames, and messages when playing between two computers.
Messages between players maybe typed any time during game play, using the
SEND and RECV lines at the bottom of the display.

VERIFICATION REQUESTER/DIALOG

A verification requester/dialog will appear on your screen whenever you
request an action that might drastically effect the current game
configuration.  The requester/dialogs will request an action from the player,
and the game will proceed until a valid response is made.
These requesters/dialogs are designed to protect you from accidentally
initiating that may irreversibly change some aspect of the game play, or
inadvertently break the teleconnection.  Please read them carefully before
responding, otherwise you may initiate an action that you actually do not
want to occur.

OPERATION COM*BAT

OVERVIEW

OPERATION COM*BAT lets you pit your military skills against those of the
computer in a graphically animated, Computer Battle Game.  It also allows you
to play against another human player, either on a single computer, or over
the telephone with two computers equipped with modems.

OPERATION COM*BAT provides 6 perspectively viewed, Battlefield Terrain maps
upon which the game may be played.  Each offers different military problems
to be solved by the strategy, tactics and intelligence of the player or
players.

These Battlefield Terrain maps include ROCKY CANYON, JUNGLE RUINS, DESERT
DUNES, RIVER MEADOW, MARSHLAND BOG and ARCHIPELAGOS.

Four types of animated military attack ordnance are provided, as well as
supply vehicles and air support.  Game pieces will move, aim and fire on
command.  To select any ordnance unit, simply point the mouse pointer to any
game piece visible on the Battlefield Map, or to one of the positions marked
on the Tactical Grid, and press the mouse button.  The chosen ordnance unit
will now be marked by a surrounding bracket.

To move the selected unit, point to any Battlefield Map location within range
and press the mouse button.  To FIRE the selected unit, choose any firing
angle from the firing cluster, then point to and click on the Firing control.

A player's turn lasts until each ordnance unit has either moved and fired
once, or the TURN TIMER runs to zero.  Play can be passed to the other player
at any time by clicking on the PASS control once the player has made all the
moves he wishes for that turn.

Each time an ordnance unit is hit by enemy fire, it sustains damage.  If it
receives too much damage, the piece is destroyed and removed from the
Battlefield.

As units run short of AMMO or FUEL, they can be resupplied (using the Supply
Control Cluster) from Supply vehicles which are positioned adjacent to them.
Supply vehicles can resupply only at HeadQuarters.

If Air Support is activated, it may be called as long as less than five
pieces have moved and less than FIVE shots have been fired.

The goal of OPERATION COM*BAT is to destroy the enemy's HeadQuarters - not an
easy task!

DISPLAY AND CONTROL

The OPERATION COM*BAT display is divided into two sections.  The upper half
display is the BATTLEFIELD TERRAIN MAP, while the lower half of the display
is referred to as the CONTROL PANEL.

BATTLEFIELD TERRAIN MAP

The Battlefield Terrain Map is a close-up perspective view of the current
battlefield with both BLUE and RED military ordnance in position.  At any
given time one-sixth of the Battlefield is displayed.
Movement and attacks by ordnance units are graphically animated on this
Battlefield Terrain Map.
Generally, only those areas of the map containing a player's unit can be
viewed.  However, calling AIR SUPPORT, will scroll across the one-third
portion of the Battlefield Map over which the Air Support flies - revealing
and updating enemy positions as it does so.

CONTROL PANEL

The lower half of the OPERATION COM*BAT display is the Control Panel.  The
Control Panel is comprised of five distinct areas which provide information,
game controls, and a user-to-user interface.  These sections are as follows.

<<>>  The Ordnance Status Table
<<>>  The Tactical Grid
<<>>  Ordnance Controls
<<>>  RECV & SEND Message Lines
<<>>  Game Turn Timer
<<>>  Connect Timer

ORDNANCE STATUS TABLE

The Ordnance Status Table displays the current status of the selected
ordnance.  Whether a unit has enough supplies of FUEL and AMMO, as well as
the Defence to complete a mission, or the GUN RANGE or POWER to destroy an
enemy, can be determined with a glance at the table.  The player is well
advised to note the stats of both his own units, and those of his enemy.

The Ordnance Status Table lists unit data in the following areas.

ORDNANCE TYPE - type of military unit currently selected; either Heavy or
Light Armour, Heavy or Light Artillery, Supply Vehicle, Air Support
Transmitter, or the HeadQuarters.

Defence - the strength of the unit, where zero Defence means the unit is
destroyed.  All units begin with maximum Defence for that ordnance type.

MOBILITY - the maximum mobility range for the selected unit, where 1 mobility
unit will move the ordnance 1 horizontal or 1 vertical square on the Tactical
Grid Map (32x20).

GUN RANGE - the maximum horizontally fired gun range for the selected unit as
measured on the Tactical Grid, where 1 Gun Range unit = 1 sq.  This range is
always limited to grid cells at least partially visible on the Battlefield
Map, except for one row to the top and one row to the bottom of the
Battlefield Map which is not displayed, but still within Gun Range.

GUN POWER - the amount of damage to be subtracted from the target enemy
unit's Defence stat with each successful hit by this ordnance type.

AMMO - amount of ammunition remaining to this unit, where 1 Ammo = 1 Firing.

FUEL - amount of fuel remaining to this unit, where 1 Fuel = 1 cell of
movement across the map.

POSITION - both horizontal (X Grid) and vertical (Y Grid) coordinates of the
selected unit on the Tactical Grid Map.


TACTICAL GRID MAP

The Tactical Grid Map displays the whole Battlefield Terrain Map under a
32x20 grid overlay upon which prominent Battlefield Map features are
displayed.

The Terrain Grid Map displays positions for each unit of the army whose turn
is current, and the last known positions of previously detected enemy units.
Enemy positions are updated whenever a player selects a friendly unit in the
vicinity.  Position updates occur only when the map area in question is
displayed within the upper Battlefield Map display.

When a player no longer has any units in that vicinity, it is not possible to
view that area without calling Air Support.

Reconnaissance provides updates on enemy units which are received for the
entire one-third portion of the Battlefield Map over which the Air Support
flies, each time Air Support is called.

The selected unit indicates its Tactical Grid Map position by blinking on and
off.  Another friendly unit may be chosen for action by clicking one of the
friendly coloured squares on the Tactical Grid Map with the mouse.

Red squares indicate RED army units, while yellow squares indicate BLUE army
units.


ORDNANCE CONTROLS

The Unit Command Controls which are used to initiate actions, are separated
into four distinct clusters.

Activity controls are PRIMARY COMMAND, FIRING DIRECTION, SUPPLY and AIR
SUPPORT, and are highlighted when active.  Selection controls are AMMO and
FUEL under Supply, and TOP, MID and LOW under Air Support.

Choice controls are highlighted whenever selected and are unhighlighted when
they are not selected.


FIRING DIRECTION CLUSTER

The Firing Direction Cluster highlights the current firing angle for a
selected unit.  Eight different firing angles are available, one for each of
the eight major compass points.

                            +----+  +---+  +----+
                            | NW |  | N |  | NE |
                            +----+  +---+  +----+
                                  \   |   /
                            +---+  \  |  /  +---+
                            | W |--   *   --| E |
                            +---+  /  |  \  +---+
                                  /   |   \
                            +----+  +---+  +----+
                            | SW |  | S |  | SE |
                            +----+  +---+  +----+

Care should be taken when determining diagonal firing trajectories.
Consulting the cells marked on the Tactical Grid Map will provide accurate
plots of enemy units that can be hit on the diagonals.


PRIMARY COMMAND CONTROL CLUSTER

The Primary Command Control Cluster provides controls to page through the
unit lists in either direction, to indicate MOVE, to PASS or FIRE.

+----+  The << and >> controls allow the player to page through the entire
| << |  ordnance unit list for each piece remaining in the game that is being
+----+  played.
+----+  It offers a quick method of determining if all units were considered
| >> |  for action.
+----+
+------+  The MOVE control indicates whether the selected unit has moved this
| MOVE |  turn.  All actual unit movement is always commanded in the
+------+  Battlefield Map display

+------+  The PASS TURN control is chosen whenever a player has finished unit
| PASS |  activity and wishes to Pass the turn to his opponent before the
+------+  Turn Length Timer is zero.
             Otherwise the turn will Pass when the Turn Length Timer reaches
          zero, or immediately following a call for Air Support.

+------+  The FIRE control is chosen to fire the guns of a selected unit.
| FIRE |  The unit's current firing direction is always indicated on the
+------+  Firing Direction Compass Cluster.

A unit may be supplied with either FUEL or AMMO once during a turn.  Supply
may occur whenever the supply vehicle is adjacent to the vehicle that is
requesting SUPPLY (North, South, East, or West).

                              +---------------+
                              |  S U P P L Y  |
                              +---------------+
                              +------+ +------+
                              | FUEL | | AMMO |
                              +------+ +------+

Either FUEL or AMMO may be chosen as the material being supplied, and is so
marked.

Clicking SUPPLY will supply the current unit the maximum quantity of fuel or
ammunition allowed for that ordnance type.

Supply vehicles can never resupply each other during the course of a game.

For a supply truck to be resupplied with fuel, it must return to its
HeadQuarters.

If a Supply Truck runs out of FUEL before HeadQuarters is reached, it is
stranded for the remainder of the game.

It is still possible, however, for units to be supplied from this stranded
supply vehicle, as long as they have sufficient fuel to reach it.


AIR SUPPORT CONTROL CLUSTER

When Air support is activated (see the OPTIONS menu), the Air Support Control
Cluster is accessed to control the flight path of an air attack, and to call
the attack on the enemy.


                        +---------------------------+
                        |    A I R  S U P P O R T   |
                        +---------------------------+
                        +-------+ +-------+ +-------+
                        | T O P | | M I D | | L O W |
                        +-------+ +-------+ +-------+

If the Transmitter has not been destroyed, AIR SUPPORT may be called, and as
long as less than FIVE units have been moved, and less than FIVE units have
been fired.  When a fifth unit moves or fires, Air Support is deactivated for
the remainder of that turn.

The Air Support TOP, MID and LOW controls select that portion of the
Battlefield Terrain Map over which Air Support will fly.

The attack plane will randomly strafe 1 of 7 grid rows within the one third
map portion that is indicated.

Each enemy unit that is encountered on that selected row will receive FIVE
points of damage.

A player's turn ends after Air Support has completed a strafing run on the
enemy and has reconned all enemy positions in the flight area.


RECV and SEND Message Lines
The RECV and SEND message lines, which are displayed across the bottom part
of the Control Panel, are only activated after a teleconnection has been
established on another computer.  All alphanumeric keys typed on the keyboard
will be displayed on the SEND line.

Message Text will be transmitted on the teleconnected computer either when
the RETURN key is pressed, or when the end of the SEND line (72 characters)
is reached.

The RECV message line displays incoming text messages from your teleconnected
opponent.

A chime sounds when an incoming message is received to alert the player to
read the message.

With some modems the RECV line will echo your SEND message should the
teleconnection be broken.  On DISCONNECT the SEND and RECV lines are
disabled.

TURN TIMER
The Turn Timer displays the time remaining in a given turn.  Turn times are
set under the Options Menu.

CONNECT TIMER
The Connect Timer indicates the elapsed time since the latest teleconnection
with another computer was made.  This is particularly useful for reminding
players how long they have been on the telephone.

ORDNANCE UNITS - THE GAME PIECES
There are seven types of ordnance units that are positioned on the
Battlefield Map at the start of each OPERATION COM*BAT game.  Each of the
three Battlefield Maps offers four game piece scenarios (see the SCENARIO
menu) that provide various unit configurations and placement.

Each ordnance type differs in DEFENCE, MOBILITY, GUN RANGE, GUN POWER, and
unit FUEL and AMMO.

It is important that players use ordnance types effectively, together and
alone, to maximise their effectiveness.

HEADQUARTERS
The HeadQuarters (HQ) for each army is represented by a flagged tent.  HQ is
a stationary objects and cannot fire on the enemy.  Its sole defence rests
with the other mobile ordnance units.

A game is won when a player destroys his opponents headquarters.  Conversely,
it is important for a player protect his HQ to prevent his opponent from
winning the game.

TRANSMITTER
The Transmitter is a stationary object that cannot defend itself.  Its sole
purpose is to call Air Support.  If the Transmitter is destroyed, then Air
Support cannot be called for the remainder of the game.  It is important to
protect your Transmitter, and attempt to destroy the Transmitter of your
opponent, if the game is to be won.

LIGHT ARTILLERY
The Light Artillery is depicted as a jeep with a mounted, short range RPG.
These units have the longest MOBILITY range, and the largest FUEL and AMMO
supply of any ordnance type.  On the other hand, they have the lowest
DEFENCE, GUN RANGE and GUN POWER.

Light artillery are usually the first to attacxk, but without the support of
heavier units, will likely be the first to be destroyed.

Nevertheless, combined they can produce enough fire power to take out any
enemy unit.

LIGHT ARMOR
Light armor is represented as a single barrel light tank. They initially
carry a respectable quantity of FUEL and AMMO, have good MOBILITY, GUN RANGE
and POWER.

Light Armor provides good backup support for Light Artillery.

They are effective when used with heavier units to destroy enemy units.

HEAVY ARMOR
Heavy Armor is represented as a two-barrel tank.  These units have a high
DEFENCE rating, GUN RANGE reaching almost anywhere on the Battlefield Map
display, and a very high GUN POWER.

They can fire on lighter enemy units, and remain out of range of return enemy
fire.

HEAVY ARTILLERY
Heavy Artillery should really be considered a Heavy ARMORED Artillery.  They
are represented as large gun barrels on treads.

Heavy Artillery have the highest DEFENCE, GUN POWER and GUN RANGE, and are
the strongest units in the game.  FUEL, AMMO and MOBILITY are all low, so
require constant resupply.

Its extremely long GUN RANGE can effectively be used for defence along the
right and left borders of the Battlefield Map, where they can see and fire
farther (11 cells) than any approaching enemy units.


SUPPLY VEHICLE

The Supply Vehicles are represented as trucks, and are unable to fire upon
the enemy.  They do have a huge FUEL and MOBILITY range, however.

They are solely used to resupply FUEL and AMMO to combat units in the field.

Because of the low DEFENCE of the Supply vehicles, it is important they be
kept out of range of enemy fire.

Supply Trucks are strategically important in OPERATION COM*BAT. Offensive
thrusts without the support of supply vehicles fizzle and die, as combat
units run out of FUEL and AMMO.

On the other hand, a player able to destroy his opponent's supply vehicles
has struck him a very crippling blow.


STARTING OPERATION COM*BAT

OPERATION COM*BAT will begin when you select NEW GAME under the PLAY menu.
Two small data files load from disk and the game begins.

NOTE: WHEN PLAYING AGAINST ANOTHER COMPUTER BOTH COMPUTERS MUST BE SET TO THE
SAME BATTLEFIELD MAP BEFORE NEW GAME IS SELECTED.

The side (Red/White or Blue/Black) that is currently chosen on the play menu
always begins a game.  Once a game has begun, the positions of all friendly
units are displayed on the Tactical Grid Map.

In order to select a different unit as the current unit, point the mouse
pointer at a unit in the Battlefield Map display and click the mouse button.

The Battlefield Map display then realigns itself to the new piece, centering
it in the display when possible.

The Ordnance Status Table now displays the stats for that unit, and all the
Command Gadgets reflect the options remaining for that unit.

Another unit, in particular those not in view in the Battlefield Map display,
can be chosen by clicking the mouse pointer on a friendly unit that is marked
on the Tactical Grid Map.

The selected ordnance unit that is within the boundaries of the bracket on
the Battlefield Map can be ordered to move by simply pointing the mouse
pointer to another location in the Battlefield Map display and clicking the
mouse button.

If the location isn't impassable (occupied by another ordnance unit, trees,
water, rock, etc.), and is within the MOBILITY range of that unit, then the
unit will do its best to move to the selected location, avoiding any
impassable obstructions.

Generally, OPERATION COM*BAT analyzes the move and calculates the best route
to reach that destination, taking into consideration the terrain crossed, and
the MOBILITY and remaining Fuel of the unit.

However, the unit will not always reach the destination, because bridges,
hills or sand slow the progress of the unit.

Sometimes the destination lies just outside the unit's MOBILITY range.

Usually, movement orders that are within the MOBILITY range of the unit are
more likely to be succesfully carried out, than those that extend to the
farthest reached of the display.  Pushing troops beyond their limits can be
counter productive.

Water is always impassable.  Sand, dunes, and hills, are passable, but often
cause delays to the advancing unit.

Where such type terrain must be crossed, it might be necessary to order a
unit to move beyond the destination in the hopes that it at least reaches the
destination coordinates.

The outcome of such moves is variable with the terrain type being crossed.
An astute general will be able to evaluate such moves correctly and make
appropriate allowances.


FIRING UNITS

The game default mode allows each unit to fire once per turn, either before
or after a move.  If the Double Fire option is enabled under the OPTIONS
Menu, then each unit may FIRE, MOVE, and then FIRE again.

Set the Firing Direction by first selecting a compass angle from one of the
eight in the Firing Direction Cluster.  Then click on the FIRE gadget to fire
the unit.

When a unit is fired, the shell continues in a straight path untill either
it:
                <<>> hits the first enemy unit encountered,
                <<>> reaches its effective GUN RANGE,
                <<>> hits an object (OBSTRUCTIVE MODE),
                <<>> reaches a Battlefield Map boundary.

It is possible to hit an enemy unit just off the top or bottom of the screen
(1 cell row).  This is allowed because of the relatively narrow verticle
field of view.

Friendly units never receive damage from friendly unit fire.

Units hit by incoming enemy fire sustain damage until eventually destroyed.

The victor in OPERATION COM*BAT is he who best uses his fire power.

Remember the defensive stats of each enemy unit.  Don't waste a shot of 4
power on an enemy unit that could have been destroyed with only a 2 power
shot.


GAME OPTIONS

The Options menu offers game options that can be set before a game is begun
and include the following:

                           <<>>  Choose opponent
                           <<>>  Choose a Side
                           <<>>  Select a Computer Play Level
                           <<>>  Select a Scenario
                           <<>>  Set the Turn Timer Lenght
                                          <<>>  Select a Firing Protocol
                           <<>>  Select Firings per Unit per Turn
                           <<>>  Activate/Deactivate Air Support

CHOOSE OPPONENT

Options include either a HUMAN opponent or a COMPUTER opponent.  If the
COMPUTER opponent is selected, then a Computer Play Level must also be
selected.


CHOOSE A SIDE

The selected army color starts the game, either BLUE/BLACK or RED/WHITE.

When playing teleconnected with another computer, the player that starts the
game by selected NEW GAME receives the chosen side color.


SELECT COMPUTER LEVEL

Three computer play levels are provided,
NNOVICE, EXPERT and MASTER.


SELECT A SCENARIO

Four game scenarios, wherein the ordnance placement and number of each
ordnance type vary, are provided.  The number of each ordnance type is
indicated in the scenario subtly changes the strategy and tactics used in the
game.

When teleconnected, the scenario selected on the computer that starts the
game will be the scenario that is played.

SCENARIO 1 - 5 of each combat ordnance type and 2 supply vehicles make this
the most challenging scenario of all to play.  Supply is always short.  It is
the longest scenario to play.

SCENARIO 2 - 6 Light Armor and 9 Light Artillary make this the fastest of all
the game scenarios to play.  Two supply vehicles are not too big a problem.

SCENARIO 3 - 8 Light Armor and 4 Heavy Armor make this a true tank war.  4
supply vehicles keep the offensives on the move.

SCENARIO 4 - Extra light ordnance and three Supply Vehicles, a variation on
other scenarios.


TURN TIMER SETTING

The Turn Timer forces the turn to change after a certain number of minutes
has elapsed.  The timer defaults to 240 seconds.

However, anything from 30 seconds to 600 seconds for a human opponent, or 120
seconds to 600 seconds for a Computer opponent, may be selected.

The shorter the time allotted, the fewer pieces a player is able to move
during the course of a turn.

Air Support usually plays a big role in games where the time is set to 120
seconds or less.


FIRING PROTOCOL

Firing Protocol sets a game to be played in either OBSTRUCTED or UNOBSTRUCTED
mode.

In the OBSTRUCTED mode all shots explode when they contact any Battlefield
impediments such as trees, rocks, etc.

In UNOBSTRUCTED mode shots move unimpeded over Battlefield map objects.


FIRE/UNIT/TURN

This option allows a game to be played with a SINGLE FIRE per unit per turn
mode, or a DOUBLE FIRE per unit per turn mode.

In DOUBLE FIRE mode units may FIRE, MOVE, them FIRE again.


AIR SUPPORT

Air Support may be selected as Activated or Deactivated.  When Deactivated,
the Transmitter is removed from the ordnance units displayed on the
Battlefield Map.


BATTLEFIELD MAPS

Any of the six Battlefield maps may be selected from the Options menu.

Each offers a different challenge in terrain types and requires a different
strategy to sucessfully master.

ROCKY CANYON  presents a semi-arid mountainous landscape divided by a deep
canyon which is always difficult to cross.

JUNGLE RUINS  presents the tangle of thick jungle carved with narrow, maze-
like pasageways.

DESERT DUNES  presents an endless vista of dunes that provide no cover and
make travel difficult.

RIVER MEADOW  presents divided territories separated by a river, which can be
crossed on a narrow bridge, or on slow access sandbars.

MARSHLAND BOG  presents a landscape of marshes, lakes, levies, and bridges.

ARCHIPELAGOS  presents a patchwork of small sandy islands joined by a matrix
of rapid transit roadways.


PLAYING OPERATION COM*BAT

First select your choice of Options from the menus.  Then select NEW GAME
from the Play menu.  Operation COM*BAT will begin.

NOTE: WHEN PLAYING AGAINST ANOTHER COMPUTER BOTH COMPUTERS MUST BE SET TO THE
SAME BATTLEFIELD MAP BEFORE NEW GAME IS SELECTED.

At any time during a Human player's turn the game can be stopped by selecting
CEDE/END from the Play menu.

A game that was Ended can be continued or Replayed simply by selecting
CONTINUE or REPLAY from the Play menu.

Any game may be saved, then later loaded and CONTINUED or REPLAYED.  However,
Replay is disabled whenever the game is played between two computers.

When the game is teleconnected to another computer, every correct move made
on one computer is echoed on the other computer.

The receiving computer, however, does not receive the opponent's Tactical
Grid Map display.

Make a mental note of enemy stats on each unit (call them intelligence
reports) and marking the weaker units as good targets.

Focus your offensive actions, allowing your units to work together towards a
common objective.  Use the borders of the map to your advantage.

Keep supply vehicles moving and supplying all units running low on FUEL or
AMMO.  An otherwise brilliant offensive attack can come to an ignoble end, if
the lead units run out of fuel on a bridge or narrow passage.

In UNOBSTRUCTED Mode attacks may come from any location.  Learn to see
possible firing angles for your enemies units, as well as your own.

In DOUBLE FIRE Mode even the weaker units are powerful.  Think wisely before
committing to an unprovoked attack.

AIR SUPPORT can be called as long as:

                     <<>>  The Transmitter is not destroyed
                     <<>>  Less than 5 units have moved
                     <<>>  Less than 5 units have fired.

Air Support is a very powerful weapon that will quickly reduce the enemy's
strength.  Called too frequently, though, it gives the enemy the opportunity
to position units in a major offensive.

Relying solely on Air Support rarely wins a game.  However, it just might
result in victory for an otherwise losing player, if used frequently at the
end of a game.


SAVING AND LOADING GAMES

Games may be saved, and later loaded and CONTINUED or REPLAYED under the
files menu.  Enter the filename of the game you wish to save.  Select
previously saved games from the list, using the mouse.


TELECOMMUNICATIONS

PLAYING BETWEEN TWO COMPUTERS
The TeleComm menu provides options relating to play between two computers.

There are four possible teleconection modes into which your computer may be
set:

         <<>>  Dial Telephone Number
         <<>>  Answer Telephone
         <<>>  Null Modem Connect
         <<>>  Disconnect

The computer will always be set to one of these four Telecommunication modes.
The default is DISCONNECT when the game begins.

In order for a player to initiate a teleconnection with another computer, one
of the other items must be selected.

DIAL TELEPHONE NUMBER
This menu selection tells your modem to DIAL THE TELEPHONE NUMBER you
requested (see Modem and Opponent Parameters).

ANSWER TELEPHONE
This menu selection designates this computer as the one that waits for and
answers the call from the other computer when attempting to establish play
between two computers.  The computer instructs the modem to answer the
telephone the next time it rings.

NULL MODEM CONNECT
This menu selection instructs OPERATION COM*BAT to bypass modem communication
routines, and directly connect to another computer via a null modem cable
between the serial ports of each.

DISCONNECT
This menu selection breaks the connection between another computer,
previously connected by selecting DIAL TELEPHONE #, ANSWER TELEPHONE, or NULL
MODEM CONNECT.

Both computers must always select DISCONNECT when a session has ended.

SETTING MODEM AND OPPONENT PARAMETERS
Modem and Opponent Parameters may be set from the menus.

OPERATION COM*BAT allows you to save the Modem and Opponent Parameters so
they can be recalled instantly when needed.

MODEM PARAMETERS
These settings can be edited to conform to your modem and saved to the disk,
so that each time OPERATION COM*BAT loads it defaults to the requirements of
your personal modem.

        <<>>  Baud Rate
        <<>>  Dial Command Modem Settings
        <<>>  Answer Command Modem Settings

BAUD RATE - MODEM PARAMETERS
Baud rates of 300, 1200,  2400 and 9600 may be selected.

Both computers must be set to the same baud rate before a connection can be
established.

DIAL COMMAND - MODEM PARAMETERS
Whenever your modem dials a telephone number, it must first send a signal to
your modem that a telephone is about to be sent.

If your particular modem, like most, is AT compatible, then either ATDT (for
tone dialing) or ATDP (pulse dialing) should be chosen.

A custom command entry box is provided for any modems with non-standard modem
command sets.  Note that this entry box may also be used to add AT commands
to the dial command.

For example, the command ATX6DT will tone dial the phone, returning result
codes, which OPERATION COM*BAT can use to inform you that the number was
busy, whether a human and not a computer answered the phone, or whether no-
one answered the phone.

If characters are displayed in the custom dial command box, then that is the
active dialing command.

Click the box active, then type the command that you require.

ANSWER COMMAND - MODEM PARAMETERS
A modem must be commanded to answer the telephone when it rings.

If the modem has a built in auto answer feature, ATSO=1 commands it to pick
up the phone when it rings once.

Some older modems will answer, but must be told to pick up the phone after it
rings.  The ATA gadget is used in this case.

If you have selected this answer command, you would not select ANSWER
TELEPHONE menu option until after the telephone rings (see Telecommunication
Procedures).

Acustom command entry box is provided, should your modem answer command
differ from those provided.

Click/activate the box, then type in the command you require.


OPPONENT PARAMETERS

Opponent Parameters can be entered or edited, and saved to disk so they can
be recalled as needed.

Previously saved Opponent files are listed and may be recalled by first
selecting, then loading them with the mouse.

Each Opponent file contains information specific to establishing a connection
with a particular opponent, such as the OPPONENTS NAME, TELEPHNE NUMBER, and
the BAUD RATE that will be used.


TELECONNECTION PROCEDURE

Playing OPERATION COM*BAT between two computers over the telephone is very
easy.  OPERATION COM*BAT does all the work of establishing and maintaining
the connection, so that the players can concentrate on playing the game.

Before you establish a teleconnection, both of the players must set the
Opponent Parameters, or LOAD a previously saved Opponent Parameters file from
the disk.

VOICE CONTACT
It is recommended that telephone voice contact be first established between
the OPERATION COM*BAT players to decide who will DIAL THE TELEPHONE NUMBER
and who will ANSWER THE TELEPHONE.

It is also necessary to agree upon the baud rate that will be used for the
connection, which should be highest common to both the modems that are being
used.

After they each hang up the voice call, the player who will answer the call
should select ANSWER TELEPHONE FROM THE MENU (if ATSO=1.  The dialing
computer waits 30 seconds to be sure his opponent is ready, then selects DIAL
TELEPHONE NUMBER from the menu.

If ATA is the Answer mode, The Player who is dialing should DIAL THE
TELEPHONE NUMBER first.

The other player then selects ANSWER TELEPHONE FROM THE MENU AFTER HIS PHONE
RINGS.


TELECONNECTION PROCEDURE SUMMARY

1.  Each computer must load OPERATION COM*BAT.

2.  Set Modem Parameters, if not set.

3.  Load or set Opponent Parameters.

4.  Call your opponent (voice) to decide who will call whom.

5.  Both computers should be on the same map,  and not have a game started.

6.  Before hanging up the phone, players decide that a call will be placed in
    15 seconds.

7.  If ATSO=1 is the designated answer command, the player who answers the
    phone selects ANSWER TELEPHONE.  Then 15 seconds later the other player
    selects DIAL TELEPHONE NUMBER.

8.  If ATA is the designated answer command, one player selects DIAL THE
    TELEPHONE NUMBER.  Then the other player selects ANSWER TELEPHONE when he
    hears the telephone ring.

9.  OPERATION COM*BAT will establish the connection between the computers.

10. Players may now type messages to each other.  When they are ready, they
    may select NEW GAME, or load and CONTINUE a saved game.


TELECONNECTION - ANOTHER METHOD

A few older, non-standard modems do not answer the phone or recognise the AT
command set, and may not initially seem to work with OPERATION COM*BAT.

You may still be able to play by using the NULL MODEM CONNECT option.  The
connect procedure that follows should be used to establish a teleconnection
under these circumstances.

The computers must each load and use telecommuication software that works
with the respective modems.

The software should be set to the following parameters.

            Baud Rate     =   Your baud rate
            Parity        =   NONE
            Data length   =   8 bits
            Stop Bits     =   1 stop bit
            Duplex        =   Full Duplex

After making a teleconnection between the two computers, quit the
telecommunication programs,  The telephone connection should remain open
between the two modems.

Load OPERATION COM*BAT on both computers,  After it has loaded, the players
should select the NULL MODEM CONNECT menu option.

Wait a sufficient time for both computers to get the game loaded and set,
then try typing messages to each other in order to determine if a connection
was sucessfully established.

    connections between computer and modem.

2.  Are MODEM AND OPPONENT PARAMETERS set correctly?  If not, set the
    Parameters correctly.

3.  Is your modem compatible with the AT command set?  If not consult your
    modem manual for a dial command that might work, and type it into the
    Dial Command Box.

4.  If all else fails, try the procedure outlined under TELECONNECTION -
    ANOTHER METHOD.

THE GAME WILL NOT ANSWER THE PHONE

4.  Try the ATA command to force the modems to answer the phone.

5.  If all else fails, try the procedure outlined under TELECONNECTION -
    ANOTHER METHOD.

TELECONNECTED, BUT GAME WILL NOT WORK

1.  Is the same baud rate set on both computers.

2.  Had a game already been STARTED on one of the computers?  Games should
    not be started when the teleconnection is first established.

3.  Are both computers set to the same Map?  Both computers should select the
    same map before starting a game.

4.  Do you have CALL WAITING?  Disable CALL WAITING and try again.

5.  Try hanging up and re-establish phone (voice) contact to verify all modem
    settings on each computer.  Then try again.
