Getting Started
----------------------

Amiga 500/1500/2000/2500

  Turn on your computer and insert The Oath is DF0: the game will boot up
  to the Vision Factory crack screen. After watching the intro press the
  left mouse button to proceed with the game. Wait until it is finished
  loading.

Amiga 1000 (with Kickstart ROM 1.2 or 1.3)

  Follow the steps for Amiga 500/1500/2000/2500.

Amiga 1000 (Kickstart on floppy)

  When are you going to trade in that piece of junk and get a power machine?
  Nevermind, turn on the computer and after some time a Kickstart requestor
  will appear.  Insert your appropriate Kickstart disk into the drive and
  after some 20 seconds you will be presented with a Workbench requestor.
  Now shove your copy of The Oath into df0: and proceed as you would if you
  had a real machine.

Amiga 1000 (Kickstart on floppy with autobooting hard drive)

  You just have to make it complicated. Proceed as you would if you only
  had a normal 1000 but after your hard drive has booted insert The Oath
  in df0: and reset the machine with CTRL-AMIGA-AMIGA. Now after the Vision
  Factory intro click the left mouse button to load the game.

THE GAME
----------------------
The Oath is a cheap rip off of the Psygnosis game Blood Money. In the game
you control a craft that flies around some impossible spacescape blasting
hordes of the enemy. You have the option of playing 1 or 2 player game,
and, er, that's really about it.

If you get to the end of the level I suppose you would be allowed to
fight some huge guardian, logical really, because that's the way it usually
works in these type of game. Okay, you guessed it, this doc is written
before the game is ever finished!

CONTROL
----------------------
You control your craft with the joystick.  You may move in any of the eight
directions your joystick allows, or, if you have a cheap joystick, any of
the four directions allowed. You may also blast the hell out of the enemy
by pressing the fire button. Keep in mind that this is a horizontal blast
fest when you set aim on the aliens.
