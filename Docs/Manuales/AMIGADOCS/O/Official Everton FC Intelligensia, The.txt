FOOTBALL INTELLIGENSA IS BASED ONOUR HIGHLY SUCCESFUL AMERICAN GAME, AND RELIES
UPON THE QUESTION AND THREE ANSWER FORMAT. FOOTBALL INTEL CONTAINS OVER 1600
TEXT ONLY QUESTIONS AND 52 PICTURE QUESTIONS. EACH QUESTION IS RANDOMLY
GENERATED SO THAT YOU WILL NOT BE GIVEN THE SAME QUESTION THROUGHOUT A COMPLETE
PLAYING SESSION. ONLY IF YOU COMPLETELY EXIT THE PROGRAM WILL A
QUESTION,REAPPEAR.

FOOTBALL INTEL IS DESIGNED TO TEST YOUR SOCCER GENERAL KNOWLEDGE TO THE FULL
AND IS PLAYED BY ONE PLAYER AT A TIME. QUESTIONS ON A COMPLETE RANGE OF
SUBJECTS WILL BE FIRED AT YOU. THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO WIN THE F.A CUP BY
CORRECTLY ANSWERING A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS PER ROUND. YOU ARE ASKED TO CHOOSE
WHICH CLUB YOU WISH TO REPRESENT. ONLY 1ST DIVISION SSIDES CAN BE CHOSEN, BASED
ON CLUBS WITHIN THE TOP FLIGHT DURING THE 1989/90 SEASON. ONCE YOU HAVE CHOSEN
YOUR TEAM, YOU WILL BE RANDOMLY MATCHED WITH CLUBS THROUGHOUT THE FOUR
DIVISIONS AND SOME NON-LEAGUECLUBS. AS WITH THE REAL F.A. CLUP, A 1ST DIVISION
SIDE GETS A BYE IN THE 1ST TWO ROUNDS, THEREFORE OUR GAME COMMENCES IN THE
THIRD ROUND. YOIU ARE GIVEN THE OPTION OF PLAYING ON THREE DIFFERENT
LEVELS...PROFFESIONAL...AMETEUR...OR NOVICE.

DEPENDING ON WHICH TEAM YOU DRAW, AND WETHER YOU ARE DRAWN HOME OR AWAY, WILL
RESULT IN THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS YOU WILL HAVE TO ANSWER TO WIN THE ROUND. THE
FOLLOWING TABLE IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS WORKS.

EXAMPLE TABLE
-------------

3RD ROUND                        DRAWN HOME:              DRAWN AWAY

4TH DIVISION AND NON-LEAGUERS.. 6 QUESTIONS              8 QUESTIONS             
3RD DIVISION                    8 QUESTIONS             10 QUESTIONS
2ND DIVISION                   10 QUESTIONS             14 QUESTIONS
1ST DIVISION                   16 QUESTIONS             20 QUESTIONS


NOVICE LEVEL:

DEPENDING ON WHICH LEVEL YOU HAVE CHOSEN , YOU WILL SCORE A GOAL. FOR EVERY 2
QUESTIONS ANSWERED INCORRECTLY, YOUR OPPONENT WILL SCORE A GOAL.


AMATEUR LEVEL:

FOR EVERY THREE QUESTIONS ANSWERED CORRECTLY YOU WILL SCORE A GOAL, EVERY 2
QUESTIONS ANSWERED INCORRECTLY, YOUR OPPONENT WILL SCORE A GOAL.

PROFFESSIONAL LEVEL:

FOR EVERY 5 QUESTIONS ANSWERED CONSECUTIVELY YOU WILL SCORE A GOAL. FOR EVERY 1
QUESTION ANSWERED INCORRECTLY YOUR OPPONENT WILL SCORE.

TO PROGRESS TO THE NEXT ROUND, IT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR YOU TO HAVE A HIGHER
GOAL SCORE THAN YOUR OPPONENT. IN THE EVENT OF THE SCORES BEING THE SAME THEN A
DRAW WILL BE DEC;LARED. IN THE EARLY ROUNDS, THE MATCH WILL BE REPLAYED AT
OPPOSITE VENUES TO THE FIRST GAME..IE IF YOU WERE AT HOME YOUR NOW AWAY...

ASSUMING YOU PROGRESS TO THE 4TH ROUND, YOU WILL AGAIN BE PLACED IN THE DRAW,
WE ASSUME THAT ALL 4TH DIVISION AND NON LEAGUE WILL NOW HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN
THE THIRD ROUND, SO THEY ARE NO LONGER INVOLVED IN OUR GAME. THE SAME QUESTION
LEVELS WILL APPLY AS THE THIRD ROUND EXCEPT OF COURSE, ONLY , ONLY THREE
DIVISIONS APPLY. CONTINUED PROGESS TO THE 5TH ROUND WILL SEE THE ELIMINATION OF
THE 3RD DIVISION. THE DRAW WILL BE MADE FROM THE 1ST AND 2ND DIVISION SIDES.
THE SAME QUESTION LEVELS WILL APPLY AND THIS SYSTEM WILL ALSO OPERATE FOR THE
QUARTER FINALS. AS THE SEMI FINAL IS PLAYED ON A NEUTRAL GROUND, THE FOLLOWING
QUESTION STRUCTURE WILL APPLY:

2ND DIVISION                 20 QUESTIONS
1ST DIVISION                 26 QUESTIONS

FINAL:

ALL MATCHES                  34 QUESTIONS


RANDOM BONUS:

DURING THE MATCHES, WE HAVE INCORPORATED A BONUS, THE SCREEN, FOR THIS PURPOSE
IS DIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF HEADINGS.A BOX FLASHES RANDOMLY OVER THE HEADINGS.
THE OBJECT IS TO TRY TO STOP THE MOVING BOX ON A FAVOURABLE HEADING, ALTHOUGH
WE CALL THIS SECTION A BONUS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IS IT POSSIBLE
TO BE WORSE OFF AFTER IT, DEPENDING ON WHERE THE BOX IS STOPPED. IN ADDITION TO
THE BONUS SCREEN, YOU ARE RANDOMLY INVITED TO PASS ON QUESTIONS IF YOU ARE
UNSURE OF THE ANSWER. THIS OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE ON EVERY QUESTION AND ONLY
APPEARS PERIODICALLY. ADDITIONALLY, YOU WILL,OCCASIONALLY, BE INVITED TO "TRY
AGAIN" IF YOU CHOOSE THE WRONG ANSWER. AGAIN, THIS APPEARS RANDOMLY AND WITHOUT
WARNING.

SCORING SYSTEM

WE HAVE ALREADY POINTED OUT THAT THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO WIN THE F.A CUP,
HOWEVER, TO ADD MORE CHALLENGE, WE HAVE INCORPORATED A PARALLEL SCORING SYSTEM.
WE AWARD POINTS FOR ANSWERING A QUESTION QUICKLY. THE QUICKER YOU ANSWER A
QUESTION THE MORE POINTS YOU SCORE. THEREFORE, ANOTHER OBJECT IS TO REACH THE
FINAL AND WIN THE CUP WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF POINTS!!

AND THATS IT MATES..ANOTHER SCOOTER-SCOOPEX PRODUCT...GENERATIONS AHEAD!!!
