HOW TO PLAY

  In the steamy jungles of South America, heavily armed extremists are
holding innocent civilians prisoner. Little do these terrorists know that
real terror is about to land on their front porch! The sound of rotor
blades and staccato bursts of gunfire echo through the valleys. Terrorists
be warned! Operation Wolf is going to teach you what terror is all about!

   Operation Wolf consists of six missions, which are displayed on the
Operations Map Screen. A mission is completed when all enemy forces are
reduced to zero. The current level is completed when you escape from the
airport with the prisoners. Your injury level increases when the enemy
hits you. The game automatically ends if the injury indicator on the right
side of the screen becomes completely red. You can reduce your injury
level by getting power drinks.
