Some Helpful Hints
------------------

To keep from running ground follow the Green Buoys till you reach the White
Buoys. Anything under 10 on your depth scale you'll be running ground. It
will take you about 18 minutes to reach the white buoy!

Keep track of your Constar, Surveillance Map, and Tactical Area Display. If
any of these gets knocked-out after a battle you'll be in bad shape.

If you decide to complete the scenario set aside at least 4 hours and 30
minutes actual time. Its a LOOOOONNGGGG simulation! The game can't be saved
unless you complete or die in the scenario.

In your first scenario the base to reach is the base nearest the one you
started from. Check your Surveillance Map to find out how far you have to
go. You must destroy ALL the enemy targets that Constar lists. It isn't
until that time that you will be able to enter the new base and complete
your scenario successfully.
