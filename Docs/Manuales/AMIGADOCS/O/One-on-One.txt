Note: This product requires Kickstart v. 1.1

To Start: Kickstart your Amiga and then insert your One on One disk in the
internal drive.  It will boot automatically.  If your Amiga is already up
and running, insert your One on One disk and "warm boot" it by holding down
the CTRL key and both Amiga keys at the same time.

To Exit Demo:  Press the left mouse button, the joystick button or the
SPACEBAR.

To Choose Game Options:  Select the main game options by pulling down each
menu, highlighting the desired selection and releasing the mouse button. 
See pages 2 and 3 of the manual (which you will find inside the front cover
of the package) for more information on the available options, such as
skill levels, end game options, and so on.

The rest to this card contains additional information on joysticks and
keyboard controls.

Keyboard Controls:

Return:	Return to Main Menu
S:	Toggle Sound On/Off
M:	Toggle Slow Motion On/Off
P:	Pause Game.  Resume play by pressing any other key.
T:	Call Time Out (the time out will be charged to the player in
        possession when T is pressed.)

Joystick Control: Whether you are using the mouse or the joystick, the
button works the same way:  on offense, a quick press and release spins the
player 180 degrees, while a slow press and release starts and completes a
basket shot.  On defense, a press goes for the steal, the block or the
rebound, as appropriate.

Mousing Around: If you are using the mouse to control your player, you will
find that you need to keep it moving in order to keep your player moving -
if you move it in a certain direction your player will keep moving in that
direction until you stop moving the mouse.  For this reason, you may find
that the mouse works better if you move it slowly and deliberately across
the table top.  In any case, you should try different techniques to find
the one that suits you best.

Switching Controllers:  You can switch from a mouse to a joystick (or vice
versa) by pressing P (to pause the game), plugging the controller you want
to use in the appropriate port and pressing any other key to resume play.
