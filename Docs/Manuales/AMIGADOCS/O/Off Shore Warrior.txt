MS/DOS disk into the internal drive of your computer; it will read the DOS,

same drive, then type: A:OFF followed by a letter indicating the type of
graphic card of your computer:

into your disk drive.

3 - The STORY:

Sweeping through the universe with their Peach Doctrine, the
Extra-Terrestrial Pacifists have taken control of all Economic, Political
and Social life on Earth. War and violence are things of the past, and even
the most basic games and sports are lacking in the action and aggression
that unfortunately every Earth inhabitant is lusting for.

Then the OFF-SHORE WARRIORS movement began. A sport evlved in which the
participants pilot enormously powerful boats in a battle against their
opponents and the natural elements.

Taking place in gigantic areans surrounding the world's largest lakes, the
warriors fight for victory against each other while trying to survive the
added dangers of rocks and waves.

The sport has grown in popularity rapidly, and is now the most popular
sport in the world. The dates of the International events are known well in
advance and take place over several days. The rules? Very simple: armed
with one boat and missiles, all warriors enter the arena knowing that
only one can leave alive. Winner takes all, win or die!

Throttles are the limit, the warriors struggle to keep their boats under
control: jumping waves, avoiding rocks, firing at their opponents, forcing
them into rocks, jumping and ramming into them...doing anything to survive
and win!

Now, after many years of waiting and training. You are an OFF-SHORE
WARRIOR.

Your first arena full of fans is impatiently waiting for you. Can you
handle the powerful boats, and the challenging conditions? Can you overcome
the extreme pressure of a win or die situation?

Will you be the new champion?
Prepare for battle....start your engine!

4 - HOW TO WIN?

Your firs opponents are novice, who can be destroyed without too much
trouble.

After a while your opponents become very alert and will react extremely
rapidly and you will have to use all of your skill and reflexes.

For each race you will have a number of missiles.  This number will be
smaller than the number of opponents you have. In order to be part of the
next race, you will have to finish first or second in every race.

At any time you can push your enemies onto the rocks to destroy them but
you must not him them head on or you will die immediately.

Even though the races take place on supposedly calm lakes, the wind may
create waves which will make you jump; while you're in the air,you cannot
control your craft and other warriors may catch up with you...

The first event takes place in 2049. Each yearly OFF-SHORE championship
consist of 4 races. Therefore, after winning 4 races you will be part of
the 2050 championship, then the 2051 championship!

Will you survive 2 years or a decade?

The best pilots are the ones that survive, for those that died during
battle, a board will show their score and date of death.

If you finish first in one of the duels you will receive a much envied
bonus.

Don't show mercy to others they won't have mercy on you - its do or die!!
