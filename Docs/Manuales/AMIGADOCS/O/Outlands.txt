                            PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS
			    --------------------

Select number of players on the title screen by pressing fire on joystick
in port 0 for one player or port 1 for two players. (Player one will start
on the left hand side of the screen). The game can be paused at any time 
by pressing the [HELP] key and resumed after that point with [UNDO]. While
paused, pressing [ESC] will abort the game and return to the title page.

Shooting some enemy ships will cause weaponry pods to appear:

SHIELD		-Kills most sprites ad they hit player ship from front. No
		 rear or side defence. Note that some large or fast ships
		 may penetrate the shield.

EXTRA LIFE 	-Provides an extra life and a couple of seconds of
		 invincibility.

DOUBLE FIRE	-Fires twin plasma bolts thus increase chances of hitting
		 enemy.

LASER NET	-Launches two pods with a laser beam between them. This
		 will kill practically anything that gets in the way. Note
		 that only 5 may be launched and that if a pod is hit by an
		 enemy ship the beam will cease.

MISSILES	-Launches two missiles from sides of player ship.

LEFT FIRE	-Fires shots from left of ship.

RIGHT FIRE	-Fires shots from right of ship.

ORBITALS	-Two spheres which rotate about the players ship providing
		 an element of shielding. Collecting a further orbital pod
		 will increase speed of rotation.

FIRING ORBITALS	-As above but the spheres fire oscillating plasma bolts.

                                PLAYING TIPS:
				-------------
o	KILL EVERYTHING!!
o	Some enemy may take more than one shot to kill, listen to the sound
	that your bullets make when they hit.
o	When you are killed, your next ship will flash for a few seconds.
	During this time you are invincible! Use this to get out of any
	tight spots.
o	Share weaponry pods when on 2 player mode.
o	High speed orbitals are very lethal to enemy ships!!
o	Watch out for the unexpected.
o	DON'T PANIC!
