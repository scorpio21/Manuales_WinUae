          ORBITAL DESTROYER DOC'S TYPED BY T.D.B. FROM LEGEND!

There you where pilotingg deep space probe CX/323 (the orbital destoyer) a
very routine flight, nothing out of the ordinary in the space burger bar,
nothing unusual in this months celibrity aliens magazine and no one
intresting on the interstellar television.
But there was a small blip on the long range scanner, best to check it out
anyway you thought.
Closing in on it you realise its not one small blip but thousands of tiny
ones each blip a strangly shaped alien form with one thing on it's 
mins ATTACK!!

Attack:
Reaching for your pulse cannen controller you realise that you are the last
line of defence to earth, you must destroy them all, if anyexcape your damage
will rise, if it reach 100% u know it's over.
Your puls lazers have limited ammunition, the only way to increase it is 
to sheet the grey asteroids that give you some respite from the aliens.
Stay as long as you can on the bonus level to collect points and ammo, do
this by shooting th emissile to reverse it's direction and revent it from
hitting the ship.
Remember destruction is the key, shoot everything aand you will  be safe,
but run out of ammo and you wil be destroyed.
