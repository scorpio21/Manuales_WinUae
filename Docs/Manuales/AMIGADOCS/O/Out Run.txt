WINNING TIPS
    If you slam on the brakes you will come to a complete stop and
    need to regain momentum. So switch to low gear instead.
 
    To maneuver a curve, downshift to low so you can hug the road
    and stay on the course.
 
    To race dow a straightaway, shift into high gear to achieve
    maximum speed.
 
    Avoid hitting vehicles in front of you, they slow you down.
