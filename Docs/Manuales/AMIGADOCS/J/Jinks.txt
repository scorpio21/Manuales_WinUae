Because of the extra memory required by the disk drive buffers, you will
have to disconnect all drives except the internal drive before running the
game.

	1. Turn off power.
	2. Disconnect the second drive.
	3. Follow instructions found in the manual.

                          INSTRUCTIONS

For the C64: Type LOAD":*",8,1 and press RETURN

For the Amiga: Insert eh boot disk when the Workbench prompt appears.

For the Atari ST: Turn on the machine and insert the boot disk.

The game is controlled by a joystick plugged into port #2.

Selecting Play Options:

Pressing the fire button when the title screen appears will cause the high
scores to be displayed.  Pressing fire again will return you to the title
screen.  By pulling the joystick down you will cause the word START to
flash.

Pulling the joystick down again will cause the SPEED selector to flash.  If
you move the joystick to the side you can select slow, normal, or fast
speed.

Pulling down on the joystick again will activate the GRAVITY control.  Push
to the side to select weak, normal, or strong gravity.

Once you have made your selections for SPEED, and GRAVITY, pressing fire
while START is flashing begins the game.

GAME NOTES

The planet Atavi has been classified by the Intergalactic Space Commission
as totally backward.  The Atavians do not seem to have grasped the purpose
of things generally...

Their defense is effective because it is incomprehensible.  While
endeavouring to use your glider to direct your anti-grav probe you will
encounter blocks, globes, light bulbs, and a pesky oscillating screw.  Any
of these strange obstacles may block your path.  When they do, it becomes
very difficult indeed to conduct the anti-grav probe.

Even more sinister are the objects that diminish you.  Touch one once and
your glider will be reduced in size while the probe eludes, sailing
uncontrolled through the Atavian defenses.  Touch again and your glider
will be destroyed.  But there is hope.  The Atavians have placed some
first-aid kits amongst the debris.  If the anti-grav probe touches one of
the revolving rectangles you will be restored to normal size.

The Space Commission will reward you for every Atavian obstacle destroyed
by your probe.  Destruction of some of the obstacles fetches a reward of
extra gliders or probes.  But be careful! Your probe may bounce through the
bricks at the bottom of the screen and become lost.  Even worse, the
floating teeth love to chew up probes!

You can finish a level when you maneuver your probe into the field of
rotating balls.  By so doing, you can enter the interlude and use your
probe to select the level of your choice.

The degree of difficulty increases with the passage of time.  Your game
ends when all your gliders are used up...
