                                  STORYLINE
                                  =========

   The  last  you heard from 009 was just after he had infiltrated a meeting of
 SPUDD..   -  (Society  of Particularly Undesirable Dastardly Dudes :  a secret
 organisation  made  up of arms dealers, mad dictators, psychopaths and traffic
 wardens).  The coded message that he sent to you was along the lines of :
 
               "SPUDD planning to take over the enntire world.
                               Let's do lunch.
                                   Cheers,
                                    009.
 
   Unfortunatly,  when  you  arrived  at  Chez  Bond  for your lunch and secret
 agent's meeting, you found 009 slumped over the menu with a knife in his back.
 To cap it all, the steak was undercooked !!!
 
   MI5,  the  FBI,  NASA,  the  KGB, MOSSAD and even top secret agents from the
 North  Beckinsdale  Pigeon Fanciers Association swung into action immediatley.
 They  were swiftly halted in their tracks when they recieved a top level order
 warning  of  a  massive  campaign  of  bribery  of government officials in all
 countries.   It  appeared that any overt attempt to destroy SPUDD would result
 in  the  downfall of most of the worlds governments.  SPUDD controlled leaders
 would soon rise to replace them.
 
   As the situation has worsened by the day, and SPUDD's forces have grown from
 strength   to  strength,  the  various  agencies  have  now  put  together  an
 underground  task  force which they hope will combat the growing threat.  This
 elite task force comprises of 1 agent..you.  Oh yes, thanks for volunteering!!
 There  in  also  a  highly  trained  mechanic called HARRY and a field support
 officer  to assign missions.  The plan is that you will "borrow" aircraft from
 local  air  forces  and carry out secret strike missions on SPUDD forces while
 they  are  still  small  enough  to stay hidden.  hopefully, by damaging their
 supply  lines,  factories and control centres you should be able to ruin their
 plans  for  world  domination.   However,  if  you  wreck  too  many expensive
 aircraft,  your  sponsors will not be able to cover for you, resulting in your
 being sent back to the secret agent's Basic Training School.
 
 
                                   LOADING
                                   =======
 
                         LOB IT IN AND LET IT GO !!!
 
 
                  JETSTRIKE is also Hard Drive installable.
 
   To install on Hard Drive...
 
   Create  a directory on your Hard Drive sufficient to hold all the files from
 Jet  Strike (you could call it Jet_Strike, but you can call it Hilda_Ogden for
 all  I care..).  Copy the HD_Install program from Disk #1 into that directory.
 Double Click on this file from WorkBench, and in a few shakes of a Los Angeles
 lamp-post, the installation will be complete.
 
 
 
                                  THE GAME
                                  ========
 
   In  JETSTRIKE  you must stop the devious SPUDD forces by attacking them with
 your  borrowed  aircraft.   Your  Commanding  Officer  will give you a mission
 objective  which you have to try to achieve withput being shot down, blown up,
 crashing into mountains or being kidnapped by aliens (only kidding !  ).
 
   Upon  loading  JETSTRIKE you will see the game selection screen.  This has a
 number of buttons which allow you to choose how to play the game.
 
   There are 4 types of game :
                                  TRAINING.
 
                                  PRACTISE.
 
                                   COMBAT.
 
                        AEROLYMPICS (for 2 players).
 
   Move  the  pointer  around  the  screen  using either foystick or mouse.  To
 select an option, press FIRE when the pointer is above it.
 
   There  are  ten  training missions each designed to allow you to familiarise
 yourself  with JETSTRIKE aircraft.  To load any of these, just press fire with
 the  pointer  above the name of one of them.  You will now be able to load the
 training  missions, starting with the one you selected.  The training aircraft
 are  fitted  with  an  automatic ejector seat which will rocket you out of the
 aircraft if you crash, usually saving your life.
 
   By the way, you only have one life and the ejector seat doesn't always work!
 
   At  the  end  of  training,  you  will  be ready to go on to the next stage,
 PRACTISE.   In  this  mode you will be presented with 10 simulated missions in
 which you will be up against forces similar to those you will encounter in the
 later  combat  missions.   In PRACTISE, you can fly any aircraft, although you
 will  only  have  three  auto-ejector seats.  Live ammo is used throughout the
 practise missions, much of which will be pointed at you !!!
 
   Once you have made it through this stage and collected your
         I'm-ready-for-anything-you-can-throw-at-me-pilots-licence,
              Brace yourself to face the forces of SPUDD......
 
   In  COMBAT  you're on your own !  Harry (under pressure from the ministry of
 finance) has removed all of the auto-ejector seats.  You may, however, be able
 to capture one (along with other bonus's) from exploding enemy jets.  Now, you
 can  only  get  away  with  wrecking  5  of the more expensive aircraft before
 somebody  from  the  accounts  department  notices and gives you your marching
 orders.   The  combat mode of JETSTRIKE consists of no less than 100 missions.
 To get to the end of the game you'll need speed, skill, cunning and at least a
 dash  of  forward planning.  You only have 1 life and because of this, There's
 just  the  merest hint of a possible minute smidgen of a chance that you might
 at  some  stage  fail.   To  help you overcome the frustration that this might
 cause,  level codes are provided at the start of some missions.  Each time you
 see one of these, you should note it down.
 
  AEROLYMPICS  has  been designed for 2 players.  Here you can take it in turns
 to  fly  10 areonautical tests against the clock.  You can't be killed, but if
 you crash, fail your mission or run out of time, you don't score any points.
 
   The aim of this game is to score more points than your opponent.
 
   To  add  to  the  challenge,  you  have  no weapons (unless specified by the
 mission),  and  you  can  get  more  points by using the more difficult to fly
 aircraft.
 
                                MORE OPTIONS
                                ============
 
   QUICK MODE : When set to YES, the game will skip from screen to screen,
                without doing any fades or wipes.
 
   REDIFINE KEYS : If you want to redefine the keys used if the game, simply
                   follow the on screen prompts.
 
   FAST AMIGA : If you have an accelerated Amiga, toggle yes to introduce
                extra detail.  Use S to toggle during play.
 
 
                               LEARNING TO FLY
                               ===============
 
                              (A CRASH COURSE)
                              ----------------
 
   Select  training 1 (landing) from the games selection screen.  You will then
 see  the  aircraft  selection  menu.  Select the GOSHAWK 200 TRAINER and press
 fire.
 
   The main control in JETSTRIKE is the joystick.
 
   Pushing  the  joystick  up  rotates the aircraft anti-clockwise.  Pulling it
 down  roates  it  clockwise.   This system may seem a little strange, but once
 learned  it  allows  you  to  control  the  aircraft with an amazing degree of
 accuracy.   Fortunatly you have 10 training missions and an infinate number of
 aircraft  to  get  used to this system.  The aircraft's speed is controlled by
 moving  the stick left to slow down, and right to speed up.  Alternatively you
 can press the buttons 1 (idle) through to 0 (full throttle) on the top of your
 keyboard.   When  you  start  training,  the  auto-throttle  is  turned on, to
 automatically control your speed.  To turn it off, press the left Amiga key.
 
   There  are a few other keyboard controls which are used throughout the game.
 Probably  the  most  important  of these is the spacebar, which is the ejector
 seat control which will allow you to get out of the aircraft in a major hurry.
 However, as no escape method is foolproof, we may at some point have to scrape
 you off a runway!!!
 
   You  should  now  be  on  the runway and ready to go.  Hold the stick to the
 right.  The engine will speed up to full throttle and the Goshawk should start
 rolling  down the runway.  Once the aircraft is going fast enough, slowly pull
 the  stick  down.   The  aircraft  will  now  pull up off the runway and start
 rotating clockwise.  Once it is pointing upwards, stop pulling the stick back,
 and it will gain altitude.  Now is a good time to pull up the undercarriage by
 pressing the U key.
 
   You  can  check  your  height  by looking at the radar display in the bottom
 right of the screen - the white flashing dot is your aircraft and a white line
 shows where your runway is.
 
   Once  you  have  gained some altitude you can experiment and get used to the
 rotation  of  the  aircraft (joystick up/down) as well as the throttle control
 (joystick  left/right).   If you should lose too much speed, the aircraft will
 stall  and  start to fall.  To gain speed simply throttle up, or you could try
 making the aircraft dive until it is going fast enough not to stall (but watch
 out  for that solid green stuff..!).  Your airspeed is shown in the display on
 the left of the screen.
 
   As  an  added saftey feature for trainee pilots, there is an automatic pilot
 on  the  training  aircraft.   Pressing the A key will toggle this on and off.
 While  this  is  on  (and  you  still  have  some fuel left) the aircraft will
 automatically  pull  up before crashing.  The auto-pilot will also prevent the
 aircraft from stalling.
 
   Landing is the difficult bit !  Fortunately for you, most of the aircraft in
 JETSTRIKE  have  a  built in fly-by-wire landing system.  To use this, put the
 undercarriage  down  by  pressing  U  and then hold down fire on the joystick.
 When  the undercarriage wheels are down pressing fire kicks in the fly-by-wire
 system.  While fire is held down, The aircraft automatically adjusts itself to
 the  correct  angle of attack and speed to land softly.  All you have to do is
 line the plane up with the runway.
 
   If  you  get  it  right,  you  will touch down on the runway.  Once you have
 landed,  hold  the  joystick to the left and the aircraft will slow to a halt.
 Your  commanding  officer  will now come out and congratulate you on finishing
 your  first  mission.   Landing  can  be tricky and you might not get it right
 first  time round.  If you write off your plane, ignore the sarcastic comments
 from Harry the flight mechanic, and get back in the air again!
 
 
                      A FEW TIPS ON LANDING AND SURVIVING
                      ===================================
 
 
   Most  of the helicopters and light aircraft, as well as the Harrier are able
 to  land on grass, although it must be flat (no craters) and the aircraft will
 tend  to  bounce  a  bit on landing.  Amphibious aircraft, such as the Grumman
 Goose can also land in the water, as long as the undercarriage is UP.
 
   If  your  undercarriage  should become damaged you can attempt to crash-land
 the  aircraft.   You  should come in very slowly and carefully, landing on any
 flat  area  (grass, runway or water).  This is a risky buisness and you should
 be ready to eject as the aircraft may explode or flip over.
 
   If  you  hit the runway too hard in a normal landing the undercarriage might
 collapse leaving you skidding towards oblivion.
 
   If,  for  any  reason,  you  feel that a landing is either impossible or too
 risky  you  should  eject from the aircraft.  If you do this you will probably
 survive.   Some  aircraft  are  not fitted with ejector seats.  With these you
 must  either  gain enough altitude before you bail out (to give your parachute
 time  to open) or fly very low over water and jump out:  if you are low enough
 you will survive.
 
 
                                 USING WEAPONS
                                 =============
 
 
   Once  you have completed your first take off and landing, you will move onto
 weapons  training.   Your first task is to bomb a target which is indicated by
 an orange line on your radar screen.
 
   At the start of each mission, a message will appear on the screen indicating
 what  ammunition  Harry  (your  ever  vigilant  mechanic)  has  loaded on your
 aircraft.  Gun ammo is nearly always loaded.  You can normally carry two other
 weapons  on the hardpoints or in the bomb bays of your aircraft.  Usually, two
 weapons  will be selected for you at the start of each mission and loaded into
 the  two  weapons  systems.   These  are  referred to as left weapon and right
 weapon,  not because they are on the left wing and right wing but because they
 are  fired  by  pressing  Fire  and moving the joystick left (to fire the left
 weapon)  or right (to fire the right weapon).  Pressing Fire without the stick
 right  or  left  fires  the  guns.   These  can  be used to shoot at virtually
 anything,  although  different  aircraft  have  different  guns with differing
 fire-powers.
 
   If  you  dont like using the joystick right / left Fire method, bombs can be
 dropped  using  the  keyboard.  You can drop bombs by pressing right Amiga key
 and right Alt key to fire the two weapons.
 
   If  you want to use different weapons from those selected by Harry (from the
 40  different types of bombs, missiles and rockets), pull down on the joystick
 when  the  aircraft  has  stopped  on  the  runway.  You will now see a screen
 showing  an inventory of some of the weapons available.  (The rest can be seen
 by  clicking  on  the arrow button).  Click on the items that you want as your
 left  and  right  weapon and then click on DONE.  You can also, at this stage,
 pick a different aircraft.  To do this, click on NEW PLANE.
 
   As  each  weapon  has its own characteristics, you should try out as many as
 you can while you are in training.  Some weapons cannot be carried by training
 aircraft.  These you will have to try out later on.
 
   Air-to-air  missiles  cannot  be  fired  without locking them on to an enemy
 aircraft.  When locked on, a box will appear on the screen in the direction of
 the  aircraft,  at  this  stage you can fire any long or medium-range missiles
 (such  as  Phoenix,  AMRAMM, Sparrow and Skyflash) at the enemy plane.  When a
 diamond appears in the box, you can fire short-range missiles (such as Stinger
 and Sidewinder) or use your guns at the opposition.
 
   A  similar system is used when attacking ground targets.  A smaller box will
 appear in the direction of the ground target which you have locked on to.  You
 can  fire air-to-ground weapons without locking on, but some of them will just
 fly off unguided.  With simple bombs you dont need a lock on - just drop them.
 
 
                                 HELICOPTERS
                                 ===========
 
 
   Once  you have finished your training in the "normal" aircraft, try learning
 to  fly  a  helicopter.   One  is  available  to you in the Training Mode, the
 Wessex.
 
   Helicopters are flown differently from the jets in this game, thier controls
 are far easier to use:
 
   Pushing  the Joystick up makes the helicopter go up.  Joystick down makes it
 go  down,  Joystick left makes it fly to the left and Joystick right (surprise
 surprise) makes it go to the right.
 
   The  Wessex and most other helicopters have undercarriages, so you dont need
 to  use the U key.  Helicopters dont have auto-pilots, they are easy enough to
 land without help.
 
   Helicopters  are  particularly useful when you need to rescue someone from a
 small space, or from a site where a jet would not be able to land.  If it is a
 designated  rescue helicopter you will be provided with a winch-man to haul up
 downed pilots, secret agents, scientists and whoever else happens to be in the
 thick  of  it.   In combat, they are able to hover over an area and plaster it
 with unguided rockets.
 
   Some  of the more advanced helicopters such as the Apache and Werewolf along
 with  Vertical/Short Take Off and Landing (VSTOL) jets such as the Harrier can
 be  controlled  both as helicopters and as "normal" aircraft.  This offers you
 all  the hovering capability of a helicopter along with the ability to do high
 speed  aircraft  manoeuvres.  If you are using one of these machines, pressing
 Return  will toggle between Agile Mode (flying as a normal aircraft) and Hover
 Mode  (flying as a helicopter).  There is also another way of changing between
 these  modes.   If  you are hovering, move the joystick full left or right and
 hold  it  there  until  you are at the far left or right of the screen.  Next,
 waggle  the  stick up/down or down/up.  You will now change to Agile Mode.  To
 change  from  Agile  Mode  to  Hover  Mode, slow the aircraft down and hold it
 straight  and  level  until  it  floats  to  the centre of the screen.  If you
 continue to hold the stick left, it will change to Hover Mode.

   If you are using a joystick which has multiple fire buttons wired separately
 (such  as  the  Sega  control  pad), then you can use the second button in Jet
 Strike.   The  second  button can be assigned to copy the action of any of the
 keys  on  the  keyboard  (as  a default it is U-undercarriage up/down) but, by
 pressing B and then the key you want to assign to the button, it will become a
 duplicate  of that key.  For instance, if you want the second button to act as
 a pause key press B followed by P.  (Where B is the second button).
 
 
                                   MISSIONS
                                   ========
 
 
   There  are  all  sorts of mission types in Jet Strike.  During the course of
 the game, you will be asked to shoot down enemy aircraft, bomb targets, attack
 convoys,  take  photographs,  deliver and rescue agents men along with lots of
 other stranger tasks.  Sometimes (especially with later mission) you will have
 to  complete  several  tasks in order to complete a mission and move on to the
 next one.
 
   A  target is displayed as an orange line on your radar screen.  This is what
 you  will  need  to attack, photograph, deliver an agent to, or the point that
 you  will  have  to  rescue someone from.  Enemy aircraft show up on the radar
 display as flashing orange dots.
 
 
                                   AIRCRAFT
                                   --------
 
   Selecting  the most appropriate aircraft for the job is vital in Jet Strike,
 especially  as  the  better  aircraft  are  in limited supply.  Apart from the
 training  aircraft  (or those used in Aerolympics) most machines are available
 for  a  limited  number of missions.  If any aircraft of a particular type are
 wrecked, then the number of missions in which that type can be used is further
 reduced.   Because of this, you cannot use the best aircraft in every mission.
 You  should  try  to  conserve  the  better machines for when the missions get
 tougher.
 
   Each  aircraft  has  its  own  strengths as well as its own weaknesses.  For
 instance,  the Phantom flies like a brick at low levels but it can carry a lot
 of  bombs and is an excellent dogfighter.  On the other hand, the A-10 Warthog
 is  an  excellent  low  level tank buster, but its chain gun is fairly poor in
 air-to-air combat.
 
   Because each pilot will have his or her own personal preference in aircraft,
 it  is suggested that you try out as many as you can in the practise missions.
 Another  factor  in  the "which aircraft" equation is that with light aircraft
 (microlights,  biplanes  and  most  non-jets)  you  earn  a  points  bonus for
 virtually anything you do.  For instance, you can multiply your point count by
 five by completing a mission with the Fokker Triplane!  The Ministry of Combat
 accountants  are  not  too  worried  about light aircraft (they are relatively
 inexpensive),  so  you  can wreck as many as you want.  On the downside, light
 aircraft have more chance of being shot down or exploding when hit.
 
 
                                   WEAPONS
                                   =======
 
 
   There  is a wide choice of weapons in Jet Strike.  They range from the wimpy
 air mines (which drop out and explode behind you thus deterring enemy aircraft
 attacking  from  behind)  to  area  denial weapons such as the JP233 and Hades
 (which spread highly destructive bobmlets over a wide area).
 
   Also included among the weapons are:
 
   Camera  Pods  (these  allow  you  to pinpoint an area for a spy satellite to
 photograph at the end of a mission)
 
   Drop Tanks (which allow you to carry extra fuel).
 
   A  camera  pod  is triggered in the same way as any "normal" weapon.  A drop
 tank  can  be  released  at any time by holding down the fire button while the
 joystick is in the firing position.  You must do this for a little longer than
 would be required when dropping bombs to ensure that you only drop a fuel tank
 when  you really want to.  Drop tanks will cause some damage when they hit the
 ground, the degree of which will depend upon the amount of fuel remaining.
 
   Weapons can be divided into two (albeit, rough) categories:
 
   Air-to-Air, and
   Air-to-Ground.
 
   Air-to-Air weapons are, mostly, missiles.  These have a variety of ranges.
   Air-to-Ground weapons have a much wider spread of designs.
 
 
                              AIR-TO-AIR WEAPONS
                              ------------------
 
   Stinger.... Very short range.  Mainly used for self defence.
 
   Sidewinder. Short range.  Standard air-to-air missile.
 
   AMRAMM..... Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (need I say more ?)
 
   Phoenix.... Very long range.  Heavy warhead.
 
   Sky Flash.. Standard RAF medium range missile.
 
   Sparrow.... Older NATO medium range missile.
 
   Air Mine... Simple self defence weapon.
 
 
   So if you want to shoot down Doris Stokes, use a medium range. (Grin)
 
 
                       AIR-TO-GROUND BOMBS AND ROCKETS
                       -------------------------------
 
   Standard Bombs.... Standard lumps of explosives in an iron casing.
                      Unguided.  Cheap,  but effective.
 
   Drag Bombs........ Normal bombs with Snakeye retard fins.
 
   Laser Guided...... Normal bombs fitted with a Paveway Laser Guidance.
 
   Bombs............. These follow a laser to their target.  So as long as the
                      target is kept locked on, its history.
 
   Cluster Bombs..... These bombs eject several smaller bomblets which scatter
                      over a large area destroying light targets.  The Drag
                      versions bomblets are parachute retarded to cause wider
                      damage.
 
   Bunker Buster..... A 2,000 lb. bomb with a 1,000 lb. iron nose cone.
 
   JP 233............ Major league runway-busting bomblet-dispenser.  Fly at a
                      low level over the target, hit Fire and watch it go.
 
   Hades............. A cluster bomb of hellish proportions.  When dropped on
                      a low level target each bomblet does the same damage as
                      a 2,000 lb. bomb.
 
   FA Bomb........... A small, tactical version of the Fuel Air bomb.  This
                      bomb explodes just over the target area, having a
                      devastating effect on vehicles, without damage to
                      hardened surfaces such as runways.
 
   Skip Bomb......... An advanced version of the famous bouncing bomb.  This
                      one can be dropped at any height and at any speed.
 
   Hydra Pod......... 16 unguided rockets.  Used in attacking unarmoured
                      targets and causing damage over a wide area.
 
   A.G. Rocket....... Unguided rocket.  For use against smaller aircraft.
 
   Light Rocket Pod.. Seven A.G. rockets in a pod.
 
   Heavy Rocket...... Armour piercing (unguided) heavyweight rocket.
 
 
   Use Drag bomb against Julian Clarey (Smirk).
 
 
                            AIR-TO-GROUND MISSILES
                            ----------------------
 
   ALARM....... Waits for a target to be illuminated and the destroys it from
                above.
 
   HARM........ Tracks in on any radar emitting target to destroy it.
 
   Harpoon..... Anti-ship cruise missile with a heavy warhead.
 
   Sea Eagle... UK anti-ship missile.
 
   Sea Skua.... Smaller version of Sea Eagle for use by helicopters and light
                aircraft.
 
   AGM-65...... The standard "Maverick" air-to-ground missile.
 
   AGM-130..... Cluster bomb equipped air-to-ground missile.
 
   Hellfire AT. Short-range single anti-tank missile.
 
   TOW AT...... Short-range missile (similar to Hellfire AT) carried in packs
                of two.
 
 
                               GETTING SHOT AT
                               ===============
 
 
   This  will  happen  to  you  a lot!  A heavily-armoured aircraft (such as an
 A-10,  Frogfoot,  Apache or Werewolf) can soak up a lot of hits before causing
 concern.   However,  after  only  a  few  hits most aircraft will start having
 critical  failiures.   When  this  happens  the  green indicator lights in the
 bottom left of your display will turn red.
 
   Damage  can include simple display failures, weapons failures, undercarriage
 damage  (where  it  locks up or down or is even blown to bits, this will force
 you  to  bail  out  or attempt to crash land), fuel leaks, engine failures and
 even  engine  fires.   If  the  engine  catches  fire  it  will  progressively
 deteriorate  and  finally  the  aircraft  will explode.  Unless you fancy your
 chances,  the  smoke  coming  from your aircraft should be a prompt to abandon
 aircraft.   Unless  you  are playing Jet Strike on an Amiga with only 1 Meg of
 RAM  or  less, you will hear a "Mayday" message to warn you that it is time to
 hit that old, trusty Spacebar.
 
 
                                   BONUSES
                                   =======
 
 
   If  an  enemy  aircraft  explodes in mid-air, there is a chance that it will
 drop a bonus pod which you can try to collect.  Each bonus will improve either
 your  aircraft  or your score.  Here are some of the bonuses you can expect to
 find:
 
 
   Fuel Pod.......... Increases your aircrafts fuel capacity.
 
   Ammo Pod.......... Increases your aircrafts gun ammo capacity.
 
   Fire-Power........ Increases the power of your aircrafts guns.
 
   Armour............ Increases the armour plating on your aircraft.
 
   Auto-Ejector...... Gives you an auto ejector seat.
 
   ECM............... Increases the power of your aircrafts Electronic Counter
                      Measures system, making it harder for the enemy radar to
                      track you.
 
   Fire Extinguisher. Automatic fire extinguisher.  In the case of an engine
                      fire this will reduce the extent of the fire or even put
                      it out.
 
   Aircraft Repair... Completely repairs any damage to the aircraft on the
                      spot.
 
   Bonus Saver....... Normally when you lose an aircraft you will lose any
                      bonuses that you have gained for it.  However, if you
                      find a bonus saver those bonuses will be carried on to
                      your next aircraft.
 
   Extra Aircraft.... This bonus is usually only awarded when you get a
                      certain number of points (1,000,000  2,000,000
                      4,000,000 and so on) and allows you to wreck one more
                      aircraft before the Accounts Department permanently
                      closes your account.
 
 
                                   TACTICS
                                   =======
 
 
   After  playing  Jet  Strike  for  a while you will probably develop your own
 tactics,  as  the  different  flying  characteristics  of  each  aircraft lend
 themselves to different tactics.  However, here are some handy words of wisdom
 from our developers:
 
   As  amazing  as it may seem, most crashes occur because you collide with the
 ground  or  something  else  of  a similar solid nature.  Because of this, you
 should  always try to think ahead a little.  Always be ready for a sudden pull
 out  (or  bail out).  Unless you are playing Aerolympics, you can take as long
 as  you  like  to  complete  a mission.  In an unfamiliar area, first arm your
 aircraft  with  a  camera  pod  along  with some air-to-air missiles to defend
 yourself.   Take  a flight around the area at high level.  While you are doing
 this  take  photos  of  any possible danger spots (for instance, when anything
 shoots at you).  If you are high enough the enemy SAMs cannot hit you.  Return
 to  base  and  examine  the  photographs.   You can now suitably re-equip your
 aircraft  and set off for your target in the confidence that you now know what
 awaits you.
 
   When  turning  around  try  to get into the habit of always turning upwards.
 (When you are going to the left you should pull the joystick down.  If you are
 going right, push the joystick up.) In this way you will have less of a chance
 of accidentally hitting the ground or low-level objects.
 
   When  you  have  to  fly over dangerous territory to reach a target you will
 inevitably be fired at before you reach your objective.  Dont be afraid to arm
 up  with  suitable  weapons  and  destroy the defences first.  Return to base,
 re-arm and then go after your target.
 
   If  there  is  an  enemy runway at or near your target area, make a point of
 putting  large holes in it.  Enemy jets might otherwise scramble from there at
 any  time  (usually  when you are running short on ammo, or are running low on
 fuel).   The  best  anti-runway weapons are JP 233s, Durandals, Bunker Busters
 and 2,000 lb.  bombs.  If you fancy a challenge, ignore the runways but always
 carry plenty of air-to-air missiles for the inevitable dogfights.
 
   Watch  out  for the unexpected.  Targets are usually well defeneded.  As you
 fly  over  them  you  will often be shot at.  Even a single infantryman with a
 rifle can shoot down an unsuspecting low-flying aircraft.
 
   Always  protect  your  airfield.  If anything hits it you will lose aircraft
 and weapons from your supplies.  This will make it much harder to complete the
 game.   If  anything looks like threatening your base, eliminate it as quickly
 as possible.
 
   Be  prepared  to  crash  land if you have to.  All the aircraft can be crash
 landed  in  an  emergency.  If you are successful, the aircraft can usually be
 recovered and used again.
 
   Watch  out  for debris.  When you destroy a target, it will usually explode,
 throwing debris everywhere.  If this hits you it will damage your aircraft.
 
   Use your codes.  Check each mission briefing to see if you have been given a
 Level  Code.   If so, write it down so you can start at the same mission after
 wrapping your F-16 around a tree.
 
 
                        TIPS FOR THE TERMINALLY BRAVE
                        -----------------------------
 
   An  engine  fire  does not always mean it is time to "use the sunroof".  You
 can  always  try  to  land  the aircraft, but this is not recommended.  Do not
 attempt  to use fly-by-wire, as this is not able to handle an aircraft when it
 is badly damaged.
 
   You get more points for using a light aircraft to complete a mission, so use
 one  of  the biplanes, microlights and other toy aircraft.  If you wreck them,
 they  do  not  come out of your pay cheque.  So long as you survive, you get a
 higher score.
 
   The lower you are to the ground, the less chance enemy radar has of spotting
 you  and  sending  up  fighters.   So  if  you "hedge hop" or fly "knap of the
 earth", you have a better chance of survival.  (Assuming you do not crash into
 anything, obviously.)
 
   If you need to land or stop in a hurry (when, for example, picking up agents
 from  short landing strips, or playing Aerolympics), you should try to get the
 aircraft  to  move  as  slowly  as possible before hitting the ground.  If you
 switch  on  the  display smoke (with the D key), you can monitor the aircrafts
 descent  more accurately which might help you to avoid stalling or landing too
 hard and wrecking your undercarriage.
 
   Above  all  else,  remember  that you only have one life in this game, so be
 prepared to hit your Spacebar.

                   THE JET STRIKE LITTLE BOOK OF AEROPLANES
                   ----------------------------------------
 
                                 INTRODUCTION
                                 ------------
 
 
   Following  extensive  and  painstaking  research carried out among pilots we
 have  discovered  that most of them actually prefer to know what aircraft they
 are  flying, either as a result of years of experience, or by reading a little
 name  tag  on  the  dashboard.   CAA  Directive No.  CQ994 states that "...all
 pilots must be able to recognise the aircraft they are flying, without the aid
 of  name  tags, hints from the control tower or any other source.." It is with
 this  in  mind that this book, which details the aircraft available for you to
 fly in Jet Strike, has been written.
 
   The information in this book is accurate only for flying the aircraft in Jet
 Strike.   It  is  accurate  at  the  time of going to press.  Since this books
 publication  SPUDD  agents  may have infiltrated the Civil Service, especially
 the Ministry of Aeroplane Spotting.  Their actions could mean that some of the
 details  in  this  book  are incorrect.  Please take note of any errors before
 crashing !
 
   Throughout  this  book  each  aircraft  is listed with details of its weapon
 capacity  (whether it can land on runways, grass or water), its mode of flight
 and  any little foibles that you should watch out for (such as total inability
 to pull up in time).
 
 
                              TRAINING AIRCRAFT
                              -----------------
 
   These  aircraft  are  ideal  for  learner  pilots.   They  are  (moderately)
 forgiving and usually easy to fly.

   The  number  of hardpoints is the number of individual positions where bombs
 can  be  loaded and, therefore, dropped.  In an aircraft with four hardpoints,
 bombs  can  be  loaded  into  four  different  areas which can each be dropped
 separately.   Most bombs can be loaded onto hardpoints in clusters (up to four
 per  hardpoint) and so the number of bombs (or other weapons) the aircraft can
 carry  depends upon the weight of the weapon, the number of hardpoints and the
 number carryable per hardpoint.
 
 
   The  Aeromacchi  MB-339 is a popular Italian jet trainer which is often used
 in displays.  It can easily be used as a light attack aircraft.
 
   The  BAe Goshawk (or T-45) was built in response to the US Navys requirement
 for  an aircraft carrier jet trainer.  It is a variant of the popular Hawk jet
 trainer used by the RAF.  In a fit (or flight) of license, various features of
 the  Hawk  200  have been added to the Jet Strike Goshawk enabling it to carry
 better weapons.
 
   The  Pilatus  Porter  is  a  civilian  transport  aircraft.   Because of its
 amazingly  short take off and landing ability, coupled with a low stall speed,
 it  is  an  ideal  machine  for  picking up secret agents.  With this slightly
 dangerous mission capability in mind, a few weapons have been added.
 
   The Westland Wessex has been one of the RAFs main Air Sea Rescue helicopters
 for  some  years.   The  Jet  Strike  version  has a long flight range.  It is
 equipped  with  a  winch  for  picking up downed pilots, agents and so on from
 places where you would not want to land.
 
 
                               COMBAT AIRCRAFT
                               ---------------
 
   On  the  whole,  these  aircraft  are  more  difficult  to fly than training
 machines.   Each  of  these  have their own individual characterisics.  As you
 will discover, these will do most of the hard work in Jet Strike.

   The  A-10  Warthog  (or  Thunderbolt  II,  as  it is officially called) is a
 specialist  ground  attack  bomber  able  to  carry large numbers of bombs and
 missiles.   It  is  heavily  armoured  and carries a multi-barrelled chain gun
 which is able to rip through tank armour.
 
   The  A-4  Skyhawk  is  a  light  ground  attack bomber and is mostly used by
 smaller air forces.
 
   The latest in the amazing Harrier Jump Jet series is the BAe Harrier II.  As
 it can fly normally as a jet or it can hover like a helicopter it is ideal for
 both ground attack and carrier work.
 
   The Bronco is a strange little obsevation and light attack aircraft.  Fairly
 heavily  armoured, it can carry enough weapons to either defend itself or make
 itself noticed.

   The  Buccaneer was originally used as a naval strike aircraft by the RAF and
 Royal  Navy.   It is now used as a laser designator aircraft for Paveway laser
 guided bombs.
 
   Development of the EFA Eurofighter has been heavily delayed due to political
 negotiations  on  who  does what and, more importantly, who pays for it.  (Its
 all  been  a bit like the arguments the go on at the end of a restaurant meal,
 but  on  a  bigger scale).  The EFA now seems to be set to take its first real
 flight around 1997.  It has been designed to take the place of the Tornado and
 Jaguar squadrons of the RAF, Lufawaffe and the Italian Air Force.
 
   The  F-177  Stealth  Fighter  (or  the  "Wobblin  Goblin"  as it is unkindly
 referred  to  as) is the first combat aircraft to utilise "Stealth" technology
 to  the  full.   Weapons  are  carried in internal bays.  This aircraft has no
 guns,  its fly-by-wire computer has enough of a job just keeping that shape in
 the   air.    All  forms  of  exhaust  and  intake  are  infra  red  sheilded.
 Unfortunately,  this  aircraft  is  a  pig to fly and is even worse at hitting
 targets.
 
   The  F-14  Tomcat  is a carrier-based aircraft used by the US Navy which can
 act as either a fighter or a bomber.  Its swing wings make it highly agile.

   The  F-15  Eagle is a twin jet heavyweight multi-role fighter/bomber as well
 as being an excellent dog-fighter.
 
   The F-16 Falcon can do almost anything:  from dog-fighting and ground attack
 to  nifty  air  show  routines.   This  lightly  armoured aircraft seems to be
 allergic to ground fire, although it is used more than the F-15 mostly because
 it is cheaper to build.
 
   The  F-18 Hornet is slightly more agile than the F-16.  It is used mainly as
 an aircraft carrier-based interceptor.
 
   The  F-20  Tiger  Shark  was originally designed as an updated single-engine
 version  of  the F-5 Freedom Fighter.  It is used by US Aggressor Squadrons in
 place  of enemy jets when training fighter pilots.  It is agile, lightly armed
 and  flies  like  a  rocket.  (Going up is no problem, its going down that you
 have to worry about.)

   The F-5 Freedom Fighter is currently used by smaller air forces and is often
 seen  in  films (where it is usually painted black and brandishes a little red
 star,  having been told to pretend its a Mig).  Just like its big brother, the
 F-20, the F-5 flies with all the grace and charm of a brick.
 
   The  Grummam A-6 Intruder is a carrier-based bomber which saw active service
 during  the  Vietnam  war.   It  is  unusual  in  that it has no guns or other
 defensive weaponry.
 
   The  Jaguar  Mk2  is used by both the RAF and the Italian Air Force for both
 ground  attack  and  patrol  work.  It is able to be used in most roles (well,
 ours  is  anyway).  Watch out for its brick-like flying when trying to pull up
 out of a steep bend.
 
   The  McDonald  Douglas  F-4  Phantom  is an ideal air-to-air fighter, but it
 flies  like  a  brick  (watch  out when you need to pull up quickly).  The Jet
 Strike  version  is  the  RAF variant with an arrestor hook fitted for carrier
 work.

   The  Mig-21  Fishbed is out of date, under-powered and generally bad news to
 fly:  so you get lots of them.
 
   The  Mig-29  Fulcrum  is  agile,  powerful  and  surprisingly  modern.  In a
 competent  pilots  hands  it  is  more than a match for either the F-15 or the
 F-16.
 
   The  Panavia  Tornado  F3  is not a great dog-fighter but it is an excellent
 weapons  platform  for  modern  air-to-air  missiles  and  therefore ideal for
 interceptor  work.   It  can carry all manner of weapons for both low and high
 level bombing.
 
   The Su-25 Frogfoot is the Russian equivalent of the A-20.  It has heavy-duty
 armour combined with a high-lift wing and BIG guns.

   The  SAAB  Grippen  is  (at  the time of writing) undergoing trials with the
 Swedish  Air  Force.   This aircraft will replace the SAAB Viggen (the current
 mainstay of the Swedish Air Force).  Both the Grippen and the Viggen are fully
 multi-role aircraft, able to act either as fighters or as light bombers.
 
   The  Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker is just as agile as the Mig-29 and is both heavily
 armed  and  armoured.  Despite some terrible paint jobs, it is very popular at
 air shows.

   The  AH-64 Apache is a heavyweight attack helicopter which has been designed
 to  give  and  take  heavy  punishment.   It  can take on most targets without
 needing so much as a paint job.
 
   Although  generally  regarded  as  a civilian helicopter, the Hughes 500 can
 easily  be  converted  into  a  light  attack  machine and goes by the name of
 Defender.
 
   The  Kamov  Ka-50  Werewolf  is  the latest Russian attack helicopter and is
 possibly   the   best  of  its  kind  currently  available.   It  has  a  twin
 contra-rotating  main  rotor  which  makes it highly manoeuvrable and a single
 anti-tank  gun  which  makes  it  extremely  deadly.  The Werewolf is the only
 helicopter to be fitted with an ejector seat.
 
   The Westland Lynx is a highly agile support helicopter.  It is able to carry
 troops or act as an attack or anti-tank helicopter.

 guys  in  the process)?  Well its actually a real aircraft called the Acro Jet
 and we have got one.
 
   The Focker DR-1 is the famous triplane as used by the Red Baron in the First
 World  War.   Compared  to  a  modern  aircraft  it is slow, under-powered and
 practically unarmed....but what the heck.
 
   The  Gee Bee Z Air Raver is the classic air racer.  Its a bit awkward to fly
 (it  has killed several pilots) but dont let that deter you.  The techies have
 managed to weld on a couple of hardpoints to help you out,
 
   The  Grumman  Goose  is a famous twin-engined seaplane.  it is popular among
 film  makers  and  adventurous types (because it is relatively inexpensive and
 not  too rare).  The Jet Strike Goose is well equipped to take care of itself.
 We  have  stuck  a machine gun on it along with two hardpoints so that you can
 carry up to 1,00 lb.  of weapons.

   The  original  Super  Solution  was  built  for  air racing in the 1930s.  A
 standard  equipped  version  of this machine would not be much use to a secret
 agent  like yourself, so we have stuck a machine gun on it and some hardpoints
 for weapons.
 
   The  almost  legendary  Supermarine Spitfire was used well into the 1950s in
 various forms.  The Jet Strike Spitfire is a souped up Mk 14 version with twin
 cannons and hardpoints.
 
 
                          THE VERY STRANGE SECTION 
                          ------------------------
                             
 
   Okay,  so this last one is really weird but it just goes to show what we can
 do in future Jet Strike mission disks.
 
   The  Dragon  was  reputedly flown by the Flying Toaster division of Erik the
 Not  Particularly  Nices  revered Gutbuster Army during the War of the Crinkly
 Fjord.   It  has been virtually unused for the past two millenia (apart from a
 spell  as  a British Prime Minister).  The Dragon flaps its wings and breathes
 fire.  It can land on water (having learned how to swim) and is fitted with an
 ejector  seat.  The fire-breath draws directly from your fuel supply, so equip
 it  with  a  drop  tank  if you intend to go around torching everything.  This
 mythical  Flying Beastie has no armour, liable to explode when hit, (you would
 too  if  you  were  mostly methane).  Carries up to 200 lb.  of weapons in two
 hands  (maximum 100 lb.  per hand).  Runway, grass or water (undercarriage up)
 landing.  Equipped with fly-by-wire.
 
   
                              THE FINAL SECTION 
                              -----------------
 
 
   Thats  it for all the aircraft available in Jet Strike.  We did have another
 one but someone stole it !!
 
   You  may  be wondering why so many aircraft have fly-by-wire controls (which
 are  there  to make landing easier) when normally you would have been lucky to
 find  them  fitted  with  any  controls at all.  The reason is that those nice
 techno boffins back at Base, retro fitted out most of the aircraft for you and
 wanted  to  give  you a fighting chance.  Remember to buy then a pint when (or
 should that be if) you make it back !!
