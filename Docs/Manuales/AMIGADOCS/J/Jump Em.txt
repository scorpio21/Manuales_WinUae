Jump Em

Guide a cute little yellow character called  Spud, along a path of tiles
to the exit, easy I hear you cry, but you'd be WRONG!! The idea is to
progress from level to level by jumping on and then off each tile. All
of the tiles must have disappeared before moving to the next and harder
level. Of course, there are tiles that need more than one jump to dissolve
them and some will teleport you across the screen. To help you on your way
free bridge-tiles are included, but don't get too excited, there's only
three per Spud. The action is all set against the clock. A password is
given at the start of each level, which can be used on starting up.
