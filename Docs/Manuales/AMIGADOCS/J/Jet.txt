                >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  JET !! <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<




    Well, I wasn't hearing about this lately at all, until I saw it on the
shelf! Havent even played it much yet just for the sake of getting it posted 
for You. Ain't even gonna format this doc file in any way, just hope ya can 
read it OK. This is probably, like, man, like 98% of the manual for Jet, and
was posted FIRST here on TARDIS, the BEST Amiga BBS on the Planet!

    

___________________________________________________________________________

                              INTRODUCTION

   Jet for the Amiga is the latest entry in SubLogic's line of aircraft 
simulations. This program is based on IBM Jet (released in 1985) , but it
owes much to Amiga Flight Simulator II and to Radar Raiders, a never-
released product. Like IBM Jet, it is a simulation of both the F-16
Fighting Falcon and the F-18 Hornet jet fighters. These jets have tremendous 
power and agility and are easy to fly. Enemy targets include Soviet MIG-21
and MIG-23 jet fighters and Kynda class missile cruisers. There are also 
numerous ground targets, some with the capability to return fire. 

   Free flight, target strike and dogfight modes are available for both the
F-16 (land based) and F-18 (sea based) jet fighters. The F-16 also supports 
a combined attack mode featuring both enemy MIGs and hostile ground targets.
Like Amiga Flight Simulator II, this Jet program has a multiplayer option
which allows you to fly with or dogfight against another player flying
Jet on another computer. Amiga Jet is also scenery disk compatible.

   In order to get you flying quickly, the first section of this manual
presents the Jet's instruments, controls, and flying techniques. Skim the front 
section of this manual to familiarize yourself with Jet and to begin flying
and dogfighting. Once you are comfortable with the program, you can read the 
more detailed sections of the manual.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              RUNNING JET

    Jet can be loaded with a cold boot, or from workbench by double clicking 
the icon, of from CLI by insering Jet in any drive, making that drive the
default drive and typing "JET" and pressing [RETURN]. 
   Note however, that the latter two means will not work unless you are
"scum", ie, have at least one Meg or more of memory for your Amiga.

   A joysick may optionally be plugged in port two, if you desire.

  Warning lights:
   G -------- gear down
   R -------- red out. If frame load drops below -3G's, you will "red out due
              to blood rushing to your head. You will be unable to control
              the jet until frame load decreases. This flashes when you are 
              about to red out.
   B -------- blackout. If frame load exceeds 9G's, you will black out due 
              to insufficient blood flow to yer head. Like red out, you lose 
              control, indicator flashes just before blackout.
   C -------- crash warning. If this indicator flashes as you come in for a 
              landing, you will crash! Pull up, or level off to touch down 
              safely, and be sure yer gear is down.
   F -------- Fuel low. Less than 5% fuel when flashing. Return to nearest
              base to refuel.
   M -------- Missile locked! Flashes when an ENEMY missile is locked on to
              YOUR jet. A beep increases in frequency as yer would-be downfall
              ie, enemy missile, approaches closer and closer.....
   E -------- enemy alert. Flashes when an enemy MIG is detected within
              approximately 2 1/2 miles of yer jet.


 Jets Remaining:
   These icons indicate the number of jets you have remaining in combat 
scenarios. You earn another jet for every 10,000 points scored.

 Score and Level:
   You earn points for destroying enemy targets in combat scenarios. Refer to 
the combat descriptions to determine the point values awarded.
   Your current skill level is also shown here. Skill level is increased
with each sortie completed.

 ADF and DME GUAGES:
   ADF stands for Automatic Direction Finder. Your home base is always
equipped with an ADF broadcaster to which your ADF guage is automatically 
tuned. When the needle is ponting straight up, you are flying directly 
toward the base. 
   DME stands for Distance Measuring Equipment. This guage displays the 
distance to your base in tenths of a mile.

 YOKE POSITION:
   A red cursor indicates the position of your control yoke relative to 
center. If it is above center, the jet is nosing up. When below center, the 
jet is nosing down. A cursor positioned to the left or right of center 
indicates that the jet is banking left or right, respectively.

 ALTIMETER:
   This scrolling guage indicates your altitude in feet above ground level
(AGL).

 CLOCK:
   The clock shows time of day. To change hours, minutes, or seconds, 
position the mouse cursor over the appropriate didits and click the left
mouse button to increment to the desired time. Jet operates in both day 
and night visual flight modes. Day lasts from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM.

 COMPASS:
   The compass displays the jet's magnetic heading (0 to 359) where 
0 degrees indicates north, 90 degrees is east, 180 degrees is south, and 
270 degrees is west.

 THROTTLE:
   The throttle guage shows the throttle setting as a percentage. This 
guage turns red when afterburners are engaged. 

 THRUST:
   The thrust guage shows the amount of thrust currently being generated
as a percentage of maximum possible thrust (without afterburners).
Maximum thrust is increased when afterburners are on.

 FUEL:
   This shows the percentage of fuel remaining.

 FRAME LOAD:
   Frame load measures the force exerted on the aircraft perpendicular to
the wing surface. This force is measured in Gs, where one G equals the force 
of gravity. If frame load is a negative value, the force is applied upward 
with respect to the wing. This instrument is important because of the human 
body's limited tolerance to high acceleration. If frame load exceeds 9 Gs, 
you will black out due to blood draining from your head. If frame load drops 
below -3 Gs, you will red out due to blood rushing to your head. Either 
condition causes you to temporarily lose control of the jet.

 ORDNANCE:
   This shows the currently selected weapon and the remaining quantity of 
that weapon. A red icon indicates an available weapon. A white icon 
indicates the weapon has recently been fired.

 AIRSPEED:
   The airspeed indicator displays airspeed in Mach number.

 RANGE CIRCLE:
   The range circle is an optional part of the Heads Up Display (HUD). It is
toggled on and off by pressing the [O] key.
   The range circle is used as an aid to determine distance to enemy targets. 
A white range circle indicates enemy targets are present but not nearby. An 
increasing percentage of the circle turns red as enemy targets come within 
range and approach your aircraft. The range circle is replaced by a black
cross when no enemies are present.

 ATTITUDE INDICATOR:
   The attitude indicator is an optional part of the HUD. It is toggled on
and off by pressing the [I] key.
   The attitude indicator shows the orientation of your aircraft with 
respect to the ground. A scale of lines in 20 degree increments both above
and below the horizon indicate the pitch of the aircraft. Blue lines are 
displayed above the horizon, red lines below. A split white line indicates the 
horizon line itself, while single points at the top and bottom of the scale
indicate a 90 degree pitch attitude. The aircraft's bank angle is displayed 
by rotation of the pitch scale. The attitude indicator is very useful when
the horizon is not visible outside the window.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              3D WINDOWS

   The center screen area is usually occupied by the three-dimensional 
out-the-window display. This area is used for all 3D windows and the optional 
map display. Up to two 3D windows plus the map display may be located in 
this area.
   A 3D window is selected or brought up by pressing a function key. Press
[F1] to select the main 3D window, [F2] for the second 3D window, and [F3] for
the map display. The currently selected 3D window is highlighted by a blue
border. Unselected windows have white borders. Zoom and view controls apply
to the selected window ONLY. If you want to change zoom or view mode on 
another window, you must first select the desired window by pressing the
appropriate function key.
   You can zoom in and out on any 3D window view. Select the window you'd like 
to adjust and press either the [+] or [F10] to zoom in, and [-] or [F9] to
zoom out. The [+] and [-] keys adjust zoom in very fine increments, while
[F10] and [F9] adjust zoom very coarsely. Press the [Backspace] key to 
automatically reset the zoom factor to 1X.
   All three-dimensional windows can be moved and sized with the mouse. To move
a window, click and hold on the title bar area at the top of the window with
the left mouse button, and drag the window to the desired position. To change
the size of a window, click and hold on the "invisible"size box at the 
lower right corner of the window and move the cursor to the desired position.
To close a window, click on the "invisible" close box at the upper left 
corner of the window. You may also close a window by quickly pressing the 
corresponding function key twice.
   You may go to a full screen three-dimensional dispaly by pressing the [W]
key. This removes all instrumentation and allows the whole screen to be used
for 3D displays. Press [W] again to return to the standard display.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               MAP DISPLAY

   Pressing the [F3] key displays a map of the area over which you are flying. 
This window can be sized or moved like the other windows. Press [F3] twice in
rapid succession (or click on the "invisible" close box) to turn off the 
map display.
   You can zoom in and out in the map display to view more detail or a 
greater area. Make sure that the map display is the selected window (ie, it has
the blue border), and press [F10] to zoom in and [F9] to zoom out. Use the 
[+] and [-] keys to zoom in very ine increments. Press [Backspace] to reset
the zoom factor to 1X.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              RADAR DISPLAY

   Press the [F4] key to turn on the radar display. Its size is fixed, unlike 
the true 3D windows, but you can adjust the zoom factor by pressing [SHIFT-F9]
to zoom out and [SHIFT-F10] to zoom in. The radius of the radar sweep is shown
at the bottom of the radar display. Press [F4] twice or click on the 
"invisible" close box to turn off the radar display.
   Colored dots have the following meanings on the radar display:

           white dot = enemy MIG
           green dot = unlocked enemy missile
           red dot = locked enemy missile
           blue dot = friendly missile
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     PRESET WINDOW CONFIGURATIONS

   Because of the many view modes and windows available in Jet, you may want
to frequently change window configurations. Ten default window configurations 
are available, all of which are user-definable. Press a number key between 
0 and 9 (on keyboard, not keypad) to select from among the ten preset 
configurations. If you set up a different configuration and would like to 
save it, press [SHIFT] and a number key to save it. You may then recall it 
by pressing that number key. 
   All windows (3D, map, radar display) and their associated zoom factors, 
view directions, and view modes, are saved as part of a window configuration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            VIEW CONTROLS

   Jet allows a wide range of viewing options. You can look from the cockpit 
in nine directions, or view the jet from a number of different external views. 
Enemy aircraft lock, full screen, or missile's-eye views are also available.
Title bars identifying each current window can be toggled on and off by 
pressing the [M] key. Remember that view controls apply to the selected
window only.

Cockpit View - [X]
   In cockpit mode, the display is from the viewpoint of the pilot. You can 
look in nine different directions by using the view direction control keys
(all keys surrounding and inclucing the [G] key, like FSII). To return to 
cockpit view from any other view, press the [X] key or any other view direction 
key.

External and Miscellaneous Views:
 - Spot Mode - [S]
     In spot mode, your jet is viewed by a spot plane flying in formation
off your right wing. This aircraft tracks you through all aerobatic 
maneuvers and keeps the view locked on your cockpit.

 - Control Tower Mode - [C]
     In control tower mode, your jet is viewed from a control tower on the 
ground. The view remains locked on your cockpit.

 - Track Mode - [D]
     Track mode is just like control tower mode except that the control tower
follows you if you fly far away.

 - Place Tower at Jet - [Q]
     Selecting this view option sets the control tower's location at the 
current jet  position. This is useful if you want to view your jet from the 
control tower vantage point, but are very high up or very far away. Press the
[C] key to return the tower to its original position.

 - Lock View Behind Jet - [Z]
     This is similar to spot mode, but the view is from a spot plane located
directly behind your jet.

 - View Locked MIG - [E]
     This mode locks your view onto an enemy MIG after you have successfully 
locked onto it (its tracking box appears black). Even if the lock is later
broken, the view remains on the MIG.

 - Missile's-Eye View - [A]
     This mode shos the view from the vantage point of the most recently fired
missile. If more than one active missile is in flight, you may press the [A] 
key to switch between active missile viewpoints.

 - Full Screen View - [W]
     This eliminates all instruments, allowing the whole screen to be used for
3D views. This is particularly useful when viewing scenery and performing
aerobatics, but it can be dangerous to engage in a dogfight without the
benefit of instruments. Press [W] again to return to the standard view.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               FLYING JET
                           
   "Fly by wire" refers to a system of aircraft control in which the pilot 
sends steering commands to a computer which in turn generates actual elevator
and aileron movement. All the pilot has to do is point the aircraft in the 
desired direction and the computer will keep it flying that way. Because the 
F-16 can generate more pounds of thrust than it weighs, it can actually
accelerate vertically, and is thus considered ballistic. This allows any
angle of controlled flight.

                               CONTROLS

   The Jet has five controls for flight operations. All of these are 
controllable from the keyboard. Some are controllable using the mouse or 
joystick. Press the [F6] key to put the mouse in control yoke mode, and
[F6] again to return to cursor mode. Plug a joystick into port two to 
enable joystick control. 
   
   The THROTTLE controls engine thrust. Press the keypad [3] and [9] keys to
decreade or increase thrust respectively. To cutoff thrust, hold down the 
[SHIFT] key and press the keypad [3] key. To go to full thrust, hold down
the [SHIFT] key and press the keypad [9] key. To activate afterburners, press 
the keypad [9] key one more time when the throttle guage reads 100%. Press the
keypad [3] key once to deactivate afterburners.
   (If the mouse is selected as the control, by toggling [F6], it works similar
to the mouse in FSII: hold down left button and roll mouse up to increase 
thrust, down to decrease, left to bank left, etc. The joystick does not
affect thrust at all.)
   
   The ELEVATOR controls the aircraft's pitch attitude. Press the keypad [2]
key to pitch the aircraft up, and the keypad [8] key to pitch down.
(mouse and joystick, push up or pull down.)

   AILERONS control the jet's bank angle. Press the keypad [4] to bank the 
aircraft left or turn counterclockwise. To bank right, or turn clockwise, 
press keypad [6].

   When using the keypad for elevator/aileron control, note that the more 
times you press a control key, the faster the aircraft rotates. Press keypad
[5] to stop rotation about both axes. Hold down the [SHIFT] key and press
keypad [5] to gradually decrease bank and level off the jet. Press [SHIFT-5]
again to gradually level off pitch as well. Pressing any other elevator or 
aileron control key halts this automatic return to straight and level flight.
(Mouse and joystick left for left, right for right...).

   LANDING GEAR must be down for all ground maneuvering. Press the [U] key to
raise or lower the landing gear. When flying, the gear should be up to
reduce the drag on your aircraft and allow for greater airspeed. If you 
attempt to land with your gear up, you will crash.

   The AIRBRAKE is used for landings and for quick midair deceleration. Press
keypad [0] to activate the airbrake. Hold it down to continue braking action.
The airbrake will turn off automatically.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 EJECTION

   In extreme emergencies (fuck-ups), it may become necessary to to bail out of
the aircraft. Press [SHIFT-E] to eject from the jet. If you are about to crash,
you will be automatically ejected immediately upon impact. (Hmmm...)
        -- use control tower view or spot mode to watch yourself
           drift into the enemy's re-education camps.
        -- press [SHIFT-N] to end this sad scene and return to base 
           immediately.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             SAMPLE FLIGHT

   To begin a sample flight, load jet and make the following menu selections:
            select scenario --------- [4] for F-16 Combined Attack
                skill level --------- [0] for Practice Mode

   Press [5] to exit the arming menu. You will now see the flight mode display, 
including the out-the-window view and HUD instruments. Note that you may press 
[P] at any time to pause the simulation, and press [P] again to resume.

1.  Press [I] to turn on the attitude indicator. This superimposes pitch-
markings over the out-the-window display.

2.  Look around by pressing the view direction keys (keys [R] [F] [V] [B] [N]
[H] [Y] and [T] to return to forward view).

3.  View your plane from the control tower by pressing [C]. Press [F10] several
times to zoom in, then [F9] to zoom back out. Press [Backspace] to return to 
1X zoom factor.

4.  Press [S] to view your plane from a spotter plane off your right wing.
Press [X] to return to cockpit view.

5.  Look at the various preset window configurations by pressing keyboard keys
[2] through [0]. Press [1] to return to the original configuration.

6.  Press [SHIFT-9] (on the keypad) to give full throttle. Press [9] again to
activate afterburners.

7.  After about ten seconds, press keypad [2] several times to start pitching
up (or use mouse or joystick...). Press keypad [5] to stop pitching at about
ten dgrees positive pitch.

8.  Press [S] to go to spot mode, then press [U] to raise your gear. Note that
the gear goes up and you gain more airspeed. Press [I] to turn off the attitude 
indicator.

9.  Press keypad [4] to begin a left bank. After one or two seconds, press 
keypad [5] to stop increasing bank angle. Watch your jet turn and note the 
scenery in the background. Press [X] to return to cockpit view.

10. When the brown mountain range comes into view (heading about 40 degrees),
press [SHIFT-keypad 5] to come out of your bank. Press [SHIFT-keypad 5] again 
to level off pitch.

11.  Bring the mouse cursor down to the green clock digits. Point and click
on the "hours" digits with the left mouse button until they read "20" (8:00PM).
It is now night. Bank again to view the moon and stars and constellations.

12.  Come out of your bank and head along the river through the mountains to 
the ocean. It may be helpful to zoom out once (press [F9]) for a wider field of
view.

13.  Press the [Spacebar] to to fire your current weapon and [RETURN] to select
the next one. Bombs drop quickly out of sight, while missiles streak out to the
horizon. If you see any enemy MIGs, you MIGHT want to fire several missiles
at them.

14.  As you near the mountains, you might try to fly between them. Don't worry 
about crashing if you are on skill level Zero.

15.  Note the ADF and DME guages at the top right of the screen. The DME digits
display the distance to your home base. The ADF needle points in the direction
of home base. Turn until the ADF needle is pointing straight up. This indicates
that you are headed directly for home base. Try to fly back there.

16.  Click on the "hours" digits again with the mouse until they read "06"
(6:00 AM). It is now day.

17.  Your home base should soon come into view. TRY to align yourself with a 
runway and come on in for a landing.

18.  Press and hold on the keypad [3] key until the throttle decreases to about
30%. Press [U] to lower your gear. Use keypad [4] and [6] keys to align with 
the runway, and keypad [8] key to pitch down as you come in for what's supposed
to be a landing. If you need to lose speed rapidly, press keypad [0] to 
activate your airbrakes. 

19.  Once you have landed, press [SHIFT-keypad 3] to cut your throttle, then
press and hold keypad [0] until you stop moving. This completes your flight.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      TAKEOFF AND LANDING ON THE CARRIER

   When you select the F-18, you start out on the deck of a Nimitz-class
aircraft carrier. Superimposed over a forward view of the launch catapult is 
the message:
                   "Press SHIFT-L to launch from catapult"

   First increase throttle to full thrust with afterburners on. Then press
[SHIFT-L] to launch; the jet will be released and will accelerate rapidly
down the deck. Pull back on the elevator as airspeed increases. When the 
F-18 clears the bow of the carrier the nose will come up and you will start
gaining altitude.

   In order to rearm or refuel the F-18, you must land back on the carrier. 
To do this, you should try to position yourself about 3 miles west and slightly
south of the carrier on a heading of 80 degrees. As you approach the carrier, 
the landing strip should become visible to the left of the superstructure,
angled slightly north with respect to the ship's hull. Lower your landing gear
and engage the airbrakes to reduce airspeed. Keep the jet parallel to the 
landing strip by banking left or right, and aim your nose for the stern of the
carrier by pitching up or down. Reduce throttle to about 20% to cut airspeed 
even more. Use your airbrakes if you need to decrease speed very rapidly. If 
you begin losing altitude too soon, increase the throttle. If your approach 
speed is too fast, decrease throttle. When the red and white dashed
centerline of the landing strip becomes visible, aim for the grey tripwire to 
the left of the superstructure. As you pass over the stern of the ship, 
begin to flare by slowly raising the jet's nose, and try to touch down
just short of the tripwire. If you catch the tripwire, the jet will stop
abruptly andyou will be returned to the launch catapult. In combat modes,
you may then press [SHIFT-R] to return to the armament menu.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              WEAPON SYSTEMS

   In either combat mode, once you've selected a skill level, the arming menu
then appears as:

             Select Armament:
             
             (1) AIM-9 Missile            4 X 160 lbs.
             (2) AIM-7 Missile            4 X 500 lbs.
             (3) AGM-65 Missile           4 X 460 lbs.
             (4) MK-82 Bomb               4 X 500 lbs.

   For the F-16 the following weight data appears below the menu:

                F-16 Empty        :       14000 lbs
             Internal Fuel        :        3700 lbs.
           Armament Weight        :        6480 lbs.
              Total Weight        :       24180 lbs.

   Corresponding figures are displayed for the F-18 when that jet is selected.

   Choose your weapons by pressing the appropriate number key. Each time you 
make a selection, the number to the right of that weapon is incremented by
one and your total weight is increased accordingly. If you select more than
five of one weapon, that weapon's counter resets to zero.

   Press [5] to exit the arming menu once you've finished selecting your
weapons. Note that the combined weight of the selected weapons affects the 
performance and flight characteristics of your jet. As you burn fuel and fire
weapons, your weight decreases and the jet becomes more maneuverable. When 
flying the F-16, you can return to the arming menu at any time by landing at
your home base and pressing [SHIFT-R]. In the F-18 you must catch the tripwire
on the carrier's landing deck before you can rearm by pressing [SHIFT-R].
After rearming the F-18, you will be replaced on the launch catapult.


  Dogfight Armament:
   AIM-9 SideWinder ------- short range- 5 miles.

  Range Circle (middle of the screen):
   the %age of red in this circle indicates range; if all white, out of range.
   Use this sight for cannon and missile launch. If there's no circle, but a black
   cross instead, ther're no more enemies, return to base.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                DOGFIGHT

                            Object and Rules

   Dogfight is a 3 dimensional combat scenario that pits you against Soviet
MIG-21's and MIG-23 fighter aircraft. They are equipped with Atoll air to
air missiles, while you can select from a variable arsenal of AIM-9
SideWinders and/or AIM-7 Sparrow missiles, along with your 20MM Vulcan
cannon. Your mission is to engage and shoot down all enemy aircraft at the
skill level you selected, then return to home base for refueling and rearming
as required. If your mission has been a success, a new wave of enemy aircraft
will then appear at the next higher level. As your skill level increases, 
you will face more difficult enemy MIGs on each sortie.

   You earn 1000 points for each MIG-21 and 1500 points for each MIG-23 you
shoot down. These two different types of aircraft can be distinguished by
shape and color. The MIG-23 is bulkier, with swept-back wings, and a brown
fuselage. The MIG-21 has a gray fuselage. If you shoot down an enemy aircraft
before returning to base, you earn a 3000 point bonus. You get another jet
for every 10,000 points scored.

   A warning beeper sounds and the missile warning indicator light flashes if
an enemy missile comes within the danger threshold of your aircraft. If your
jet is fatally damaged by an Atoll missile, the screen will flash red and
orange, and your jet will spin out of control. You have sedonds to eject 
begore your jet explodes and the game is over. If you eject in time, you will
float safely back to earth, and given a new jet. Note that an enemy missile 
hit is not necessarily fatal, particularly at lower skill levels. You may
be able to sustain several hits before you have to eject. You will know that
a hit is fatal when the screen flashes orange and red. Once all of your
earned jets have been shot down, you are grounded, and the game is over.

                              Enemy Aircraft  

   Enemy aircraft will come at you from the south at the start of each mission.
You may encounter either MIG-21s or MIG-23s depending on your skill level.
The MIG-21 is less maneuverable than your jet, but can fly at about the same
speed. The MIG-23 is faster than your jet and is quite maneuberable. The skill
level you choose determines the type and number of aircraft you must shoot
down. The more advanced the skill level, the more MIG-23s you will face.

   During a dogfight, the MIGs will track you and firee their Atoll air to air
missiles. Missiles also track your jet, and will detonate their warheads if
they come WITHIN THE HIT RADIUS of your aircraft. MIGs will take evasive 
action if they detect that they have been locked onto by your weapon systems.

   You must select the appropriate weapon system (AIM-7, AIM-9 missiles or 
M-61 cannon) to target and shoot down an enemy aircraft. Press [RETURN] to
select an appropriate weapon system. A MIG will be highlighted by a white 
tracking box when it comes within range of your weapon system. You must 
position the range circle over the targeting box to lock onto the MIG. When
your weapon system locks onto the MIG, the tracking box will turn black.
Press the SpaceBar to fire the selected weapon. The traacking box will turn 
red to indicate that the MIG is now being tracked by a missile. When your 
weapon system has locked onto a MIG, your missiles are able to track it
and the probability of destroying it is greatly increased. If you fire a 
missile at an unlocked MIG, it is unlikely (but possible) that it will
be destroyed.
   
   After shooting down all opponents, or if you run out of weapons, you
will have to return to home base. Any remaining MIGs will chase you until
you enter the safe zone surrounding your base. Once you have landed, 
press [SHIFT-R] to refuel, rearm and repair your aircraft.

                            Dogfight Strategies

   The primary combat strategy of enemy MIG pilots is to get behind you.
If you can anticipate the direction of their flight, you will be better 
able to lock onto and destroy them. It may be useful to zoom in to determine 
aircraft type when MIGs are far away, and to zoom out as far as possible to
get a wider field of view when they are nearby. You can also use the 
missile's eye view to gather information on approaching aircraft. As your 
missile approaches the target, you should be able to determine if it is a 
MIG-21 or MIG-23. Remember that MIG-23s are faster and more maneuverable.

   You may find it useful to preconfigure the display windows before going
into battle. You can set up a front and back view to see as much area as
possible, or perhaps a control tower view to get an overall picture of 
the battle.

   You can turn off all non-essential scenery during combat to increase 
animation time and improve response to your control inputs. Press [K] to
toggle non-essential scenery details off and on.
  
   Although missiles are very effective for destroying MIGs at a distance, 
your gun is more effective in close combat. Since bullets cannot track a 
target, you will have to lead the target a bit. You can fire your gun at 
any time, regardless of which weapon is selected, by pressing the [.] key.

   Always be prepared to evade an enemy missile. If you hear the missile 
warning beeper, bring up the radar display (press F4) to see how near it is. 
The best way to evade a missile is by changing direction, causing it to burn 
fuel, or by flying straight up if you have enough velocity. Be careful of 
missiles launched from a faraway MIG. You don't want to get destroyed before
the battle begins!

   If you suffer a fatal missile hit (flashing orange and red screen), eject
immediately. Your jet has already been lost, and the game will be over if 
you don't eject in time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             TARGET STRIKE

                           Object and Rules

   In the target strike game, your mission is to seek and destroy all enemy
ground targets. In F-16 flight mode, targets are randomly chosen from a set
of fuel depots, factories, and missile silos. In F-18 mode, the targets are
Kynda-class Soviet missile cruisers randomly placed in the water south of
your carrier. Each target will be designated by a white tracking box. All
targets are protected by Surface-toAir Missile (SAM) launchers. Once a SAM
site has been identified, it will be shown on the HUD by angled brackets
( <  > ). Your ordnance can include both AGM-65 air-to-ground missiles and
MK-82 smart bombs. Press the [RETURN] key to cycle through your available 
weapons and select the one you'd like to use. 

   Turning on the range circle automatically activates the ground targeting 
computer. As you fly, the range circle indicates the distance from your jet
to the point on the ground that intersects your current flight path. If the
distance is greater than the range of your selected weapon, the range circle 
shows all white. When you come within range of a target, (range circle turns
partially red), you should maneuver your aircraft until the tracking box of 
the desired target is in the center of the range circle, and then press the
[Spacebar] to release your weapon. The weapon willl track that point to the 
ground. If the target is within the hit radius of the weapon, it will be
destroyed.

   You earn 1,000 points for each target you destroy. A bonus of 3,000 points 
is awarded if you destroy all enemy targets before returning to base, and
another jet is awarded for every  10,000 points scored. Upon successfully 
completing a sortie, the skill level is automatically increased. Enemy SAM
sites launch  missiles more often as skill level increases.

                            SURFACE-to-AIR-MISSILES

   Enemy SAM launchers are only capable of detecting your presence within
the conical airspace directly above them. If you pass within this airspace, 
they will track your jet and launch their missiles. Because of this you 
should fly as low as possible when nearing your target. A warning beeper will
sound if an enemy missile comes within the danger threshold of your aircraft.
Your jet will sustain damage if you are hit with a SAM. The hit may or may 
not be fatal, depending on your chosen skill level. If the hit is fatal, 
the screen will flash red and orange and the jet will spin out of control.
You have seconds to eject before the aircraft explodes and the game is over.
If you eject in time you will float safely back to earth, where you will be
recovered (how nice!) and given a new jet to continue the mission. Once all
your earned jets have been shot down, you are grounded and the game is over,
Bud.

                          TARGET STRIKE STRATEGIES 

   If you are having diffculty locating targets, zoom all the way out to get
a wider view. Zoom in a bit to improve your firing accuracy as you approach 
the target. When firing air-to-ground weapons, it is important to remember
that aiming errors are magnified at shallow pitch angles. Approaching the 
target from steeper angles will allow you to deviate slightly from the target 
and still impact the ground near it, but this will also place you in greater
danger of being detected by enemy SAM launchers.

   When you hear the missile warning beeper, a missile is probably very near
to hitting you. You should turn sharply, or fly upward if you have enough 
velocity. If a missile hits you and the screen border flashes red and orange,
eject immediately. Thass part of yer strategy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           COMBINED ATTACK

                          Object and Rules

   The combined attack simulation features both ground and airborne threats.
Since I ain't gonna try to draw the primitive maps in the book, try looking at
yer map view for this part: You begin at the base to the south. It is 
generally best to fly a counter-clock-wise circle, and begin by flying toward the 
mountains to your northeast where an enemy base and numerous SAM sites are
located. By the time you reach the base, you will probably encounter airborne
resistance from MIGs flying in from other enemy airbases. Destroy these as 
necessary, but remember that more will follow. There are many targets along 
the sea and river, as well as enemy SAM sites. When all primary ground targets
are destroyed, you will be notified, so that you can return to base for
rearming and refueling. The skill level will then automatically increase, 
ground targets will be replaced, and you can fly the next round.

                      Combined Attack Strategies

   Your objective is to destroy all primary ground targets. This allows you to
advance to the next wave. Your jet cannot carry enough bombs to destroy all
ground targets without rearming, but if you destroy all PRIMARY targets you
will earn a sortie bonus. You may rearm and refuel at either your home base or 
the civilian airport to the north of the river. You will encounter fewer MIGs 
at lower skill levels; if you can eliminate all of them you will be able to
destroy the ground targets without resistance (until more MIGs return!). More
powerful MIGs are encountered as skill level increases, so you will hafta evade
their fire in order to destroy the ground targets. It may also be necessary to
destroy the enemy SAM sites in order to safely reach some of your targets.
Remember that enemy SAM sites are indicated on the HUD by angled brackets
( <  > ).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             MULTIPLAYER

   The multiplayer option enables two players using separate machines to fly 
and dogfight together. Communications between the machines is thru the 
Amiga's serial port.

                  Establishing Modem Communications

    Making a connection between modems is don entirely within the Jet
program. Select "Multiplayer Dogfight" from the main menu to go to the 
multiplayer menu. Select baud rate by clicking on the appropriate box on the
right side of the menu. You will probably want to use a 300, 1200, or 2400
baud rate, depending on what YOUR modem can HANDLE! Now, one of you must make
the phone call, and the other must answer. 

   If you are both using Hayes-compatible modems, use the following procedure:
the person answering need only click on the "Wait for ring" box and wait for 
the phone call to come through. The person making the call may click on the 
"Dial" box and then enter the phone number in the message box which will come 
up. (Note that there is a ">" symbol to the left of the message line. This 
signifies that characters will be sent to the modem, rather than the other 
player. More on that later.)  Press [RETURN] to make the phone call. If all 
goes well, the number will be dialed, and, when a modem connection has been 
established, the message "CONNECT" will be displayed on the bottom line of the
message box. This indicates that the computers are ready to communicate.
Appropriate information, such as coordinates, is now being sent between
machines. 

   You can send a command to the modem any time by bringing up the message box
and entering ">" as the first character. This instructs Jet to send the line to
the modem rather than the other player.

                              DOGFIGHTING

   Once you have established commucnications, you are ready to begin multi-
player dogfight. Your jet will be fully-armed, with AIM-7 and AIM-9 missiles.
Both you and your opponent's jet will be randomly placed within a fixed area in 
the multiplayer database. 

   There are a few functional differences in multiplayer dogfight mode. Your
ADF guage is automatically tuned to point at the other player's aircraft, and
the DME digits display his distance. The View Locked MIG view mode will always 
track the other player's plane, even if it is not locked. The number of hits 
you can sustain is dependent on your skill level. You may fly at a different
skill level than your opponent, if you like to cheat.

   You may refuel, rearm and repair at the base at any time by landing and
pressing [SHIFT-R], but you will be particularly vulnerable to your opponent
when coming in for a landing. Both jets are automatically refueled, rearmed,
and repaired when one is shot down.

   You receive 100 points each time you hit the other player, and 1000 points 
for destroying his aircraft. The game ends when one player loses all his jets.

                        Sending and Receiving Messages
   
   You may send messages to each other by clicking on the "messages/talk to 
modem" box on the multiplayer menu. (If the multiplayer menu is not active, 
press [F5] to bring it up.) A message box appears which will accept text to
be sent to the other player. When you bring up the message box, all characters 
typed will be directed THERE, and will NOT have any effect on your flight.
You can switch from entering messages to controlling your jet by pressing the 
[F7] key. This causes all keys to have their normal effect. It also makes the
message box cursor disappear to indicate that keys are functioning normally. 
Press the [F7] key again to return to message mode. The cursor will reappear,
and keypresses will be directed to the message box.

   Press [RETURN] to send your message. The message will be sent to the other
player and the top line of the message box will be cleared. You may enter 
another message if you like, or you may close the box to exit the message mode.
If you are sending a very long message, it will be sent in pieces as you 
overrun the message box. The message box can accomodate 49 characters, so 
after you type your 50th character, the first 49 characters will be sent and
your message line will be cleared, so you can continue entering text. 

   Messages received from the other player will be displayed on the bottom line
of the message box. If you receive a message from the other player while your
message box is not active, it will be brought up automatically for you. If
you want to respond to the message, you can do so in the normal way, or you 
can colse the box after reading the message.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                MEDALS

   In all combat scenarios, you are awarded medals for specific achievements.
You are awarded a Silver Star for each enemy MIG you shoot down, and an
Air Medal for each sortie you successfully complete. Each time your jet gets
shot down, but you manage to return safely, you are awarded the Purple Heart
for injuries suffered after ejecting into enemy territory. Other medals may
be awarded for other achievements; you will learn about these as you earn them.
Press the [~] key to see the medals display. Pressing any key exits the medals
display.
   No medals are awarded at skill level zero.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           LOADING SCENERY DISKS

   To load a FSII scenery disk, select game mode [8] from the main menu. A
display will prompt you for both the north and east coordinates.

   Insert the scenery disk into any drive. Then check that disk's maps and
documentation to determine the coordinates of the place you'd like to start 
from. Enter the north coordinate and press [RETURN], then enter the east
coordinate and press [RETURN] again. The scenery disk will load into memory
and you may continue with normal menu selections. The FSII disk itself may also
be used as a scenery disk in this way.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Ed. comments:)
   >whew<
  The only things I haven't typed in now, are some maps and pictures, the 
pictures only illustrate the things covered here, and the maps I think you can
use your own on Jet to look at. Also I didnt type in all of the multiplayer
stuff, ie, hooking up two machines directly with a null cable, and instructions
for those unfortunate few who don't have Hayes-compatible modems. Refer to
the FSII instructions, if ya can, I think the procedures are the same.
    Then, there's the "History of Fighter Jets" which appears on the last
3 1/2 pages. Subscribe to Time-Life.
    Nor was this documentation formatted in any way. I just used TxEd, for
some strange reason, and didnt bother with page numbers or the table of
contents.
    Everything else, as far as I know, has been covered. I went sequentially 
right along with the manual and typed verbatim as much as possible.

    .....the only thing that seems peculiar is I havent found ANY defensive 
countermeasure equipment, such as flares or sunburst or electronic jamming. 
DAMN! Whut the Fuck?? Oh, well....



   ....now, WHERE IS GUNSHIP??!

 Enjoy,
