                ------------------------------------------


			   - OCEANIC TIMES - 
	MAYBE TAKES OVER TOY FACTORY AND HOLDS WORLD TO RANSOM.

IN A NEW BID FOR WORLD DOMINATION, THE EVIL DOCTOR MAYBE HAS TAKEN OVER 
THE MAIN NORTH POLE BASED TOY FACTORY AND HAS SABOTAGED MANY OF THE TOYS
DESTINED FOR HOMES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THIS CHRISTMAS.
AS YET,WE DO NOT KNOW HIS DEMANDS, BUT WORLD LEADERS ARE MEETING AS A MATTER
OF URGENCY TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN AN AFFORT TO AVERT HIS TREACHEROUS 
THREATS. 

GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN HAVE NOT BEEN AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT; HOWEVER, 
WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS CANCELLED ALL MEETINGS AND THIS   
MORNING LEFT FOR WASHINGTON WHERE IT IS BELIEVED HE WILL BE MEETING UP 
WITH THE PRESIDENT AND OTHER WORLD LEADERS.
RUMOURS EMERGED FROM WHITEHALL LAST LIGHT THAT SECURITY SERVICES HAVE BEEN
PUT ON ALERT AND THAT THE HIGHLY SECRETIVE SUCCESSFULL F.1.5.H UNDERWATER 
ESPIONAGE AGENCY HAS BEEN CONTACTED. 

DOCTOR MAYBE STRIKES DREAD IN THE HEARTS OF US ALL, BUT HAVING BEEN 
THWARTED IN THE PAST BY F.1.5.H, IT WAS BELIEVED THAT HE HAD GIVEN UP
ALL HOPE OF FUTURE DASTARDLY ACTIVITIES. IT SEEMS, HOW EVER, THAT HIS EARLIER
FAILURES HAVE MADE HIM MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER TO DOMINATE THE WORLD STAGE.

PRESIDENT OF NORTH POLE TOYS INC., MR. S CLAUS, WHO NARROWLY ESCAPED FROM 
MAYBE'S ABLE CLUTCHES AND FIRST BROUGHT THE NEWS TO THE OCEANIC TIMES SAID
LAST NIGHT... ' THIS IS TERRIBLE NEWS, OUR WHOLE YEAR'S SUPPLY WAS READY FOR
DISPATCH WHEN WE WERE OVERWHELMED BY MAYBE AND HIS GANG. ' PRESSED FURTHER 
BY OUR TOP REPORTER LEWIS LEAN, CLAUS SAID THAT HE HAD LITTLE FAITH IN WORLD
GOVERNMENTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE WORLD SAFETY 
THIS XMAS WAS TO LET F.1.5.H DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM. 

LEWIS LEAN, THE ONLY KNOWN PERSON OUTSIDE OF WORLD LEADERS TO HAVE MADE 
CONTACT WITH F.1.5.H, SPECULATES THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO PUT THEIR TOP AGENT
ONTO THE CASE, JAMES POND. HE HAS HAD DEALINGS WITH MAYBE BEFORE AND KNOWS 
HOW HIS EAGLE AND DASTARDLY MIND WORKS . HOWEVER, POND HAS BEEN OUT OF 
CIRCULATION FOR A WHILE SINCE LAST ENCOUNTER WITH MAYBE AND IS RUMOURED TO
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A HIGHLY INTENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAMME.
 
WE WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED ON ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS. IN THE MEANTIME THE
WORLD WAITES WITH BATED BREATH FOR MAYBE'S NEXT MOVE. IT SEEMS THAT OUR ONLY 
CHANCE NOW LIES IN THE CAPABLE FINS OF THE AQUATIC SUPER HERO, JAMES POND.
WHEREVER YOU ARE POND, OUR HEARTS ARE WITH YOU.

WHAT YOU SEE

CHEAP? BECAUSE IT DOSEN'T WORK IN THE FROZEN WASTELAND OF THE ARCIT. THE SYSTEM

ONLY IN ORDER FROM THE GROUND UP. ECPLORE THE CASTLE ROOF TOPS - YOU MAY FIND SOME
VERY INTERESTING NOOKS AND CRANNIES!

                      ROOM BEFORE THE EXIT FLASHES, SOMETIMES
                      YOU WON'T (IN A SECRET BONUS ROOM, FOR

		      TO FINISH THE GAME. IN ONE HAND, ROBOCOD
		      COUNTS DOWN YOU CHANCES TO CATCH DR.
		      MAYBE. IN THE OTHER HAND, HE HOLDS
		      BATTERIES FOR THE EXPANDOSUIT. EACH TIME
