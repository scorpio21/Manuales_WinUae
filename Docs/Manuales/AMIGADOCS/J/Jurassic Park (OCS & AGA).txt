 Astounding biotechnical advances have brought back to life the lost
awesome creatures ever to walk the face of the earth and have made
possible the most incredible animal preserve of all time...
                            Jurassic Park!

 Humans and dinosaurs -thought to have missed meeting one another by
over 60 million years- have been brought to gether on Isla Nebular,
a tiny island off the coast of Central America.

 As Dr.Grant, world-renowned palaontologist, you have been invited 
to examine the cloned inhabitants of this mysterious, fog shrouded 
island. The dinosaurs are monitored and controlled by a huge
super-computer, and you have been assured that you can explore the
island and see these breathtaking behemoths in complete safety...

 But now.. something has gone terribly wrong!
Jurassic Park's computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has sabotaged the
security systems - electrified fences and motion sensors are down - 
and hundreds of fearsome prehistoric predators have escaped their 
pens and paddocks to roam fee on the island. Vicious raptors, 
spitters and tyrannosaurs have quickly overrun even the fortified
visitors center. And millions of years of extinction haven't slowed
these creatures' reflexes - they still know how to run!

 You'll need to accomplish a number of increasingly difficult tasks
before you're free to attempt the toughest one of all: getting 
yourself safely off the island!

 Are you ready to face some of history's most powerful and deadly
carnivores? the perilous primeval world of Jurassic Park awaits!

                          * GIOCO *

 As a world-renowned paleontologist, you have been invited to a 
special preview of jurassic Park. Imagine beeing able to study a 
live animal that you thought you'd only see as bone fragments. but
your dreams of a lifetime has become a nightmare since a system 
failure released the dinosaurs from their carefuly constructed pens.
now they have overrun the island, and you've got some serious work 
to do before you can get yourself off the island.




                      * GAME OBJECTIVE *
                      * ZIEL DES SPIEL *
                     * OBJECTIF DU JEU  *
                    * OBIETTIVO DEL GIOCO *

 you are stranded in the Tyrannsaur paddock of jurassic Park. Nearby
somewhere, are John Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex. You must 
find them and take them with you through various dinosaur paddocks,
to the visitors center. From there you must restore the park's 
systems and call for a rescue helicopter.

The KIDS:
-------- 
 Tim and Lex are hiding, scared somwhere. If you can find them they 
will follow you as best they can. Sometimes, however, they might be 
just too frightened and might do something silly. You'll have to 
protect them frol any scrapes they may get into.

The Paddocks:
------------
 Eache paddock was supposed to contain one species of dinoasaur but
since the system failure many have broken free.
They have scattered about the island by wrecking the fences and 
creeping into underground tunnels and drainage pipes.



                                 
                            * WEAPONS *
                            * WAFFEN  *
                           * LES ARMES *
                              * ARMI *

 In hand-to-hand combat, a human doesn't have much of a chance 
against a dinosaur, so Dr.Grant needs armaments to aid him.

 You will start armed only with a tazer. This basic weapon throws 
out a bolt of electricity wich will destroy some smaller dinosaurs
and stun others. The tazer uses energy quickly and must be given a
moment to recharge. If you look around, you may find some other
weapons that may have been discarded by some of the park's workers.
Remember thoough, this is supposed to be a theme park so you won't 
find any devices of mass destruction here. The most powerful weapon
carried is always selected. If you are using a gun when its ammo 
runs out then the tazer wiil be automatically used.

Objects to pick up and use:
--------------------------
 Pick-ups can be found inside or outsied of buildings. You will ned
these itmes to complete your objectives and get out of Jurassic Park
When you Pick up an object an icon will appear briefly to tell you
what it is.
Objetcs are automatically used whenever they are needed. (eg if you 
walk towards a locked door and you are carrying the correct keycard
then the door will unlock).
An icon will again appear to tell you wich object was used.
Some of the more common pick-ups are:
Ammunition - Some weapons require ammos. Collect these boxes to 
             ensure you don't run out.
First Aid Kit - Collect to heal your injuries and restore all your
                energy. These are valuables since there are a lot of
                to get hurt in jurassic park.

Objetcs to push around:
----------------------
 Some objects that you may find might be too large to carry but can
still be moved. If you find a rock, try pushing it around (just walk
into it). these could be used to overcome some obstacles. If you 
push a rock against a wall, just keep pushing and Grant will jump on
it.



                          * MOTION SENSORS *
                        * BEWEGUNGSSENSOREN *
                   * LES DETECTEURS DE MOUVEMENTS *
                      * RILEVATORI DI MOVIMENTO *

 Electronic motion sensors are located throughout jurassic park. This
is how the computer was supposed to keep the track of the dinosaurs.
When the motion sensors are working, they can detect all moving 
objetcs on the island, and can even identify the different types of 
dinosaurs running free in the park.

Connected to the motions sensors are terminals that you can use to 
call up information. You will also need the terminals to control 
park functions, like opening gates and doors, and to recieve urgent
messages from control room. You can access a computer terminal by
walking up to it and pressing RETURN when the terminal icon appears.

Utility sheds:
-------------
 In some of the dinosaurs paddocks you may find the concrete utility
sheds. Most of them can be unlocked from the motions sensors 
terminals and may contain something to help you. Some of them are 
also connected to a network of maintenance tunnels underneath the park.

                           * OSTACOLI  *

Electric Fences:
---------------
 These separate the dinosaurs and the different areas of the park.
Mosst of the fences are off so they will probably be safe to touch.
To open a gate in the fence, you may need to unlock it from a 
computer terminal, or find a keycard.

Cliffs and rocks:
----------------
 You can climb small steps by just walking into them. Walk of edges
to descend, but don't fall to far or you will be knocked unconscious
and eaten before you wake up.

Tree and bushes:
---------------
 Raptors and other dinos can hide behind these and jump out at you.
Surprise!

Fast flowing Rivers:
-------------------
 Rivers snake their way across Isla Nebular separatin dinosaurs and
areas of the park. Like the electric fences, these can help you by
stopping the dinosaurs, but they can also stop you, since they can
only be crossed at certain points.

Rock Avalanches:
---------------
 Remember, you are just a dino doc, not s super here - rocks will
crush you flat.

Deadly Dino Dragonfly:
---------------------
 This one is big bug. It will follow you and injure you by stinging. 
Godd thing it's not a mosquito, or genticist might dig you DNA out 
of amber millions of years from now and put your clones in 
Palaeontologist Park.
