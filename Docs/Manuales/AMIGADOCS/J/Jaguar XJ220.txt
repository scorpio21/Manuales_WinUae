JAGUAR XJ - 220

INTRODUCTION

In December 1989 Jaguar announced that a limited production run of its 
XJ-220 concept car would go ahead. A mere 350 units of the four hundred 
thousand pound super-car are to be built by a newly formed Jayuar 
subsidiary Project XJ-220 Ltd. The car borrows heavily from the XJR-11 
race car. uslng the twin-turbo V6 engine as well as many chassis and 
suspension components. Its light weight and tremendous
power (over 500 BHP) result in performance to humble the greatest efforts 
of Ferrari Lamborghini and Porsche. Despite its light weight the XJ-220 
is no spartan racing car full leather interior air-conditioning and 
electric windows are all standard features.

Jaguar XJ - 220 Raclng gives you the chance to test your skill 
driving against the cream of world sports cars in the Sports Car Racing 
(S.C.R.) Challenge a fictitious internatlonal race series. 
Battle to victory over 36 rounds to take the chequered flag
against a field of determined and skilled opponents.


			-=- 2 -=-


S.C.R . CHALLENGE

The S.C.R. Challenge is open to all road-legal sports cars and 
consists of 12 international rounds each with 3 races. Each race take 
place on a different circuit making a total of 36 courses. Each cars 
chassis and suspension may be modified freely roll cage and fuel cell 
being mandatory. Minor engine modifications are also permissible but 
the car may produce no more than 15% extra power. Fuel is regulated
to 98 Octane and all cars must use road legal tyres.     

To ensure fair competition a slide-rule of minimum weights are 
employed derived from the cars maximum power output. During the series 
engine,  suspension and drive-train components may be replaced but the 
chassis must remain original  (I.e competitors may not change cars 
mid-season!).

			Jaguar Sports Cars
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


For over 50 years, the name of Jaguar has been synonymous with 
performance luxury and refinement. From its earliest days, Jaguar have 
produced cars with the power and handling to match any competitor. 
Many early rallies were dominated by the SS-100 whlch was not only 
much cheaper than continental rivals, (a princely 395 pounds), but also 
more powerful and rugged. First produced In 1935, the SS-100 was a 2 
seater open sports car wlth 2.5 litre engine and a four-speed
synchromesh gearbox. In standard form It was capable of 94 mph and 
accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 12.8 seconds, outstanding for the 
time. The cars flrst success came In 1936 when Tommy Wisdom won a 
Glacier Cup In the Alpine Rally. The car was soon improved and was 
offered with the option of a 3.5 litre englne. This gave a
useful performance boost bringing the 0 - 60 mph time down to ten 
seconds and a top speed of over 100 mph. In 1937 Tommy Wisdom's tuned 
3.5 litre SS-100 recorded an average lap speed of 118 mph at 
Brooklands. By 1939, modificiations raised that to 125mph. Development
was halted by the war but on its return the SS-100s success continued,
the greatest when Ian Appleyard's 3.5 litre version gained a Coupes 
des Alps in the 1948 Alpine rally. The car continued its success well 
into the fifties driven by many famous race drivers including Stirling
Moss.

The fifties saw the introduction of the classic XK120 sports car, its name
derived from the new XK engine it incorporated. The XK120 was no less than
a revolution in the design of sports cars. Not only did it possess power 
and handling second to none, but it proved comfortable, reliable and
most importantly easy to drive. It quickly became the benchmark for high
performance sports cars. Reliability was underlined by the week-long
speed record set at Montihery Autodrome in France in 1951. A modified
XK120 averaged over 100mph for seven days covering almost 17000 miles.

The engine proved to be as successful on the track as it was on the 
road, powering C-type and D-type Jaguars to victory at Le Mans five
times between 1951 and 1957. The original C-types were developed in 
only 8 months, many components, including the engine, taken from the 
XK120 sports car. This proved to be of little hindrence and the 
team soared to victory. For the next three years the cars were 
continuously modified, lightened and improved.

Jaguar quickly realised however, that continued success depended on a
purpose-built racer and so in 1953 work began on the D-type. The 
D-type was an altogether different machine with breathtaking performance.
The car proved a huge success taking three successive Le Man 
victories. The cars were eventually retired in 1958 when new regulations
restricted engine size to three litres, an engine size to which the 
race modified XK was unsuited.


			-=- 17 -=-

The sixties saw the advent of the historic E-type Jaguar. Never before
had a car made such an impact with the motoring press and public.

Its design was obviously inspired by the D-type racers and indeed its 
chassis and engine owed much to the Le Mans winner. Once again the Jaguar 
not only undercut Its obvious rivals the Aston Martin DB4 and the 
Mercedes 300SL but also proved to be more comfortable and flexlble. 
The 3.8 engine was soon replaced by a 4.2 litre version and allied 
to a new gearbox the E-type retained its posltlon as the worlds most
desirable sports car.

Although not raced by Jaguar itself the factory did support John Coombs 
and between 1961 and 1963 the car took many victories against cars such 
as the Ferrari GTO. The cars continued to be successful In the US and 
between 194 and 1966 they won 39 races out of 42 entered.        

As Jaguars success on the road continued, the racing division of the 
company was busy developing a new 5 litre V12 engine for a new Le Mans
contender. The XJ-13 was to be Jaguar's statement of technological
superiority. With its areodynamic mid-engine layout and over 500bhp
the Xj-13 was capable of over 175mph. Disastrously, the car was involved
in an accident during a high-speed test. The car was travelling at 
around 140mph on a banked track when the huge G-forces caused the offside
rear wheel to collapse. The car was badly damaged, but miraculously, the
driver Norman Dewis escaped virtually unscathed. Sadly, although the
car was rebuily, the project was scrapped but many componenets developed
for the XJ-13 were incorporated into Jaguar road cars including the 
pwerful V12 engine.

By 1971 over 57,000 E-types had been built, more than 80% being exported.
Due to new emmision and safety regulations, though, the car's performance
was restricted. To maintain Jaguar's status, a new version of the V12
engine was chosen. The 5.3 litre V12 engine was installed in the new
series 3 variant and the option of an automatic transmission boosted 
sales enormously. In fact, the car was tested against the cream of 
Italian sports cars and only the exotic Maserati Bora proved slightly
faster. The V12 E-type proved another success in US racing, winning
virtually every race they entered sometimes lapping the entire field.
The cars remained competitive for many years after the production of 
the road cars had ceased. Bob Tillius winning the drivers and 
manufacturers titles in the 1977 Trans Am.

Production of the E-type finally ceased in 1975 after 72,000 had been 
built. It's replacement, the XJS, continuing the line of powerful
sports cars.


Jaguar re-entered group C racing in 1985 after an absence of 27 years. The
V12 so successful on the road proved to be just as at home on the
track. After only three years the partnership of Jaguar and TWR were
crushing the opposition, winning 8 of the 10 of the Word Championship
rounds Including Le Mans to take the manufacturers title. 1987
saw the  Introductlon of the Twin Turbo V6 englne which proved successful
in the shorter races. The groundwork led to today XJ -14 currently
the most advanced Group C car In the world.

THE TEAMS
~~~~~~~~~

Corvette
--------
Factory sponsored team running 91-spec ZR1 s. The cars
massive 5.7 litre engines are both powerful and reliable
although rather thirsty and heavy. The cars traditional front-
engine rear wheel drive set-up limits cornering ability
somewhat.

Stuck/Porsche
-------------
Last years winning team factory sponsored and for the first
time running 959s. The cars twin-turbo engines provide
masses of power and the four-wheel drive produces
spectacular cornering although the rear-engine layout makes It
twitchy on the limit.

Lorenzo/Bugatti
---------------
New for this race season using the all new EB110 sports car.
Capable of a top speed of over 200 mph and the handling to
match. This should prove to be a tough contender to all those
racing this season.

Morello/Ferrari
---------------
A new private team running the legendary F40. Producing
almost 500 BHP in a lightweight body gives the car slingshot
acceleratlon and a top speed of over 200 mph. The mid-
engine layout provides balance in cornerlng although being
only 2-wheel drive the car is a handful in the wet.

Kyle/Lamborghini
----------------
The Kyle team return, running ex factory Countachs due to reliability
problems with the Diablos. After a strong showing last season the team
must be strong contenders with experienced drivers and well developed 
cars. The mid-engine cars run modified 5.2 litre V12 engines now fitted
with fuel injection.

Core/Jaguar
-----------
The latest team to enter the S.C.R. challenge. Partly sponsored by Jaguar
and running the latest XJ-220 the team must surely be a strong contender
for this years champoinship. Although the car is still in development,
its group C derived power-plant gives it an obvious speed advantage
over most of the field.

TACTICS
~~~~~~~

While racing always keep an eye on your fuel reserve (the faster you 
drive, the more fuel the car wlll use). On most tracks you will need 
to refuel at least once throughout the race.

Avoid opponent cars and any objects on the track as colllsions lose speed 
and cause damage which you will have to pay to repair.

Keep an eye on the weather reports before racing as bad weather can 
hinder your progress in a race. Rain makes for slippery tracks 
crosswinds can affect cornering and top speed.

To keep costs down plan your route through the season to minimise 
transport expenses. Bad results and expensive crash damage will quickly 
drain a teams bank balance.

Try to learn the course you are racing on knowing where a sharp corner 
is can be a BIG help. (A brake in tlme saves damage! and money!).
