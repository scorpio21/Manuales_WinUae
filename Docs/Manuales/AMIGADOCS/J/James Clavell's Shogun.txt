Preface to the Story
====================

         In Shogun,  you  play  the role  of resourceful English seaman
      John Blackthorne, Pilot-Major of the Dutch trader-warship Erasmus,
      which is  on a  secret  mission  of  trade  and plunder  to  the
      Spanish-dominated Pacific Ocean.
         The year is 1600, and  the powerful  Catholic empire  of Spain
      and  Portugal is  locked  in a death struggle  with the  upstart
      Protestant nations  of England and Holland.  The Catholic nations
      have spread  their political and  religious influence across the
      world, reaching as far as  China and the almost mythical land of
      Japan,  extracting great  wealth in  spices and precious  metals.
      Their extensive knowledge of  the Asian seaways is highly  secret
      information coveted by  English and Dutch traders. But while the
      European powers battle each other, a longer and even more vicious
      struggle is raging among the feudal lords of Japan.
         After hundreds of years of anarchy,  Japan was unified  by the
      great warrior  Nakamura,  was Taiko,  or  military ruler. But the
      Taiko  has  died,  leaving as  heir a  seven-year-old boy,  and a
      five-man Council of  Regents to  rule in his  name. The dominant
      figures on the Council are Lord Toranaga and Lord Ishido. Each is
      a daimyo:  powerful warrior-rulers who follow the ancient samurai
      traditions. Each harbors the ambition to be Shogun: supreme ruler
      under the divine but nearly powerless Emperor.
         Toranaga  and Ishido are  each  backed  by lesser daimyos and
      hordes of  samurai.  They  jockey  for  position, nearly  evenly
      matched, looking for any way of bolstering their chances. Perhaps
      the Jesuits will  swing their  support behind  one candidate,  or
      hostages  will  neutralize a powerful  supporter. The balance is
      delicate, and the appearance of the Eramus creates excitement and
      new possibilities.
         It is  into the  center of  this momentous conflict that  you,
      John Blackthorne, have been thrown, and soon you discover that the
      perils of the sea are  almost trifling  compared to the danger and
      intrigue among the samurai loards of Japan.
         Life in  Japan can be  a hazardous  affair. If  you choose  the
      wrong friends of confidants,  you may find your head detached from
      your body.  But strict  adherence to the rules of etiquette,  some
      judicious  questions,  and  careful  listening  will enhance  your
      pleasure, prestige, and prospects for survival.
         Shogun is one of a new family  of Infocom stories which utilize
      vivid graphics to  enhance the  story.  So  now, along  with  the
      quality  interactive  fiction  that  you've  come  to expect  from
      Infocom, you can  also expect beautiful  artwo.  So urvival.
         Shogun is one of  as well.  You'll
      find that the art in Shogun is  tied very closely to the story and
      gives you  a "fine-focus"  on the mood or  locale as you  play the
      role of John Blackthorne.

Hints
=====

         Shogun  contains on-screen  hints!  If you ever get stuck, just
      type HINT and follow  the instructions on  your screen.  The hints
      generally progress from a gentle nudge to a complete answer.
         Don't  let the  presence or  absence of  hints on a particular
      subject affect your thinking.  In fact, fake hints have been added
      to prevent this.
         We strongly recommend that you look at only one hint at a time.
      Avoid the temptation to use  the hints too often; this inevitably
      spoils,  or  at  least  lessens,  the  fun of  solving a solving a
      puzzle.
         If you don't have the  will power to stop  looking at the hints
      you can type HINTS OFF.  This will deactivate  the on-screen hints
      (unless you RESTART or RESTORE to an earlier point).

=============
Function Keys
=============

         As described  elsewhere  in this  manual,  many commands have
      abbreviations:  you can type N instead of NORTH, for instance, or
      I instead of INVENTORY.
         With  function keys,  you can  use a  single keystroke  as an
      abbreviation for whatever you choose.  You can use a function key
      to  abbreviate  a  long  word  that  you  don't  to type   (like
      TORANAGA),  or  to  abbreviate  a  commonly  used command  (like
      RESTORE),  or even to  abbreviate a whole sentence (like LOAD THE
      PISTOL).
         The 10 user-defined functions (F1-F10) are accessed by holding
      down the Closed Apple/Option key  and simultaneously pressing the
      number key (1-0) which  corresponds  to the  function you want to
      use. The arrow  keys  have also  been  defined  as function keys.
      Initially, they are defined as  the four cardinal directions. You
      may, however, change them also. Please  note that  the left arrow
      key is defined as WEST and cannot be user as a backspace key.
         You  start the  story with  the function  keys already set to
      commonly used commands.  To see what the function keys are to, or
      to change the  settings of the function keys,  type DEFINE at the
      prompt {>} and press  the RETURN key.  Then  use your mouse or up
      and  down  arrow  keys to  highlight the  setting(s) you  want to
      change. The vertical bar {|} or exclamation point {!} is  used as
      an abbreviation for the RETURN key automatically pressed when you
      use  that function key.  Note: Only one RETURN can be included in
      each function  key  definition.  Anything  typed after the first
      RETURN will be discarded.
         You can restore all the original settings of the function keys
      by highlighting  the  RESET DEFAULTS  command  and pressing  the
      RETURN key. You can save any changes you make by highlighting the
      SAVE DEFINITIONS command.  If after  saving your  own definitions
      you wish to RESET DEFAULTS, or save a new set of definitions, you
      may retrieve your previous  definitions save by highlighting the
      RESTORE DEFINITIONS command and pressing the RETURN key.
         To leave  the DEFINE screen,  highlight the  EXIT command  and
      press the RETURN key.

================
Special Commands
================

         Below  are  explanations  for  a  number  of useful  one-word
      commands. In many cases, these will not count as a move. Type the
      command after the prompt {>} and press the  RETURN key.  Most  of
      these commands  appear in all  Infocom games, but those  that are
      starred (*) are new.

          tell you  only the  name of the  location in BRIEF mode,  and
          rnin in BRIEF mode unless  you use the VERBOSE or SUPERBRIEF
          commands.  SUPERBRIEF tells Shogun to display only the name of
          a place  you have  entered,  even if you have never been there
          before.  In  this  mode,  Shogun willm not even mention which
          objects are present. Of  course,  you  can always get a  full
          description  of youm not even mention which
          objects are present. Of  course,  you  can always get a  full
          description  of youmlocation and  the items there by typing
          LOOK.  SUPERBRIEF mode  is meant for  players who are already

          LOOK.  SUPERBRIEF mode  is meant for  players who are already
          fammar with the geography.  The VERBOSE command tells Shogun
          that you want a complete description of each location, and the

          it, you  cao correct  yourself at  the next prompt by typing
          OOPS and the  correct word.  For example, if you typed ATTACK

Sample Transcript
=================

         This transcript is not from Shogun,  but will give you a good
      feeling for how Infocom's interactive fiction works. It contains
      some simple  puzzles and their  solutions. The player's commands
      appear in capital letters after each prompt {>}.

>LOOK
You are at the helm of the tradeships Dek Twintig, about to make port in Goro.

>LOOK AT THE SEA
The sea is as calm as the day is beautiful. The sails are full and the brisk
wind moves the ship along at a quick and steady pace. Directly to port lies
the barrier reef which makes Goro an ideal harbor, sheltered from the
relentless battering of the sea and safe from easy enemy attack.

>LOOK AT THE REEF
The reef is to port, marked by a line of churning surf and broken two hundred
yards ahead by the mouth of the winding channel that leads to the anchorage in
Goro Harbor. The Dek Twintig is running before the wind parallel to the reef.

>LOOK AT THE CHANNEL
The channel is ahead and to port, marked by red and green buoys; red buoys
mark the channel's left side and green buoys mark the right side.

>WAIT
Time passes...
From atop the mainsail in the crow's nest you hear the lookout yell, "Coming
up on the channel now."

>TURN THE WHEEL TO PORT
You turn the wheel to port and the Dek Twintig slips into the channel.

>LOOK AT THE CHANNEL
The channel surrounds you on both sides, about twice as wide as your ship,
with red and green buoys marking its boundaries. Beyond the buoys lie shallow
water, rocks, and disaster. The channel bends to starboard about three hundred
yards ahead.

>WAIT

Time passes...
The ship moves deeper into the channel propelled by the stiff winds.

>WAIT
Time passes...
The ship moves deeper into the channel propelled by the stiff winds. The ship
seems to be moving away from the center towards the left side of the channel.
You hear the lookout yell excitedly, "Approaching red buoy dead ahead!"
Startled, you look to the left for the buoy but it's too late because you've
just left the channel and run aground. Luckily, you're on a sand bar, and not
the rocks.

>UNDO
(UNDO done)

>TURN WHEEL TO STARBOARD
You quickly turn the helm to starboard just avoiding the red buoy. The Dek
Twintig responds, veering back towards the center of the channel.

>LOOK AT THE CHANNEL
The channel surrounds you on both sides about twice as wide as your ship. The
ship seems to be veering off to the right side of the channel. You remeber
your recent close call as you hear the lookout yell, "Green buoy sighted,
Captain!"

>STRAIGHTEN WHEEL
You quickly straighten the wheel and the ship immediately centers herself in
the channel.

>LOOK AT THE CHANNEL
The channel surrounds you on both sides, about twice as wide as your ship. The
lookout yells, "Channel turning starboard, Captain."

>TURN THE WHEEL STARBOARD
You turn the wheel to starboard, expertly following the center of the channel.

>STRAIGHTEN THE WHEEL
You straighten the wheel holding the Dek T . The channel opens
up into Goro bay about two hundred yards ahead.

>WAIT
Time passes...
You enter the harbor under full sail, a tribute to English seamanship. The
anchorage is just a hundred yards away now.

>CREW, LOWER THE SAILS
The crewmen, w
majestically to the anchorage. You notice a small boat being launched from the
shore and heading your way.

the men look like warriors.

>I AM CAPTAIN ALEXANDER WICKS
You hurriedly explain to Glaz that Jeremiah Wicks is your half-brother, a
scrourge to your family and an enemy of England and all nations. He turns and
speaks once more to Sukata, Sukata listens intently then orders his me

      at a later time  without having  that you

         To  move  around,  just  type  the  direction  you want to  go.
      Directions can be abbreviated:  NORTH to N, SOUTH to S, EAST to  E,

         There are various kinds of  questions  that  Shogun understands.
      Examples include: WHO IS {someone}, WHERE IS {en you meet other  people

      typing  their name,  then a comma,  then whatever you wanMariko  asked,
"What's you favorite color?"
      you could answer.

         You can also ask questions of characters by  using the form  ASK

>ASK OCHIBA ABOUT THE SAMURAI
>ASK OMI ABOUT Ie
      chatter,  you should listen to  others and answer their questions.
      Often your actions will speak louder than you
      You can answer  these questions  simply by  supplying the  missing
      information at the very next prompt. For exampl
         1. Draw a map.  It should include each location, the connections
      to adjoining locations,  and any interesting ot,ou can always save your
      position first. Here's a silly example:

>GIVE THE BROKEN COMPASS TO TORANAGA
Toranaga scornfun one solution;  other  puzzles  don't need to  be solved  at
all.
      Sometimes you will have to solve  one puzzle in order          9. If you
really  have difficulty,  you can type HINT. The screen
      will then show you a list of  questions to whi
         11. You can  word a command  in many different ways. For example,
      if you  wanted  to  stop  the  ship,  you could  type in any of the
      following:

>DROP THE ANCHOR IN THE WATER
>THROW THE ANCHOR IN THE WATER
>PUT ANCHOR IN WATERtences  on your input line, since the
      event  may have  changed your  situation drastically.)  Here are
      some of Shoknow the words MOON or SHADOW or
      CRATER in your input.  When this happens, you can assume that you
      don't need  to erb missing in that sentence!}

         Unless you are answering a question, each sentence must have a
      verb (or  one o   READ, EXAMINE,  OPEN, CLOSE, ENTER, EXIT, EAT and
WEAR. There are
      many more.  Remeber,  you can use a  variety of prepy
      noun "phrases"  with it.  For example, Shogun  may recognize SKIP
      but not SKIP THIS PART.

{You can't see any e
      else, or it may be present but in a closed container.

{You can't use more than one object at a time with _________.}word ALL,  but 
there  aren't  any appropriate
      objects visible.

{Sorry, but I don't understand. Please that another wa      UNDER THE TREE 
and  SKIP AROUND THE MAYPOLE  are syntaxes  that
      Shogun wouldn't recognize.
