   FIRE OFF THE LINE: STARTING UP THE GAME

   To play John Madden Football, you need an Amiga with a minimum 512k
   of free memory. If your computer has 1MB or more of free memory,
   you'll also hear special music features during the game.


   NOTE: John Madden Football is not hard drive installable!


   Before loading, make copies of your disks. You'll need two, blank,
   formatted floppy disks.


   To make copies of your disks:

   1.  Turn on your Amiga (Amiga 1000 owners, insert Kickstart 1.2 or
       1.3.)
   2.  Insert Workbench into drive DF0:.
   3.  Users With One Disk Drive: Remove Workbench and insert your
       original Program Disk into the drive. Users With Two Disk
       Drives: Insert the Madden Program Disk into the other drive.
   4.  Place the mouse pointer on the Disk0 icon and left-click to
       highlight it.
   5.  Pull down the Icon menu from the menu bar, drag the highlighted
       bar down to Copy, and release the mouse button. (Users with
       Workbench 1.2 - 1.3, select the Duplicate option from the
       Workbench menu.)
   6.  You may have to swap disks from time to time. Follow the
       onscreen instructions.
   7.  The Amiga will automatically name your disk "Copy of Disk0,"
       however, it must be named "Disk0" in order to work properly.
       Remove "Copy of" and the space following them using the
       Rename command (on Workbench 1.3 it's on the Workbench menu;
       on 2.0 it's on the Icon menu).
   8.  Label the copy "Madden Program Disk."
   9.  Once you've copied the Madden Program Disk, repeat the above
       procedure for the Data Disk. Label this copy "Madden Data
       Disk."


   To load the game:

   1.  If your Amiga is on, turn it off.
   2.  Insert your copy of the Program Disk into drive DF0:.
   3.  Turn your Amiga on.
   4.  The EASN intro appears, followed by a Title screen and game
       credits. Press a mouse or joystick button to exit the
       current screen and load the game.
   5.  Users With One Disk Drive: You're prompted to insert the Data
       Disk. Remove the Program Disk from DF0: and insert your copy
       of the Data Disk. Users With Two Disk Drives: Insert your copy
       of the Data Disk into any drive.

   --------------------------------------------------------------[ 2 ]

       Note To Users With Only 1MB of Free Memory

       If your computer has only 1MB of free memory, the game could
       take a few minutes to load. If your computer has more than 1MB,
       the "You've got it, we've used it" screen appears to let you
       know that the program is taking advantage of your extra memory.


   COPY PROTECTION SCREEN

   You're asked to enter a statistic for a particular position on a
   certain team.

   Turn on the PLAYER RATINGS section in this manual and look up the
   team name you see on the screen. Find the player position and type
   the statistics called for. Press Return.


   SO YOU DON'T KNOW A HAIL MARY FROM A HALFBACK...

   Football can be confusing for those unfortunates who have never
   seen the game played before. If you count yourself among the
   pigskin illiterate, you can review the basic concepts of the game
   by turning to Appendix A: Quick Guide to Football.

   --------------------------------------------------------------[ 3 ]

   GAME SETUP SCREEN

   Once you've answered the copy protection question and the game has
   loaded, the Game Setup screen appears. The Game Setup screen
   options let you choose season modes, teams, weather, stadium type,
   quarter lengths, and control devices.


   Season Modes

                    Regular Season - Single game.
                      Sudden Death - The first team to score, wins.
      New Playoff/Continue Playoff - See BIG TIME PLAYOFFS before
                                     choosing either of these modes.


   Visiting and Home Teams

   There are 16 teams to choose from plus the All-Madden team (in
   Regular Season and Sudden Death only).


   Team Control

   Teams can be controlled with a joystick, the keyboard, or by the
   computer. Click on the football icons to change each team's control
   setting. The top team is the visitor and always kicks off to start
   the game.

   [1-Joystick]    Control Team using joystick plugged into Joystick
                   Port 2.
   [2-Joystick]    Control team using joystick plugged into Joystick
                   Port 1.
   [3-SomeKeys]    Control team using the keyboard.

   --------------------------------------------------------------[ 4 ]

      [Large M]    Team controlled by Madden (your computer). Madden's
                   skill and knowledge are built into the game - he's
                   a very aggressive and savvy opponent.

   Stadium

   Plays on Open Grass, Open Turf, Dome Grass or Dome Turf (Regular
   Season and Sudden Death only). Dome stadiums are covered; Open
   stadiums aren't. Grass playing fields are covered with natural
   grass - players have better traction on grass but move slower.
   Turf fields are covered with artificial turf - players can move
   slightly faster on artificial surfaces.

   Weather

   Play in Fair weather, Rain/Mud or Snow/Ice (Regular Season or
   Sudden Death only). Adverse weather conditions can impede player
   movement. If the stadium you're playing in is covered by a dome,
   weather has no effect. Note: In playoff mode, weather is
   selected by the computer.

   Quarter Time

   Select 5, 10 or 15 minute quarters.


   By default, you're San Francisco playing against the Madden-coached
   Denver team in a Regular Season game with fair weather, open grass
   stadium, and five minute quarters. The Madden team (Team 1) is
   controlled by the computer, and your team (Team 2) is controlled
   by joystick 1 (the joystick plugged into Joystick Port 2).

    o  You may want to change some of the settings. Use the mouse or
       joystick to point the Selection Arrow at the various options.
       If you're using the mouse, it must be plugged into Joystick
       Port 1; if you're using a joystick, it must be plugged into
       Joystick Port 2. To change the setting, move the cursor to
       the football icon and press the joystick button or click the
       mouse button. Note: The left mouse button cycles forward
       through the settings; the right mouse button cycles in the
       other direction.

       Note: The mouse is used only for selecting options in the
       Setup screen; it cannot be used during the game.

    o  When you've set up the game you want to play, fasten your
       chin strap, and select START.

   --------------------------------------------------------------[ 5 ]

   Alright! Here comes my evaluation of both teams, who's got a go-to
   guy, who's weak up the middle, who's got players that aren't
   afraid of getting dirt on their pants, you know what I mean? These
   scouting reports are terrific and will help you play a better
   game. But if you don't think you need them, press the joystick
   button again.      [john madden]


   GAME CONTROLS

   You can control your team with a joystick or the keyboard. Which
   you use depends on the Control Device setting you chose on the
   Game Setup screen.

      Keys
      ----------------
      Z - Left
      X - Right
      ' - Up
      / - Down

   The FIRE Button

   The instructions in this manual refer to the FIRE button. If you're
   controlling your team with a joystick, FIRE is the joystick button.
   If you're controlling your team with the keyboard, FIRE is Return.

   There are two ways in which you use FIRE. When the instructions
   tell you to tap the FIRE button, quickly press and release it. When
   they tell you to hold the FIRE button, press the button and keep it
   held down until you're told to release it.


   QUITTING A GAME

   Once a game has started, you can quit and return to the setup menu
   by pressing Shift-Esc. If you want to quit Madden altogether,
   simply turn off your Amiga.


   THE KICKOFF

   The visiting team always kicks off. If you're the home team and are
   playing against Madden (the computer), the kickoff takes place
   automatically. If this is the case, skip to the RECEIVING TEAM
   section below. If you're the visiting team, read on.

   --------------------------------------------------------------[ 6 ]

   KICKING TEAM

   After the referee spots the ball and the teams line up, press the
   Fire button. This starts yoru kicker moving toward the ball and
   brings up the Kick Metter on the screen. The Kick Meter helps you
   kick with accuracy and power.  [see JohnMadden.p7.iff]

   The white marker in the strength gauge begins to move up as the
   kicker approaches the ball.

    o  When the marker reaches the very top of the gauge, press the
       joystick button to kick the ball.

   If you want to aim your kick:

    o  As the kciker advances toward the ball, move the joystick left
       or right to move the direction marker either left or right.
       When the marker indicates where you want the ball to go,
       release the joystick.

   Once the kick is away, your team automatically moves out to break
   the wedge and tackle your opponent's return man.

    o  After the return man catches the ball, tap FIRE to take control
       of the defensive guy closest to the ballcarrier.

          The player you control is standing on the four-arrow symbol
          so you can recognize him even with his helmet on.

   To tackle the ballcarrier:

   1.  Tap fire to take control of the defensive guy closest to the
       ballcarrier.
   2.  Use the joystick to guide your guy into the ballcarrier. If
       you run into him at the correct angle, chances are he'll go
       down.

   For a diving tackle (more powerful, but sometimes less accurate):

   1.  Use the joystick to guide your guy straight at the ballcarrier.
   2.  Hold FIRE to send him diving in for a tackle.

   --------------------------------------------------------------[ 7 ]

   NOTE: Uf your timing is right, you'll bury the runner in his
   tracks. If your timing's a bit off, your guy goes sailing out of
   the picture empty handed. No big deal. Just tap FIRE to get
   control of the defensive guy who's closest and try to bring down
   the ballcarrier again.


   RECEIVING TEAM

   Your deep return man catches the ball and begins to move up field.
   Either let the computer pick his route for you, or control him
   using the joystick.

          The player you control is standing on the four-arrow symbol
          so you can recognize him.

    o  Tap FIRE to dive for an extra yard or so in the direction the
       joystick is currently pushed.

    o  To spin and possibly avoid being tackled by pursuing defenders,
       center the joystick and hold FIRE.

    o  With the joystick pushed in any direction, hold down the FIRE
       button for extra umph, a boost of extra power and strength
       that might help you drive through the opposition.

          When a kickoff or punt goes into the End Zone, it may be
          better to down the ball rather than try to return it. Don't
          run out of the End Zone if you wish to down the ball. This
          is a touchback. The return teams gets the ball on its own
          20 yeard line, and play begins from there.


   
   IN THE HUDDLE

   At the end of the kickoff return, both teams huddle up. The game
   clock on the right side of the screen shows the time left in the
   quarter. The 45-second clock on the left shows how much time the
   offense has to start the next play.

          Offense: Don't worry if the 45-second click runs down to 0
          before the snap in a Regular Season game. Your team will
          NOT get penalized. The clock is there so you can practice
          getting off your plays in 45 seconds. In the Playoffs you'll
          get a 5-yeard Delay of Game penalty if you go over 45
          seconds.

   The Play Calling Screen and scoreboard appear above the field. When
   you're on offense, the Play Calling Screen (PCS) shows your team
   name and says Choose Set. When your team is on defense the PCS
   says Choose Formation.

   --------------------------------------------------------------[ 8 ]

   Hey, some of my lingo might be new to you but it's football talk.
   If you want a full explanation of the words in ITALICIZED CAPITAL
   letters, look em up in JOHN MADDEN'S FOOTBALL TALK.   [john madden]


   OFFENSE

   In the offensive huddle you're the quarterback. Play calling is as
   simple as 1, 2, 3. Just like the pros, you call a set, then a
   formation, and then a play.

   1.  CHOOSE A SET

       A Set is football talk for the group of players who will run
       your play. The names of three sets appear in windows A, B, and
       C above the field. There are six sets to choose from: NORMAL,
       HANDS, BIG, FAST, and two SPECIAL TEAMS. Each set represents a
       different group of offensive guys.

   To see the other three sets, push the joystick left or right.

    o  When the set you want is in a window, select it like this:

   --------------------------------------------------------------[ 9 ]

   NOTE: Don't release the joystick until after you've released FIRE.

   After you've selected a set, three formations are displayed in the
   A, B and C windows. The name of the set you chose is displayed
   briefly on the screen.

          If you want to change your mind and move back to the Set
          windows to alter your Set, push the joystick down.

   2.  CHOOSE A FORMATION

       A formation tells your player set how to line up before the
       snap. There are five formations to choose from: GOAL LINE,
       FAR, NEAR, PRO-FORM, and SHOTGUN.

   To see the other offensive formations in the windows, push the
   joystick left or right.

    o  When the formation you want is in the window, choose it like
       you chose a set:

          A   FIRE + Left + Release FIRE
          B   FIRE + Up + Release FIRE
          C   FIRE + Right + Release FIRE

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 10 ]

   Note: Don't release the joystick until after you've released FIRE.

          If you want to move back to the Formation windows, push the
          joystick down.

   3. CHOOSE A PLAY

      Coach Madden designed six different plays for each formation.
      Their names appear (three at a time) in the windows along
      with a graphic that shows what happens in each play.

      In general, plays whose names have yellow backgrounds are
      running plays. Plays with brown backgrounds are passing plays.
      Only players with white routes have been designed to carry
      the ball or receive a pass.

    o  When the play you want is in a window, use the appropriate
       joystick combination described above to select it.

          Once you've chosen a play, the only way to change it is
          by calling an AUDIBLE or a TIME-OUT. For details on
          calling these, see AUDIBLES and TIME-OUTS in JOHN
          MADDEN'S FOOTBALL TALK.

    o  When your players get set in their stance at the line of
       scrimmage, tap the FIRE button to SNAP the ball.


    Call plays that exploit the strengths of your best players. Or
    Choose plays that expose the weaknesses of the guys chewing
    their mouth guards. You know, the defense.  [john madden]

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 11 ]

   RUNNING PLAYS

   Handoffs on running plays happen automatically. You take control
   AFTER the handoff. Use the joystick to move the ballcarrier through
   the defense, or watch the computer execute the play you just
   called.

   During a running play, you can:

    o  Tap FIRE to dive for an extra yard or so in the direction the
       joystick in currently pushed.

    o  To spin and possibly avoid being tackled by pursuing defenders,
       center the joystick and hold FIRE.

    o  With the joystick pushed in any direction, hold down the FIRE
       button for extra umph, a boost of extra power and strength
       that might help you drive through the opposition.

   The defensive guys are not a bunch of stiffs impersonating fire
   hydrants. They try to run you down. If you can't avoid the
   contact, you don;t have to fall down in a heap and give up. Keep
   fighting or yeardage, any way you can!


   PASSING PLAYS

   When you call a pass, tap FIRE to snap the ball. At this point, you
   can let the computer execute the play, or you can use the joystick
   to move the quarterback backwards after he receives the snap. This
   gives him some time to get the pass off.

    o  Move the joystick down and tap FIRE to bring up the passing
       windows. They show which receivers are eligible. (If you're
       letting your computer control the quarterbak for you, the
       passing windows come up automatically as soon as the
       quarterback is ready to throw.)

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 12 ]

    o  Select your receiver by using the same window-choosing routine
       as in play section:

          A   FIRE + Left + Release FIRE
          B   FIRE + Up + Release FIRE
          C   FIRE + Right + Release FIRE

   Note: Don't release the joystick until after you've released FIRE.

          Use the joystick to move the receiver to the target circle.
          (He's doing his best to get there on hos own.) If he
          doesn't have the speed to get to that exact spot, tap FIRE
          so he can dive for the ball, or hold FIRE down so he can
          jump for it.

   HINT:  When you're just learning the game, let the receivers run
          the routes (patterns) automatically. After watching a few
          times, you can take full control. Whatever you decide to
          do, keep a finger near the FIRE button - holding down
          FIRE at the right time can really increase your chances
          of catching the ball.

   Once the receiver has caught the ball, he becomes a runner and he
   can do what any other runner can do (see Running Plays above).

          If you pass the line of scrimmage when the pass windows
          are visible, the play automatically becomes a running
          play. You may not pass once your quarterback has passed
          the line of scrimmage.


   DEFENSE

   Look at the down, the field position, and the offensive set, which
   flashes on the screen when the offense chooses it. Then call a
   play in three simple steps.

   1.  Choose a formation
   2.  Choose a set
   3.  Choose a play

   1.  CHOOSE A FORMATION

       On defense a formation is the group of players who will run
       your play. There are five defensive formations to choose from:
       BIG, 4-3, NICKEL, DIME, and SPECIAL TEAMS. Each formation
       represents a different group of defensive guys.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 13 ]

       The names of three formations appear in the windows marked A,
       B, and C above the field. To see the other formations, push the
       joystick left or right.

    o  When the FORMATION you want is in the window, choose it using
       the same window selection system as before:

          A   FIRE + Left + Release FIRE
          B   FIRE + Up + Release FIRE
          C   FIRE + Right + Release FIRE

   NOTE: Don't release the joystick until after you've released FIRE.

          If you want to move back to the formation windows and make
          a change, push the joystick down.

   2.  CHOOSE A SET

       A set specifies the personnel in yoru defensive formation and
       tells them how to play the offense. There are three basic sets:
       COVER, READ, and CONTROL.

       You can use any available set with any formation. But you'll
       find that certain formations work better with some sets that
       with others.

    o  When the set you want is in a window, choose it like you chose
       a Formation. This selects a set and shows the available
       defensive plays in the windows.

          If you want to move back to the Set or Formation windows,
          push the joystick down.

   3.  CHOOSE A PLAY

   You've got a lot of choices here. To BLITZ, or stay homel ZONE
   or MAN-TO-MAN coverage; PREVENT or BUMP AND RUN. That's what makes
   the game so great - the possibilities. Out-foxing the other guy,
   figuring out what he's going to do, or making him do something
   he thinks he thought up for himself. That's really fooling him.
                                                        [john madden]

    o When the PLAY you want is in a window, choose it like you chose
      a Set.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 14 ]

          Once you've chosen a play, the only way to change it is by
          calling an AUDIBLE or a TIME-OUT. For details calling
          these, see AUDIBLES and TIME-OUTS in JOHN MADDEN'S FOOTBALL
          TALK.

   HINT:  Before the snap, you can hold down the FIRE button and move
          the joystick left or right to change the player you control.
          Once the ball has been snapped, tap the FIRE button to take
          control of the guy closest to the ball.

   Pass defense works the same way. Once the ball is thrown, tap the
   FIRE button to get control of the defender closest to where the
   ball is being thrown. Hold down the FIRE button while your
   defender is running at the guy to jump and intercept or knock the
   ball down.

   Great defenses don't simply react. You've got to make the offense
   do stuff it doesn't particularly want to do. Exploit known
   tendencies to run or pass in certain situations. Sometimes you
   might try to force weird matchups, like putting a linebacker on a
   wide receiver, just daring the offense to throw to the guy.
                                                       [john madden]


   Anticipating The Snap

   If you're listening to the quarterback call his signals and you
   think he's just about to order the center to snap the ball, you can
   order your team forward. This is known as anticipating the snap. To
   order your players to charge, hold down FIRE and pull the joystick
   down. The trick is not to order them forward too soon - if they
   cross the line of scrimmage before the ball is snapped, you'll get
   an Offsides Penalty (5 yards).

   Crunch Plays

   The FIRE button can help you put a hurt on the offense.

    o  Just as the receiver is about to catch the ball, hold FIRE to
       make your defender dive at the receiver or jump to intercept
       the ball (the computer will decide which is best). If you can
       time your hit on the receiver so that the defender and the ball
       arrive at the same time, you've got a great chance to jar the
       ball loose or force a fumble.

       But be careful! If you hit the receiver before the ball
       arrives, you may get whistled for pass interference. If the
       zebras call your number, the play is spotted at the location
       of the penalty and the offense gets an automatic first down.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 15 ]

    o  When you make contact with the ballcarrier along with a bunch
       of your teammates, tap the FIRE button repeatedly to improve
       your chances of causing a fumble. However, if you're the lone
       defender, think twice about doing this. If you just try to
       strip the ball loose, you might miss the tackle.


   BIG TIME PLAYOFFS

   New Playoffs

   When your ready to challenge the rest of the league for the right
   to play on Super Sunday, choose New Playoff as the Season mode on
   the Game Setup Screen.

    o  Use the mouse or joystick to point the Selection Arrow at the
       various options. If you're using the mouse, it must be
       plugged into Joystick Port 1; if you're using a joystick, it
       must be plugged into Joystick Port 2. To change the setting,
       move the cursor to the football icon and press the joystick
       button or click a mouse button.

       Visiting and Home Teams

       Initial team matchups are randomly fixed by the computer, but
       you can control any team in the playoffs.

       Team Control

       Team 1 (top) is the visiting team; Team 2 (bottom) is the home
       team. To choose a different team, use the joystick or mouse to
       move the Selection Arrow over the football icon next to either
       team. Press a mouse or joystick button. Each press cycles
       to a new set of playoff pairings.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 16 ]

    o  When you see the team you want to be, set the Control Device
       for your team to joystick or keyboard. For example, if the
       visiting team is Miami and you want to take them through the
       playoffs, set the Team 1 Control Device to joystick or
       keyboard. If you're playing against Madden, set the Team 2
       Control Device to M; otherwise, set it to your opponen's
       control device.

       Weather

       In Playoff games, weather and stadium are automatically
       determined by where you play (you have no control over the
       type of weather). Whenever you're in an open stadium, snow and
       mud on the field are distinct possibilities. Everybody has less
       traction in the mud and snow and long passes are more difficult
       to complete.

       Quarter Time

       Select 5, 10 or 15 minute quarters.

    o  When you've set up the game you want to play, select START in
       the bottom righthand corner of the screen.

   The Playoff Tree shows the match-ups that will lead to the
   championship game on Super Sunday.

    o  To see the scouting reports for your playoff teams, press FIRE.

    o  When you're ready to play your playoff game, press FIRE again.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 17 ]

   Game rules, functions, conditions and operations are the same in
   the Playoffs as they are during the Regular Season. But remember:
   the 45-second clock is active in Playoffs.

    o  At the end of your playoff game, you'll see a screen with an
       updated playoff tree. A seven digit number appears at the top
       of the screen. Write this number down on a piece of paper -
       it's the password you'll need to continue where you left off.

   Continue Playoffs

   When you're ready to continue the playoffs where you left off,
   select Continue Playoffs as the Season Mode on the Game Setup
   Screen. An additional - Enter Password - appears on the screen.

   If you just finsihed a game in this playoff, you don't need to
   enter a password. Simply select Start at the bottom of the screen.
   However, if you've interrupted the playoffs by quitting Madden
   or playing a Regular Season or Sudden Death game, you'll need to
   enter a password. Here's how you enter the password you received
   at the end of your last game.

    o  Select Enter Password. The Playoff Password screen appears.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 18 ]

    o  Select the Enter Password option on this screen. The current
       number is deleted.

    o  Type the number you copied down at the end of your last Playoff
       game. (If you make a mistake while typing, press Del to
       backspace over them.)

    o  Select Retirn to Menu to go back to the Game Setup Screen. You
       can now choose any team that won in the previous round to
       continue in your attempt to reach Super Sunday. Select start to
       play the next game in the Playoff.


   STATISTICS

   At half-time and the end of the game, Coach madden presents the
   stats for your game: who's running well, who's going nowhere fast,
   who's sacking whom, and all the rest.

   If you're in Playoff mode, press FIRE to see a summary of other
   games played today. If there are other games still going on, you'll
   see highlights of the close contests.

   JOHN MADDEN'S FOOTBALL TALK


   AUDIBLES

   If the play you called in the huddle looks like a loser when you
   hit the line of scrimmage, you can call an audible. Once in
   formation, push the joystick up (or in the case of Defense before
   the snap, hold FIRE down and press the joystick up) to alert your
   team that you're calling an audible. Push the joystick left, up or
   right to choose a specific play, or down to cancel the audible and
   go with the play you originally chose.

   The audibles available to you depend on which team you control.
   Each team has a different set of audibles.

   Onside Kicks:

   If the kicking team is behind with very little time left, they may
   opt to kick the ball a short distance (minimum 10 yeards) in an
   attempt to recover the ball on a fumble by the receiving team.
   This is called an onside kick.
   To call an audible for an onside kick, push the joystick up and
   right on onside formatipon. have your kicker aim a kick toward the
   right sideline, and kick the ball weakly. Tap the FIRE button to
   control the player nearest the ball after the onside kick. Hold the
   FIRE button down with the joystick pushed in the appropriate
   direction to make that player dive for the ball.


   On Defense:

   To call an audible for a trick play (like a flea-flicker or a
   double reverse), push the joystick up and left.

   To call an audible for an anti-blitz play, push the joystick up
   twice.

   To call an audible for a running play, push the joystick up and
   right.


   On Defense:

   To call an audible to protect against the run, hold down FIRE and
   push the joystick up and left.

   To call an audible for a blitz play, hold down FIRE and push the
   joystick up and left.

   To call an audible for a stunt, hold down FIRE and push the
   joystick up and right.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 20 ]

   There are over 30 audibles and each team has its own set of six.
   Look at the numbered play diagrams to see what your team audibles
   look like.

   AUDIBLE FORMATIONS

   Every Team has a version of play 22, the Anti-Run audible. The
   strong safety, anticipating a run, leaves the man or zone he's
   assigned to cover, and cheats up to the line of scrimmage just
   before the snap. This gives an extra man on the line.

   PLAY 31 LINE STUNT

   Every team in the league has a play 31, the defensive line stunt.
   It's an alignment in which combinations of linemen and linebackers
   rush the quarterback using routes to the backfield that are meant
   to disrupt the normal blocking assignments of the offensive line
   and confuse the quarterback. There are numerous version of the
   stunt built into the game. The computer chooses one at random when
   you push the joystick right. See also STUNT.


   SNAP

   All the action starts with the snap of the ball, and only the
   offense knows the count. If you're on defense and want to try to
   anticipate the quarterback's cadence - that is, how he calls the
   signals - hold down FIRE and pull the joystick down just before
   or as the ball is snapped. Your defensive guys will try to fire
   into the backfield and dump the quarterback, or at least stuff
   the play before it gets rolling.

   The down-side is, if you do this too soon before the ball is
   snapped, you'll get an offsides penalty (5 yards).


   TIME OUT

   You can call Time Out any time before the ball is snapped, or after
   the play is over. Just press F1 if you're using Joystick 1, or F10
   if you're using Joystick 2 or the keyboard (pressing these buttons
   during a play pauses the game). This stops the clock and pauses
   the game. A screen message appears that reads OFFENSE CALLS: TIME
   OUT (or DEFENSE CALLS: TIME OUT, depending on who called it), and
   gives the number of Time Outs remaining in the half.

   If you want a Time Out, press the FIRE button. You can then reset
   the play. Sometimes an audible just wont do and you really want to
   realign your formation. Call a time out and take care of it -
   better safe than sorry. However, you only get three time outs each
   half, so use them wisely.

   If you change your mind (you're allowed to) or you just wanted a
   pause, rather than to change the formation, press F1 or F10 again.
   Play resumes at the point where you paused the game and you still
   have the same number of Time outs left.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 31 ]

   OFFENSE SETS, FORMATIONS, AND PLAYS


   SETS

   FAST

   My version of the Run and Shoot. It has four quick receivers and a
   halfback. Guys with good hands who run forty yards in less than
   five seconds are the stuff defensive backs have nightmares about.

   NORMAL

   Refers to the standard offensive package: two wide receivers, a
   tight end, a halfback and a fullback.

   HANDS

   Puts your best group of receivers on the field, and includes two
   running backs.

   BIG

   Fields your strongest backs, cannonballs with legs who can grind
   out yards in the mud and snow. These guys let the defense grab a
   leg just so they can ram it through their chests.


   FORMATIONS

   SHOTGUN

   This is primarily a passing formation because the quarterback
   receives the snap about five yards behind the line. He doesn't have
   to drop back to throw the ball, cause he's already there.

   PRO-FORM

   This is my version of the pro-set, where the fullback and a
   halfback line up beside one another and behind the quarterback.

   FAR and NEAR

   These are my way of describing where the halfback lines up. He's
   either far from or near to the strong side of the offensive line,
   that's the side where the tight end lines up.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 32 ]

   PLAYS

   FLOOD

   One of the most effective ways for a quarterback to beat zone
   coverage is to flood, or overload the zone with multiple receivers.
   A defender has to think twice about leaving his own zone to follow
   a receiver into another guy's zone.

   CUT

   You've heard of turning on a dime. That's sportswriter talk. I
   never really understood why you'd want to do that, even if it was
   possible. I guess it means turning fast. I think cutting is a more
   accurate description of the ability to change direction. A guy's
   going one way and boom, he cuts and is going another way.

   PULL

   In a pull play, the guard runs parallel to the line of scrimmage
   and turns up field when he clears the tight end. The running back
   follows right behind, a smile on his face.

   TRAP

   Like all good offensive plays, the Trap depends on deception to
   work. The idea is you trap a defensive guy into thinking one thing
   is happening, when really something totally different is going on.
   For example, you let a defensive end just walk into the backfield.
   You put up only token resistance. He's saying, "Man, this is a
   piece of cake, I'm going to stuff this play and maybe get a sack!"
   Suddenly an earth mover disguised as an offensive guard comes from
   an unexpected direction and the defensive guy is on his backside
   wondering what happened. The runner jets through the area where
   the defensive guy was when he was standing up.

   COUNTER

   A Counter play relies on misdirection. You try to sell the defense
   on the idea that the play is going right, for example, when in fact
   you want to go left. It's a tough sell. You send everybody but the
   water boy and the guy who's going to carry the ball in one
   direction. When you have them moving the wrong way, give the ball
   to the running back and he runs to daylight in the opposite
   direction.

   SCREEN

   A screen is a short pass caught behind the line of scrimmage.
   Usually the quarterback lures rushing defenders toward him and then
   loops a soft pass over their outstretched hands to a moving
   running back/receiver who follows a screen of blockers downfield.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 33 ]

   PLAYACTION

   Playaction (also called play fake) refers to a pass thrown after
   the quarterback has faked a handoff to a running back. The back
   tries to add to the deception by pretending to take the ball and
   follow blockers. The idea is that the fake delays the pass rushers,
   and makes the defensive backs run toward the line to help tackle
   the guy they think has the ball.

   DRAW

   The opposite of a play action pass. The QB drops back as if to pass
   and hands off to the running back who charges up the middle of the
   formation. By the time the rushing defenders realize the deception,
   their momentum may have taken them beyond the ballcarrier.

   QUICKOUTS

   Sometimes called a square out. In this pass pattern the receiver
   takes a few steps upfield and makes a quick 90 degree cut to the
   nearest sideline. If he doesn't want to sit next to the water
   cooler for the rest of the game, he tries to stay in bounds.

   CROSS

   Most crossing patterns are the opposite of quickouts the receiver
   turns toward the middle of the field. Some guys call them slants,
   but it just depends on the angle that the receiver runs.

   POST UP

   Post patterns are for fast guys. The receiver runs downfield and
   angles in toward the goal post. If the quarterback can really air
   out the ball, and the receiver can run like the wind, this bomb can
   score.


   OFFENSIVE ALIGNMENTS

   The sts and formations show how your offensive team lines up when
   you call certain plays (see OFFENSE, above). Remember: not all
   formations are appropriate with every set. We're showing you the
   most common ones here. You'll be more competitive if you use these
   alignments in combination with the PLAYER RATINGS. Here's an
   example of how they work.

   From the PLAYER RATINGS you can find out who your fastest wide
   receiver is. You can find out where that guy lines up by looking
   at the OFFENSIVE ALIGNMENT chart, below. You might want to call
   a play for him from the passing windows, if his hands are as good
   as his feet,

   DEFENSE FORMATIONS, SETS, AND PLAYS


   FORMATIONS


   BIG

   A good line up for stuffing the short run and goal line defense.

   4-3

   Standard four down linemen with three linebackers. Used for short
   and medium zone pass coverage and basic defense against the run.

   NICKEL

   Gets its name from the addition of a fifth defensive back (nickel
   back). When a pass is expected, may teams add a defensive back to
   their sets, and take out a down lineman or linebacker. Cover and
   Read sets are available.

   DIME

   When the defense is willing to mortgage the farm that the next play
   is going to be a pass, they might put in a sixth defensive back.
   This is the Dime defense or Dime package. Cover and Read sets are
   available.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 37 ]

   SETS


   CONTROL

   A Control set is the best defense against running plays because it
   emphasizes containment. Control basically means that the defense
   is willing to give up short stuff up the middle, but they're not
   prepared to let the offense work the sidelines and make big yards
   on sweeps and stuff like that.

   Control is not available with the Nickel and Dime formations.

   READ

   The Read set gives balanced coverage. The defense has a little bit
   more flexibility to react quickly to pass or run. This is known as
   having some options. It's probably the safest defense against run
   or pass, but it's not the strongest defense against either one.

   COVER

   Cover is usually the best set against the pass. The defense is
   trying to convince the offense that all its receivers are covered
   and any ball thrown will be shut down or intercepted. Pass coverage
   comes in two basic flavors: Man-to-man and Zone (see Defensive
   Plays, below).

   
   PLAYS

   
   BLITZ

   A blitz is when one or more of the linebackers or defensive backs
   unexpectedly rush the quarterback. This usually happens when the
   defense thinks the offense is going to pass. A blitzing linebacker
   tries to sack the quarterback but he's satisfied if he puts enough
   pressure on the ball handler to make him hurry his motion and throw
   badly.

   STUNT

   A stunt is when a defensive lineman takes an unexpected route
   toward the quarterback. Instead of going straight ahead and trying
   to get by the offensive man in front of him, he might loop around
   one or two teammates to approach the backfield. When one or more
   defensive linemen stunt, they can cause confusion in the offensive
   line.

   ZONE

   In Zone pass coverage, the defender is responsible for a particular
   area of the field. He covers any receiver who enters his area. Some
   defensive backs hate it when you come into their zone. They say,
   "Get out of my area and no one gets hurt." Some receivers believe
   them. Zone defenders will play five yards off the receiver to
   prevent getting burned deep.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 38 ]

   MAN

   In Man-to-man pass coverage, the defender follows a certain
   receiver wherever he goes. Man-to-Man defenders are tough guys who
   love a challenge. They play closer to the receiver but better have
   the horsepower to stay with a speedy opponent. Their reputations
   are on the line every time the ball goes in the air. They can't
   say, "I thought you were guarding him." They say stuff like, "I'm
   gonna be on his back like white on rice."

   JAM

   Although it's against the rules to tackle or hold onto a pass
   receiver before he touches the ball, a defender can jam or chuck
   a receiver. That means he's allowed to give him one push or block
   within five yards of the line of scrimmage, provided the ball
   hasn't been thrown. The defensive man is going to knock the
   receiver off balance, mess up his timing, and prevent him
   from running his pattern.

   PREVENT

   Prevent concedes a short gain to the offense but focuses on
   preventing a long gain. The defensive backfield lines up farther
   back from the line as usual, so they give up the short pass too.
   It's usually used late in the half or game when the defensive team
   is way ahead, and the offensive team is out of scoring position.


   DEFENSIVE ALIGNMENTS

   The alignments show how your defensive team lines up when you call
   certain formations and sets (see DEFENSE, above). You'll be more
   competitive if you use these alignments in combination with the
   PLAYER RATINGS. Here's and example of how to use them.

   From the PLAYER RATINGS you can find out who your fastest defensive
   back is. From the DEFENSIVE ALIGNMENT chart below, you know where
   that guy lines up. If he's not covering the man or zone you want
   him to cover, get control of him by tapping the FIRE button
   with the joystick cenetered (until he's standing on the 4-arrow
   symbol) and then use the joystick to move him into the position
   where you think he'll do the most good.

   PLAYER RATINGS

   The skills and attributes of every player in our league is rated on
   a scale from 0 to 15, with 15 standing for near perfection. Each
   player has a speed rating - if you can't run, you can't play the
   game. But, since different positions require different skills,
   we've also rated the characteristics that are most important for
   each playing position.

   These player ratings are reflected in my team scouting reports and
   in the way individual players perform. Here's an example of how
   the ratings work and how use can use them.

   You'll notice San Fancisco's number one wide receiver (WR1) has
   great quickness, speed, and a pair of hands you'd trust to catch
   an artillery shell. If you're on offense, you're going to want to
   throw to this guy a lot, or use him as a decoy because the defense
   has to respect him. If you're on defense, you want to guard against
   ever going man-to-man with this burner with only a linebacker to
   depend on. You're probably going to want to put your faster
   defensive back on him. Get the idea?

   Keep these ratings in mind when you choose a play. They'll help you
   play a better game.

   Key to Player Ratings

   Eight groups of players are rated, four offensive and four
   defensive.

           OFFENSE                     DEFENSE
   1. Quarterback = Quarterback (QB)   Defensive Line = Tackle (RT,LT)

   2. Running Backs = Halfback (HB)    Linebackers = LB (M, middle, R,
                      Fullback (FB)                  right, L, Left,
                                                     P, passing)
   3. Receivers = Wide Receiver (WR)   Defensive Backs = Strong Safety
                  Split End (SE)                         (SS), Free
                  Tight End (TE)                         Safety (FS)

   4. Offensive Line = Center (C)      Special Teams = Kicker (K)
                       Guard (RG, LG)                  Punter (P)

   APPENDIX A: QUICK GUIDE TO FOOTBALL

   For those of you who know nothing of the rules of football, here's
   an introduction to the basic principles of the game.

   OVERVIEW

   The main playing area is 53 12 yards wide and 100 yards long,
   divided into two 50 yard halves. At each end of the field is an
   additional ten yard section called the end zone.

   Each team has 11 men on the field. At any point in the game, there
   is an attacking team, or offense, and a defending team, or defense.
   The offense is truing to score points, and in order to do that it's
   got to move the ball across the defense's goal line and into the
   end zone for a touchdown. Each touchdown earns the offense 6
   points. The touchdown is the primary way to score points - there
   are a few other ways, but we'll talk about those later.

   Most of the game runs like this: The two teams line up against each
   other on either side of an imaginary line. This imaginary line -
   the line of scrimmage - runs through the point on the field where
   the ball currently rests. The offense has four attempts to move the
   ball from the line of scrimmage to the defense's goal line. These
   attempts are called downs: first down, second down, and so on. If
   the offense manages to move the ball 10 or more yards closer to the
   defense's goal line, they get a new first down from the point where
   the ball came to rest. The teams now line up on the new line of
   scrimmage and the offense has four more attempts to move the ball
   ten or more yards.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 61 ]

   If the offense either scores a touchdown or fails to gain ten yards
   in four downs, play passes to the other team, who become the
   offense and try to move the ball in the opposite direction - toward
   the other team's goal line. The game continues like this through
   four 15 minute quarters.


   THE KICKOFF

   The game begins with the visiting team kicking the ball from their
   35 yard line toward the players of the home team. The home team
   catches the ball and runs toward the opponents' end zone. The
   kicking team pursues the player who caught the ball and tries to
   knock him to the ground, or tackle him. When the player carrying
   the ball is tackled or runs out of bounds (off the edge of the
   field), play stops and the referee marks the spot at which it
   happened. This is known as spotting the ball, and play resumes
   from here. The team that kicked the ball is the defense, and the
   team that caught the ball is the offense.

   If the kick is caught in the end zone, the home team can touch the
   ball on the ground rather than run towards the center line. Known
   as a touchback, this action automatically sets the line of
   scrimmage on the 20 yard line.


   THE SCRIMMAGE

   Before each play begins, the two teams get in a circle - that is,
   they huddle - to discuss tactics. The offense plans a strategy
   intended to get the ball at least ten yards closer to the
   defense's goal line; the defense tries to anticipate the offense's
   plan of action and arrange their players in such a way as to
   prevent the offense from ganing yardage.

   An important thing to remember about American football is that even
   though each team has only 11 players out on the field, there are
   actually 45 players per team. Depending on the offensive or
   defensive strategy chosen, different players are brought out. For
   example, if your team is the offense and you think that the only
   chance you have of gaining yardage is with a long pass, you want to
   bring out a lot of players that can run fast and catch well. Once a
   play has been chosen, the teams line up opposite each other along
   the line of scrimmage in formation. The formation varies depending
   on the strategy selected.

   Between the two teams, along the line of scrimmage, is a neutral
   zone the length of the football. If a player from either side
   enters this area before the ball is brought into play, an offsides
   penalty is called and five yards are taken from the offending team.

   NOTE: Defense may enter the neutral zone with no penalty on two
   conditions:

   1.  They touch no offensive players, and
   2.  They return to the defensive side before the ball is snapped.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 62 ]


   THE SNAP

   The quarterback is the player in charge who calls the plays for the
   offense. On the quarterback's instructions, the offensive player
   holding the ball - known as the center - snaps the ball back to the
   quarterback. At this point, the ball is considered 'in play'.
   Players from both teams can cross the neutral zone and all breaks
   loose on the field.

   The offense must now physically move the ball toward the defense's
   goal line. There are two ways to do this. The most obvious way is
   to carry the ball toward the goal line. This is known as a running
   play. the other method is to throw the ball forward to another
   player. They call this a passing play. Only one forward pass can
   be made per play. It can be passed to another player after this,
   but only if the player is level with or behind the passer.


   OFFENSE: RUNNING PLAYS

   Once the quarterback receives the snap, he can hand or pass the
   ball to another player behind the line of scrimmage, who then
   attempts to weave his way through the defense toward the goal line.
   Alternately, he can choose to run with the ball himself.

   The defense tries to tackle the guy with the ball or force him out
   of bounds. If they succeed, the spot where the ball became 'out of
   play' is marked. This point is then compared with the original
   line of scrimmage. If 10 yards or more have been gained, a new
   first down is awarded. If less than 10 yards have been gained, the
   ball is spotted at its new yardage line and the next down is
   declared.

   After each play, the current down and the number of yeards needed
   to get another down are announced. For example, say it's the first
   down and the defense tackles the ballcarrier four yards in front of
   the original line of scrimmage. The next play would be described
   as 'second and six,' indicating that the offense was on its second
   down and now needed six yards to gain a new first down. The offense
   can also lose yardage. For instance, if the defense tackled the
   ballcarrier three yeards behind the original line of scrimmage,
   the next play would be described as 'second and thirteen.'

   The most common type of running play is the handoff, in which the
   quarterback literally places the ball in the hands of another
   player who is sprinting toward the defense's end zone. Another type
   of running play is the pitchout, in which the quarterback tosses
   the ball underhand to a player running wide toward the edge of the
   field.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 63 ]

   OFFENSE: PASSING PLAYS

   In passing plays, the quarterback throws the ball overhand to a
   receiver who attempts to catch it. If the receiver manages to catch
   the ball, he puts his head down and runs like hell toward the
   defense's goal line. If he's already in the end zone, it's a
   touchdown.

   When performing a passing play, the quarterback waits for the snap
   and then drops back into an area known as the pocket - a
   momentarily safe area craeted by blockers, who are keeping the big
   defensive guys off him while he scans the field for a suitably
   placed receiver. Of course, dropping back into the pocket alerts
   every guy in the defensive front line that a pass is about to go
   down, so they try to blast through the offensive blockers, hoping
   to reach the quarterback or at least upset his throw. This is known
   as a pass rush. If the quarterback can't find an open receiver, he
   may have to makea run for it to avoid being tackled. This last
   ditch attempt to gain a few yards is called a scramble. If the
   defense does manage to tackle the quarterback behind the line of
   scrimmage, it's called a sack. getting sacked is a quarterback's
   worst nightmare.

   A pass is declared complete when the receiver clearly has the ball
   in his possession - not in and out of his hands like a wet fish -
   and both his feet are within the boundries of the field. If the
   ball isn't caught, then the pass is declared incomplete and the
   ball is spotted at its last position. For example, say the offense
   is on its second down with twelve yards to go. If their pass is
   incomplete, the ball is spotted again and play resumes at 'third
   and twelve.'

   Occasionally a player on the defense manages to catch a ball
   thrown by the offense. This is known as an interception. As soon
   as a ball is intercepted, the defense immediately becomes the
   offense and is free to run the ball toward the opposite goal line.

   It's against the rules for a player to impede another player -
   offense or defense - who is trying to make a catch. When this
   occurs, pass interference is called. If the defender interfers
   with an offensive receiver, the ball is spotted at the point where
   the interference occured and the offense is given an automatic
   first down. If an offensive player interfers with a defensive
   receiver, a 10 yard penalty is given against the offense - that is,
   the ball is spotted 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage.


   PUNTS

   On the fourts down, the offensive team can choose to kick (punt)
   the ball toward the opponent's goal line. The center snaps the ball
   back about 15 yards from the line of scrimmage to the punter, who
   then kicks the ball into the defense's half as if it were a
   kickoff. The defense catches and takes possession of the ball, thus
   becoming the offense.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 64 ]

   Punting is particularly useful when the offense is struck down on
   its half of the field and they don't think they can get a new
   first down. A long punt can drive the opposing team deep into
   their own territory and make it more difficult for them to gain
   enough yardage to score.

   The offense can also fake a punt - the punter makes like he's going
   to kick, but at the last moment throws the ball to an open receiver
   or hands the ball to a fullback.


   DEFENSE: GAINING POSSESSION

   The defensive team has two goals in mind. The immediate goal is to
   keep the offense from gaining territory, making first downs, and
   scoring touchdowns. Keeping the offense at bay through four downs
   isn't easy, so the defense's secondary goal is to take possession
   of the ball and become the offense. This can be achieved by
   turnovers. One type of turnover, mentioned earlier, is the pass
   interception. The other is the fumble, when the offense
   accidentally drops the ball. If a defensive player manages to
   pick up or recover a fumbled ball, he's considered to have
   possession of the ball and is free to run it toward the opposing
   team's goal line.


   AUDIBLES AND TIME OUTS

   Once each team has called it offensive or defensive play, it lines
   up on the line of scrimmage. At this point, they try to guess the
   other team's strategy from the types of players they have on the
   field and the kind of formation they're in. The quarterback or
   defensive lineman who calls the plays may decide that the play or
   formation he chose is inappropriate, given the apparent strategy
   of the opposing team. When this happens, there are two kinds of
   last minute changes he can make.

   First, he can call an audible. An audible is a special pre-arranged
   play associated with a particular combination of numbers and
   words. It might be a trick offensive play or a defensive rush.
   By audibly calling out code words or numbers before the ball is
   snapped, the quarterback or linebacker alerts the team that the
   special play is replacing the one previously called.

   If the coach decides he needs a complete change of fomration, he
   can call a time out. During time outs, the game clock is stopped
   and the teams have 90 seconds to reorganize the play from scratch.
   Each team has three time outs during a half.

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 65 ]

   SCORING POINTS

   We've already mentioned the touchdown, but there are other ways to
   score, too. After a touchdown, the offense attempts to make a point
   after tocuhdown (PAT). The ball is spotted on the three yard line
   and snapped back about seven yards or so to a holder. The holder
   places the ball on the ground and orients it for the kicker, who
   attempts to kick it over the cross bar and between the goal posts.
   A successful PAT gives the offense 1 point.

   The offense can also score from a normal down by kicking a field
   goal. This is rarely attempted from further out than 40 yards. It
   takes exactly the same for as a PAT: the center snaps to a holder,
   who orients the ball for the kicker. A successful field goal gives
   the offense 3 points. If the attempted field goal is unsuccessful,
   the defense takes possession of the ball at the spot where the
   kick was attempted.

   The defense can also score in a situation known as a safety. This
   occurs when a defensive player tackles the ballcarrier in the
   offense's own end zone. This earns the defense two points.


   THE TEAMS

   Each team consists of a pool of 45 players, any 11 of which are on
   the field at the same time. Each team has a number of different
   11-man configurations, divided into offensive defensive, and
   special teams. The latter are used mainly for kicking plays -
   kickoffs, field goals, punts and PATs.

   Though there are many possible variations, a typical lineup can
   be divided into three main categories:

   Linemen (or offensive line)   A center flanked by two guards, in
                                 turn flanked by two tackles. The
                                 tackles protect the bakcs from
                                 defensive rushes.

   Receivers                     Two wide receivers and tight end at
                                 one end of the line. The wide
                                 receivers are usually fast and handy,
                                 while the tight end is a bigger and
                                 heavier receiver who can act as a
                                 blocker if necessary.

   Backfield                     The quarterback and two running backs
                                 (halfbacks, fullbacks, or both). The
                                 quarterback is the boss, calling the
                                 plays, doing most of the ball
                                 handling, passing, and even running
                                 occasionally. The fullback is the
                                 heaviest offensive back on the field,
                                 generally used for short running
                                 plays and

   -------------------------------------------------------------[ 66 ]

                                 protecting the quarterback. The
                                 halfback is a multi-function player
                                 who can run, block, receive, or even
                                 pass when necessary.

   The defensive lineup can also be divided into three categories:

   Defensive Line                Three or four big defenders,
                                 consisting of one or two tackles
                                 flanked by two ends. It's their job
                                 to block running plays through the
                                 center and rush the quarterback.

   Linebackers                   Three or four multi-purpose defenders
                                 who can chase runners or drop back to
                                 defend against passes. In a blitz
                                 defense, the linebackers may also
                                 rush the offensive line.

   Defensive Backs               Four back line defenders, consisting
                                 of two safeties flanked by two
                                 cornerbacks. The defensive backs
                                 guard the area behind the linebackers
                                 called the secondary. They're the
                                 last line of defense against running
                                 backs and receivers.

   About Gary Roberts

   Gary started programming at college, where he did his A levels in
   Computer Science, Maths, technology and Electronics and wrote some
   games that gave plumbing problems to various networks and almost
   got him thrown out.

   After college, it was on to the university, where he got a degree
   and some placements he'd rather gorget about. Then IBM snatched him
   up and made him work on a CD-ROM-based ray-tracing multi-media
   project and some other things with lots of hyphens in them. During
   this time of collars, ties and corporate lunches, he worked on
   something called Pink Floyd: The Wall, now the Numero Uno demo on
   the Amiga.

   He also wrote a game for the Amiga called TANX, which was published
   on Amiga Computing and Amiga Action. It was this kind of stuff that
   got the attention of Electronic Arts and their score of roving
   talent scouts. That, and the 231 CVs he sent us.

   When Gary isn't sweating over other hot Amiga conversions, you'll
   find him flying models, gliding in various contraption, and
   basking in the worship of adoring females. As he blithely sums up:
   "It's a life."
