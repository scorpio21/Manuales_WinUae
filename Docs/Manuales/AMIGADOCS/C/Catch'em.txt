INTRODUCTION:
JEFF IS A WARDER IN A ZOO. WHILE HE`S BUSY CHECKING OUT HIS LATEST GAME

THE SURROUNDING AREA. SOME END UP IN THE FOREST, SOME IN A DISUSED MINE,
AND THE REST GO SIGHT-SEEING IN THE LOCAL TOWN!

GET THEM BACK BEFORE HIS BOSS FINDS OUT!

JEFF HAS ALL SORTS OF GODDIES TO HAND IN HIS TRUCK AND ALSO SCATTERED
