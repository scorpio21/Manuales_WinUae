Please make a back-up of the disk before using it. Always use the back-up,
and preserve the original. Having made the back-up do not forget to
write-protect it!

Loading

To load the adventure. insert the game disk in the internal drive at the
'Workbench' prompt. When the Workbench screen has loaded, double-click on
the 'Game' disc icon, then double-click on the game icon itself - the title
picture should now load. Press any key to start the game.

Screen Layout

Once loaded you will notice that the screen is split into three sections.

The top line contains the following information:

The top left is the name of the room that you are currently in.
The first figure on the right is your score.
The second figure on the right is the number of moves you have made

The second section is the Graphics window, which is where the pictures are
displayed. Below the picture you will find four scrolls. These scrolls are
activated in the following fashion:

1. Move the mouse over the scroll you wish to pull down.
2. Click once on the left hand button.
3. Select the command you require using the mouse.
4. Click once. The command will now be typed into the input buffer for you.

The graphics window can be set to be as high or as low as you wish by
moving the mouse to the Scroll Ear, holding down the right hand button, and
moving the window up and down.

The third section is the text window, where your commands and the game's
responses are displayed.

Talking to the program

To communicate with the program, simply type in a sentence describing what
you want to do. When it is waiting for a command, a '>' prompt and a block
cursor are displayed. Once you have typed your command press the <RETURN>
key.

Editing Your Commands

The following allow you to edit the current line:

Move left one character            Left arrow
Move right one character           Right arrow
Move left one word                 Up arrow
Move right one word                Down arrow
Delete one character to the left   SHIFT-Left arrow or BACKSPACE
Delete one character to the right  SHIFT-Right arrow or DEL
Delete one word to the left        SHIFT-Up arrow
Delete one word to the right       SHIFT-Down arrow

Re-editing Your Last Command

If you discover that you have made a small typing error on your last line,
pressing the ESC key will bring it back for editing.

More

When there are too many lines to display on the screen at once the message
'<MORE>' appears as the bottom right of the screen. Pressing any key will
allow the game to continue.

Function n

This will allow you to define any of the ten function keys. For instance if
you decide that you are typing the command 'GET ALL' repeatedly, you can
define function 1 to be 'GET ALL', and every time you now press F1 the
string 'GET ALL' will be placed on your command line. Function can also be
abbreviated to Funct.

Save

This command enables you to save your current position in the game. When
prompted for a filename, enter 'DF0:' for the internal drive, or 'DF1:' for
the external drive followed by the filename, e.g. 'DF1 :SAVED'. Please do
not attempt to save files on the game disk, and remember to replace the game
disk after saving a game position.

Restore

To reload a previously saved game type 'RESTORE'; as with 'SAVE' you will
be prompted for a filename. Don't forget to put the game disk back in the
default drive after loading a saved game

Printer On (Printer Off)

You can record your game by use of this command which turns the printer on
(and off). Do not despair if you have a slow printer, as the adventure
maintains its own printer buffer (but please ensure that your printer is
switched on before using this feature).

Graphics On (Graphics Off)

If you prefer to play the game without the pictures being displayed they
can be disabled with 'GRAPHICS OFF'. They can then be re-enabled with
'GRAPHICS ON'.

Textsize

This command will change the size of your characters: The default is small,
however you may toggle this command to select large characters.

Speech

This command toggles the speech synthesizer on and off. The speech will be
heard through your monitor in stereo if your monitor can cope, or mono if
it can't.

Everything that you type into the game and every reply that you receive
from the game will be spoken clearly by the computer. It is quite practical
to play the game in this way without even looking at the screen.

                           INTRODUCTION

What is an adventure game? Think of it as something like a novel - except
that you are the lead character. The computer presents you with part of the
story, then gives you the opportunity to decide what you want to do next.
You'll know when that moment has come because you'll see the "prompt"
appear on the screen. It looks like this:

When you see the prompt, it's time to tell the computer what you want to do
next. You do this by typing plain English. Corruption understands an awful
lot, but not everything; the best way to make your instructions clear is to
imagine that they are preceded by the "invisible" phrase "Now I want
to...", followed by whatever it is you want to do. After you've made your
move", press the RETURN or ENTER key on your computer; Corruption will then
evaluate your instructions and proceed accordingly.

Your aim is to win the game. What that involves, and how best to go about
it, is up to you to discover as you play. All we're going to say right now
is that you'll need all your wits and determination.

GAME COMMANDS

You can get a long way with simple, two-word commands like GET BRIEFCASE.
(The game will respond with something like "You have now got the
briefcase."). But to do more complex things, you'll need more complex
commands. Let's go through some of these. Imagine we're playing an
espionage adventure (and, by the way, there are no clues to Corruption
here, so don't get your hopes up...) Perhaps you decide you want to

>GO INTO MR. HARGREAVES' OFFICE.

You can move around the game by GOing to a particular place or in a
particular direction. The directions you can use are NORTH. SOUTH. EAST and
WEST, and possibly NORTHEAST, SOUTHEAST. SOUTHWEST, NORTHWEST, UP, DOWN, IN
and OUT. (Of course, not all of these directions are available at every
point in the game; there may just be one way into and out of Mr.
Hargreaves' office, for example.)

Thus the simplest way to move about the game is to say, for instance, GO
NORTH, or just NORTH or N for short. (See the section on abbreviations for
more details of short commands.) Mr. Hargeaves' office is in darkness, so
you decide to

>SWITCH ON MY TORCH.

Corruption recognizes the possessive pronouns, MY, HIS and HER. These are
useful to make it clear which item you're referring to; for example, if Mr
Hargreaves' secretary turns up unexpectedly, you might

>PUT THE POISON PILL INTO HER COFFEE CUP.

You don't want to accidentally poison your own coffee! Having dealt with
the secretary. it's time to go about some serious espionage.

>OPEN THE DESK'S TOP DRAWER WITH THE MASTER
KEY AND LooK INSIDE IT.

This is a combination of two simpler commands: OPEN THE DESK'S TOP DRAWER
WITH THE MASTER KEY and LOOK INSIDE IT. Corruption understands multiple
commands: you can string them together with AND, a comma, THEN or just a
full stop. For example, PICK UP THE CODE BOOK AND READ IT or GET THE BOOK
THEN READ IT or just GET BOOK. READ IT do precisely the same thing. But
back to Hargreaves' dastardly top drawer...

>GET THE TOP SECRET FOLDER AND THE SLIP OF PAPER FROM IT.

You can save time (game and real) by doing things more efficiently. For
instance the commands GET MY GUN and GET THE TRUTH DRUG then GET THE CAMERA
take three moves. whereas the same operation can be performed in just one
turn with GET THE DRUG, CAMERA AND MY GUN. In Corruption, each turn is one
minute of game time, so it's wise not to waste time when you're in a hurry.
Well... we've got the slip of paper. What now?

>READ THE SLIP OF PAPER

In Corruption you will need to prove to the game that you have found out an
important fact. by actually finding it out in each game. Suppose, for
example, that the combination of the safe is written on the slip of paper.
Corruption will only acknowledge that you know the combination if you READ
THE SLIP OF PAPER. The fact that you might have found out the combination
whilst playing the game on a previous occasion is immaterial. Imagine that
each time you restart a new game, in your role in the plot you know
nothing.

>OPEN THE FOLDER AND READ EVERYTHING THAT IS IN IT.

Most of the time, objects that contain things, such as folders. desk
drawers and files, have to be open before you can refer to things inside
them. In the above example, the game will not automatically open the file
to let you read the contents.(If it did you would be getting a free move!)
Corruption recognizes the collective terms ALL or EVERYTHING and deals with
them according to what it thinks you are trying to do. If you walk into a
room you will be told about the things which are lying about. easily
visible. Tell the game to GET ALL at that point will just get those things.
If you have dropped something that, too, will be lying around, so GET ALL
will get that, as well But there may be things hidden in cupboards. To get
those, you first have to OPEN THE CUPBOARD then GET ALL FROM THE CUPBOARD.
It can get complicated; Corruption will understand sentences like PUT
EVERYTHING IN THE ENVELOPE IN THE BRIEFCASE IN THE CABINET, but you might
lind it clearer to say PUT THE CONTENTS OF THE ENVELOPE IN THE BRIEFCASE
INTO THE CABINET. Having done that, you might want to

>REMOVE THE BLUEPRINTS FROM IT AND PUT THEM ON THE DESK.

When it is necessary to have long commands it is convenient to use pronouns
whenever possible; that is, IT, THEM, HIM and HER. This can save you having
to type long-winded sentences. Remember. though, IT may not always be what
you expect. The usual rule is that the pronouns refer to the item or items
involved in your previous command, not the last item mentioned by the game.
There are some circumstances, though, where events in the game may affect
the pronouns. For example, an important character walking into the room
will be made the subject of the pronoun HIM or HER

>GET THE FAKE BLUEPRINTS FROM MY JACKET
POCKET AND PUT THEM INTO THE FOLDER.

Since you can move things around the game, you may end up with several
things of the same name in the same place. In the example above there are
now blueprints on the desk and some more blueprints which you took from
your jacket pocket. If you just typed LOOK AT THE BLUEPRINTS the game would
be unsure which set of blueprints you were talking about, and so it would
ask you "Which ones, the real blueprints or the fake blueprints?", to which
you can respond THE REAL BLUEPRINTS,or THE REAL ONES, or just REAL. Maybe
you had not realized there were two of a kind and may want to see both:
then respond with BOTH. If you don't care. just type ANY.

>GET THE REAL BLUEPRINTS FROM THE DESK.

This is being extra-sure! You could have got away with saying GET THE REAL
BLUEPRINTS or GET THE BLUEPRINTS FROM THE DESK: in either case, it was
clear precisely which set you meant.

>LOOK BEHIND THE COMPANY PICTURE.

Sometimes objects are not evident until you search for them.

>USE THE COMBINATION ON THE SLIP OF PAPER TO OPEN THE COMPANY SAFE.

USE is a way of phrasing a command the other way around. You can USE
something to do something. For example, USE THE MASTER KEY TO OPEN THE DESK
DRAWER is the same as OPEN THE DESK DRAWER WITH THE MASTER KEY.

>PUT ALL FROM THE SAFE EXCEPT THE LEDGERS AND THE RECEIPTS INTO MY
BRIEFCASE.

If you are dealing with a large number of objects, it's often easier to say
what you don't want, rather than typing a whole list of items that you do
want. Suppose the safe contained many objects you want, like gold, silver,
jewelry, money, and blackmail letters, but also contained valueless ledgers
and receipts. Typing GET ALL FROM THE SAFE EXCEPT THE LEDGERS AND RECEIPTS
is handier than GET THE GOLD, SILVER, JEWELRY, MONEY AND THE BLACKMAIL
LETTERS THAT ARE IN THE SAFE.

TALKING TO PEOPLE

In Corruption you have to pass on information to others, as well as collect
it yourself. Corruption has been designed around two major channels of
communication: ASK and TELL. You'll need to do both a lot, but there's
little point in making efforts to communicate with characters in other
ways. If you want to get information from a character. "ASK [someone] ABOUT
[something]" - for example.

>ASK THE M15 MAN ABOUT THE POLISH SPY.

The things you ASK about do not have to be solid objects, eg. you can ASK
THE SPY ABOUT ESPIONAGE.

The other channel for communication is TELL. This is more subtle than ASK,
since although it takes the same form it left up to the game to decide
precisely what information you reveal. For example, READ THE SLIP OF PAPER
finds out the combination to the safe; so if you:

>TELL M15 MAN ABOUT THE SLIP OF PAPER.

The game will work out what you know about the slip of paper and pass it
on. In this case the game may respond: "You tell the M15 man that the safe
combination is four left, three right and six left."

You might find out numerous pieces of information about a particular
object; in this case, each time you TELL about that object, the game
divulges another piece of information until you've told all you know. It is
important that you really do know about the object, since otherwise the
game is not convinced and refuses to say anything.

In the above, if you had not read the slip of paper but had still said TELL
THE M15 MAN ABOUT THE SLIP OF PAPER, the game replies: "But you don't know
anything about the slip of paper." (Of course you may know that it exists
and was in Mr. Hargreaves' desk drawer, but the game does not consider that
significant enough to interest anyone else in the story.)

OTHER COMMANDS

Corruption is based on information. Where other adventure games have
puzzles involving the manipulation of objects, Corruption instead has a
complicated web of who-knows-what and who-goes-where, -when and -how. You
score points for the information you manage to find.

Waiting

The Corruption clock displays the current time in the top right hand comer
of the screen. This clock advances one minute for each game turn, and in
that time each of the many characters in the story have a turn to go about
their business. You can use the command WAIT UNTIL to speed the progress of
the plot. The syntax is "Wait until [time]" - for example, WAIT UNTIL 2:30.
(A time of day is expressed as hour:minute, on a 12-hour clock.) As you
wait, the clock in the top corner advances rapidly to the desired time.
Nearby events can sometimes interrupt a WAIT command, so if some special
event happens, Corruption lets you change your mind and do something else,
or carry on waiting. (Note that you can only WAIT for 15 or 30 minutes,
unless you are unusually patient...)

Following People

Using the FOLLOW command, you can follow characters in Corruption providing
you are physically able to move in the right directions. When following
someone, the prompt changes from the normal '>' prompt to '(following
[name])>', where [name] is the person you are following. While following
people, each tum takes a full move, even if the character you are following
is stationary. This is because you are effectively waiting for them. If you
press the return key while the follow prompt is displayed, the game will
advance one minute and you will move one step after the person you are
tailing. Any other command terminates the follow mode in favour of your new
instruction - but beware; you might lose sight of the person you are
following.

SPECIAL COMMANDS

To make things easier, a number of special single word commands exist to
alleviate typing.

INVENTORY This command gives you a list of objects that you are carrying.lt
also describes any clothes you are wearing.

AGAIN Sometimes an action needs to be repeated, AGAIN recalls the previous
command typed. This is especially useful to continue waiting after an
interruption.

SCORE shows you how well you are doing. In Corruption the score is based on
how much you have found out. You do not necessarily need a full score to
win the game.

VERBOSE/BRIEF/NORMAL These three commands alter the amount of descriptive
text displayed when moving from location to location.

In VERBOSE mode the room description is always displayed even if you have
been through the room before. (This mode is recommended for beginners).

BRIEF, however, is the opposite; you only get the name of the room - no
description The only way to force a description is by typing LOOK on its
own.

NORMAL, is the default, displaying the room description the first time you
enter a room, but not for subsequent visits.

QUIT When you wish to stop playing, QUIT finishes your game. You are given
a choice of whether to restart a fresh game or to exit the program. Restart
forgets the game you are currently playing and starts again.

Some words are used frequently enough to justify a single or double letter
abbreviation:

ADVICE FOR BEGINNERS

If you have never played an adventure game before, please remember that
there are limitations in what you can say and do. If you are having
difficulty trying to express to the machine what you want to do, try saying
it another way - the game possesses a large but nevertheless limited
vocabulary. Observe the following helpful tips:

1. Get to know your way about the game. You will not be able to visit all
   the locations at first; some may be discovered later, as the plot
   unfolds. Even if you have a map in the packaging, draw up a more
   detailed one marking the locations of important items for future
   reference

2. Try to EXAMINE as much as possible. Some clues are more subtle than
   others.

3. Before playing, make sure you have a formatted blank disk handy to save
   games on. Save the game frequently, especially if you wish to try out
   something reckless. Saving the game does not cost a move, so in places
   where timing may be essential save a copy of the game at the start of
   the problem, just in case you make a mess of it.

4. Try to find out what people are up to in the game; you can FOLLOW them,
   or just hang around to see what they do. Try ASKing them about each
   other to find out what their point of view is.If they do something
   unusual or interesting, make a note of the time and location so that you
   will be able to catch them again.

5. Read the packaging very carefully as it contains some vital clues.

Good Luck !

                        How to use this section

The Cypheric Hint section lets you get hints for Corruption without seeing
the answers to questions you do not wish to know.

If you can't solve a puzzle, or if you just do not know what to do next,
scan the list of questions until you find one which resembles your problem.
Then, at the prompt, type:

>HINT

The computer will respond with:

Please enter your hint:

At this point you type in the letters between '<' and '>'. The computer
will then decode your hint. If you have not typed in the correct letters
the computer will respond:

Sorry, please try that one again.

A "+" sign after the answer means there's more to come. Please type in the
next hint.

The first hint is usually a gentle nudge in the right direction. The last
hint may be the complete solution to your problem.

              A Guide to Popular Card Games of Chance & Skill

Trente et Quarante

Simple enough, like all casino classics - but fortunes can be lost as well
as made. The rules are simple. Cards are dealt in two rows. red and black.
If the first card dealt is black, the dealer continues dealing cards to the
black row until its total value is equal to or greater than thirty-one.
Face cards count ten points, aces count one. She then deals the red row in
the same way. (If the first card was red, then the red row would be dealt
first.) The winning row is the one whose total is closest to thirty-one. If
both rows are the same, the bank takes all bets.

You bet on the row you think will win. You can bet on RED or BLACK, or on
COULEUR (where you bet on the row which is the same colour as the first
card) or INVERSE (the row of the opposite colour to the first card).

The normal way to place a bet is to say

>BET (X POUNDS or CHIPS) ON (RED/BLACK/COULEUR/INVERSE).

Winning bets pay evens (i.e.. if you win. you get )our stake back, plus an
equal amount.)

Example: You

>BET 10 POUNDS ON INVERSE.

The first card dealt is the six of Clubs (a BLACK card); this means that
you are betting on the RED ROW. Dealer deals 4, 9, Ace, King and 8. Total
for the BLACK row is 38. She then deals Queen, 9, Ace, 4, 8 to the RED ROW,
giving it a total of 32. The RED ROW is closest to 31, therefore you win
$10 plus your original stake of $10 making a total of $20.

Blackjack

This is named after the "Black Jack" - the combination of a face card
(worth ten) and an ace (worth eleven - or, under certain circumstances,
worth one). You are gambling on whether you can get nearer to a total hand
value of twenty one - without exceeding it - than the Bank (that is to say,
the dealer), The dealer gives you your first card. You place your bet. The
syntax is:

>BET (X POUNDS or X CHIPS).

You then get a second card. This is the minimum hand with which you can
play. If you are happy with this hand, you can now "Stick" - in other
words, decline any further cards. You do this by typing NO or N or STICK or
S when the croupier asks if you want another card. The croupier at this
point, or whenever you do "stick", will show her hand. If your two cards
add up to less than 21, you should now consider whether "twisting" - asking
for another card - is likely to bring your total to more than 21. If you
have, for example, two tens, or a ten and a King, then drawing another card
is likely to push you over the limit, in which case you have "bust". (Note
that, in these circumstances, you are allowed to count an Ace as equal to
one rather than eleven. You needn't worry about this as the computer
calculates the best value for your hand if you have an ace.)

If, on the other hand, you want another card, type YES or Y or TWIST or T.

The game ends when you stick or bust, or when the croupier busts. You win
if you beat her, or if you are still in the game when she busts. She wins
all draws.

If you win with a Black Jack hand, the payout is 3 to 2 - that is, $5 for
every $2 you bet (because you get your original stake back, too).
Everything else pays evens.

N.B. Some Casinos recognize another form of winning hand, where the Player
holds five cards and his total still remains under twenty-one, called a
five-card trick'. Pay attention to the house rules of your casino.

Baccarat

Everyone gets a chance to be a star in Baccarat, because it's played by one
of the players at the table, against the "Bank", or dealer. House rules
vary as to who can be the Player; in Casinos populated by dedicated
gamesters, the casual visitor has little or no chance of becoming Player,
so might as well simply take his place with the rest of the table.

The Player takes the "shoe", which holds the cards. The betting is on
whether the Player or the Bank will win, so the first thing to do is

>BET (X POUNDS or X CHIPS) ON (BANK or PLAYER)

Both Bank and Player are dealt two cards from the shoe, face up. They add
up the values of their cards (aces count as one, face cards count as ten),
then knock off the first digit if the total is ten or more. For example, if
the Player is dealt a S and a 4, his hand value is 9; if dealt a 7 and a 3,
the hand value is zero; and if dealt a Queen and an 8, the total value is
18 so knock off the '1' giving a hand value of eight.

This particular hand value, called a "natural", is an immediate winner. So
is a hand value of nine. If there is a draw, neither the Player nor the
Bank wins; the casino takes all the bets on the table.

If neither player has a natural and there is not a draw, play now
continues. The rules are strict. If the Players hand was 5 or less, he has
to draw another card (let's call this one "C") and recalculates his total.
If, alternatively, his hand totalled 6 or 7, he must stand - that is, he
isn't allowed any more cards.

If the Player had to stand, the Bank then follows the same rules; in other
words, if she has 5 or less, she draws another card, if she has 6 or 7 she
stands.

If, on the other hand, the Player drew another card - the one we called
"C", remember - the Bank follows a different set of rules:

(1) If the Bank's hand is seven, she stands.

(2) If the Bank's hand is two or less, she draws another card.

(3) If the Bank's hand is three to six inclusive, then what she does
    depends on the value of the Player's card "C", as follows:

	(a) Bank's hand = 3; stand if C=8, else draw.

	(b) Bank's hand = 4; stand if C = 1,8,9 or 10; else draw

	(c) Bank's hand = 5; stand if C = 1,2,3,8,9 or 10; else draw

	(d) Bank's hand=6; stand if C= 1,2,3,4,5,8,90rlO; else draw

At the end of this process, the hand values are recalculates, and the
highest one wins. The casino takes all bets if there is a draw - that is,
neither Player nor Bank wins. If you bet on Bank and it wins, the Casino
takes five per cent of your winnings (calculated to the nearest pound) as
commission.

A winning Baccarat hand pays evens, like Trente et Quarante.

General Notes

The house limit in the City's casinos is usually $100,000

Most chips are worth $10; but you can receive smaller-value chips in your
winnings. If you want to use these to bet with, you will have to calculate
the value and: BET X POUNDS, but watch out - there may be a minimum bet.
