INTRODUCTION: or What Are We Doing in Tilverton, Anyway?

JOURNAL ENTRY 1
     "I am beginning a new journal.  My old journal is gone,
along with all of the party's equipment.  I write here to try to
make some sense out of our spotty memories.
     "We had all agreed to come south to Tilverton to seek the
lost princess, Nacacia of Cormyr.  Tilverton is on the border
between the Dalelands and Cormyr, and was the last place the
princess had been spotted.
     "Rumor was that King Azoun's youngest daughter, the Princess
Nacacia, ran away from the royal household Of Cormyr almost a
year ago.  She fled an arranged marriage and ran off with a
cleric from Tilverton named Gharri of Gond.
     "The latest word was that Nacacia and Gharri had a falling
out and that she was seen near Tilverton recently. The king had a
large reward out for Nacacia's return.  A smart group of
adventures like ourselves could make some powerful friends if
they found the princess and returned her to the king.
     "Somewhere along the road to Tilverton we were attacked. The
brigands must have been invisible, because some of our party went
down before we knew what was going on. I vaguely remember dark
faces in evil looking helmets firing crossbows into our midst.
The crossbow hits were not fatal, but every hit seemed to drop
its target.  I remember getting hit in the arm.  The wound blazed
like fire.  My head swam.  Just before I blacked out, I thought
that this was a bad end for such experienced adventures.
     "Now we awake in Tilverton with our wounds healed.  Our
equipment is gone, bet we have found a stash of coins.  One of
our first priorities must be to buy new equipment.
     "I overheard a servant mention the date, but I'm not sure I
believe it.  If the servant speaks true it is almost a month
since the ambush.  Almost anything could have happened in that
time.
     "It seems that almost anything did.  Each of us awoke with
five azure blue symbols imprinted on our sword arm.  The symbols
are not tattoos, they seem to exist below the skin. They
occasionally feel like they're moving.
     "We have devised a plan of attack.  Our spell-casters will
prepare their spells.  We will purchase some new arms and armor.
Then we are going out into Tilverton and find out what is going
on.  Someone must know.  And I don't care if we have to roust
every sage, priest, and bartender in this town to find out.
     "These are some random printed notes I have collected.
Their information may be important on our journey. My journal
notes continue on page 10. ( or when ever they appear on this
text that I am typing RM )

IMPORTANT DALELANDS GEOGRAPHIC REFERENCES
The area shown on the map stretches from Tilverton in the
southwest to Phlan in the northeast. It includes the center of
the Elven Court, the western shores of the Moonsea, and several
of the dales surrounding the Elven court. The area is sparsely
populated, with major concentrations in the cities and towns and
farms covering the intervening dales. Each location on the map is
described below.

Cormyr is a large civilized nation to the south and west of the
Dalelands. The forces of Cormyr have extended their northern
border by annexing the city of Tilverton. Cormyr has no known
plans to continue its expansion toward the Dalelands.

Dagger Falls is a Farming Community on the River Tesh and the
largest settlement in Daggerdale.  The inhabitants of Dagger
Falls dislike outsiders of any kind. They fear the expansion of
Zhentil Keep may destroy their independence.

The Dalelands include the fertile areas surrounding the vast
Elven Court. There are many dales around the Court, including:
Shadowdale, Mistdale, Battledale, and Daggerdale.

The Elven Court is a vast forest that was the center of elven
civilization in the areas near the Moonsea. When the elves left
in The Retreat, the elven court was left empty. Without the elves
to control them, evil creatures have begun to multiply deep
within the forests. Some fear that these creatures will become a
threat to the surrounding Dalelands.

Essembra is the trading center or Battledale. Battledale has seen
many conflicts; many bitter enemies find it convenient to hold
their wars in Battledale, rather than risk ravishing their own
lands. Battledale has lost some of its former power with the
retreat of the elves.

Hillsfar was formerly the major trading center between the Elves
of the Elven Court and the Humans of the Moonsea reaches.  With
the retreat of the elves, Hillsfar has been taken over by a
ruthless dictator.  He has expanded the Red Plume mercenaries and
is engaged in a successful military campaign against Zhentil Keep
in the ruins of Yulash.

Mistledale is a quiet farming community. Its Largest town is
Ashabenford, where the River Ashaba crosses the road from
Hillsfar to Tilverton.

Myth Drannor was a huge ancient city of elves at the center of
the Elven court.  WHen the elves left the Elven Court, the city
was left deserted.  Evil Creatures, drawn by the elven places of
power, quickly rushed into the city and turned it into a
foreboding ruin.

Shadowdale is the name of both a town and its surrounding area
located where the River Ashaba crossed the road from Tilverton to
Voonlar. Shadowdale is a haven for adventurers and happily opens
its arms to the power, protection, and riches that successful
adventurers bring. Shadowdale is also home to the famous sage
Elminster.

The Standing Stone is a large marker commemorating the singing of
the agreement whereby the elves allowed humans to settle the
Dalelands. The marker is also the closest marker to the ruined
city of Myth Drannor.

Teshwave is a medium-sized city that has been recently occupied
by the forces of Zhentil Keep. So far the occupation has been a
calm affair and the forces of Zhentil keep think that the people
of Teshwave have been cowed.

Tilverton is a small city on the southwestern border of the
kingdom of Cormyr near the Dalelands. Tilverton was recently
taken over by the Cormyr Protection forces and is currently
occupied by the 7th division. However, the occupation is going
peacefully, and the people of Tilverton actually seem relieved to
be under the protection of the kingdom of Cormyr.

Voonlar is an evil city which has allied with Zhentil Keep.
Troops from voonlar have attempted to invade Shadowdale many
times, but have always been turned back.

Yulash is a ruined city that sits on the only trade route from
Zhentil Keep to the civilized southlands. The city is currently
controlled by the Red Plume mercenaries of Hillsfar after a
bitter struggle with the forces of Zhentil Keep. Both sides are
preparing themselves for another round of battle.

Zhentil Keep is a major city politically controlled by the evil
Zhentrim. The city has been expanding its influence both west and
south and many fear any further expansion of its power.

IMPORTANT DALELAND'S POWER GROUPS
The Army of Zhentil Keep is not so much a tool of the city state,
as it is a tool of the evil group, the Zhentrim. The army has
recently taken the city of Teshwave, patrols the route to
Voonlar, and its fighting with the army of Hillsfar over the
ruins of Yulash. The army of Zhentil Keep excels in the close
cooperation of fighters, mages, and clerics. It also employs
Terror Teams of intermediate level clerics, mages, and fighter to
sneak behind enemy lines and wreak havoc.

The Cultists of Moander worship a dark, evil god whose power was
centered in Yulash. Long ago, the elves of the Elven Court
banished Moander to another plane and barred much of his power
from the realms. Since then, Moander worship has been reduced to
a few fanatic cultists. These cultists were central in creating
the first azure bonds and temporarily brought Moander back into
the realms. But, Moander was rebanished after a vicious magical
combat over Westgate. After Moander's rebanishment, his remaining
cultists faithfully began yet another plot to return their master
to the realms. Moander's symbol is a black hand with a mouth in
its palm.

Elminster the Sage is the most famous resident of Shadowdale. He
is a powerful magic-user of indeterminate age. Elminster no
longer tutors or works for hire, but he investigates items and
issues of great import to the safety of the realms.

The Five Knives, also known as the Flame Knives, are an
organization of thieves and assassins that formerly flourished
throughout Cormyr. King Azoun IV of Cormyr drove the Fire Knives
from their comfortable niche, and they have been unable to find a
new home ever since. The Fire Knives have been sworn to
assassinate King Azoun IV and joined the first bonding project as
a means to that end. After the fiasco of the first bonding
project, the remains of the Fire Knives have moved into the outer
edges of the country of Cormyr. They are rumored to be engaged in
another plot against the king. The symbol of the Fire Knives is a
dagger surrounded by flame.

The Harpers are a secretive group consisting mostly of high level
bards and rangers. The overall aims of the Harpers are a mystery,
but they are known to support good causes, and to oppose evil
groups such as the Zhentrim. The Harpers mostly work behind the
scenes, applying as little force as necessary to unravel the
plots of evil.

The Knights of Myth Drannor guard the realms from the tremendous
powers and unending perils of the ruins of Myth Drannor. They
keep the unspeakable monsters inside the city from escaping. They
also keep naive adventurers from entering the city and getting
hurt.

The Red Plumes of Hillsfar is the generic name for all troops
fighting for the city of Hillsfar. The city hires mercenaries of
many companies. These companies all fight under the banner of the
Red Plumes. Recently, the Red Plumes have expanded greatly. They
have just taken control of the ruins of Yulash from the army of
Zhentil Keep.

The Red Wizards of Thay are the powerful, paranoid spell-casters
who rule the kingdom of Thay. Thay is an evil kingdom, far to the
east of the Dalelands. The Red Wizards gain influence in Thay by
showing up their fellow wizards, by gaining magical or political
power, or by causing great strife among the enemies of They. As
far as the Red Wizards are concerned, the enemies of Thay include
everyone else in the realms. Each Red Wizard has his own symbol.

The Royal Family of Cormyr rules the Kingdom of Cormyr. The royal
family is headed by King Azoun IV, a powerful warrior and a just
king. Azoun's Advisor, and former tutor, is Vangerdahast a
powerful Magic-User. One of Azoun's daughters, the princess
Nacacia, disappeared almost one year ago. It is rumored that
Nacacia fled the royal family with a priest named Gharri of Gond,
a member of the temple of Gond in Tilverton. The King has put out
a large reward for the return of the Princess. It is rumored that
he is personally searching for Nacacia incognito.

Tyranthraxus is an evil spirit who flourished until recently in
and around the ruined city of Phlan. He controlled Phlan with
legions of humanoid monsters, and hoped to make it a base for the
conquest of the Moonsea reaches. He was reported to draw power
from a gateway between the planes called the Pool of Radiance.
His main power was the ability to possess powerful creatures and
escape even after the creatures body had died. A band of
adventurers freed Phlan and defeated Tyranthraxus just in the
last year. His spirit was sucked back through the Pool of
Radiance and the pool dried up.

The Worshipers of bane are centered on the Moonsea, but its
influence spreads throughout the realms. Bane is the evil god of
strife, hatred, and tyranny. The largest temple of Bane is The
Black Lord's Altar in Mulmaster. The second largest temple is The
Dark Shrine in Zhentil Keep. Bane's symbol is a black left hand
on a field of red.

A SHORT HISTORY OF THE DALELANDS AND THE ELVEN COURT
1357 years ago, humans moving north encountered the Elven Court,
a huge outcropping of forest just south of the Moonsea. These
humans sought and received permission from the elven rulers to
settle the dales around the forest. The Standing Stone was
erected to commemorate the occasion.

Out of the agreement, the various human settlements of the
Dalelands were born. These settlements included Shadowdale,
Mistledale, Daggerdale, and Battledale. The settlements grew
around their population centers: Shadowdale, Ashabenford, Dagger
Falls, and Essembra.

South and East of the Elven Court lay the human kingdom of
Sembia. The Sembians cut at the forest to make plans for their
ships. The elves put a stop to this by crushing the Sembians at
the battle of Singing Arrows, 473 years ago. The elves and humans
then made an agreement that allowed the humans to push a road
from sembia, past the standing stone, to the Moonsea. Where the
road met the Moonsea the city of Hillsfar grew.

South and West of the Elven Court lay the human Kingdom of
Cormyr. The forces of Cormyr have recently taken over the border
town of Tilverton, but any further expansion is hindered by the
southern tip of the Desertsmouth Mountains. Shadow Gap and
Tilver's Gap lead through the mountains, but the king of Cormyr
has not yet risked his armies thought the treacherous mountain
passes.

Around the Moonsea, Hillsfar and other cities prospered. Zhentil
Keep rose to power, fell from grace, and rose again under the
power of the Zhentrim. Phlan rose to prominence, was devastated
by a blight, ruined by the dragon flight, and then rescued from
permanent enslavement by a band of adventurers.

North of the Elven Court, cities outside the Dalelands arouse.
Yulash prospered as the center of the worship of Moander, until
the elves banished Moander from the realms. Teshwave grew as a
river town, until it was occupied by the forces of Zhentil Keep.
Voonlar grew on the edge of the Elven court, and continued to
grow even though its attacks toward Shadowdale were repulsed
again and again. All around the Elven Court humans bustled about,
building towns, clearing the wild, and remaking the land in their
own image.

But, the battle of Singing Arrows and the road from Sembia to
Hillsfar started a great debate among the elves. Could elves and
humans live side by side, or was human expansion a threat to the
lifestyle of the Elven Court? For hundreds of years the elves
secretly debated among themselves. Scant years ago they made
their decision. The elves began The Retreat.

The Retreat caught the humans around the Elven Court by sunrise.
Almost overnight, the inhabitants of the court and the
magnificent city of Myth Drannor seemed to disappear. Once the
elves decided to leave, the left swiftly. Some elves living in
the communities outside the Elven Court left, but others stayed
in their new homes.

The Retreat left a huge area empty. Evil forces quickly took
advantage of the power vacuum. The bright elven forests quickly
became dark and foreboding. The fabled city of Myth Drannor fell
into ruins and was overrun by evil creatures. And the road from
Sembia to Hillsfar was no longer a safe trek for fat merchants,
but a dangerous gauntlet for the adventurous traveler.

After the retreat came the Flight of the Dragons. Hundreds of
dragons flew out of the north to devastate cities and towns all
around the Dalelands. The dragons were driven off or destroyed,
but at tremendous cost. The port in Hillsfar was closed for weeks
by the huge body of a fallen dragon. The battle between the witch
Sylume and a giant dragon left nothing but a crater of one corner
of Shadowdale. But, the flight ended as swiftly as it had come.
Once the dragons were gone, the settlements picked up the pieces
and went on with their lives.

By now, the inhabitants of Dalelands have gotten used to the
absence of the elves after The Retreat, and the damage from the
Flight of the Dragons is old news. They look toward the future
where another harvest ripens in the fields, battles between
armies rage, and children grow up dreaming of becoming
adventurers.

A BARD'S NOTES ON PHLAN AND THE POOL OF RADIANCE
The City of Phlan had risen to prominence, and then fell beneath
an overwhelming tide of evil monsters. The ruined city was
controlled by a powerful entity, known only as "The Boss."

While The Boss looked outward toward even greater conquests,
human settlers landed and created a foothold on the edge of
Phlan. Adventurers flocked to the city in hopes of claiming a
portion of the Phlan's fabled wealth.

The battle to cleanse Phlan was an epic struggle. First,
adventurers cleared the city, block by block. Then, they found
and defeated the concentrations of evil monsters and men in the
wilderness around the city. Finally, adventurers assaulted the
castle where the evil leader held sway.

When the adventurers finally battled their way into the deepest
chamber of the castle, they discovered the infamous 'Boss' of
Phlan was an evil spirit named Tyranthraxus the Flamed One.
Tyranthraxus had possessed the body of a great bronze dragon and
had transported the mystical 'Pool of Radiance' into his lair.
The pool was an extra-dimensional portal which game Tyranthraxus
access to information and power from beings on other planes.

Tyranthraxus used his power to augment the dragon's already
fearsome combat capabilities. He was also protected by a squad of
powerful fighters with magical arms and armor. The adventurers
triumphed over Tyranthraxus and his minions only after the most
heroic of combats.

When Tyranthraxus was defeated he did not die. His naked spirit
rose from the body of the dragon and was drawn back thought the
Pool of Radiance. The pool drained away and the power of
Tyranthraxus was broken. Phlan was free.

Like most heroes, however, the adventurers who freed Phlan did
not stay around. It is known that they took a boat from Phlan to
the City of Hillsfar across the Moonsea. From there it is rumored
that they traveled south and west in search of further adventure.

JOURNAL ENTRY 2
     The assembled dragons glare down upon the party, three
ancient dragons of each color: red, green, blue, black, white. In
a booming voice you hear one say, "Mortals, you have chosen a
very bad time to confront us. Flee for your miserable lives now
and we shall consider letting you live."
     As you consider their magnanimous offer, you hear a great
beating of wings. Several dragons quickly push you to the rear,
trying to hide you from view. The rest bow their heads in
supplication. The gigantic, queen of evil dragons lands amidst
the assembled throng. Her five heads scan the gathering. Tiamat
has arrived.

JOURNAL ENTRY 3
     "I'm afraid that I know all too well what those bonds
signify. I was bonded once as well.
     "The story began when a Master Harper wanted to make sure
that his work would be preserved in pristine form. He was
revolted at the thought of his songs and stories being corrupted
and changed over time, as all performing arts eventually are. He
attempted an experiment to create a kind of flesh golem, a
simulacrum of a human being, that would be an immortal vessel for
all of his work. In this way he hoped to cheat the effects of
time.
     "Unfortunately, the Master Bard made a mistake during the
creation of the vessel and one of his assistants was killed. When
the Conclave of Harpers found out about the experiment, and the
reasons behind it, they were appalled. The Conclave stripped the
Master Bard of his powers, his magical objects, and his name.
They wiped his songs and stories from the collective memories of
the entire Realm. It was as if he had never existed. Then, they
trapped him in a pocket dimension, and left him there. The
Conclave thought the now nameless bard was effectively banished.
     "However, a powerful group of magicians and monsters re-
created- some of the nameless bard's experiment. They tracked the
nameless one to his dimensional prison and offered to help him
build his vessel. In exchange, the group would have a hand in
defining the vessel's "instructions." The nameless Bard's
obsession with his work blinded him to the evil intent of the
group. He agreed to build another vessel.
     "I was the result of their efforts. In order to bring me to
true life, they needed to sacrifice a being of truth and
goodness. The demon Phalse kidnapped my companion, Dragonbait,
from another dimension. Dragonbait is a saurian; he is the
otherworldly equivalent of a Paladin.
     "However, with the aid of the nameless bard, Dragonbait was
able to thwart the evil ones by gifting me with a portion of his
spirit. The nameless one sacrificed himself and engineered
Dragonbait and my escape from the evil ones.
     "After our escaped I woke up in a strange place, with
manufactured memories and symbols such as yours on my arm. Don't
worry. My bonds are gone, and I am now fully my own person.
     "In order to remove my symbols, I had to overcome the
compulsion of the bonds. Each bond is like a magical geas put on
you by the person or group represented by the symbol.
     "Your only hope is to destroy the person or group that was
involved in creating your bonds. I see the "mouth in hand" symbol
of Moander on your arm. Perhaps we can cooperate.
     "I am here because of the rumors that Moander is threatening
to return again. The cultist of Moander were some of the evil
ones involved in my bonding. Since you are here and carry his
bond, I assume that he has managed to gather enough power to
attempt his return.
     "I know that the new altar of Moander is somewhere in this
ruined temple. This is his original holy place on our Plane. Let
Dragonbait and I help you. We have battled this evil before."

     "We Rakashasa are very fond of gambling. I had been having a
streak of bad luck and gone through most of my possessions.
Recently, I discovered that Birsheya had been cheating in those
games. However, the Clan Lord will not act without proof.
Birsheya guards the clan storehouse and I know that there is
evidence hidden there. If you help me break in, you may select
what ever you want from the storehouse, I just want the proof of
Birsheya's cheating."

     "It is I who work for the greater glory of Bane. The powers
granted us by Bane, combined with the power of the secular magic-
users, will bring about a Banite Hegemony in the Realms, and
these bonded tools are central to the consolidation of our power.
With them I hope to be able to control and avoid the traps set in
magical items by the lawful and the good. The bonded ones are
under my control and authority and will remain so for as long as
I live."

     "I have been laughed at and abused since I first came to
Phlan, but now my true genius shall be seen. In the caverns
beneath us are the nucleus of my fanatical army. In the river are
my dragon navy and soon the gargoyles shall arrive to control the
air. I shall let you live long enough to see my victory over the
Flamed One. Then you shall be sacrificed to my greater glory." He

     "Your arrival is well timed. We expect the king to fall into
our backup trap. It is unfortunate that you attacked the wrong
target. But let me introduce the man you tried to kill." He
gestures over to two prisoners, tied up against the wall. One is
a thin bearded man and the other is a young woman, with a
tattered purple sash.
     "The man you tried to kill is Giogi Wyvernspur, an excellent
mimic." Turning to Giogi, "Perhaps you could give us another
rendition of the king's voice.' Giogi looks at you and blanches.
     "Also, let me introduce the woman who made the king's
arrival possible, Princess Nacacia."
     At this point, the princess slips her bonds, sweeps up a
handy club and brains the leader. "Quick," she yells, "Dispose of
his guards before the leader can evoke your bonds!"

JOURNAL ENTRY 12
     Dimswart says, "My name is Dimswart the Sage. I am happy to
meet you, though I wish it were under better circumstances.
     "I knew some other people who had bonds similar to yours and
have spent some time studying them. I see that some of the
symbols are missing, however, I would suppose that originally
there were five. Essentially, the symbols are power signs of five
powerful factions that have banded together.
     "Needless to say, they are all extremely evil. Their common
purpose is to enhance their collective power. However, if this
bonding follows the previous pattern, and with Moander and the
Fire knives involved I have little doubt that it will, each of
the evil powers has it's own use for you, to the detriment of the
others. That is your greatest advantage.
     "I have personal knowledge of one of your bonds. The hand
with a mouth is the symbol of Moander. His aspect was destroyed
the last time he tried to enter this plane. It's probable that
Mogion, his surviving High Priestess, has placed the symbol on
you as part of her attempt to bring him back.
     "I know little more than the identity and some rumors about
the other symbols. The Z encased in a circle on a triangular
field is the symbol of the Zhentrim, our hosts I'm afraid. It is
said that they have a great hoard of lawful good weapons and
magical items hidden somewhere. I was attempting to find out
where it is when I was captured. I have determined that the hoard
is not at Zhentil Keep. It is rumored that Fzoul Chembryl, the
leader of the Zhentrim, is attempting to bring persons of good
alignment under his power so that he can use these devices.
     "The half moon with three bars is the sign of Dracandros. He
is a mighty Red Wizard of Thay, but he has been banished for
having an overweening ambition untempered with any sense of tact
or timing. It is said he has an obsession with dragons, hence his
name. His symbol also resembles that of Elminster of Shadowdale.
Dracandros obviously hopes that he can be as powerful as
Elminster someday.
     "Finally, the claws of flame are the symbol of Tyranthraxus,
the flamed one. I thought that it would take him much longer
after the recent events in Phlan. His is the greatest threat, as
his ambition is the domination of the entire Prime Material
Plane, and he controls the Pool of Radiance, which most still
exist if he is back.
     "To finish off Tyranthraxus you will need three magical
artifacts. I know that they have been distributed amongst three
of the powers that have bonded you. One of the artifacts, the
Amulet of Lothander, is somewhere here in Zhentil Keep.
Dracandros has the Helm of Dragons near Haptooth and Mogion
controls the Gauntlet of Moander at Yulash. Neno of these items
are of any use except when they are in the vicinity of the Pool
of Radiance. Unfortunately, I don't know how their magic works.
     "I'm afraid I won't be of much use to you in terms of
fighting power. However, I have been adventuring before and know
how to stay out of the way."

JOURNAL ENTRY 13
     "It has been deemed necessary to call upon the Mulmaster
Beholder Corps to counter the dragons now infesting the RIver
Tesh. Because of the corps destructive impulses, all Zhentrim
operative between Teshwave and Dagger Falls are ordered to
withdraw from the area. No benefits will be paid to the widows
and orphans of those who ignore this order."

JOURNAL ENTRY 14
     The man with no name begins to glow and change. His features
become evil and calculating. "Nameless opposed me as you do," the
man-form says. "Now his shell protects my fiery essence. THe time
has come, bow to your new master - bow down to Tyranthraxus!" As
he laughs, the bonds on your arm glow brightly. You feel your
knees bend as you bow down before him.

JOURNAL ENTRY 15
     "There, Great Ones, you can see that they are part of
Elminster's plot to destroy all dragonkind in retaliation for the
Dragonflight. You may have these assassins as a sign of my good
faith in warning you. You can see on their arms the sign of
Tyranthraxus, the enslaver of dragons. This sign marks them as
the servants of the enslaver, as well as being pawns of
Elminster!"
     One Dragon, however, says, "You have not convinced me. I see
the glowing bonds on these mortals. I have heard that similar
bonds were used to control a warrior that attacked
Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco. I think you control these mortals
with their glowing bonds. Free them and them we may judge their
actions."
     Dracandros says, "But if I free them, they will attack you!"
     The Dragon says, "The few of them... against the many of us!
We are not afraid. Or is it you who are afraid of them? You
should not be. For if you lie, you should be afraid of me!" With
that a drop of smoking acid escapes from the dragon's mouth past
his evil, toothy grin!
     Dracandros recoils from the dragon and turns to the party.
He speaks a meaningless phrase and his symbol slowly disappears.
The party is free of another bond.

JOURNAL ENTRY 16
     "The creatures of the deeper caverns have begun to awake. In
deference to me, they have made a present of a great artifact. It
is one of the three needed to slay the Flamed One permanently. He
betrayed me back in Phlan, but now I shall gain revenge. As soon
as we have disposed of the Zhentrim we can turn our attention to
Myth Drannor and my enemy."

JOURNAL ENTRY 17
( This entry is of a knife with jagged edges.  It is a knife, of
the Fire Knives, stuck into a wooden wall. )

JOURNAL ENTRY 18
     "That bond you wear - the one with the crescent moon - bears
a very close similarity to Elminster's symbol. Now Elminster is
not the type of man to take kindly to someone claiming that
they'd been bonded by him. So, if I were you, I'd slip out of
Shadowdale and sail down to Ashbenford. Then I'd work my way
south until I found a certain red wizard's tower. After that I'd
get him to remove the bond. Or you could hang around here and get
turned into a newt by Elminster."

JOURNAL ENTRY 19
     As the cleric casts the spell, the bonds begin to glow
brightly. Arcs of blue flame shoot out from them and strike about
the room. The characters begin to writhe in extreme pain. The
cleric ceases the spell, "These bonds fight my powers, removing
them is beyond me. I wish you better luck. Go with Gond."

JOURNAL ENTRY 21
     Alaterian,
     Hey, you may be my brother, but if I don't get that 300 gold
pieces you owe me I'm gonna come after you with a bastard sword.
I don't care if you are a member of the Black Network. They can't
watch you all the time. I've still get a few tricks of my own
that I can use on a slime ridden, otyugh like you.
     Otherwise, Mom and Dad are fine. Sis is getting to big for
her britches. I may head down to the village of Hap to look into
rumors of a gathering of Black Dragons.
     When're you coming back to Essembra? Your wife Lilian wants
to know.
     By the way, I'll take her instead of the money.
     Your loving brother,
     Myrixelets

JOURNAL ENTRY 22
     "I don't know why your're crazy enough to want to go down
the Pit of Moander, but I can give you free passage through the
city. I can guarantee that Red Plumes not molest you, but this is
still a city under siege and I can't be nurse-maiding you around.
It has been reported the Zhentil Keep has sent some terror teams
to annoy us. Some shambling mounds have also been spotted
somewhere to the east.
     Here's a map to the Pit and the locations of our
checkpoints. (see Journal Entry 52) You are welcome to rest in
the barracks and eat in the trooper mess. I've indicated them on
the map as well. Oh, be careful, the walls and pavement in Yulash
have endured some great strains recently, I can't vouch for their
stability in most areas of the city."

JOURNAL ENTRY 23
     "Ok, here's the scoop. Ya got yer condemmed prisoners,
them's as admitted they was guilty. They has ta fight the
monsters with out now weapons - we give ya three to one if ya
chose the prisoners, straight even if ya chose the monsters. On
the other hand, ya got yer accused criminals, them's as said they
was not guilt; they gets ta keep their weapons as they're
fightin' to see if Bane will judge them as worthy. We give ya two
to one on either side. Just set yerself and pays yer money. Only
need one Platinum piece to play."

JOURNAL ENTRY 24
     The letter reads, "Hail Harper's Friend, we must warn you
that Dracandros of Thay seeks to use you against dragonkind. To
protect yourself you should seek a deadly blade that he has
secreted in the caves below his tower. Still avoid the dragons if
possible, they are quite deadly."
The letter was unsigned.

JOURNAL ENTRY 25
     "We spirits of Myth Drannor have grown weak over the
centuries. We ask for your help. In return let me reveal to you a
secret power of the Thri-kreen. Within this building is a glowing
red web. If you speak the word "Krrkik" while standing before it,
then walk into it, you will gain great strength. I have seen many
of the Thri-kreen do this."

JOURNAL ENTRY 26
     "The men had been paralyzed by a spell cast by an invading
cleric. He was after the prisoners held in the leader's room to
the south. Luckily he had finally been overcome in this room."

JOURNAL ENTRY 27
     The wounded men moan in terror about a hammer wielding
maniac and a room suddenly filled with flashing blades. They hope
the leaders two prisoners are worth their trouble.

JOURNAL ENTRY 28
     Zhentrim troops that have tried to reach Dagger Falls via
the RIver Tesh have been consumed by a dragon lying beneath the
waves. It was awakened by someone from Phlan who was betrayed by
Zhentil Keep. He must still be somewhere near Dagger Falls, since
the attacks have been recent.

JOURNAL ENTRY 29
     The unburned part reads, "...our ally can control flame,
skip from body to body and exhibits an array of extra-dimensional
powers. It is my conclusion that the Flamed One can be none other
than Tyran..."

JOURNAL ENTRY 30
     "So, these are Fzoul's little secret. Very interesting. As
the representative of the TRUE priests of Bane, I shall deliver
you to Mulmaster and to the grand Imperceptor.
     "Once in Mulmaster, I will examine these bonds in my
laboratory, to your extreme discomfort I'm afraid. But, you may
be comforted that during the final procedure, the one that will
result in your death, the pain will not go on for more than two,
or perhaps three, weeks.
     "Once I have uncovered the secret of these bonds, the
Imperceptor will be most angry with his dear little Fzoul, and we
may finally rid ourselves of this heretic and his precious
mages."

JOURNAL ENTRY 31
     "You were brought in by a group in red robes. They said
they'd found you on the road, near death. They paid for your
rooms in advance, so you can stay as long as you'd like. You had
those tattoos when you came in, but I've never seen anything like
them. Filani the sage could help you though, you should go see
her, two blocks north."

JOURNAL ENTRY 32
     You are questioned by two of the guards and their commander.
For every yes answer you give one of the guards sneers and marks
it down. For every no answer the other guard snorts and marks it
in a different ledger. The commander writes down all of your
party's vital statistics including where you came from and your
names. Anytime you ask them about their questioning they all
turn, sneer and the commander says, "We are preparing a file on
you, this is strictly routine."

JOURNAL ENTRY 33
     "I am Caemir and my ancestors lived and died here in Myth
Drannor. I have been plagued recently by evil dreams of my
grandfather's tomb being turned into a nest for foul spider
thing. If you will help me lay his spirit to rest. I will give
you this bow which he made." He shows you an exquisitely crafted
bow that radiates powerful magic.

JOURNAL ENTRY 34
     "Yeah, well, watch yourself because there's lots of holes ya
can't see and walls that are about to come down and brain you.
The Red Plume's are crawling all over the place-and they have
orders to kill any looters they find. You want to know where the
pit is? You're crazy. Its in the north wall of the northeastern
quadrant of the city. That place is enough to make you loony
though. Some Red Plume's have jumped ship rather than go on
guarding the place. Oh, yeah. The Plumies have set up some
checkpoints all over the city. There's one just in front of The
Pit and one at the commanders HQ. Can we go now?"

JOURNAL ENTRY 35
     The letter reads, "Friend, we have come upon more news for
you. To slay the accursed Flamed One who holds the most powerful
of your bonds, you will need three items, the Helm of Dragons,
the Gauntlet of Moander and the Amulet of Lathander. Each is held
by one of those controlling your bonds. Without these he will be
able to ignore your most powerful attacks." The letter is
unsigned.

JOURNAL ENTRY 36
     "We've been here for almost a month whipping these bugbears
and wards into shape. Now you've got the easy part. We can
a lead these monsters against Dagger Falls, otherwise they would
realize that the ZHentrim were behind this. So you take the
beasties to Dagger Falls and attack the city. We'll have a
"rescue force" of Zhentil Keep troops arrive soon after and
repulse your attack. Then we'll occupy the city as heroes and
you'll be paid most handsomely. Well, we're off to Teshwave, good
luck."

JOURNAL ENTRY 37
     "This passage was used during funerals by those in the
temple. THey would transport the deceased remains from the temple
to the burial glen through the passage. The passage comes up in a
back room of the temple.
     "If you try to approach the Temple on the path to the north,
of through the ruins to the east, Tyranthraxus minions will spot
you and he will be waiting. He does not know about this tunnel."

JOURNAL ENTRY 38
     "You bear the symbol of five different organizations. Three
I recognize, one I've never seen and the last causes me some
concern. THe flame and dagger is the symbol of the Fire Knives, a
group of assassins who last operated out of Westgate. That group
had been destroyed, so they must have a new base of operation. I
fear I do not know where.
     "The mouth in the palm is the symbol of the god Moander.
This god was banished from the world, but he reappeared briefly
as a pile of filth. It laid waste to a section of the city of
Yulash before its defeat. The cult's color of choice is green.
     "The ornate Z in the triangle is the symbol of the ZHentrim,
the Black Network. These are an evil alliance of priests, mages
and thieves operating out of ZHentil Keep. Some say that they run
Zhentil Keep.
     "The flaming symbol I've never seen, so I can give you no
information. The last symbol, with the crescent moon, bears a
disturbing similarity to a powerful sage in Shadowdale. For my
own safety, I'll say no more about it.

JOURNAL ENTRY 39
( This entry is a picture of a dragon coming out from a
waterfall. RM )

JOURNAL ENTRY 40
     Because of the incursions along the River Tesh by Zhentrim
forces, all allies are ordered to gather in the caverns beneath
the falls. The dragons should be able to hold back the beholders,
but I expect Zhentrim troops to follow up the attack. As pay I
pledge the standard portion when loot Teshwave, Voonlar and
Zhentil Keep. THe plan is nearly complete, come at once.
     Signed,
     Lord Poryphrys Cadorna

JOURNAL ENTRY 41
     The paper is heavily soiled, but you can make it out,
"...Knives untrustworthy, cultists unreliable, wizard insane and
T seems very dangerous. Expect little reliability from the New
Alliance, especially over the bonded subject. Will need to set up
our own observation team. Per ..."

JOURNAL ENTRY 42
     The letter reads, "Friend of the Harpers, we are working to
provide you with allies. We have arranged for a rather unusual
harp player to meet you in Zhentil Keep. In the village of Hap,
the mage Akabar Bel Akash works to counter Dracandros. Finally,
two excellent warriors have been sent to the Pit to aid you." The
letter is unsigned.

JOURNAL ENTRY 43
     An important man from Phlan escaped proper justice. A
traitorous Council member, named Cadorna, was raised from the
dead and has flown to Dagger Falls.

JOURNAL ENTRY 44
     "I am the current leader of the Swanmays, since Kith and
Belinda disappeared on the Great Glacier. We need someone to
infiltrate the Red Wizard's Tower and we heard that Dracandros
was looking for a party bearing those symbols on your arms.
     "Dracandros has gathered all the Black Dragons in the area
to his tower. We need to get a special piece of one of them. If
you accept our mark you will be eligible for a share of our
reward. I have influence with several families that are guarding
these caves, so I can get you to the tower. Once there, you would
be most happy if you could get us a part of a dragon's heart, or
at least get them to leave the tower."

JOURNAL ENTRY 45
     The centaurs recently had a brush with spiders and Thri-
kreen. These monsters were heading north, apparently on a
treasure hunting expedition. They were probably headed for Myth
Drannor. The Thri-kreen can avoid arrows and their phase spiders
are unhittable after they strike.

JOURNAL ENTRY 46
     Most Respected Mogion of Moander,
     The Red Wizard Dracandros has provided a magical sending to
me, alerting me that you are planning to exterminate the subjects
of our little test. While I realize that you are among the
survivors of not only a banished god but an earlier alliance, I
must protest strongly your intention to eradicate our subjects
before they are fully tested.
     If you carry out this mad plot and slay our pigeons, then
Dracandros, myself, and Lord T will all be forced to hunt you
down and slay both you and anything you chose to bring onto this
plane. Do not doubt that we can do so. Remember that I represent
a more active power that is still at work in this part of the
Realms, and will take poorly to your hostile actions. Once the
subjects have been fully tested, then we may slay them.
     One more thing: I performed the requested research for you,
and you are wrong. It is only the gauntlets, not the appearance
of Moander himself, which can devour the Pool of Radiance. This
further weakens your argument to bring "old moldy' back onto this
plane.
     Yours in darkness,
     Lord Fzoul Chembryl of Bane,
     Zhentil Keep

JOURNAL ENTRY 47
     Near the city of Dagger Falls is the waterfall it was named
after. Behind it are deep caverns, abandoned until recently. New
activity suggests that a man raised from the dead has taken them
over. Dark things are beginning to awake in response.

JOURNAL ENTRY 48
     "You have done well, my pets. THe three artifacts that can
do me harm are now in my possession. More importantly, the bonds
you wear can act as the Pool of Radiance does. With them I can
transfer into any of your bodies and use if for as long as I need
to . Then, should the body be killed, I can transfer thought the
bond and back to the pool-or to another of your bodies. I must
thank you for the great freedom you have afforded me. Now come
along and we will dispose of those dangerous objects."

JOURNAL ENTRY 49
     A Dark Journey: The four dark elves take you down a long
sloping corridor. After many hours, you have descended many miles
and begin to pass massive black mushroom forests and a few
bizarrely shaped buildings.
     Finally, you reach a glowing cavern, with a large temple in
the center. The dark elves march you up into the heart of the
temple. In an onyx walled room is a perfect silvery web. In the
center of the web is a giant black spider. The spider speaks in a
raspy, hollow voice.
     "Greetings. I represent the god of the dark elves. You are
my prisoners. Your choice is simple, you may be my slaves, or be
my lunch."
     As you consider retreat, huge stone blocks seal the
entrance. A tittering laugh echoes through the room.

JOURNAL ENTRY 50
     Olive says, "Well now, aren't we a fine bunch of
adventurers. My name is Olive Ruskettle and I know a bit about
those tattoos on your arms. A pal of mine had some similar marks
a while back. I wonder where she is...
     "Listen, you've got to get hold of the AMulet of Lathander.
There is a man who could help you but he's been captured and is
being held prisoner inside the temple. His name is Dimswart the
Sage na he helped that friend of mine I told you about. I have a
secret way into the temple. What do you say?"

JOURNAL ENTRY 51
     "The human you are looking for named Dimswart. He's a very
good sage, and a music lover, which is why we get along-did you
know that I was a Bard? Yes sir, I've got my harp right here and
I could sing for you- will, maybe now is not the time. Anyway,
Fzoul Chembryl has captured DImswart in order to learn about the
other bonds.
     "I can get you to the jail cell but I need your help to get
him out. I'll wriggle out in my own way. I can't have any of the
Banite Priests catching sight of me. But only someone as slippery
as I can squeeze through the route that I know."

JOURNAL ENTRY 53
     Suddenly the roof vaporizes and King Azoun, his wizard
Vangerdahast and a troop of royal guards descent into the room.
One of the guards points at your party and says, "Those are the
ones who tried to kill you, your highness."
     The princess leaps up and stands between you and her father.
"They were under the FIre Knives' control, they couldn't help
themselves. Besides that, they saved me."
     The king looks at you and the princess, "Well, that fact
remains that you attempted to kill me. Also, it looks as though
you wear more controlling bonds. I will not slay you, but you are
banished from all Cormyr lands."
     The royal guards come up and begin escorting you out.
Suddenly the far door opens and Gharri of Gond steps unsteadily
into the room. As you leave the room, you see the princess run
over to him and they embrace. Heading out of the hideout you hear
the king saying, "Nacacia, time for you to accept the duties of a
princess." The voices fade.
     You are taken to the outskirts of town and the guards leave.
As you decide on your next move, a horse pounds out of the gate,
bearing Gharri and Nacacia. She waves as they race north.

JOURNAL ENTRY 54
     THe princess has been talking with the slightly recovered
leader. With a dagger to his throat he croaks, "All right, I'll
release them." He mouths a meaningless syllable and your bonds
fade.

JOURNAL ENTRY 55
     "Your aid of one of our fellows in Tilverton was much
appreciated. In return we must warn you that the Fire Knives are
watching the forest roads for you. Also the FLamed One, in the
ruins of Myth Drannor seems to be taking an interest in you.
FInally, something malignant seems to be watching the Standing
Stones. Beware and Good Luck."

JOURNAL ENTRY 56
     The man says, "Ask me not my name, for names are but labels
men apply to that which they do not understand. I know of your
bonds, and of your struggle to free yourself, for I helped create
the first bonds what seems now so long ago.
     "Your last bond, that of Tyranthraxus the Flamed One, is the
most dangerous. Whither you know it or not, you are closer to
eternal slavery now than ever, for Tyranthraxus need no longer
share his power over you with others, he can turn his full fury
to making sure that you do not ever escape.
     "Your only hope is to catch the flamed one by surprise and
deal with him before he can evoke the power of your bonds.

JOURNAL ENTRY 57
     "It is good to speak with those with confidence enough to
deal. My clan has taken this spot as a place to rest for a few
mortal lifetimes. But, the Flamed One, Tyranthraxus, has stolen
our followers and threatened my clan. His power is such that we
cannot attack his temple directly, though we hate him with great
passion.
     "Now to our deal. You wear the Flamed Ones mark, but I have
been told you are his enemy. When you attack his temple we will
bend our power to reclaim our followers. That may weaken him
enough for you to be victorious."

JOURNAL ENTRY 58
     The letter is written in a crabbed script, "I have deemed
the Displacer Beasts to be too weak for my needs. You are
instructed to continue their training in the mountains near
Tilverton. It would take too many of them to lay waste to the
Dalelands, but I don't want them destroyed when the dragons begin
their flight. You will be contacted periodically with new
instructions."
     The letter is signed with a symbol that matches the crescent
moon bond on your arm.
