invulnerable to the effects of the cuties.You can also pick up bottles of
ketchup that DUCKULA can squirt at the Cuties rendering them Temporarily
harmless.
DUCKULA can call on TREMENDOUS TERENCE to help him get past really awkward
obstacles,but only for a limited number of times,and when DUCKULA meets up 
with IGOR,he is refeshed with broccoli sandwiches,so allowing his search
for the lightning conductor to continue.

at the moment,that just leaves NANNY. Will she be able to help get DUCKULA
past the puppy and retrieve the lightning conductor?

the movement of the platforms,which follow a set pattern.Fire sauce at
