                          Crazy Cars

You are racing in the worlds craziest race; the American Cross Country
Prestige Cars Race. The race is in three stages throughout the United
States: Arizona, Florida and Space Shuttle.

If you are able to complete three challenges before the times run out, you
will get a faster car. You start with a Mercedes 560, then a PORSCHE 911.
Better than average drivers will receive a LAMBORGHINI Countach, and only
the world's best drivers may drive a FERRARI GTO.

(On the Amiga version there are three more stages: Mountain, Malibu and New
York).

While racing, be careful not to collide with the other cars, near you, each
collision will slow your car down and cause you to lose time. Once you have
passed a car, be careful to maintain your speed and not to allow the cars
behind you to collide with you.

CRAZY CARS was created to be as realistic as possible, therefore you must
be careful not to lose control of your car especially when you are jumping
or cornering.

If you goo off the track, your speed will decrease very quickly and your
chances of beating the clock will be greatly reduced. Hitting bumps at high
speeds will cause your car to fly through the air, but this can be used to
pass a car.

To win a stage, you have to go through the finish line before the time
reaches zero.

PREPARE TO START, READY?

                     GO!!!!
