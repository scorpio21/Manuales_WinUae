Is Out To Get Even. Ereanor Became A Hell On Earth. People Became 
Destructive Creatures, Animals Became Killer Beasts And Even Plants Turned
Evil.

The End Seemed To Be Near, Ereanor Was A Cursed Kingdom. But None Of This
Satisfied The "Mistriss Of Death", Who Was Still After Revenge. No, Sue
Was To Be Hit By The Worst Kind Of Evil.  Sue Was Not Harmed By Any Of The

Of Death Kidnapped Her Teddy-Bear... (Snif Snif. Sad Story Heh Guys?)
