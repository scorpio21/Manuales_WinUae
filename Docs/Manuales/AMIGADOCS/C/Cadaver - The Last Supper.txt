                        -- THE STORY --

HAVING SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED WITH DIANOS CONTRACT, KARADOC CAN'T RESIST
AN INVITE TO A FEAST IN CELEBRATION OF THE VILLIAN'S DEATH.
PAUSING ONLY TO STUFF A COPY OF INTO THE LAIR OF THE NECROMANCER, SIX
ASPIRIN AND A WELL THUMBED COPY OF PLAYDWARF INTO HIS RUCKSACK, HE SETS
OFF TO PARTY AT THE BLEAK HOSTEL, ZEIGENHOFF.
HE ARRIVES TO THE STRAIN OF MUSIC, THE SMELL OF ROASTING BOAR, THE PROSPECT
OF FREE BOOZE, FREE FOOD AND CLEAN SHEETS.
NOTHING BUT PLEASURE AWAITED WITHIN.
AND IF YOU BELIEVE THAT.......

                       -- PLAY THE GAME --
 
During normal play, Karadoc is moved around using the joystick, while the
gire button allows the player to jump.
While holding a weapon or spell, the firebutton fires/casts the item.
The item held is displayed in a large window on the left of the status
panel. (Note: The 'h' key toggles a held object on and off.)

                      -- ICONOCLASTIC --
 
On touching an object, the left hand status display reveals a series of
icons showing actions that can be executed upon that item.
Using the joystick, you can highlight the icons appropriate to the chosen
item. To use items in your rucksack, simply press the spacebar.
A large window on the right of the status display shows the last item from
your rucksack you used or picked up.
To cycle through the items available, move the highlighted box off to
the left or right of the icons panel.
By moving the joystick up and down, new items from the rucksack are displayed.
Moving the joystick left or right returnes the player to the icon panel.
Pressing the spacebar again returns the player to the game.
Using the return key allows you to acces an overview of the rucksack
showing up to 16 items wich can be scrolled by moving the joystick.
Pressing fire selects the item and returns you to the 'small' rucksack
display in order for you to select the appropriate icon.
Pressing return when in the large rucksack returns the player to the game.
 
                   -- THE KEY TO YOUR LIFE --
 
A bar located on the right hand status panel displays the healt of the 
character, while a book located in the first room reveals gold, experience,
healt and percentage of room visited.
All money that is collected will be deleted unless the item plays some part
in a puzzle.
Keys that are no longer needed are also deleted - this clears space in the 
rucksack. Some portions of spells will be unknown when you find them.
There are two spells which reveal unknown information.
Read Magic will allow you to use an unknown spell and tell you its true name
and function.
Learn Potion allows the player to descern the nature of a potition if its
name is unknown. Read Language translates foreign scripts. 
It is used for learning information written in runes or another tongue.
