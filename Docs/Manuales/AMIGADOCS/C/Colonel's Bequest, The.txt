HELPFULL HINTS:
--------------
1)TAKE NOTES

2)DRAW A MAP

3)LOOK in as MANY places as possible! LOOK EVERYWHERE!

4)EXPLORE EVERYWHERE... Things can happen to a screen you've already seen
  so re-visit screen often, and look for changes

5)TALK to EVERYONE you CAN... If you dont have anythign to say to them,
  then try showing them somethign that you've found...

6)LISTEN to OTHER conversation cearfully! Write down important info that
  you hear.

7)PICK UP anything that isn't nailed down!

8)USE items you have picked up to solve things in the game.

9)BE CEARFUL (that one had to be in here somewhere)

10)SAVE YOUR GANE OFTEN.... (you need a blank formatted disk for that)
