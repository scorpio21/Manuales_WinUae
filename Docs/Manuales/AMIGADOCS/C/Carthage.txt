CARTHAGE - THE GAME
-------------------

In this unique combination of arcade & strategy elements, you aim as
Diogenes, is to prevent the romans from destroying the city of Carthage.

3-D fractal generated maps display the positions of Carthagian cities, your
forces and the advancing Roman legions.

At start of play you're in the city of Carthage with your forces randomly
distributed throughout other cities in the territory.

Using your god-given sight you assess the situation, speed your chariot to
chosen cities, there to deliver money, build, mould and advise armies how
to best counter the Roman onslaught.

While in cities - other than Carthage - you may create armies from city
reserves. Once created, you decide whether to despatch them to meet 
Roman forces or leave them to guard the city.

You have a short period (five minutes real time) in which to build up
forces and distribute money before Roman armies - usually around 2,500
men in each - begin marching on Carthage.

You can have a maximum of five mobile armies under your control which
may either be used to re-enforce troops or engage Romans in
combat. Each mobile army may consist of no more then 30 battalions -
cavalry, infantry ;and archers - and each battalion of no more then 99 men.

Unlike troops, elephants and catapults can not be bought or sold although,
at start of play, some are scattered throughout the cities and should be
collected as soon as possible, before the Romans get their hands on them.

Your armies need to quickly gain strength, experience and loyalty to
improve their fighting prowess. Loyalty and strength percentages should be
kept high to get the best from your men. A fatigued army may rest in 
garrisons or in camp on roadsides.

Flags represent Carthagian cities while Roman standards depcit captured 
cities; gold helmets are Carthagian armies, silver helmets are Roman
forces.

While Carthage stands, her nimble merchant ships run Roman blockades to 
bring home gold and silver for your to distribute. Maintaining a sound
economy - i.e. having sufficient in each city for army wages with no cash
stockpiles - encourages more overseas trading with Carthage and
consequently more money for you to distribute.

Your charioteering cash deliveries are implended by determined Roman
assassins, equipped with their own spiked chariots, who try to run you off
the road.

Should you visit  garrison which is either under siege or has been overrun
by Romans, you're held captive until such time as Carthage can afford
your ransom. You cannot travel roads leading to Roman-occupied garrisons
and are captured if you try.

As soon as Romans enter Carthage the conflict is lost!



YOUR CHARIOT AWAITS
-------------------
Once you've selected a city to visit - click'n'drag Diogenes Icon - the 
screen changes to a third-person 3-D rear view of you on your chariot.
Whipping your horses up to a break-neck speed you dash along rough
roads, negotiating obstacles and dispatching Roman charioteers bent on
preventing you reaching your destination.

You must stay on the road and steer your chariot around smaller objects
such as rocks and logs. Hitting such obstacles causes little immediate
damage to your chariot but it accumulates and eventually a wheel may
drop off. Also, each bump you suffer causes money to fall from the back
of your chariot. Leaving the road brings your chariot to a stop, wasting
precious time.

When close to other chariots, the display changes to a plan view of the 
confrontation. Use your whip and wheel spikes to rid yourself of 
Roman adversaries.

Wheel damage is depicted by wobble; too much wobble and wheels 
drop off.

In plan view, game speed is halved and your horses instinctively keep the
chariot on the road.

Should your be the victor of a chariot battle, the screen reverts to rear view
and you continue to your destination.

Should you be the victim, however, you lose all your money and have to 
thumb it back to the last city you were in.

               the direction the joystick is pushed.



STRATEGY
--------

Click RMB (right mouse button) on a city to generate an information icon
displaying garrison strength: cavalry, infantry, archers, catapults, elephants
and wealth.
Click RMB on information icon to close it.
Click LMB on information icon to bring it to the force
Click on Diogenes - depicted as a large golden helmet - to display his wealth
and the wealth of the city he's in (if any) and to enable transferal of money
between him and the city plus the creation or disbanding of an army.
Click on a created army - small golden helmet - while inside a garrison to
generate a full-screen isometric view of the city's stronghold. Its four
towers represent cavalry, archers, elephants and infantry. An out-building
depicts catapult strength.
Click on each tower to create a battalion - this is only possible if there are
reserves. 
You may also disband an army from this point.
At the right hand side of the garrison are five romans numerals depicting your
five armies. Click on a number to show details of the corresponding army - this
is only possible if said army is in the particular garrison.
Tents represent battalions which, when clicked on, are used to modify armies:
Increase/decrease strength or disband battalions. Each tent represents one
battalion.
To start an army marching click LMB on its general - gold helmet - and drag it
to its destination or target army. Click on the general to halt an army.


CONFRONTATION
-------------

A zoom of greater then X8 displays armies as separate battalions, each represented
by a suitable flag.
Click LMB on a battalion flag to display its number of men and route to current
destination, if any.
To halt an army and read it for attack, click on its general. Only when an army
is stationary may you move battalions around seperately.
To move cavalry, infantry or elephants simply grab'n'drag them to their
selected destination. A line is drawn to indicate their route to the required
positon.
Grab'n'drag one battalion to antoher and it will follow (or attack) that 
battalion. 
Grab'n'drag archers to open fire enemy, they score hits only if in range.
You have limitless supply of arrows.
Catapults work in similar fashion to archers but they fire further and their hit
area is larger.
While in combat your battalions' strength, loyalty and number of men decreases
However, the more successful conflicts your men have the greater their loyalty
and battle experience becomes.
To emerge victorious from a conflict you must destroy the enemy army's general.

GENERAL NOTES
-------------

Fair distribution of money is necessary for each city to raise sufficient cash
from taxes to upkeep its protectiong army and also to maintain a balanced 
economy for Carthage

Army wages are drawn from Carthage's coffers while garrison armies are paid
by the city in which they're based.

Should diogenes be in a selected city, additional icons are available to buy
or sell archers, infantry or cavalry.

It's tougher to travel or fight uphill.

Try to gain the advantage of height when in conflict.

You may position battalions only when their general is on-screen.

To retreat from a confrontation, click on the army's general.

Armies must travel by road but, unlike Diogenes, do not need to call in on
every city enroute to their destination.

Romans siege garrisons by slower wearing them down with catapult fire, then
invading. The only way this can be stopped is to attack them ... from the
outside.

Protect your general at all costs: armies desert without a leader.

To defeat the enemy your army must destroy its general - depicted as a silver
helmet.


                              CARTHAGE HELP SHEET
                              -------------------

1.INTRODUCTION
--------------

These notes are included with the CARTHAGE package to enable you to 
use all the game facilities in the shortest possible time. The manual is a
more comprehensive guide to the CARTHAGE facilities.


2.DIOGENES
----------

Once CARTHAGE has loaded, a fractal map displays the position of the
cities you must defend. The hero (Diogenes) is in the Carthage at teh start
of play and is depicted on the map as a large golden helmet. By
clicking on this icon - using the left mouse button - and holding the 
button down, it may be dragged to other cities (depicted as flags).

When Diogenes is dragged over a city icon, the icon highlights to
confirm selection. When the mouse button is released over the city,
Diogenes sets out on his chariot to that city. Please note that 
Diogenes's current city and his destination city MUST be connected by
a single road - depicted as a yellow dotted line.


NOTE ON CHARIOT RACING
----------------------

Chariot racing enables Diogenes to take money from one city to 
another. Money is central to the game, intelligent use of it enables the
purchase of sufficient troops to defend Carthage.

Avoid running over logs on the road as this causes money to fall off
your chariot.

The longer you take to complete a chariot run, the further the Romans
will have advanced on Carthage.

Use the fully-3-D roadway to anticipate the approach of hills and 
corners.

In plan viewk, the horses keep the chariot on the road automatically.
This allows you to concentrate on despatching adversaries.

Also in plan view, your chariot moves at half speed so try to destroy
Roman assassins with your wheel spikes as quickly as possible.


3. BUILDING YOUR DEFENCES
-------------------------

See the manual (pages 11 to 15) on how to use the map.


3.1 MONEY AND TRADE
-------------------

Money is vital to purchase troops for the coming battles.

More money arrives in Carthage via the treasure ships if the wealth of
Carthage is fairly distributed around the map. Thisis because more
cities contribute to Carthage's foreign trade.

Poorer areas on the map are harder to defend as troops can not be 
bought in sufficent numbers to form an effective army.
Use your chariot to take money to areas at risk.

Cities also receive money automatically from a local income tax. The
money received is directly related to the amount of money in that city.


3.2 BUILDING UP CITIES' DEFENCES
--------------------------------

No forces may be bought or altered within the city of Carthage.

Diogenes must be in the relative city to buy troops and create armies
in that city.

Wages for troops within a city are paid directly from the city's money
reserves. Ensure that enough income tax is collected byt he city or its
resereves will slowly reduce to zero and troops will desert.


3.3 BUILDING YOUR ARMIES
------------------------

Wages for troops not in cities are drawn directly from money within
Carthage. Ensure enough money is being deposited in Carthage via
the treasure ships (related to the amount of foreign trade) to pay for
your armies. Armies out in the field are loyal enough not to desert for
not being paid.

Create armies as soon as possible as they need to gain experience to
match the Roman might. The more experience a fighting force has, 
the more effective it is - new troops added to an army dilute its total
experience.

Cavalry are a very effective fighting force, but are expensive to buy
and upkeep.

Try to collect the elephants and catalpult that are distributed around
the map as soon as possible, the are destroyed if the Romans reach
them before you.

Use the read-prepared army in Carthage to its full fighting potential; it
is quite powerfull.

You may only have a maximum of five armies at any one time.


4. FIGHTING THE ROMAN LEGIONS
-----------------------------

The objective of the game is to prevent any Roman legion from
reaching Carthage. You can only stop them by destroying the legions
completely. See the manual (Pages 11 to 15) on how to move your
armies around the map.


4.1 MOVING YOUR ARMIES
----------------------

As when moving the hero from city to city, click and drag the army
icon (depicted as a small golden helmet) to its destination to start it
marching to a city. Unlike when moving the hero from city to city
however, the destination can be any city on the map, and the 
computer calculates the shortest route via one or more roads.

Armies always travel by road.

You may also dag the army icon to a Roman army and it will 
calculate the shortest route to intercept it. It is important however to
keep an eye on your army's route as the Romans will try to evade your
approach.


4.2 MOVING YOUR BATTALIONS INDIVIDUALLY
---------------------------------------

On x 16 and x 32 magnifications of the map, you will see the individual
battalions in an army, if that army has left a city.

Bring a marching army to a halt by clicking on its general. Only when
the army has stopped may your controll battalions individually.

Individual battalions can move anywhere on the on-screen map.

Move battalions by clicking and dragging them to the required 
destination or target battalion.

Dragging a battalion to another of your battalions results in the second
battalion following the first. This is a very effective way of controlling
battalions as groups. If any enemy battalion is the target, battalions will
follow, then attack.

You halt battalions by dragging them off the on-screen map.


4.3 WINNING BATTLES
-------------------

The objective when fighting a Roman army is to kill their general. Once
killed, the army will flee in panic.

Try to organise your defence and attack well before the Romans spy
your army and begin their assault.

Troops become exhausted if they are made to fight for too long.
Stop them to allow them to recover.

Ensure there are no gaps in your defence to allow the Romans an easy
passage to your general.

Cavalry are best suited to attacking the Roman general, while infantry
are effective in defence - but are also useful to attack.

Use your archers to cut down approaching Roman cavalry.

Elephants are a very efffective defence force but are slow moving for 
attack.
