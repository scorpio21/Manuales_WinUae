CYTRON THE GAME.
----------------
YOU MUST GUIDE A CYTRON ROBOT THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE UNDER-GROUND RESEARCH
BUNKER IN WHICH THE RESIDENT ROBOTS HAVE RUN AMOK.
THEY HAVE RELEASED MANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS AND ARE ATTACKING THE
SCIENTISTS. CYTRON MUST RESCUE AS MANY HUMANS AS POSSIBLE FROM EACH LEVEL.
PROGRESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED IF SUFFICIENT SCIENTISTS
HAVE BEEN RESCUED.

CYTRON THE ROBOT
----------------
CYTRON IS COMPRISED OF 2 ROBOTS COMBINED (CYT AND RON) WHICH MAY BE
CONTROLLED EITHER IN THE STATE OF A SINGLE LARGE ROBOT OR AS 2 INDEPENDANT
SMALLER BOTS. SOME WEAPONS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE TO A SPECIFIC ROBOT OR
COMBINATION OF ROBOTS. ONLY SMALLER ROBOTS (CYT AND RON) MAY ACCESS NARROW
CORRIDORS.

WHEN CONTROLLING ONE OF THE SMALLER ROBOTS THE OTHER ROBOT WILL COCOON
ITSELF. WHILE IN THIS STATE MOST ALIENS WILL BOUNCE OFF IT AND IT WILL ONLY 
TAKE A SMALL AMOUNT OF DAMAGE. OTHER ALIENS ARE MORE PERSISTENT AND WILL
EVENTUALLY DESTROY IT. THEREFORE THE COCOONED ROBOT SHOULD BE POSITIONED IN
A RELATIVELY SAFE PLACE AND YOU SHOULD KEEP AN EYE ON ITS ENERGY LEVEL.

EACH ROBOT HAS A 100 UNITS OF ENERGY WHICH IS DRAINED ON CONTACT WITH ENEMY
ROBOTS.FORCE FEILDS ECT..WHEN COMBINED, BOTH ROBOTS TAKE EQUAL DAMAGE. BOTH
FEATURE A RESERVE ENERGY PACK WHICH HOLDS SURPLUS ENERGY. IN THE EVENT THAT
BOTH ROBOTS ARE DESTROYED THEY WILL BE RE-GENERATED USING ENERGY FROM THE
PACK.

THE ROBOTS INTERACT WITH THE CURRENT LEVEL VIA SWITCHES AND PRESSURE PADS
WHICH MUST BE SHOT AT OR DRIVEN OVER TO BE ACTIVATED. TERMINALS ARE ALSO
AVAILABLE WHICH ALLOW YOU TO RE-CONFIGURE CYTRONS WEAPONS AND RE-DISTRIBUTE
ENERGY, EXAMINE MINIATURE MAPS AND ACCESS VARIOUS SECURITY FEATURES.
SCATTERED AROUND EACH LEVEL ARE VARIOUS USEFUL TOKENS WHICH, WHEN COLLECTED
MAY HELP CYTRON COMPLETE ITS MISSION.

AS SOON AS ONE OF THE INTELLIGENT ENEMIES SPOT CYTRON THEY INITIATE A
DETONATION SEQUENCE FOR THE CURRENT LEVEL. FROM THIS MOMENT ON CYTRON HAS A
LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO RESCUE THE SCIENTISTS AND ESCAPE TO THE NEXT
LEVEL.

NOTE: THE DETONATION TIMER WILL BE FROZEN WHILE CYTRON IS LOGGED ON TO A
TERMINAL. ALSO, FROM A SUFFICENTLY HIGH STATUS TERMINAL. THE DETONATION
SEQUENCE MAY BE RE-SET.

ENEMIES
-------
CYTRON HAS THE FOLLOWING HOSTILE ROBOTS AND CREATURES.

STORMERS.....STANDARD PATROL ROBOTS WHICH REMAIN STATIONARY UNTIL THEY
DETECT CYTRON. AT WHICH POINT THEY MAY ATTACK.

BOUNCER......A NON-INTELLIGENT ALIEN WHICH BOUNCES AROUND THE LEVEL

ASSASSIN.....FOUND GUARDING SCIENTISTS. WHEN THEY DETECT CYTRON THEY HEAD
STRAIGHT TOWARDS THEIR HOSTAGE AND ATTEMPT TO KILL HIM. CYTRON MUST EITHER
GET TO THE SCIENTIST FIRST OR KILL THE ASSASSIN. IF THE HOSTAGE IS KILLED
OR RESCUED THE ASSASSIN TURNS HIS ATTENTION ON CYTRON.

EXOSKELETON..MINDLESS ROBOTS THAT WANDER AROUND AT RANDOM. WHEN THEIR
SENSORS DETECT THE BODY HEAT OF A NEARBY SCIENTIST THEY HEAD STRAIGHT
TOWARDS HIM. IF THEY MANAGE TO CAPTURE A SCIENTIST THEY COMFORM WITH HIM TO
BECOME A CYBORG.

CYBORG.......THESE ARE INDESTRUCTIBLE CREATURES MADE WHEN AN EXOSKELETON
CAPTURES A SCIENTIST. THEY HEAD STRAIGHT TOWARDS CYTRON AND ATTACK.

ALIEN GENERATOR.STATIONERY MANUFACTURING MACHINES. WHEN THEY DETECT CYTRON
THEY BEGIN BUILDING EXTRA ROBOTS (EITHER STORMERS OR BOUNCERS) WHEN DAMAGED
THEY DECREASE THE RATE AT WHICH THEY GENERATE NEW ROBOTS. IT IS POSSIBLE TO
TURN SOME OF THEM OFF USING SPECIAL SWITCHES.

TANKS........TOUGH ROBOTS THAT FIRE A CONSTANT STREAM OF DEADLY MISSILES AT
CYTRON.

WALLWALKER...DUMB MAINTENANCE ROBOTS THAT PATROL THE WALLS OF THE COMPLEX.

BLOBS........REGENERATE THEMSELVES TO EVENTUALLY FILL THE ENTIRE LEVEL. IF
CYTRON DRIVES OVER THEM THEIR SLIME SLOWS THE ROBOT DOWN.

PLUTOMIUM POD.ONLY PRESENT ON REACTOR LEVELS. THEY DONT MOVE BUT IF CYTRON
GETS TO CLOSE IT OVERHEATS AND DAMAGES ITSELF. WHEN SHOT AT THEY ARE MERELY
PUSHED AWAY. IF 2 OR MORE PODS ARE PUSHED CLOSE TOGETHER THEY BOTH EXPLODE
TAKING OUT EVERYTHING WITHIN A CERTAIN RANGE(INCLUDING SCIENTISTS AND OTHER
ROBOTS) IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER PODS IN BLAST RANGE THEN THEY WILL ALSO
EXPLODE.POSSIBLY SETTING OFF A CHAIN REACTION. CARE MUST ALSO BE TAKEN NOT
TO PUSH TEHM TOO CLOSE TO SCIENTISTS. OR THEY WILL BE KILLED.

HOLOGRAMS....WHILE ONLY PRESENT ON HOLODECK LEVELS, THEY ARE NOT RESTRICTED
BY WALLS. FORCE FIELDS ECT...AND CYTRONS WEAPONS GO STRAIGHT THROUGH
THEM,HOWEVER, THEY CAN DAMAGE CYTRON. THE ONLY WAY TO DESTROY THEM IS TO
DESTROY THE PROJECTOR THATS GENERATING THEM.

TOKENS
------
WEAPON TOKENS - OCTABGAL TOKENS THAT ADD HALF THE MAXIMUM AMMO FOR A
PARTICULAR WEAPON TO CYTRONS ARSENAL. THE WEAPON WILL NOT BECOME ACTIVE
IMMEDIATELY. CYTRON MUST LOG ONTO A TERMINAL AND SELECT THE APPROPRIATE
WEAPON. SEE TERMINALS SECTION.

SECURITY PASS TOKEN - SQAURE TOKENS MARKED WITH EITHER A +1 +2 OR +3. WHEN
COLLECTED THEY BOOST THE SECURITY CLEARENCE OF CYTRON FOR WHEN IT LOGS ONTO
A TERMINAL AND ALLOW IT ACCESS SECURITY FUNCTIONS THAT WERE NOT AVAILABLE
PREVIOUSLY. THE TOKEN REMAINS ACTIVE UNTIL THE END OF THE LEVEL OR UNTIL
CYTRON MALFUNCTIONS. IF CYTRON COLLECTS A SECOND SECURITY THE TOKEN WITH 
THE HIGHEST VALUE TAKES EFFECT. IE THE BONUSES ARE NOT ADDED TOGETHER.

ALL OTHER TOEKNS ARE CIRCULAR.

ENERGY TOKENS - ADD 50 UNITS OF ENERGY TO THE ROBOT THAT COLLECTS THEM (CYT
OR RON) IF CYTRON PICKS UP A TOKEN. THE 50 UNITS OF ENERGY ARE ADDED TO
BOTH CYT AND RONS ENERGY LEVEL. ANY SURPLUS ENERGY IS TRANSFERRED TO THE
RESERVE BATTERY.

INVISIBILITY TOKENS - CLOAKS THE ROBOT THAT COLLECTS IT. MAKING IT
DIFFICULT FOR ENEMIES TO DETECT. HOWEVER IT DOES NOT GRANT INVULNERABILITY
AND CYTRON STILL TAKES DAMAGE IF HIT.

FREEZE TOKEN - TEMPORARILY FREEZES ALL ENEMIES AND SCIENTISTS IN THE
CURRENT ZONE. NOTE:CYTRON STILL TAKES DAMAGE IF HE COLLIDES WITH A FROZEN
ENEMY.

CONFUSION TOKEN - TEMPORARILY CAUSES ALL ENEMIES TO MOVE IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION TO NORMAL.

BEACON TOKEN - ACTIVATES SUBSONIC BEACON WHICH CAUSES ALL SCIENTISTS
(CONSCIOUS OR UNCONSCIOUS) TO MOVE TOWARDS CYTRON. IF THERE IS ANYTHING
DANGEROUS IN THEIR PATH (SUCH AS A FORCE FIELD OR ENEMY) THEY MAY BE
KILLED. IT REMAINS ACTIVE UNTIL THE END OF THE LEVEL OR UNTIL CYTRON
MALFUNCTIONS.

UV TOKEN - MAKES HIDDEN WRITING ON THE WALL VISIBLE. THIS MAY PROVIDE CLUES
TO THE FUNCTION OF THE SWITCHES OR PRESSURE PADS. THE TOKEN REMAINS ACTIVE
UNTIL CYTRON MALFUNCTIONS.

NOTE: IF A TOKEN IS COLLECTED BY CYTRON THEN BOTH CYT AND RON WILL BE
AFFECTED BY THE TOKEN WHEN THEY SPLIT UP. IF A TOKEN IS COLLECTED BY CYT OR
RON THEN THE OTHER ROBOT WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE TOKEN.HOWEVER, IF THEY
JOIN TOGETHER AGAIN THEN CYTRON WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE TOKEN.

AT ANY TIME YOU CAN FIND OUT WHICH TOKENS ARE ACTIVE BY LOGGING ONTO A
TERMINAL AND SELECTING THE `PLAYER` OPTION FROM THE `STATUS MENU`

TERMINALS
---------
SITUATED IN EVERY LEVEL ARE VARIOUS COMPUTER TERMINALS. YOU LOG ONTO THEM
BY PARKING CYTRON OVER THEM AND PRESSING THE `SOACE BAR`.
EACH TERMINAL HAS A FIXED SECURITY LEVEL THAT DETERMINES WHICH OPTIONS ARE
AVAILABLE FROM THE `SECURITY` MENU. IF YOU HAVE COLLECTED A SECURITY PASS
THEN THIS IS ADDED TO THE SECURITY LEVEL OF THE TERMINAL AND WILL BE USED
TO DETERMINE WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO CYTRON.

YOU MAY MANOEUVRE AROUND SCREEN TERMINALS BY EITHER CLICKING ON ONE OF THE
BORDER SCREENS. WHICH SELECTS THAT OPTION, OR BY CLICKING ON THE CENTRAL
SCREEN WHICH TAKES YOU TO THE NEXT HIGHER SCREEN OR LOGS YOU TO THE INITIAL
LEVEL.

IF THE SPACE BAR IS PRESSED WHILE YOU ARE LOGGED ON, AS EITHER CYT OR RON
THEN CONTROL WILL SWAP TO THE OTHER ROBOT, THE CURRENT ROBOT REMAINS LOGGED
ONTO THE TERMINAL. THIS ALLOWS BOTH ROBOTS TO LOG ONTO DIFFERENT TERMINALS.
IF BOTH ROBOTS ARE LOGGED ON THEN IT IS POSSIBLE TO TRANSFER ENERGY BETWEEN
CYT AND RON.

YOU MAY LOG ONTO EACH TERMINAL FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME ONLY.INDICATED
BY A VERTICAL BAR TO THE RIGHT OF THE CENTRAL SCREEN. IF TIME RUNS OUT YOU
ARE LOGGED OFF AND HAVE TO FIND A DIFFERENT TERMINAL THROUGH WHICH TO
PERFORM FURTHER FUNCTIONS.

OPTIONS AVAILABLE FROM TERMINALS
--------------------------------
WEAPON MENU - USED TO SELECT WITH WITH WEAPON TO ARM CYT.RON OR CYTRON. SEE
WEAPONS FOR MORE DETAILS.

STATUS MENU - FEATURES THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS

DISPLAYS YOUR STATS,GIVING DETAILS OF WHICH TOKENS ARE ACTIVE.

CALLS UP A LEVEL INFO SCREEN

DISPLAYS WHICH ZONE OF THE LEVEL YOU ARE ON

DISPLAYS YOUR CURRENT SCORE

DISPLAYS THE ENERGY LEVELS OF BOTH THE ROBOTS AND THE RESEVE BATTERY
DISPLAYS THE CURRENT CYT WEAPON. THE CURRENT RON WEAPON AND THE CURRENT
CYTRON WEAPON.

ENERGY MENU - ENEABLES YOU TO CHECK AND RE-DISTRIBUTE THE ENERGY LEVELS OF
CYT AND RON. TO TRANSFER ENERGY BETWEEN CYT AND RON YOU MUST EITHER BE
LOGGED ON AS CYTRON OR BOTH CYT AND RON (ON DIFFERENT TERMINALS).

SECURITY MENU - OPTIONS ARE AVAIALABLE FROM THIS MENU DEPEND ON THE
SECURITY LEVEL OF THE TERMINAL AND THE SECURITY PASSES HELD BY THE USER.
THE OPTIONS ARE...

VIEW CURRENT ZONE - DISPLAYS A FLOOR PLAN OF THE CURRENT ZONE. ANY
SCIENTISTS ON THE LEVEL ARE SHOWN AS FLASHING RED SQUARES.

VIEW ALL ZONES - DISPLAYS A FLOOR PLAN OF ANY OF THE ZONES ON THE LEVEL AND
THE POSITION OF THE SCIENTISTS.

VIEW LEVEL FEATURE - DISPLAYS A FLOOR PLAN OF ANY OF THE LEVEL ZONES
TOGETHER WITH THE POSITION OF EITHER ENEMEY ROBOTS,CONVEYOR BELTS,FORCE
FIELDS, TERMINALS, SWITCHES, PRESSURE PADS, BLAST DOORS OR TELEPORTS.

RESTART LEVEL - CAUSE THE LEVEL TO BE RE-STARTED WHEN YOU EXIT THE TERMINAL
(SEE RE-START SECTION FOR MORE DETAILS)

TURN LEVEL LIGHTS ON/OFF - WHEN THE LEVEL LIGHTS ARE OFF THE ENEMY
DETECTION SYSTEMS ARE HINDERED. MAKING IT SLIGHTLY EASIER TO SNEAK PAST
THEM.

PROCESS SWITCH - ENEABLE YOU TO CHANGE THE STATE OF ANY SWITCH FROM WITHIN
A TERMINAL. 2 ICONS CYCLE THROUGH THE AVAILABLE SWITCHES WHILE A THIRD ICON
ALLOWS YOU TO VIEW THE POSITION ON THE LEVEL. A FOURTH ICON ENABLE YOU TO
FLIP THE SWITCH. THE SWITCH DOES NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL YOU EXIT THE
TERMINAL.

RESET DETONATION TIMER - TURNS OFF THE DETONATION TIMER. GIVING YOU TIME TO
COMPLETE THE LEVEL. AS SOON AS AN INTELLIGENT ENEMY DETECTS CYTRON THE
TIMER IS RE-ENGAGED - FROM ITS INITAL VALUE.

SOME TERMINALS ALLOW CODES TO BE ENTERED WHICH WILL REPROGAM THE LEVEL EXIT
TELEPORT TO ALTERNATIVE DESTINATION.

WEAPONS
-------
AT THE START OF THE GAME THE ONLY WEAPONS AVAILBLE ARE A STANDARD LASER AND
A GRENADE LAUNCHER. THESE WEAPONS HAVE UNLIMITED AMMO AND WILL ALWAYS BE
AVAILABLE TO YOU.

TOKENS TO COLLECT OTHER WEAPONS CAN BE FOUND SCATTERED AROUND THE LEVELS.
WHEN COLLECTED THEY WILL GIVE CYTRON UP TO HALF THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF AMMO
FOR THAT WEAPON. THE WEAPON WILL NOT BECOME IMMEDIATELY ACTIVE, INSTEAD
CYTRON MUST LOG ONTO A TERMINAL TO SELECT THAT WEAPON.

WEAPONS ARE DIVIDED INTO 3 CATERGORIES:HIGH POWER WEAPONS THAT MAY ONLY BE
USED BY CYTRON. GRENADE WEAPONS THAT MAY ONLY BE USED BY RON, AND LASER
WEAPONS THAT MAY ONLY BE USED BY CYT.ALTHOUGH CYTRON HAS A CLASS OF WEAPONS
ALL TO ITS SELF IT CAN ALSO USE ANY OF CYT OR RONS WEAPONS.

IF CYTRON RUNS OUT OF AMMO FOR THE CURRENT WEAPON THEN THE DEFAULT WEAPON
IS AUTOMATICALLY SELECTED. THE WEAPONS AVAILABLE ARE...

STANDARD LASER - CYT AND CYTRONS DEFAULT WEAPON. UNLIMITED AMMO. LOW DAMAGE
BUT LONG RANGE, WILL BOUNCE OFF MIRRORS AND GO THROUGH GLASS.

HEAVY LASER - A CYT WEAPON. MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A STANDARD LASER BUT WITH
SHORTER RANGE. WILL BOUNCE OFF MIRRORS AND GO THROUGH GLASS.

INDUSTRIAL LASER - A CYT WEAPON. SIMILAR TO HEAVY LASER BUT EVEN MORE
POWERFUL AND WITH A SHORTER RANGE.

SONIC LASER - A CYT WEAPON. ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE LEAST POWERFUL OF THE
LASERS IT HAS THE ABILITY TO SHATTER SOME MIRRORS AND GLASS ALLOWING YOU TO
GAIN ACCESS TO OTHER AREAS OF THE COMPLEX.

STANDARD GEENADE - RONS DEFUALT WEAPON. THESE EXPLODE AFTER TRAVELLING A
SHORT DISTANCE OR WHEN THEY HIT AN OBSTACLE OR ENEMY. THEY DAMAGE
EVERYTHING WITHIN A SMALL RADIUS. UNLIMITED AMMO.

HEAVY GREANADE - A RON WEAPON. SIMILAR TO STANDARD GRENADE EXCEPT THEY DO
MORE DAMAGE AND HAVE A LARGER EXPLOSION RADIUS.

STUN GREANDE - A RON WEAPON. WHEN THESE EXPLODE THEY RELEASE A CLOUD OF GAS
THAT TEMPORARILY FREEZES ALL ROBOTS OR SCIENTISTS IN THE VICINITY.

MINE GRENADE - A RON WEAPON. WHEN FIRED THESE REMAIN ON THE FLOOR UNTIL
EITHER ENEMY OR SCIENTISTS TRAVEL OVER THEM. OR UNTIL THE TIMER RUNS OUT.
THEY EXPLODE TO DAMAGE EVERYTHING WITHIN A LARGE RADIUS.

TRIPLE LASER - QA CYTRON WEAPON.THIS FIRES 3 LASERS AT ONCE. EACH LASER IS
EQIVALENT TO A HEAVY LASER BOLT.

CLUSTER BOMB - A CYTRON WEAPON. THIS FIRES A GREANDE WHICH, WHEN EXPLODES,
SPLITS INTO 8. EACH PIECE OF SHRAPNEL WILL THEN TRAVEL A SHORT DISTANCE
BEFORE EXPLODING. VERY POWERFUL BUT TAKES A LONG TIME TO RE-LOAD.

HEAT SEEKING MISSILE - A CYTRON WEAPON. THIS FIRES A MISSILE WHICH TRIES TO
HOME IN ON HOSTILE ROBOTS. IT CAN TAKE A FEW SECONDS TO LOCK ONTO A
SUITABLE TARGET SO ITS BEST USED IN WIDE OPEN SPACES.

VORTEX LASER -  A CYTRON WEAPON. THIS RELEASE A SLOW EXPANDING CIRCLE OF
LASER BOLTS THAT WILL DESTROY VIRTUALLY ANYTHING. VERY EFFECTIVE IF
RELEASED NEXT TO AN ASSEMBLER.

BONUSES. COMPLETION OF A LEVEL:

1 .....POINT FOR EACH BONUS SUARE

1 .....POINT FOR THE FIRST BONUS SQUARE PICKED UP.(FLASHES BLUE WHEN DRIVEN
       OVER)ON COLLECTING CONSECTUTIVE BONUS SQUARES THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED 
       UNTIL A LIFE IS LOST.

20.....POINTS FOR EACH UNIT OF ENERGY REMAINING (NOT INCLUDING RESERVE)

25.....POINTS FOR EACH SECOND REMAINING

500....POINTS FOR EACH SCIENTIST RESCUED UPTO TO TARGET FIGURE THEM:

1000...POINTS FOR FIRST EXTRA SCIENTIST

2000...POINTS FOR SECOND EXTRA SCIENTIST RESCUED

4000...POINTS FOR THIRD SCIENTIST ETC(POINTS ARE DOUBLED FOR EACH EXTRA
       SCIENTIST OVER REQUIRED AMOUNT)

ADDITIONAL BONUS:

320000.POINTS FROM ACCUMULATIVE BONUS SQUARES AND YOU ARE REWARDED WITH 200
ENERGY POINTS.

CONTROLS
--------
THE FOLLOWING CONTROL OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. THEY MAY BE SELECTED USING THE
F KEYS F1-F5 FROM THE TITLE SCREEN OR AT ANY TIME DURING THE GAME.

YOU MAY FIND THAT THE DIFFERENT CONTROL METHODS ARE INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT
TO MASTER BUT EACH ONE WILL GIVE YOU INCREASED CONTROL OVER CYTRON MAKING
THE GAME EASIER IN THE LONG TERM. IN PARTICULAR THE REACTOR LEVELS WILL BE
MUCH EASIER WITH THE MOUSE CONTROL MODES BECAUSE THEY ALLOW PLUTONIUM PODS
TO BE PUSHED AT OBSCURE ANGLES.

F1 - SINGLE JOYSTICK MODE.
--------------------------
THIS IS THE DEFAULT MODE AND BEHAVES AS YOU WOULD EXPECT. PUSHING THE
JOYSTICK MOVES CYTRON IN THAT DIRECTION AND PRESSING FIRE, FIRES THE
CURRENT WEAPON.

F2 - SINGLE JOYSTICK MODE LOCKING.
----------------------------------
IF THE IRE BUTTON IS NOT PRESSED THEN YOU MOVE AND FIRE IN THE DIRECTION OF
THE JOYSTICK. IF THE BUTTON IS HELD DOWN WHILE THE JOYSTICK IS PUSHED IN A
PARTICULAR DIRECTION YOU CONTINUE TO FIRE IN THAT DIRECTION FOR AS LONG AS
THE BUTTON IS HELD DOWN, THIS ENABLE YOU TO MOVE AND FIRE IN DIFFERENT
DIRECTIONS. USEFUL FOR RUNNING AWAY FROM AN ENEMY ROBOT WHILE CONTINUING TO
FIRE AT IT. IF THE BUTTON IS HELD DOWN WHILE THE JOYSTICK IS CENTRED THEN
YOU WONT FIRE UNTIL THE BUTTON IS RELEASED.

F3 - DOUBLE JOYSTICK MODE.
--------------------------
THE FIRST JOYSTICK CONTROLS CYTRONS MOVEMENTS WHILE THE SECOND
AUTOMATICALLY CONTROLS THE FIRING DIRECTION. NEITHER JOYSTICK BUTTON NEEDS
MTO BE PRESSED TO MOVE OR FIRE.

F4 - SINGLE MOUSE MODE.
-----------------------
THE MOUSE MOVES A POINTER AROUND THE SCREEN WITHIN A SMALL RADIUS OF
CYTRON. IF THE LEFT BUTTON IS PRESSED THE ROBOT MOVES TOWARDS THE POINTER.
IF THE RIGHT BUTTON ID PRESSED THE ROBOT FIRES TOWARD THE POINTER. HOLDING
DOWN THE RIGHT `AMIGA` KEY WILL LOCK THE MOVEMENT DIRECTION. AND WHILE
PRESSED, THE ROBOT MAINTAINS MOVEMENT IN THE LOCKED DIRECTION WHENEVER THE
LEFT MOUSE BUTTON IS PRESSED. HOLDING DOWN THE RIGHT `ALT` KEY LOCKS THE
FIRING DIRECTION. WHILE THIS IS PRESSED THE ROBOT MAINTAINS FIRING IN THE
LOCED DIRECTION WHENEVER THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON IS PRESSED.

F5 - DOUBLE MOUSE MODE.
-----------------------
THE FIRST MOUSE MOVES AN X CURSOR AROUND CYTRON, WHEN THE LEFT BUTTON IS
PRESSED THE ROBOT MOVES TOWARDS THE X.
THE SECOND MOUSE MOVES A+ CURSOR AROUND CYTRON. WHEN THE LEFT BUTTON IS
PRESSED THE ROBOT FIRES TOWARDS THE +

RESTART
-------
LEVEL RESTART CAN OCCUR WHEN ANY OF 3 THINGS HAPPEN - YOU SELECT RESTART
FROM A TERMINAL, THE LEVEL EXPLODES AND CYTRON HAS SOME ENERGY REMAINING IN
THE RESERVE BATTERY OR CYTRON MALFUNCTIONS AND THE SPACE BAR IS PRESSED TO
SELECT RESTART.

IN EITHER CASE THE LEVEL IS RELOADED AND ALL PLAYER INFO (INCLUDING
SCORE,WEAPON AMMO,TOKENS ACTIVE AND SO ON) WILL BE RESET TO THE VALUES WHEN
YOU FIRST ENETERED THE LEVEL. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE RESERVE BATTERY
WHICH WILL BE ONE LIFE (200 POINTS) LOWER.

YOU SHOULD ONLY USE RESTART IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETE THE LEVEL. IF CYTRON MALFUNCTIONS AND YOU DONT PRESS
THE `SPACE` TO RESTART THEN ENERGY FROM THE RESERVE BATTERY WILL BE USED TO
GENERATE A NEW ROBOT AND YOU MAY CONTINUE PLAYING THE LEVEL.

END.......
