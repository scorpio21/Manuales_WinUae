DESCRIPTION. THE IMAGE AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT OF THE SCREEN IS A FULL FIGURE
PICTURE OF THE AGENT..TO ALLOW YOU TO COMPARE RELATIVE HEIGHTS AND WEIGHTS BY
SIGHT AS WELL AS BY THE SPECIFIED NUMBERS.

ABILITIES;

STRENGTH;--THIS MEASURES THE INDIVIDUALS PHYSICAL STRENGHT. IT IS USED TO
DETERMINE HOW MUCH EQUIP THE AGENT CAN CARRY BEFORE BECOMING ENCUMBERED.

DEXTERITY

THIS DESCRIBES THE INMDIVIDUALS HAND-EYE CO-ORDINATION. IN THE GAME IT AFFECTS
THE DAMAGE DONE TO AN ENEMY IN MISSILE COMBAT, AND IT AFFECTS THE CHANCE OF
EFFECTING A SUCCESFUL REPAIR ON DAMAGED EQUIP.

ENDURANE

ENDURANCE IS USED WITH STRENGTH TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH EQUIP THE AGENT CAN
CARRY..BEFORE BEING ENCUMBERED.

INTELLIGENCE

THE INTELLIGENCE RATING IS USED AS A GUIDE TO THE PLAYER AS TO HOW THE ROLE
SHOULD BE PLAYED. IT IS ONLY USED TO DETERMINE HOW SUCCESFUL THE CHARACTER HAS
BEEN IN PRE-MISSION TRAINING TO IMPROVE A SELECTED SKILL.

MOVEMENT

EACH AGENT MOVES AT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT RATE. THIS VALUE DOES NOT RELATE TO
ANY DISTANCE OR TIME. THE GREATER THE NUMBER, THE GREATER THE RUNNING SPEED. IF
ANY AGENT BECOMES ENCUMBERED THROUGH CARRYING TO MUCH EQUIPMENT, THIS VALUE IS
TEMPORYARILY REDUCED.

SKILLS

COMBAT;--THE COMBAT ABILITY IS USED IN BOTH HAND-TO-HAND AND MISSILE COMBAT TO
DETERMINE HOW HARD A SUCCESSFUL HIT WAS.

WEAPONS

THIS SKILL RELATES TO MISSILE COMBAT AND THE AGENTS ABILITY TO REPAIR A GUN

COMPUTERS;

REPAIRING THE BACKPACK COMPUTER REQUIRES THIS SKILL, IT ALSO DETERMINES HOW
SUCCESFUL THE ANDROID AGENTS ARE WHEN ATTEPTING TO HEAL THEMSELVES.

ELECTRONIC;

USED IN THE REPAIR OF ELECTRONIC EQUIP

MECHANICAL;

USED IN THE REPAIR OF MECHANICAL EQUIP

MEDICAL;

THIS DETERMINES HOW SUCCESFUL A HUMAN AGENT IS WHEN ATTEPTING TO HEAL
HIM/HERSELF

PSIONICS;

THE NUMBER UNDER THIS HEADING DATAILS THE INDIVIDUALS PSYCHIC ENERGY LEVEL. THE
MAXIMUM NUMBER IS 33 ALTHOUGH THIS CAN BE BOOSTED ARTIFICALLY..ANDROIDS DO NOT
POSSESS THIS ABILITY.

THE SCREEN LAYOUT;

DAMAGE;- THE FIGURE DISPALYED TO THE LEFT OF THE PLAYING AREA IS USED TO
INDICATE THE DAMAGE YOU HAVE SUSTAINED DURING THE GAME. IF THE BOX OVER YOUR
HEAD IS FILLED OR THE BOX OVER YOUR CHEST IS FILLED THEN THE GAME IS OVER YOUR
DEAD!!!!..IF A BOX BECOMES MORE THAN HALF FILLED THEN YOU USE OF THAt AREA
BECOMES RESTRICTED, FOR EXAMPLEIF YOUR LEG IS INJURED BY MORE THAN HALF OF ITS
CAPICITY YOUR MOVEMENT IS REDUCED..IF YOUR HEAD IS MORE THAN HALF INJURED YOUR
SIGHT IS AFFECTED.

THE HORIZNTAL BAR BENEATH THIS FIGURE REPRESENTS YOUR ENERGY LEVEL..THIS
STARTS OFF AS FULL AND GRADUALLY DEPLETS.

EQUIPMENT;

THE FIGURE DISPLAYED TO THE RIGHT OF THE PLAYING AREA IS USED TO INDICATE WHAT
EQUIP IS CARRIED WHERE. EACH BOX ON THE FIGURE REPRESENTS A POCKET. USE THIS

MOVEMENT..THESE VALUES ARE NORMALLY STATIC THROUGHOUT THE GAME ALTHOUGH THE USE
OF SOME OBJECTS MAY AFFECT ONE OR MORE OF YOUR ATTRIBUTES.!.

LOOK WINDOWS;

THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF OF THE DISPLAY REPRESENTS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT,
THIS IS NORMALLY THE CONTENTS OF A POCKET OR ANYTHING IN THE ROOM WHICH IS IN
REACH. THE SMALL BUTTON MARKED WITH AN ARROW CYCLES THROUGH ALL OF THE ITEMS IN
THE POCKET OR WITHIN REACH. IF YOU CAN DROP AN ITEM, A DOWN ARRIW IS DISPLAYED
OVER THE CYCLE BUTTON. CLICK HERE TO DROP AN ITEM. IF IT IS DAMAGED A RED CROSS
IS SHOWN AT THE LEFT OF THE CYCLE BUTTON. THE VERTICAL COLUMN OF THIS AREA IS
USED TO SHOW HOW MUCH OF THE REPAIR PROCESS HAS BEN COMPLETED.

CONTROLLER:

THE BOTTOM CENTRE OF THE DISPLAY HOLDS EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO CONTROL YOUR
CHARACTER. IT HAS BEEN DESIGNED WITH EASE OF USE AND MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN
MIND, THE BUTTON MARKED WITH AN ARROW POINTING DOWN ALLOWS YOU TO CROUCH OR
DUCK. CLICK HERE QUICKLY TO DUCK OR HOLD THE BUTTON A LITTLE LONGER TO CROUCH
DOWN. USE THIS BUTTON TO LAND IF YOU ARE FLYING. THE ARROW MARKED WITH AN ARROW
POINTING UP ALLOWS YOU TO STAND UP FROM A CROUCHED POSITION. CLICK HERE QUICKLY
TO PEEP OVER AN OBJECT OR HOLD THE BUTTON A LITTLE LONGER TO STAND UP, CLICK
HERE WHILE STANDING OR RUNNING TO JUMP ON THE SPOT OR JUMP OVER SOMETHING. USE
THIS BUTTON TO FLY IF YOU HAVE A JETPACK, OR IF YOU ARE GOING TO LEVITATE.

THE BUTTON MARKED WITH AN EYE ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK AROUND. CLICK HERE AND YOU

WILL SLIDE ALONG IT.

PRESS P TO PAUSE THE GAME. THIS FEATURE IS NOT AVAILABLE WHILST AN ITEM OF
EQUIPMENT IS BEING MANIPULATED

DAMAGE;

BOTH YOU AND YOUR EQUIPMENT ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE, DAMAGE TO YOUR BODY IS
DISPLAYED IN TH BOXES SHOWN ON THE FIGURE LEFT OF THE SCREEN. DAMAGE TO AN
OBJECT IS SHOWN ONLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OBJECT(IE CLICK ON ITS POCKET). THE
RED CROSS SIGNIFIES THAT THE ITEM IS FAULTY. ALL DAMAGE CAN BE REPAIRED WITH
THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT,SKILLS AND TIME.PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO FLESH IS REPAIRED BY
USING THE FIRST-AID KIT. ROBOTS AND BIONIC LIMBS REQUIRE THE ELECTRONICS KIT TO
REPAIR DAMAGE, SIMPLY FIND THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT AND PRESS THE MANIPULATE
BUTTON (THE ONE WITH THE HAND) THESE KITS CAN BE USED ONCE ONLY AND ARE THEN
USED UP. YOU CAN,HOWEVER,FIND ANOTHER ONE AND USE THAT. THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE
REPAIRED DEPENDS ON YOUR SKILL IN THAT FEILD, USING A FIRST AID KIT IN
CONJUNCTION WITH A HIGH MEDICAL SKILL AND A HIGH DEXTERITY,FOR EXAMPLE WILL
RESULT IN A GOOD REPAIR.
DAMAGED EQUIPMENT CAN MALFUNCTION WHEN USED, WITH A DAMAGED HOLOGRAM THIS IS
NOT A PROBLEM BUT A DAMAGED GRENADE MAY JUST BLOW OFF YER HAND!!..TO REPAIR AN
ITEM OF EQUIPMENT, LOOK AT IT AND (CLICK ON ITS POCKETS) AND THEN HOLD DOWN THE
REPAIR BUTTON(THE ONE WITH THE SPANNER) WHILE THE BUTTTON IS DOWN, THE MERCURY
IN THE INDICATOR IS RISING. HOLD THE BUTTON UNTIL THE MERCURY REACHES THE TOP
AND AT THAT POINT YOUR CHARACTER THINKS THE REPAIR IS COMPLETE. IF YOU ARE
INTERRUPTED DURING A REPAIR, YOU WILL HAVE TO START THE WHOLE REPAIR AGAIN NEXT
TIME. WHEN THE REPAIR IS THOUGHT TO BE COMPLETE, THE COMPUTER HAS USED YOUR
CHARACTERS SKILLS TO DETERMINE SUCCESS. IF THE REPAIR WAS A FAILURE IT COULD BE
OBVIOUS AND THE DAMAGE CROSS COULD STILL BE VISIBLE OR IT MAY ONLY BE OBVIUS
WHEN THE OBJECT IS NEXT USED!!.

GUNS ARE COMPLEXED OBJECTS AND CAN MALFUNCTION IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. THESE
INCLUDE LOSING ALL OF THEIR CHARGE, EXPLODING WHEN DAMAGED, EXPLODING WHEN NEXT
USED AND FIRING REDUCED POWER MISSILES. REPAIRING A GUN IS A COMPLICATED A
PROCEDURE AND SUCCESS IS DETERMINED BY YOUR WEAPONS,ELCTRONIC AND MECHANICAL
SKILLS AND DEXTERITY RATING.

ARMOUR;

ONE ITEM OF EQUIPMENT YOU CAN PURCHASE IS A SUIT OF ARMOUR. THERE ARE FOUR
TYPES OF ARMOUR AND ALL OFFER DIFFERENT DEGREES OF PROTECTION AGAINST
DAMAGE,ANDROIDS BEING HUMANOID CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ARMOUR TOO.

ABLATIVE;

THIS FORM OF ARMOUR IS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, IT IS MADE OF COMPRESSED CARBON
COMPOUND AND PROTECTS AGAINST ALL DAMAGE WHILST IT LASTS. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS
ARMOUR IS THAT EVERY HIT DESTROYS PART OF IT.

REFLECTIVE;

THIS ARMOUR IS EXCELLENT AGAINST ATTACKS FROM ENERGY WEAPONS. IT IS FORMED FROM
A HIGHLY REFLECTIVE PLASTIC MATERIAL WHICH SIMPLY DEFLECTS THE MISSILE. THE
PLASTIC IS SOFT,HOWEVER,AND OFFERS NO PROTECTION AGAINST HAND -TO-HAND COMBAT.

STANDARD;

THIS IS THE STANDARD ISSUE ARMOUR WORN BY MOST MILITARY PERSONNAL. IT OFFERS A
GENERAL PROTECTION WHICH IS NOT AS GOOD AGAINST ENERY ATTACK AS REFLECTIVE
ARMOUR DOES, BUT DOES ABSORB SOME HAND-TO-HAND DAMAGE.

SUPREME;

THIS ARMOUR IS THE ULTIMATE PROTECTION.IT OFFERS ALMOST COMPLETE PROTECTION
FROM ENERY ATTACKS AND IS SO TOUGH ONLY A LARGE EXPLOSIVE IS LIKELY TO INJURE
THE OCCUPANT. THE SUIT DOES NOT HAVE DISADVANTAGES IN THAT IT CONTINUALLY USES
POWER, ITS BULK SLOWS THE WEARER DOWN AND IT REDUCES THE WEARERS ENDURANCE. AS
A CONSEQUENCE THE WEARER CAN CARRY LESS EQUIPMENT BEFORE BEING ENCUMBERED. IF
THE SUIT RUNS OUT OF POWER THE OCCUPANT IS TRAPPED AND WILL BE CAPTURED.

COMBAT;

THE CHARACTER CAN INDULGE IN TWO FORMS OF COMBAT;LONG AND SHORT RANGE. WHEN YOU
POINT INTO THE GAME WINDOW YOU WILL SEE THAT THE SMALL ARROW BECOMES A CROSS
HAIR, USE THIS TO AIM AND PRESS THE LEFT BUTTON TO ATTACK.

MISSILE;

MISSILE COMBAT COVERS THE USE OF GUNS AND GRENADES. TO USE A GUN SIMPLY HOLD IT
IN YOUR HAND(EITHER HAND) AND WHEN YOU ATTACK YOU WILL FIRE A MISILE. IF THE
GUN RUNS OUT OF CHARGE, INSTEAD OF SHOOTING YOU WILL PUNCH(SEE POWER FOR
DETAILS ON RE-CHARGING EQUIPMENT) TO THROW A GRENADE LOOK AT IT MANIPULATE IT.
THE GRENADE WILL BE THROWN STRAIGHT AHEAD AND WILL EXPLODE ON IMPACT. REMEMBER
NOT TO STAND TO CLOSE!!!.

HAND-TO-HAND;

IF YOU ATTACK WITHOUT HOLDING A GUN, YOU WILL `PUNCH`. YOU WILL ALSO PUNCH IF
YOUR GUN HAS RUN OUT OF CHARGE. PUNCHING DOES VERY LITTLE DAMAGE. REMEMBER THAT
YOU ONLY PUNCH AT ARMS LENGTH!..COMBAT CAN BE DANGEROUS. IT IS WORTH
REMEMBERING THAT EVERYONE IN THE GAME IS WEARING ARMOUR.

OBJECTS;

MANIPULATION;- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ABILITY AND IS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE ALTHOUGH
IT MAY AT FIRST SEEM COMPLICATED...EVERY OBJECT IN THE GAME HAS A FUNCTION AND
THIS NORMALL ACTIVATED BY CLICKING ON THE MANIPULATE BUTTON, IF THE ITEM CANNOT
PERFORM ITS USUAL FUNCTION. YOU ARE PRESENTED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO RE-CHARGE
IT. FOR THE BUTTON TO WORK, YOU MUST BE LOOKING AT THE ITEM YOU WISH TO
MANIPULATE.

IE..
TO USE THE MEDI-KIT YOU  SHOULD CLICK ON THE POCKET IT IS IN AND THEN CLICK ON
THE MANIPULATE BUTTON. THE MACHINE WILL ADMINISTER EITHER A STIMULANT OR AN
ANTIDOTE OR BOTH, IF THE MEDI-KIT HAS NO CHEMICALS, CLICKING ON MANIPULATE WILL
INSTEAD PRODUCE A FULL SCREEN IMAGE OF IT. YOU ARE NOW IN POSITION TO REFILL
IT. SEARCH YOUR POCKETS TO SEE IF YOU HAVE THE AMPULE OF CHEMICALS NECESSARY TO
REFILL THE MEDI-KIT. IF YOU FIND THEM LLOK AT THEM AND MANIPULATE THEM. THE
CHEMICALS WILL THEN BE USED AND THE MEDI-KIT RE-SUPPLIED.

THE SAME PROCEDURE IS USED WITH THE GUN, IF YOU LOOK AT THE GUN AND MANIPULATE
IT, YOU WILL SEE THE FULL SCREEN IMAGE OF IT. NOW LOOK AT THE POWER LEAD WHICH
COMES FROM THE BELT OF YOUR SUIT AND MANIPULATE THAT. THE GUN WILL BE `BURST
CHARGED`.

TO PICK UP AN OBJECT UP. CLICK ON THE LOOK BUTTON (HAS AN EYE ON IT) SO THAT
THE SMALL LIGHT IS ON. AS YOU MOVE AROUND ANYTHING WHICH COMES WITHIN REACH
APPEARS IN THE LOOK WINDOW. TO PICK AN OBJECT UP, SIMPLY CLICK ON IT AND HOLD
THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON DOWN. YOUR POINTER WILL CHANGE INTO A HAND. MOVE THE HAND
OVER THE POCKET IN WHICH YOU WISH TO PUT THE OBJECT AND RELEASE THE BUTTON. IF
THERE IS ROOM IN THE POCKET THE OBJECT WILL BE MOVED THERE.

DOORS;

LOCK DOORS ARE MANIPULATED IN A SIMILAR MANNER TO GUNS, THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF
DOORS; ONE THAT CAN BE OPENED BY WALKING ON PRESSURE PADS AND THE SECOND THAT
IS LOCKED BY AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM, THE LOCKED DOOR IS DEPICTED BY A GREY SQUARE
ON ITS SURFACE, TO OPEN IT CLICK .ON THE LOOK BUTTON AND APPROACH THE DOOR,
WHEN THE CONTROL PANEL IS WITHIN ITS REACH, IT APPEARS AS A SMALL IMAGE IN THE
LOOK WINDOW(BOTTOM RIGHT OF YOUR SCREEN) NEXT CLICK ON THE MANIPULATE BUTTON
AND THE CONTROL PANEL WILL BE SHOWN AS A FULL SCREEN IMAGE. IN ORDER TO ENETR
THE FOUR FIGURE CODE POINT AT ANDCLICK ON THE BUTTONS ON THE PANEL. AS YOU
LOCATE A CORRECT NUMBER, THE GREEN LIGHT ON THE PANEL FLASHES. NOTE THE NUMBERS
AND THEN TRY TO ESTABLISH THE THREE OTHER FIGURES NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE CODE.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL FOUR FIGURES PRESS THE ENTER KEY ON THE CONTROL PANEL. IF YOU
HAVE ENTERED THE NUMBERS IN THE CORRECT SEQUENCE, THE DOOR WILL OPEN, IF NOT
YOU WILL HAVE TO TRY ENTERING THE NUMBERS IN DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS UNTIL THEY
ARE CORRECT.

THE ALTERNATIVE TO OPENING DOORS `MANUALLY` IS TO USE AN ELECTRONIC LOCK PICK.
THESE CAN BE EITHER PURCHASED AT THE START OR COLLECTED AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH
THE GAME. TO USE IT CLICK ON THE POCKET IT IS STORED IN. IT WILL NOW APPEAR IN
THE VIEW SCREEN. CLICK ON MANIPULATE AND THE LOCK PICK WILL START TO DECODE THE
COMBINATION. IT WILL ELIMINATE WRONG NUMBERS BY LEARNING FROM ITS MISTAKES.
ONCE IT HAS COMPLETED ITS DECODING. YOU WILL HAVE APPROX 5 SECONDS TO NOTE THE
NUMBER FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. YOU WILL NOW BE TO ADVANCE THROUGH THE DOOR. YOU
CAN ONLY USE THE ELECTRONIC LOCK PICK WHEN YOU HAVE A FULL SCREEN IMAGE OF THE
CONTROL PANEL.

ELEVATORS:
ELEVATORS ARE THE ONLY WAY TO MOVE BETWEEN LEVELS.THERE ARE TWO CONTROL PANELS
WHICH RELATE TO ELEVATORS.THE SMALL PANEL OUTSIDE AN ELEVATOR SHOWS THE FLOOR
IT IS ON.PRESS THE ARROW SHAPED BUTTON AND THE ELEVATOR WILL BE CALLED. WHEN IT
ARRIVES YOU HAVE 5 SECONDS TO ENTER THE OPEN DOOR.INSIDE IS A CONTROL
COLUMN.WALK UP TO IT AND CLICK THE LOOK BUTTON.MANIPULATE THE RESULTING KEYPAD
TO SEE A FULL SCREEN PICTURE OF THE CONTROL PAD.KEY PRESSES WILL NOT BE
ACCEPTED UNTIL YOU HAVE INSERTED YOUR SMART CARD.TO DO THIS FIND WHICH POCKET
IT IS IN,LOOK AT IT AND CLICK THE MANIPULATE BUTTON.THE CARD WILL NOW APPEAR IN
THE SLOT.THE ARRANGEMENT OF BUTTONS ON THE CONTROL PANEL ALLOWS YOU TO GO TO
ANY FLOOR IN THE BUILDING.TO SELECT A FLOOR JUST PPIONT TO ITS NUMBER AND
CLICK.IF YOU HAVE SECURITY CLEARENCE FOTR THAT LEVEL A GREEN LIGHT WILL COME ON
AND THE LIFT WILL START TO MOVE.IF YOU DONT HAVE CLEARANCE NOTHING WILL HAPPEN
AND YOU WILL HAVE TO PRESS ANOTHER NUMBER.THE PANEL DISPLAYS THE LEVEL YOU ARE
ON IN THE TOP RIGHT AND THE LEVEL YOU ARE GOING TO IN THE TOP LEFT. WHEN THE
ELEVATOR HAS REACHED ITS DESTINATION THE CONTROL PAD WILL DISAPPEAR AND YOUR
SMART CARD WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE RETURNED TO YOU.

AIRLOCKS:
THE WAREHOUSE, CAR PARK, AND GROUND FLOOR ARE SEPARATED BY SECURITY LOCKS
NICKNAMED 'AIRLOCKS'.THE CONTROL PADS FOR THESE ARE SIMILAR TO THE LOCKED DOOR
CONTROL PAD.FIRST INSERT YOUR SMART CARD AND THEN ENTER THE FOUR FIGURE CODE IN
THE SAME WAYAS YOU WOULD WITH A NORMAL DOOR.WHEN THE CODE HAS BEEN CORRECTLY
ENTERED THE SMALL LIGHT WILL COME ON.NOW PRESS THE YELLOW BUTTON TO OPEN THE
DOOR.YOUR SMART CARD WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE RETURNED TO YOU.

TERMINALS:
COMPUTER TERMINALS ARE A RARE FIND.THEY ARE SIMILAR TO THE ELEVATOR CONTROL
COLUMN.WALK UP TO THE COLUMN AND LOOK AT IT.WHEN THE PICTURE OF A MONITOR
SCREEN APPEARS IN THE LOOK WINDOW,CLICK ON THE MANIPULATE BUTTON.COMPUTER
TERMINALS OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF FACILITIES INCLUDING INCREASING YOUR SECURITY
CLEARENCE TO ALLOW YOU ACCES TO MORE LEVELS OF THE BUILDING.
NOTE:IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO USE ANY OF THE ABOVE ITEMS WHILE THEY ARE DISPLAYED
FULL SCREEN,JUST CLICK ON THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL
SCREEN.

POWER:YOUR PERSONAL ENERGY IS DISPLAYED AS A HORIZONTAL BAR BENEATH THE DAMAGE
FIGURE.THIS ENERGY IS BEING CONSTANTLY DEPLETED.IF YOU BECOME ENCUMBERED BY
CARRYING TOO MUCH EQUIPMENT YOU WILL USE POWER TWICE AS FAST AS YOU NORMALLY
DO.ENERGY IS REWPLENISHED BY DRINKING GLUCOSE COMPOUND FROM THE DRINKING BOTTLE
AND BY SLEEPING.IN AN EMERGENCY MANIPULATING THE MEDI-KIT WILL ADMINISTER A
STIMULANT WHICH WILL RAISE YOUR ENERGY TO HALF ITS NORMAL LEVEL.TOO FREQUENT
USE OF THIS STIMULANT COULD PERMANENTLY REDUCE YOUR ENDURANCE RATING AND THIS
IN TURN WILL REDUCE YOUR ENCUMBRANCE RATING.

MANY ITEMS OF EQUIMENT REQUIRE POWER TO FUNCTION.YOUR SUIT CAN CARRY A CHARGE
FOR THIS JUST PURPOSE.THE LEVEL OF CHARGE REMAINING IN YOUR SUIT IS DISPLAYED
AS A HORIZONTAL BAR BENEATH THE EQUIPMENT FIGURE.TO RECHARGE YOUR SUIT FIND A
TERMINAL(A MONITOR SCREEN-EACH LEVEL CONTAINS AT LEAST ONE!). WHEN YOU FIND ONE
MANIPULATE IT AND IT WILL BECOME A FULL SCREEN IMAGE.POINT AND CLICK ON THE
POWER BUTTON ON THE TEMINAL TO ACTIVATE IT.FIND YOUR SMART CARD AND MANIPULATE
IT TO PUT IT IN THE SLOT.NOW FIND YOUR POWER LEAD AND MANIPULATE THAT.THIS
PLUGS IT INTO THE POWER SOCKET ON THE TERMINAL.THE SUIT IS THEN 'BURST
CHARGED'IN A FRACTION OF A SECOND.

TO CHARGE AN OBJECT,LOOK AT IT AND THEN MANIPULATE IT AND IT WILL BECOME A FULL
SCREEN IMAGE.NOW LOOK AT AND MANIPULATE YOUR POWER LEAD. THIS PLUGS INTO THE
POWER SOCKET ON THE OBJECT WHICH IS THEN 'BURST CHARGED'.IF YOU CHARGE UP A
DAMAGED GUN,IT MAY EXPLODE.

SOME EQUIPMENT WILL CONSTANTLY DRAIN YOUR SUITS POWRE. THIS INCLUDES THE MOST
POWERFUL ARMOUR, THE JETPACK (WHEN IN USE) AND THE VISION ENHANCING VISOR(WHEN
IN USE) THE BUILDINGS POWER CAN BE INTERRUPTED AT THE FUSE BOX, EACH FUSE
RELATES TO A LEVEL OF THE BUILDING INCLUDING THE WAREHOUSE. THERE IS NO FUSE
FOR THE CAR PARK. BY LOOKING AT THE FUSE BOX AND MANIPULATING IT, IT BECOMES
A FULL SCREEN IMAGE. POINT AND CLICK ON THE BUTTON UNDER A USE TO CUT THE POWER
TO THAT LEVEL. THE FUSES ARE NOT MARKED BUT THEY LAID OUT IN A LOGICAL MANNER
AND A LITTLE EXPERIMENATION SHOULD REVEAL WHICH IS WHICH. A FUSE WHICH HAS BEEN
REMOVED IN THIS WAY CAN BE REPLACED LATER ON BY THE GUARD OR PLAYER. USE THE
BOMB OR GRENADE TO PERMANTLY CUT THE POWER TO THE WHOLE BUILDING. WHEN THE
POWER IS CUT TO A LEVEL, ALL LIGHTS GO OUT, ROBOT GUARDS CAN STILL SEE BECAUSE
OF THEIR VISION ENHANCED SYSTEMS. THE OTHER CREATURES ARE EFFECTIVELY BLINDED
UNTIL THE POWER IS RESTORED. THE PLAYER CAN USE ENHANCED  VISION IF THE VISOR
IS WORN(ANDROIDS ARE FITTED WITH THIS AS STANDARD) CUTTING THE POWER ALSO
DISABLES DOORS AND TERMINALS.

SECURITY;

CAMERAS;--SECURITY CAMERAS ARE MOUNTED ON THE CEILING AND ROTATE AT REGULAR
INTERVALS. IF THE PLAYER IS DETECTED BY ONE, THE ALARMS ARE TRIGGERED. THE
CAMERAS HAVE A LIMITED RANGE THOUGH, DESTRUCTION OF AN ALARM TRIGGER DOES NOT
SET OFF THE ALARMS.

INFRA RED BEAMS;

BEAM PROJECTORS ARE SMALL METAL OBJECTS STANDING ON THE FLOOR. THEY ARE EASILY
RECONGNISED BY NTHEIR SINGLE LARGE LENS, WALKING IN FRONT OF THIS LENS WILL
BREAK THE BEAM AND TRIGGER THE ALARM. LIKE THE CAMERA, THESE CAN BE SHOT FROM A
DISTANCE. THE PROJECTORS ARE NORMALLY DIFFICULT TO SEE BECAUSE THEY ARE HIDDEN
IN ALCOVES. BUT THE INFRA RED MODE ON THE VISOR WILL ALLOW YOU TO DETECT THE
BEAM ITSELF. IT IS POSSIBLE, ALTHOUGH BY NO MEANS EASY, TO JUMP OVER THE
INFRA-RED BEAM AND AVOID TRIGGERING THE ALARM. TO DO THIS, BACK AS FAR AWAY
FROM THE PROJECTOR AS POSSIBLE, RUN TOWARDS IT AT TOP SPEED AND CLICK ON THE
UP/JUMP BUTTON. THIS TAKES PRACTISE!!.

PRESSURE PADS;

PRESSURE PADS APPEAR AS SLIGHTLY DISCOLOURED TILES ON THE FLOOR, THEY CANNOT BE
SHOT. ONCE SPOTTED THEY SHOULD BE AVOIDED, BECAUSE STEPPING ON ONE ACTIVATES
THE ALARM.

ALARMS;

WHEN THE ALARM IS SET OFF, THE ORANGE LIGHTS ON THE CEILING START TO FLASH, A
SIREN STARTS TO WAIL AND THE GUARDS ON YOUR LEVEL START TO HUNT YOU DOWN,
SHOOTING THE ALARM LIGHTS IS A WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY.

GAS;

THE BAD NEWS IS THAT TRANQUILLISER GAS GAS IS PUMPED INTO THE AIR, IF YOU HAVE
A GAS MASK PUT IT ONTO YOUR HEAD BOX. A SMALL FACE MASK IS THE NEXT BEST
PROTECTION. NOTE THAT THE GAS MASK CANNOT BE WORN WITH THE VISION ENHANCING
VISOR..IF YOU HAVE NO GAS MASK, MOVE FAR AWAY FROM THE SOUND OF GAS AS
POSSIBLE.THIS COULD MINIMISE THE EFFECT. IF THE GAS DOES AECT YOU, YOU WILL
SLOW DOWN AND YOUR VISION WILL BECOME DARK. USING THE MEDI-KIT WILL INJECT A
FAST ACTING ANTIDOTE.

DOORS;

WHEN THE ALARM GOES OFF,ALL DOORS WITH A KEYPAD ARE LOCKED AND CANNOT BE
OPENED, AUTOMATIC DOORS STILL FUNCTION.

CAPTURE;

IF YOU FAINT FROM EXHAUSTION, RUN OUT OF POWER(ANDROID OR SUPREME ARMOUR) ARE
OVERCOME BY GAS OR ARE DAMAGED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT YOU BLACK OUT, YOU WILL
BE CAPTURED AND PLACED IN A SECURED CELL. ONCE YOU HAVE RECOVERED, SURVEY THE
SURROUNDINGS AS THERE IS ALWAYS AN ESCAPE ROUTE. YOUR EQUIPMENT WILL BE INTACT
ALTHOUGH YOUR GUN(S) WILL HAVE BEEN REMOVED. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY
OR EQUIPMENT TO ESCAPE, UCC WILL DISPOSE OF YOU IN SUCH A WAY AS TO LEAVE ANY
EVIDENCE THAT YOU WERE EVER THERE!!!

ESCAPE;

WHEN YOU AWAKE IN THE CELL, THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY TO ESCAPE. CHECK ,WHAT
EQUIPMENT YOU HAVE LEFT. WHEN YOU DO ESCAPE YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND OUT WERE YOU
ARE, TRY TO FIND A WEAPON AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU COULD BECOME
VULNERABLE TO ATTACK.

LAODING AND SAVING GAMES;

TO LOAD A SAVED GAME, LOOK AT THE CONTENTS OF THE BELT POCKET. ITEMS IN THIS
POCKET CANNOT BE DROPPED OR REMOVED. YOU WILL SEE THE POWER LEAD. POINT AND
CLICK ON THE CYCLE BUTTON(BUTTON MARKED WITH AN ARROW IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT
CORNER OF THE LOOK WINDOW) YOU SHOULD NOW SEE A PICTURE OF A FLOPPY DISK. CLICK
ON THE MANIPULATE BUTTON AND YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH A MENU OF OPTIONS.
THESE INCLUDE LOADING A PREVIOUSLY SAVED GAME AND SAVING YOUR EXISTING GAME.
USE THE MOUSE POINTER TO POINT AT THE OPTION YOU WISH TO CHOOSE AND CLICK THE
LEFT MOUSE BUTTON. IF YOU DONOT WISH TO LOAD OR SAVE A GAME, CLICK THE RIGHT
MOUSE BUTTON. WHEN YOU HAVE MADE YOUR SELECTION, YOU WILL BE ASKED TO INSERT
YOUR SAVE-GAME DISK..REMEMBER NEVER SAVE A GAME ONTO  YOUR GAME DISK!!.

AT THE START OF THE GAME YOU WILL BE GIVEN THE OPTION OF LOADING A SAVED GAME.
THIS ALLOWS YOU TO BYPASS THE CHARACTER SELECTION PART OF THE GAME AND RESUME
PLAYING WERE YOU LEFT OFF.

HINTS;

A) DONT RUSH AROUND. IT IS BETTER NOT TO TRIGGER ALARMS. THIS IS ACHIEVED MORE
EASILY IF YOU ARE CAREFUL.

B) SHOOT CAMERAS AND PROJECTORS FROM A DISTANCE

C) IF YOU ARE GETTING LOW ON ENERGY OR POWER. DONT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE
BEFORE RECHARGING, SOMETHING MIGHT ATTACK YOU AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO RE-CHARGE.

D) USE THE JETPACK, VISOR, AND BACKPACK COMPUTER SPARINGLY. THEY USE POWER ALL
THE TIME THEY ARE IN USE.

E) LEARN TO USE YOUR PSYCHIC POWERS. SOMETHING BRINGS UP THE SELECTION MENU,
TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS

F) USE EXPLOSEIVES SPARINGLY.

G) EXAMINE HOLOGRAMS VERY CAREFULLY

H) FIGHT WITH YOUR BACK TO A WALL

I) TRY KEEP AN ESCAPE ROUTE CLEAR. YOU`LL NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU NEED TO RUN LIKE
CRAZY!!!
