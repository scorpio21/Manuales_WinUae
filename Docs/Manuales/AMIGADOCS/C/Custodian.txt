GAMEPLAY.!
==========
 
	Your job is to protect the tomb by collecting all the alien pods
located around each level and to destroy them in the pod annihilation
chambers. You start the game with a life energy,when this reaches zero you
will expire. The tomb also has an energy level,if this reaches zero the tomb
shuts down , killing you in the process
 
	You start the game with 1000 credits (which are used to purchase
weaponry) and a full batch of ejectable laser turrets.
 
PODS.!
======
 
	Pods appear in a randomplace on the map in a quanity set by the 
current level of play,up to a max of 20. Initially they are relatively weak
but grow at intervals becoming more powerful,absorting the tomb energy in
the process.
Pods can fire a heat seeking sucker that drains your energy (the more 
powerful the pod,the more energy they drain).This sucker can be shaken off 
or will self destruct after a short time.Collecting a pod gives you
200 credits.
 
ALIENS.!
========
 
	Aliens attack in waves useing different weapons and tactics.
Different aliens are sensitive to different weapons.Credits are obtained from
killing aliens (about 24 each).It is best to use the most suited weapon for
each alien type if you want to survive longer.
 
GUARDIAN.!
==========
 
	This creature appears after all pods in the map have been collected.
It is very strong and fires the same heat seeking suckers as the pods.On
destroying a guardian you will pick up 200 credits.
 
POD POINTER.!
=============
 
	This indicator points to the nest pod on the map.This indicator can
only work while you are not carrying any pods.Collection of more than one pod
can only be done `blind`.
 
ENERGY INDICATORS.!
===================
 
	The indicator on the left is your lifeforce and the indicator on the
right is the total tomb energy.The more energy they have the higher the
displayed level.
 
TELEPORTS.!
===========
 
	While standing in the middle of the teleport bay (a large cabinet 
with a T in the centre) pull down on the joystick or press down the
keyboard.You cannot take a teleport journey unless you can pay a sum or 100 
credirs.The teleporters transport you around the level and as an added
bonus give you 256 energy points back.
 
SILO.!
======
 
	While standing in the middle of an ammuntion silo (a large cabinet
with a bullet in the centre) pull down on the joystick or press down the
keyboard. and you will enter.Once inside,left and right or relevant function
key select the weapon,up to buy ammunition or down to sell it.All weapons
have a max level that you cannot go beyond.
 
POD AMMUNITION CHAMBER.!
========================
 
	If you are carrying a pod or pods you can enter a pod chamber by
pressing down while standing in the centre,this gives you 1024 energy points
back.Once in the chamber use the joystick or keys to move the sight around
the screen.When the pod enters the sight press fire to detroy it.If left
alone the pods will gradually grow larger untill they reach the first red
stage and then they disappear back onto the map in weak form so they have to
be collected again.The more pods you are carryingthe more pods you have to
destroy at a time.! The next level is reached when you have to destroy the
last pod.As each pod is destroyed the tomb reclaims 48 points of energy back.
The amount of pods you have destroyed so far on the level is displayed on
screen.
