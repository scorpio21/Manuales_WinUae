INTRODUCTION 
In June of 1950, United States military plan-
ners believed that the army of the Republic
of Korea was the “best military force of its
size in Asia.” Washington was worried that
the strength of any additional arms given to
the South Koreans might tempt them into
an invasion of North Korea. American intel-
ligence agencies were in full agreement that
a North Korean invasion of the south was
unlikely. On 25 June 1950, North Korea
invaded the south. Within a month they
had overrun more than three quarters of
South Korea. The fighting was to last for
three years.

The Korean Conflict can be broken down
into two phases. The first phase lasted less
than a year and was characterized by strate-
gic surprises and dramatic mobility. As
troop strengths built up and political oppo-
sition to the war increased, the conflict
degenerated into a static exercise in attri-
tion. In its first three scenarios, CONFLICT 
KOREA simulates the opening, mobile phase
of the Korean War.

Even now, almost forty years after the
Korean War, the Korean peninsula remains
divided and heavily militarized. While there
is no reason to expect a renewal of hostili-
ties, events in this part of the world have
surprised us before. The “Tomorrow’s War”
scenario takes a look at the possibility of a
new war sometime in the near future.

CONFLICT KOREA is a game for one or two
players. Players will assume the roles of
overall military commanders of Communist
or United Nations forces during the mobile
phase of the Korean conflict, or during the
first four months of a hypothetical conflict
occurring in the immediate future. Each
game turn represents about eight days of
action. The military units in the game repre-
sent formations ranging in size from battal- 
ions to divisions. Air units are wings or
groups of from 25 to 100 aircraft. Ground
combat units may be examined to the level
of individual infantry platoons, vehicles, or
gun tubes. 

1.0 STARTUP 
Before playing the game, you should make
a copy of your game disk. Use the copy for
playing the game and store your original
disk in a safe place. Refer to your CONFLICT 
KOREA data card for installation instructions. 

1.1 Documentation Check
After you select a scenario or saved game,
the program will ask you to do a documen-
tation check before it will allow you to con-
tinue the game. This check will take the
form of a question about the first paragraph
of some section of the rules. 

Example:
Please type the first word of section 1.1.
The correct response would be “After”. 

1.2 Talking to the Computer  
1.21 Commodore Amiga Select such options as the Strategic Report or
Air Operations by using the mouse to move
the cursor to the menu bar at the top of the
screen, clicking the right mouse button over
the desired section and pulling it down.
Release the button when the desired option
is highlighted.

Select command buttons or individual hexes
by using the mouse to place the cursor over
the desired item and clicking the left mouse
button. Once an action has been selected, it
will immediately be performed by the pro-
gram (if a simple action), or you will be
prompted to provide additional information
or selections.

All active control buttons have the same
appearance — they are light gray with blue
text or red arrows. Select control buttons by 
moving the cursor over the button with the
mouse and pressing the left mouse button.
The keyboard is only used during the 
documentation check, assigning names to
military forces, or specifying saved game 
file names. 

1.211 Gadgets, Menus, and 
Multi-Tasking 
CONFLICT KOREA is fully compatible with multi-
tasking systems. The depth arrangement,
menu and screen bar gadgets operate in the
standard Amiga fashion. The workbench
behind the game screen is fully usable. 

1.212 Shortcuts Generally, pressing the right mouse button
will exit back to the Main Map screen.

When the program displays a dialog box
with only one possible selection (usually
“Continue”), you do not need to move the
mouse cursor over the selection button to
continue the game. Simply click the left
mouse button to exit. 

1.22 IBM PC XT/AT You may control the program with either a
mouse or the keyboard. 

1.221 Using the Mouse If you have a mouse installed on your com-
puter and you have run the mouse installa-
tion program included with your mouse
before running CONFLICT KOREA then you 
can control most game functions using 
the mouse.

If you are not sure whether the mouse
installation program has been run, try run-
ning CONFLICT KOREA and see if the mouse
works. The mouse installation is usually
done for you when you turn your computer
on. If the mouse does not respond, refer to
the manual that came with your mouse for
installation instructions. 

Select options such as the Strategic Report or
Air Operations by using the mouse to move
the cursor to the menu bar at the top of the
screen, clicking the left mouse button over
the desired section and pulling it down.
Release the button when the desired option
is highlighted.

Select command buttons or individual hexes
by using the mouse to place the cursor over
the desired item and clicking the left mouse
button. Once an action has been selected, it
will immediately be performed by the pro-
gram (if a simple action), or you will be
prompted to provide additional information
or selections.

All active control buttons have the same
appearance — in EGA or VGA, they are
light gray with yellow and blue text or red
arrows. In CGA they are black boxes with
white text and surrounded by a white
frame. A control button is selected by mov-
ing the cursor over the button with the
mouse and pressing the left mouse button.

You may, of course, still use the keyboard to
issue orders, even if the mouse is in use. 

1.222 Using the Keyboard Most game functions may be controlled by
use of the numeric keypad and <Enter> or
<Escape> keys.

The Main Map screen features two control
modes: Menu Mode and Scroll Mode. In
Menu Mode, you may access reports, allo-
cate aircraft, and alter various game func-
tions. In Scroll Mode, you may move a cur-
sor around the map and select force and ter-
rain information or manipulate the con-
tents of individual hexes on the map. The
<5> or <Escape> key may be used to toggle
between Menu and Scroll modes. When in
Menu mode, menu items are selected by
moving the highlight over the desired menu
item by using the Menu keys (2,4,6,8) and
pressing <Enter>. In Scroll mode, map hex
selections are made by using the Scroll keys 
(1,2,3,7,8,9) to move the map cursor and
then pressing the <Enter> key. Either the
numeric keypad or top row of numbers may
be used to input numbers into the program.
Don’t press <NumLock> — this is set within
the program.

All active control buttons will have the
appearance noted in section 1.221. Control
buttons may be selected by pressing the key
corresponding to the highlighted number
near the left side of the control button. 

1.223 Shortcuts The right mouse button or <Escape> key
may be used to exit from any screen or
function within the game. There is also an
Exit Button or prompt for such functions.
When the program displays a dialog box
with only one possible selection (usually
“Continue”), you do not need to move the
mouse cursor over the selection button to
continue the game. Simply click the left
mouse button to exit. 

1.3 Basic Concepts 
There are a few basic concepts you need to
understand in order to know what’s going
on in the game.

Unless exceptions are specifically stated, the
term United Nations refers to all US, USMC,
Commonwealth, ROK, and miscellaneous
United Nations allied forces. The term
Communist refers to all North Korean
(NKPA) and Chinese (CPLA) forces.

A UNIT is a military formation which 
cannot be broken down into smaller forma-
tions (in the game). Units are in turn com-
posed of equipment (which is managed by
the program).

A FORCE is a collection of one to six units.
This is what you see scattered across the
map when playing the game. You create
forces (from existing units) as necessary dur-
ing game play. Details of force manage-
ment are given in section 3.42. 

Most of the game is controlled from the game
map screen. Please read section 1.4 carefully.

The combat and movement capabilities of
your units are strongly dependent on their
supply status. Supply rules are described in
section 6.1.

In order to win the game, you will have to
move forces across the map (see section 3.41
FORCE MOVEMENT) in order to take land
from the enemy. It will also be necessary for
you to order attacks on enemy forces (see
sections 3.21 AIR OPERATIONS, 3.41 FORCE
MOVEMENT, and 4.0 COMBAT RESOLU-
TIONS PHASE). When the game ends, your
performance will be compared with histori-
cal results (see section 8.0 SCENARIOS AND
VICTORY CONDITIONS) to determine who
“won” the game. 

1.4 The Game Map Screen
The map shows the entire Korean penin-
sula, as well as an abstracted Japan deploy-
ment area to the southeast of Korea.
Military forces, when detected, will be dis-
played on the map using standard NATO
military symbols (see Appendix A). In the
1950’s scenarios, the 38th parallel will be
indicated by a dotted line and MiG Alley
hexes will be indicated by a small jet
graphic. The map is overlaid with a hexago-
nal grid. Cells within the grid are called
“hexes.” A single cell is called a “hex.” Each
hex is 15 kilometers across. The main map
screen shows an area fourteen hexes wide
and eight high (about 4% of total map
area). To the right of the map is a panel of
control buttons (described below).
Sandwiched between the upper and lower
groups of buttons is a graphic indicator of
current weather conditions. Scrolling (mov-
ing your view around the map) is accom-
plished by selecting any of the top six con-
trol buttons at the right of the screen.
Holding down the mouse button or high-
lighted number key for a scroll control but-
ton will repeat the scroll in the selected
direction. The other three control buttons
perform the following functions: 

UNITS button toggles the display of
unit/force icons. This allows you to remove
the unit/force icons from the map to allow
unobstructed viewing of terrain. Pressing 
the key again returns the unit/force icons 
to the map.

POSSN button toggles the display of hex pos-
session information. When the hex posses-
sion display feature is enabled, the program
will show which side controls each unoccu-
pied hex by placing a small graphic in the
center of the hex. (Any occupied hex is con-
trolled by the player owning the occupying
unit.) Communist hexes are indicated by a
“star” graphic. United Nations hexes are
indicated by a “divided circle” graphic.
Pressing the button again removes the pos-
session graphics from the map.

OVRVW button displays the Strategic
Overview Map. The unit and possession
selections described above also affect this
display. The map for the entire game will be
displayed at a greatly reduced scale. To exit,
select a location on the overview display.
Either click on a map point with the mouse
or (IBM only) press <Enter> to select an
area. On the IBM, you may scroll the selec-
tor box within the overview using the stan-
dard game scroll controls. Once an area has
been selected from the Overview screen, the
Main Map screen will be redrawn, centered
on the area selected.

You may also select any hex on the Main
Map screen for additional information on
units and terrain. This is accomplished by
clicking on the hex with the mouse or (IBM
only) pressing <Enter> to select the hex
under the map cursor. You will be given as
much information on the hex as is avail-
able to you. Full information is always
available for friendly hexes. Information on
enemy hexes varies from very complete to
non-existent, depending on the intelligence
level you choose when you start the game
and the intelligence gathering rules. 

Once a friendly hex has been selected, and
you click or press <Enter> a second time on
it, additional options will become available.
You may opt to begin moving one of the
forces in the hex, or you may examine the
hex in greater detail. See section 3.4.

Below the map is an area where the pro-
gram displays information, gives prompts,
and asks for input at certain points in the
game. Included in the information is a vic-
tory level count (see section 8.0), game turn,
and player/game phase information.  

1.5 Saving a Game 
At any time during a player’s orders phase
you can save the game in progress. A FOR-
MATTED DISK, HARD DISK, OR RAM DISK
IS REQUIRED. On the Amiga, you can ini-
tialize a disk at any time by using the depth
arrangement gadgets to go to the
Workbench screen and selecting the
Disk/Initialize menu option. Use the
Workbench depth arrangement gadget to
return to the program.

If you are playing the game from a hard
drive on the Amiga, games will automati-
cally be saved into the SavedGames drawer
on your hard drive. 

You need only follow the prompts in order
to save the game. Saved games may be
restarted from the saved point whenever the
game is booted, or the Restart Game option
is selected. In addition to the “game state,”
player selections such as Movement, center-
ing, and Speed settings will be saved. 

1.6 The Readme File 
Your game disk may include a README file.
If so, then there have been important
changes or additions to these rules. Please
examine any README file on your game
disk before beginning play. 

2.0 PLAYING THE GAME 
Each game of CONFLICT KOREA will continue
until the victory or termination conditions
for the selected scenario are met (see section
8.0). Historically, the mobile phase of the
Korean war lasted about 45 turns.

Each game turn consists of the following
major phases:

. First Orders Phase.
. Combat Resolutions Phase.
. Second Orders Phase.
. General Resolutions Phase.

In the First Orders Phase, each player is given
the opportunity examine the situation, move
all forces, and change operational orders for
air units. 

During the Combat Resolutions Phase, air
superiority is determined, and the players
are given the opportunity to manage
airstrikes ordered earlier. Then ground forces
fight for any contested terrain.

Next, in the Second Orders Phase, both
players may move any forces which have
not exhausted their full movement
allowance earlier in the turn.

Finally, the program will perform reinforce-
ment, replacement, and supply functions,
and check for end of game conditions.

There are two players in a game of CONFLICT 
KOREA and either (but not both) can be con-
trolled by the computer. Thus, the options
are:

Communist Solitaire: A human player
controls Communist coalition forces against
a United Nations computer player.

United Nations Solitaire: A human player
controls United Nations forces against a
Communist computer player.

Two Player: Human players control both
sides. 

2.1 Pre Game Selections 
Before starting a game of CONFLICT KOREA 
you will be asked if you wish to load a previ-
ously saved game. If you wish to load a
saved game, the program will display a
selector box and prompts. Simply select a
saved game file as indicated to begin play.

If you have not loaded a saved game, you
will be presented with the following menu:

SCENARIO SELECTIONS
. Scenario: The Dragon Wakes, Operation
  Chromite, Cold Steel or Tomorrow’s War
. CCF Intervention: Historical or Fixed
. Communist Capability: Pushover,
  Moderate, Challenging, Hairy, Hideous,
  or Random
GAME CONTROL OPTIONS
. Play Mode: Red Solitaire, U.N. Solitaire,
  Two Player
. Air Campaign: Player Control or
  Program Control
. Intelligence: Limited or Complete
. Begin the Game: Select this option to
  begin playing the game using the selec- 
  tions shown above. 

2.11 Effects of Menu Selections 
2.111 SCENARIO SELECTIONS 

Scenario: This controls the game’s historical
starting point. “The Dragon Wakes” begins
the game with the North Korean Invasion of
South Korea in June of 1950. “Operation
Chromite” begins the game in September of
1950 as the United Nations forces are
preparing to launch the Inchon invasion.
The “Cold Steel” scenario begins in
November of 1950 as the Communist
Chinese Forces launch their surprise counter-
attack. “Tomorrow’s War” is a hypothetical
modern scenario that takes place in 1995.

CCF Intervention: This option controls the
Chinese response to a United Nations inva-
sion of North Korea. In the HISTORICAL set-
ting, the Chinese may or may not intervene 
as they did in 1950. This presents both sides
(especially the United Nations player) with
the actual dilemmas they faced historically.
In the FIXED setting, the Chinese army will
always intervene if non ROK units enter
North Korea and will begin to cross into
North Korea within two to four turns of the
first non ROK United Nations force crossing
the 38th parallel into North Korea. This set-
ting has no effect if the Tomorrow’s War sce-
nario is selected.

Communist Capability: This controls
many aspects of the quality of Communist
forces. Readiness recovery rates, strength
modifiers, and (when under computer con-
trol) the general quality of play are all mod-
ified by this selection. The “historical” level
of Communist competence would be
“Challenging.” 

2.112 GAME CONTROL OPTIONS 

Play Mode: This specifies which (if any) of
the ground forces in the game should be
computer controlled.

Air Campaign: This specifies whether you
or the computer will control any air forces
in the game. Computer controlled forces will
tend to act somewhat “historically” (and
conservatively).

Intelligence: This specifies how much infor-
mation the two players have about each
other’s forces. Historically, neither side really
had the slightest idea of where uncommitted
enemy forces were or what they were doing.
Consider that the U.N. was actually on the
offensive when the Chinese counter-attack
developed. The U.N. commanders did not
even know that 300,000 Chinese troops had
entered Korea! The “historical” setting for
this selection would be “Limited” intelli-
gence. The computer player always operates
in a limited intelligence mode, so setting this
selection to “Complete” intelligence will give
a human player a major advantage against
the computer. 

2.2 The Turn Sequence Each game turn proceeds in the following
order:
. First Orders Phase (section 3.0)
. Combat Resolutions Phase (section 4.0)
. Second Orders Phase (section 5.0)
. General Resolutions Phase (section 6.0) 

3.0 THE FIRST ORDERS PHASE 
All forces may be moved and/or given
assault orders. Orders for air forces may be
viewed and changed. Players may examine
the map and strategic situation in detail. 

Each player will have an orders phase. The
order of the players’ phases will vary ran-
domly from turn to turn. Supply stockpile
levels will influence the determination of
who moves first. Generally, the player with
the higher stockpile level will move after the
player with the lower stockpile level.
(Details of the calculation are given in
Appendix F.) 

During the first orders phase, the
player/phase indicator at the bottom left of
the screen will show “Phase: IA” (first player)
or “Phase: IB” (second player).

The U.N. player will not have a first orders
phase on the first turn of the game in the
following scenarios: The Dragon Wakes,
Cold Steel, and Tomorrow’s War. Orders for
United Nations ground units and air forces
in these scenarios will be what they were
historically, or (in 1995) a reasonable pro-
jection of pre-war plans. 

3.1 The Info Menu 
The Info Menu gives you access to the fol-
lowing game functions:
. Strategic Report (section 3.11)
. Weather Report (section 3.12)
. Supply Net Map (section 3.13)
. Airfields/Ports (section 3.14)
. Scenario Info (section 3.15)
. Game Info (section 3.16) 

3.11 Strategic Report 
Selection of Strategic Report will present you
with a display of the overall strategic situa-
tion. Territorial holdings and supply stock-
piles for both players and recent news
reports are displayed. 

3.12 Weather Report 
Current conditions and a condensed sum-
mary of their effects on air operations and
force readiness in combat operations will be
displayed. 

The freeze line (if not thawed) modifies terrain
and weather conditions within the “frozen”
area. Generally, the freeze line runs horizon-
tally across the map in the hexrow shown in
the weather report. For coastal areas (any
hexes adjacent to a deep ocean hex) the
freeze line is actually five hexes north of the
hexrow shown here. In all hexes north of the
freeze line (inclusive), the temperature is
always “Cold” and all rivers are frozen. A hex
north of the freeze line is indicated by an
asterisk next to the terrain description when-
ever the terrain in a hex is reported. 

Weather forecasts are also available. A one
week (next turn) forecast is 85% accurate.
The two week (turn after next) forecast is
70% accurate, and the three week forecast is
55% accurate (slightly better than a guess). 

3.13 Supply Net Map 
This calls for a calculation and display of
current United Nations and Communist
supply nets. A theater level map (in the
same scale as the strategic overview map)
showing the current supplied and unsup-
plied areas will be displayed. 

3.14 Airfields/Ports 
This will give you a display of the current
status of all airfield and port hexes on the
map. 

3.15 Scenario Info This will give you a display of the scenario
and game control options you selected
when you began the game. 

3.16 Game Info 
This calls a small info box listing copyright
and version number information. Use this
option if you need to know which version of
the game you are playing. 

3.2 The Orders Menu 
The Orders Menu gives you access to the fol-
lowing game functions:
. Air Operations (section 3.21)
. End Player Phase (section 3.22) 

3.21 Air Operations 
In 1950, the United Nations commanders’
expectations of the effectiveness of their air
forces were wildly optimistic. There was talk
of a “great slaughter” if the Chinese were so
foolish as to attempt to cross the Yalu river.
Initially operating from Japanese bases, the
United States Far East Air Force had very
modest capabilities in the first months of
the war. In time, United Nations air power
became quite effective. As shown recently in
the Gulf War, modern air power will be
extremely effective from the first day of any
new war in Korea.

In the 1950’s scenarios, only the United
Nations player can access the Air
Operations menu item. Historically, the
Communist air forces’ only significant con-
tribution to the war was in an air superior-
ity role over Northern Korea. See rules sec-
tion 4.1. In 1995, North Korea has a very
respectable air force (although it is equipped
primarily with obsolete aircraft), and both
players will have access to the Air
Operations menu item.

Selection of Air Operations gives you access
to the Air Operations planning screen. At
screen left is a list of air units (which varies 
with time). One of these units is indicated
with a “light” on its button. Details on the
indicated unit are displayed in the Air Unit
Description box to the right of the screen.
The displayed unit may be changed by
selecting any other unit on the list. Re-select-
ing a unit will change the unit’s orders. 

Selecting the “Projections” button will give
you a display of the estimates of the effects
of your mission selections.  

The Air Unit Description shows drawings of
the most numerous aircraft types in the
selected unit. Below the drawings is a list of
unit characteristics. These characteristics
include: Air to Ground Strength, Air to Air
Strength, Long Range and All Weather
capabilities, Basing Requirements, Current
Basing, and Current orders.

Air to Ground Strength is the ability of a unit
to attack enemy forces on the ground or to
interdict enemy supply/transport routes.

Air to Air Strength is the ability of a unit to
resist enemy air force attempts to intercept
and disrupt air to ground and interdiction
attempts. If the unit has an Air Superiority
mission, the Air to Air Strength is used to
attack enemy air forces directly. Air superi-
ority missions include air-to-air combat as
well as strikes on airfields.

Air units can be based on carriers, in Japan,
or in Korea. Basing is automatically per-
formed by the program in order to maintain
maximum efficiency for your air units. Air
unit basing details are described in
Appendix F.

The Air to Ground and Air to Air strengths
may be modified by mission orders, basing,
and weather. In the 1950’s scenarios, long
range air units (composed of Invaders and
Superfortresses) will have their Air to
Ground strength halved if given a Ground
Attack mission, and their Air to Air strength
will be halved if the unit is given an Air
Superiority mission. Units without a long 
range capability will have Air to Air and Air
to Ground strengths decreased if operating
from Japanese bases. If the weather is not
“good,” all units will suffer a drop in
strengths. All weather capable units will suf-
fer a lesser drop in strengths. Weather and
basing effects on unit strengths are summa-
rized below:

3.22 End Player Phase 
You use this option to end your current
orders phase and turn control over to the
other player or to the following game
phases. 

3.3 The General Menu 
The General Menu allows access to a num-
ber of functions:

End Game: gives you an opportunity to 
end the game with a count of current 
victory levels (see section 8.0). The General
Resolutions Phase and certain menu selec-
tions are disabled, and the game is placed
in a limited two player mode for ease of
inspection of the computer player’s situa-
tion in a solitaire game. 

Quit Game: allows you to stop playing the
game and return to DOS (IBM compatibles)
or the Workbench (Amiga) in a controlled
manner.

Save Game: allows you to save the game at
the current point in game play. The game
will continue after the save is completed.

Restart Game: allows you to restart a saved
game or begin a new one without having to
exit the program.

Movement Centering: forces the program
to center the map on a force when it is
selected for movement. Ordinarily, the map
only centers on moving forces if they are
near the edge of the displayed area.

Grid: (VGA or Amiga) gives you the option
of turning the hexagonal grid map graphic
on or off.

Other options may be available on your
computer. See your Data Card. 

3.4 Map Selections 
While many game functions are accessed
through menus, the heart of the game is
force movement and force management.
You get at these functions by directly select-
ing a hex on the map.  

If you select an empty hex, you will be
informed of the terrain type in the hex. Only
tactically significant features of the terrain
will be described in the information box at
the bottom of the screen. (Ports, Communist
supply points, and airfields have no direct
effect on combat or movement.)

If you select a hex containing known enemy
forces, you will get some information on
those forces. In many cases this information
will only be force type, in others, you will be
given force names. The extent of informa-
tion is dependent on how much information
the program decides you have about any
given hex. See section 6.3 for more details.

If you select a hex containing at least one
friendly force, the program will offer you a
panel of the following options:

. Force Movement (section 3.41)
. Report (section 3.42)
. Exit (section 3.43) 

3.41 Force Movement 
If you select one of the force movement
options for one of the forces in the hex, you
will be able to move that force. Options will
vary with the location and status of the
force. Generally, you will use tactical move-
ment to move your forces across the map.
Rail, amphibious, sea, and air movement
are special cases with their own restrictions
and capabilities. If the force is eligible for
rail, sea, or air movement, you will be given
those options in addition to tactical move-
ment.

Once a unit has been selected for move-
ment, simply pick any hex adjacent to the
force and it will move into the hex (subject
to the following rules). 

3.411 TACTICAL FORCE MOVEMENT 
Each force begins each turn with a fixed
movement allowance which is dependent
upon supply status and force nationality (see
section 6.13). This is a quantification of the
ability of the force to move across the map.  

In some cases, forces may begin the turn
with a zero movement allowance. Unmoved
units with zero movement allowances may
be ordered to bug out. This will give the
force a movement allowance of 6 move-
ment points for the turn. The units in the
force will however suffer the ill effects of
bugging out (see section 5.22).

Different types of terrain have different
entry costs. In some cases, additional costs
apply to enter a hex. All entry costs are
cumulative. In order to enter a hex, a force
must have sufficient remaining movement
allowance to “pay” the entry cost for the
hex the force wishes to enter. Forces may
not enter a hex unless they have enough
remaining movement allowance to pay all
costs associated with the move. As forces are
moved, their remaining movement
allowance is displayed (along with the
force’s current lethality and survivability) in
the force information box at the bottom of
the screen. 

Units may continue to be moved as long as
they still have remaining movement
allowance. You need not complete all of a
force’s movement in a single operation
(Exception: See sections 3.41207, 3.41208,
and 3.41209). As long as a force has some
remaining movement allowance, you may
return to it and continue its movement,
even after exiting from movement and
returning back to the map.

For each movement point expended during
force movement, the readiness of the mov-
ing force declines by 1%.

If your force moves next to an enemy con-
trolled hex during movement (except for
airborne and seaborne movement), that
hex will be spotted to level 1 (see section 6.3
for intelligence gathering rules).

During movement, you can center the dis-
played map area on the moving force by
selecting the “Center Force” button at the 
bottom right of the screen. If you are using
a mouse, the scroll buttons at screen right
may be used to scroll the screen without
moving the unit.

If you make a mistake and move a force to
the wrong hex, you can usually take back
the move by selecting the “Move back” but-
ton at the bottom right of the screen. “Move
back” will not work if: 
. Your force has not yet moved 
. You attempted to enter an enemy con-
  trolled hex.
. Your force is moving by air or sea.
. The hex entered was adjacent to enemy
  controlled territory which is not spotted
  to at least level 1 (see section 6.3). The
  enemy controlled territory need not be
  occupied in order to block your move
  back. This rule is necessary to prevent
  the abuses of the intelligence gathering
  rules, and will not be in effect if you are
  playing with complete intelligence. 

3.412 SPECIAL CASES OF FORCE MOVEMENT 

There are several special cases of move-
ment:

Tactical movement:
. Road Movement (section 3.41201)
. Disengagement (section 3.41202)
. Assault Deployment (section 3.41203)
. Cross River Movement (section 3.41204)
. Congestion (section 3.41205)
. Enemy Controlled Hexes (section
  3.41206)
Special movement:
. Seaborne Movement (section 3.41207)
. Rail Movement (section 3.41208) 
. Airborne Movement (section 3.41209)
. Amphibious Movement (section
  3.41210) 

3.41201 ROAD MOVEMENT 
Regardless of other terrain in a hex, if a
force enters a hex along a road, movement
costs will generally be lower than if the
same kind of terrain were entered normally.
In order to be considered to have entered
along a road, a force must exit its old hex
and enter the new one through hex sides
with roads running through them. 

Roads are ignored and movement costs are
determined by other terrain in the hex on
turns when massive numbers of refugees are
on the move. See section 6.8.

In the 1950’s scenarios, roads are ignored in
all hexes during any storm turn.  

3.41202 DISENGAGEMENT 
In order to leave a hex adjacent to an
enemy force, an additional cost of 4 move-
ment points must be paid by the moving
force. In the Tomorrow’s War scenario,
North Korean Commando units do not have
to pay the disengagement cost if they are
operating independently (not assigned to a
force with another unit). 

3.41203 ASSAULT DEPLOYMENT 

When you try to move one of your forces
into a hex containing enemy forces, one of
three things will happen.

If the enemy forces are very weak and your
force has at least 6 movement points remain-
ing, there is a 50% chance that your force
will overrun the enemy hex. The enemy
forces will be destroyed and your force will
advance into the hex. If you are moving dur-
ing your Second Orders Phase and the hex is
not overrun, your force’s movement
allowance will be set to zero (with no loss of
readiness). Details of the overrun calculations
are given in Appendix F.

If the enemy hex is not overrun and your
force has less than 6 movement points left 
in its movement allowance the move will
not be allowed by the program. 

Otherwise, the movement for your force will
end in your force’s current hex, one move-
ment point will be subtracted from its move-
ment allowance, and an assault order will
be plotted. Your force will assault and
attempt to take the hex from enemy forces
during the Ground Combat Phase (section
4.2). The assault order may be cancelled at
any time by selecting the force again for
movement. Any unused movement points
will still be available for use by the force. As
long as the force has an assault order, any
selection of the hex the force occupies will
show an arrow from your force into the hex
to be assaulted, as well as a short directional
indicator in the force information box
(Example: If the movement allowance of
your force is given as 10SW, the program is
telling you that your force has 10 move-
ment points remaining for the turn, and it
will assault the hex to its southwest.) 

3.41204 CROSS RIVER MOVEMENT 
A bridged river hex is any friendly river hex
in which the river is crossed by a road or
railroad. An unbridged river is any other
non-frozen river hex. 

Movement costs to enter bridged river hexes
are lower than for unbridged river hexes.

Rivers are ignored north of the freeze line. A
hex north of the freeze line is indicated by a
snowflake graphic on the map and an
asterisk (*) whenever the terrain is described
at the bottom of the screen. 

3.41205 CONGESTION 
When different forces try to use the same
transport routes through an area, traffic jams
usually result. In game terms, this means
that entering a hex which already contains
a friendly force costs an extra 1 movement
point above the normal cost of the terrain.

Additionally, except for purposes of moving
through a hex during airborne, seaborne, or 
rail movement, a maximum of two forces
may occupy a hex at any given time. This is
called force “stacking.” In all cases, only two
forces may remain in a hex after all move-
ments have been completed. 

3.41206 ENEMY CONTROLLED HEXES 
(MOVING INTO ENEMY TERRITORY) 

Even under the best of conditions, forces will
proceed with caution when entering enemy
territory. In game terms, this is reflected by
an extra 1 point cost above the normal cost
of the terrain in the hex to enter an enemy
controlled hex. 

3.41207 SEABORNE MOVEMENT 
Only the United Nations player may use
seaborne movement. Seaborne movement
can be used to move forces from any coastal
hex (a coastal hex is any non-estuary hex
adjacent to a deep ocean hex) to any other
coastal hex. Once seaborne movement is
selected, the force will be represented on the
map by a ship icon. A force may only use
seaborne movement if it has not moved pre-
viously during the turn. If a force can be
moved by sea, the program will offer you
the option of selecting sea movement. Forces
can move an unlimited distance by sea, but
only a limited number of forces may use
seaborne movement on any given turn. In
the 1950’s scenarios, up to 4 sealift demand
points may be spent on each turn according
to the following schedule: 

SEALIFT DEMAND TABLE 
                                          SEALIFT
OPERATION                                 DEMAND 

Begin movement from port hex              2 points
Begin movement from non port (land) hex   3 points
Begin movement from deep ocean hex        0 points
End movement at port hex                 -1 point 

In order to begin sea movement, at least 2
or 3 sealift demand points (see above) must
still be available for the turn.

Notice that ending movement at a port hex
returns one point of sealift demand to the
available amount. The least expensive form 
of seaborne movement is from one port to
another. This would cost one (2-1=1) point.
Four forces per turn could be moved in this
fashion. In order to qualify as a port hex,
the port in the hex must be free of mines
(see section 6.7). 

A mined port hex may not be entered by
seaborne movement.

Except for the beginning and ending hexes,
only deep ocean hexes may be entered by
forces using seaborne movement. If you are
using a mouse, any deep ocean hex on the
map may be selected; deep sea hexes need
not be adjacent for selection as in other
cases of movement. You can move the force
all the way across the map without entering
the hexes in between. Additionally, if you
select the “Choose Waypoint” option at the
bottom of the screen during seaborne move-
ment, you may pick one of three fixed
points for rapid movement of the force. One
of these points is in the Yellow Sea near
Inchon. Another waypoint is in the Sea of
Japan near Hamhumg/Hungnam. The third
waypoint is in the Korea strait, near Pusan.
Once you select a waypoint hex, the force
will move directly to that waypoint. If you
select a land hex, it must be adjacent to the
force. This will be the ending hex of the
seaborne move. 

If a force begins seaborne movement from a
non-port land hex, one which is not marked
by an anchor symbol, the force will suffer
losses. These losses are identical to Bug-Out
losses as described in section 5.2.

If the ending hex of a seaborne move is
occupied by enemy forces, the seaborne
force will remain in the deep ocean hex
adjacent to the enemy occupied hex until
the Combat Phase, when a normal combat
will occur. The consequences of combat are
described in section 4.253. 

Seaborne movement may not be used on
Storm weather turns. Moving forces by sea
will interfere with movement of supplies to
front line forces. See section 6.1.

After sea movement, the force will have its
movement allowance for the turn reduced
to zero and no further movement will be
allowed. Seaborne movement does not cost
readiness points as does normal movement.

Although it is possible to move as many as
four forces per turn by seaborne movement
(in the 1950’s scenarios), only two forces per
turn may be given orders to assault from
the sea.  

Due to excessive demands on available sea
transport in the Tomorrow’s War scenario,
only one independently operating (not
assigned to a force with any other unit)
USMC unit may use seaborne movement on
any given turn in that scenario.

Under certain rare circumstances, it is possi-
ble for a force to begin a turn at sea. If this
happens, the unit may use seaborne move-
ment even on storm turns. This move will
count towards the maximum sea move lim-
its for the scenario. 

3.41208 RAIL MOVEMENT 
Each side has a limited ability to move
forces by rail. Up to five forces per side may
be moved by rail. Any force beginning its
turn on a rail hex and connected to at least
one other friendly rail hex may use rail
movement to move an unlimited number of
hexes along the rails. The program will offer
you the option of rail movement if it is
available for a force. Only friendly rail
hexes may be entered. Forces using rail
movement may not enter hexes adjacent to
enemy forces. Normal stacking limits are
suspended during rail movement, but will
be enforced by the program in the final rail
move hex.  

Moving forces by rail will interfere with
movement of supplies to front line forces.
See section 6.1.

Communist forces moving by rail are sub-
ject to attack by United Nations air units
performing interdiction missions. When the
force is first entrained, there is a (UN inter-
diction level)% chance that the force will
suffer a 20% to 90% equipment loss.

After rail movement, the force will have its
movement allowance for the turn set to zero
and no further movement will be allowed.
Rail movement does not cost readiness
points as does normal movement. 

3.41209 AIRBORNE MOVEMENT 
This is available in the 1950’s scenarios
only. None of the units committed to Korea
in the Tomorrow’s War scenario have an
airborne movement capability.

In the 1950’s scenarios, the United Nations
has one unit which is capable of airborne
movement. The 187th RCT may use air-
borne movement on any non storm turn on
which it begins in an airfield hex. If you can
move the unit by air, the program will offer
you the option of air movement. Airborne
movement is unlimited. Normal stacking
limits are suspended during airborne move-
ment, but will be enforced by the program
in the final (drop) hex. Any land hex may
be selected as the final hex of movement.

If the ending hex of the move is not a
friendly airbase hex, the unit will suffer
losses at the end of an airborne move
according to the following schedule: 

AIRBORNE MOVEMENT LOSS RATIOS 
ACTION                         LOSS RATIO 

Drop on open or urban terrain  5%
Drop on rough terrain          10%
Drop on mountain terrain       25%
Drop on Cloudy weather turn    +5%
Drop in the MiG Alley area     +Communist
                               Interception Level % 

This loss ratio is the percentage of equip-
ment which will be lost during the drop. The
Communist Interception Level is calculated
during the Combat Phase (see section 4.1).
It is best to allocate a significant number of
air units to air superiority missions on any
turn in which you wish to drop the 187th in
MiG Alley (see section 4.1).

If the hex selected for the end of movement
is occupied by enemy forces, the 187th must
fight and take the hex or die trying. This
will occur immediately. Only if the enemy
force occupying the hex is eliminated will
the 187th survive to take the hex. This will
only occur if the enemy force is VERY weak.
If you drop the 187th into an enemy occu-
pied hex, you will most likely lose the unit.

Moving the 187th by air will interfere with
movement of supplies to front line forces.
See section 6.1.

After airborne movement, the unit will have
its movement allowance for the turn set to
zero and no further movement will be
allowed. Airborne movement does not cost
readiness points as does normal movement. 

3.41210 AMPHIBIOUS MOVEMENT 
United States Marine infantry units have a
limited organic capacity for amphibious
movement. Under certain circumstances, a
USMC unit may move across estuary and
reservoir hexes:
. The unit must be an infantry regiment
  or RCT.
. The unit must have no other units
  attached to it.
. The unit must begin the turn adjacent
  to the reservoir or estuary hex.
. The unit must have its full movement
  allowance of 24 points available.
  
A qualifying unit may enter the
estuary/reservoir hex at no cost. The unit
must then be moved off the hex to any
other hex that it could normally enter. The 
unit may not end its movement in an estu-
ary/reservoir hex.

No other units may enter an estuary or
reservoir hex under any circumstances. 

3.413 MOVEMENT COSTS

3.42 Report 
If you select the “Report” option you will see
a detailed report on the hex currently high-
lighted by the map cursor.

The report gives information on the physi-
cal characteristics of the hex, and detailed
organization of any military forces in the
hex. The combat effects of the hex terrain
are listed at the top of the screen. Forces are
described in terms of the units assigned to
the force. If a force contains more than one
unit, the readiness shown for the force is the
average readiness of units assigned to the
force. Each unit in a force is in turn
described in terms of the equipment
assigned to the unit and its supply status
during the last general resolutions phase. A
force’s total strengths are a function of the 
sum of the strengths of all equipment
assigned to the force. If a unit is indicated to
be “entrenched,” it will be eligible to receive
the prepared defensive position advantage
(section 4.23) if attacked. See Appendix F for
details and examples. 

Several options are available on this screen:
. +hex (section 3.421)
. -hex (section 3.421)
. Exit to map (section 3.421)
. Transfer Unit (section 3.422)
. Rename Force (section 3.423) 

3.421 MISCELLANEOUS HEX REPORT SELECTIONS 

The +hex option will examine the next
friendly occupied hex. If you exit from the
Full Hex Report after selecting a new hex, the
map will re-center on the new hex. The next
hex is selected by looking for the hex with
the next highest x,y coordinates (compared
with the coordinates of the current hex).

The -hex option is similar, but operates in
the other x,y direction.

The Exit to map option will send you back
to the main game map. You can also do
this by hitting either the <Escape> key (IBM
only) or the right mouse button. 

3.422 FORCE TO FORCE UNIT TRANSFERS 

Units may be freely transferred from one
force to another in the same hex. If only one
force is present in a hex, a new one will be
created if you transfer a unit out of the exist-
ing force in the hex. There are no penalties
for transferring units from force to force; how-
ever, when a unit is transferred, the receiving
force will have its movement allowance lim-
ited to that of the transferred unit.  

There are a few limitations on unit transfers:

. No more than six units are allowed in
  any force.
. No more than four units in any force
  are allowed to be infantry units.
. ROK units may not be transferred into
  US/USMC/CW/UN forces.
. US/USMC/CW/UN units may not be
  transferred into ROK forces.
. CPLA units may not be transferred into
  NKPA forces.
. NKPA units may not be transferred into
  CPLA forces. 
. The US TF Smith unit is a temporary Ad
  Hoc unit and will disband permanently
  if it is ever transferred to another force
  containing a U.S. infantry unit. The
  equipment which makes up TF Smith
  will be transferred to an infantry unit in
  the receiving force.
. No unit may be transferred into the TF
  Smith force.
. In order to transfer into a force which
  has plotted an attack, the transferring
  unit must have at least 6 movement
  points remaining. 

3.423 RENAMING FORCES 

You may rename any force which contains
more than one unit by selecting the
“Rename” button for that force. 

3.43 Exit 
Selecting this button will exit from the force
movement/report panel. 

4.0 COMBAT RESOLUTIONS PHASE

4.1 Airstrikes, Interdiction,
and Air Superiority 

Air power has a powerful influence on the
game. Since the air situation has changed
dramatically over the last forty years, there
are a couple of significant rules differences
between the 1950’s scenarios and the 1995
(Tomorrow’s War) scenario.

In the Tomorrow’s War scenario, the North
Koreans have a small but capable air force,
operating from hardened North Korean
bases. This is not true in the 1950’s scenarios.

In the original Korean War, air unit losses
were generally temporary. New equipment
and aircrews were shipped into the theater
to replace losses, and personnel finishing
tours were rotated out of theater so that unit
strengths remained fairly constant. In the
Tomorrow’s War scenario, no significant
replacements will be available. Losses in air
unit strengths will be permanent. 

Air superiority and interdiction work differ-
ently in the 1950’s and Tomorrow’s War sce-
narios. Read section 4.11 if you intend to
play the historical Korean war scenarios.
Read section 4.12 if you plan to play the
hypothetical modern scenario. 

4.11 Air Superiority and
Interdiction: 1950’s 

This section describes air superiority, and
interdiction rules for all scenarios other than
Tomorrow’s War. If you are playing the
Tomorrow’s War scenario, skip to section
4.12 below.

On the 25-June-1950 turn, the United
Nations air force is automatically allocated
to destroying the North Korean air force. For
the remainder of the war, Communist air
forces will operate from bases in China and
the Soviet Union. 

Communist air forces are represented
abstractly as a Communist Interception
Level (CIL). The CIL acts to decrease the
effectiveness of all United Nations
Interdiction missions and those Ground
Attack missions in MiG Alley (see below).
Additionally, the CIL influences losses to
United Nations airborne operations in MiG
Alley. United Nations air units assigned air
superiority missions will engage the
Communist air forces in an attempt to lower
the Communist Interception Level. Each
turn (beginning with 1-September-1950),
the CIL is increased by 10 (from 1-
September-1950 to 22-December-1950) or 15
(from 1-January-1951 to the end of the
game) to a maximum of 200. Then the CIL
will be decreased by (Total United Nations
air units Air to Air strength/5). Thus, if the
United Nations player allocates a total of 40
points worth of Air to Air strength to air
superiority missions, the CIL will increase by
two (10-40/5=2). The CIL is not affected by
weather. 

MiG Alley is the area of the map north of
hexrow 26 (inclusive) and west of hex col-
umn 14 (inclusive). MiG Alley hexes are indi-
cated on the map with a small jet graphic in
the lower left corner of the hex. The CIL is
ZERO for airstrikes outside of MiG Alley.

The Effective Air to Ground strength for
each United Nations air unit is equal to
(unit Air to Ground strength - CIL + unit Air
to Air). If the unit’s Air to Air strength is
greater than the CIL then the Effective Air to
Ground Strength is equal to the units actual
Air to Ground Strength as displayed on the
Air Operations Screen. This Effective Air to
Ground strength is used in all air to ground
and interdiction calculations.

After the CIL for the turn has been deter-
mined, the effects of U.N. air units interdic-
tion missions are calculated. The United
Nations Interdiction Level (UNIL) is equal to
the sum of all United Nations air unit 

Effective Air to Ground strengths assigned to
Interdiction missions, divided by 10. The
UNIL has two effects. The Communist supply
stockpile will be lowered immediately by a
random number from 0 to the UNIL. (So, for
example, the Communist stockpile may
drop as much as 20 points if the UNIL is 20.)
Additionally, the UNIL affects resupply of
individual Communist units later in the turn
(section 6.11), especially in Southern Korea.

The most recent CIL and UNIL figures are
displayed in the Strategic Report (section
3.11). 

4.12 Air Superiority and
Interdiction: 1995 

This section describes air superiority and
interdiction rules for the Tomorrow’s War
scenario. If you are playing one of the
1950’s scenarios, skip this rules section.

United Nations and North Korean air force
units assigned to air superiority missions
will attempt to neutralize the enemy air
force. For each side, an air superiority
strength is calculated. This is the sum of all
air to air strengths for units with air superi-
ority missions plus twenty percent of the
sum of all air to air strengths for air units
with other missions. These total strengths
are compared and a loss percentage is cal-
culated for each side. All air units will suffer
losses equal to this loss percentage. See
Appendix F for details of the calculation.

After losses are inflicted on all air units, the
effects of interdiction missions are calcu-
lated. Each player’s Interdiction Level (IL) is
equal to the sum of all friendly air unit Air
to Ground strengths assigned to Interdiction
missions, divided by 10. The IL has two
effects. The enemy supply stockpile will be 
lowered immediately by a random number
from 0 to the IL. (So, for example, the
Communist stockpile may drop as much as
20 points if the United Nations IL is 20.)
Additionally, the IL affects resupply of indi-
vidual enemy units later in the turn (section
6.11).

The most recent Communist and United
Nations Interdiction Level figures are dis-
played in the Strategic Report (section 3.11). 

4.13 Airstrikes 
Finally, each player will execute any avail-
able airstrikes. Each air unit with a ground
attack mission will launch one airstrike. To
pick a strike hex, you simply select any
enemy hex on the map. The strategic
overview function can be used to zoom in
on any section of the map. You may select
an apparently empty hex if you like. If
enemy forces are found there they will be
spotted and attacked. (Exception: CPLA
forces not previously spotted by other means
will not be spotted by airstrikes until at least
six turns after the first CPLA unit enters
Korea.) Airstrikes destroy equipment and
supplies in the target hex. Each piece of
equipment in any unit in the hex will have
to survive a loss check or be destroyed. The
lethality of the airstrike (shown below the
map) is equal to the air unit’s Effective Air
to Ground strength. In a rough, mountain,
or urban hex, the strike lethality will be
multiplied by 0.75. Additionally, airstrikes
will be multiplied by 0.75 if the units in the
hex are in prepared defensive positions (see
section 4.23). These two multipliers are
cumulative.

1950’s only: Due to exceptionally efficient
communications between USMC units and
Marine or Naval air units, airstrike lethali-
ties of Naval and Marine air units will be
multiplied by 1.5 if the strike hex is adjacent
to any force containing a USMC infantry
unit.  

The chance that any piece of equipment in a
target force will be destroyed by the strike is:

strike lethality% * (15-equipment surviv-
ability)/10. 

This means infantry will tend to be more
survivable in airstrikes than artillery and
tanks. (See Appendix B for equipment
descriptions.) Additionally, force readiness
will decrease by a percentage equal to half
of the strike lethality. Force readiness will
not be lowered below 50% by airstrikes.

After each strike, estimated strike results will
be given. These reports may be exaggerated.
An explosion graphic in the target hex will
give another indication of target damage,
with from one (light damage: less than 9%
loss of strength) to three (heavy damage:
more than 20% loss of strength) explosions
in the target hex.

In the Tomorrow’s War scenario, there is a
chance that the striking air unit will suffer
losses from enemy anti-aircraft fire. This
chance is equal to (the total number of
enemy units in the hex/10). If suffering
losses, the air unit will lose one point each
of air to ground and air to air strength. 

4.2 Ground Combat  
All assault orders issued during the players’
First Orders Phases are executed in random
order with one side moving all of its forces
before the other side’s forces are moved.

If an assault is plotted against a hex which
has become vacant since the order was issued,
the assaulting forces will occupy the hex in a
normal (non-combat) move. If an assault is
plotted against a hex which still contains an
enemy force, then combat will occur.
Defending forces will receive terrain and (pos-
sibly) prepared position strength modifiers.
Within each hex, combat will take place and
players will be notified of the results before
combat moves on to the next hex. 

4.21.Ground Combat Force
Strength Modifiers 

The lethalities and survivabilities of forces
are based upon the sum of equipment
lethalities and survivabilities for all equip-
ment assigned to all units in the forces. To
find the effective strengths for the units,
individual unit strengths are multiplied by
unit readiness % and then modified by the
unit’s experience level. “Seasoned” units will
have their strengths increased by 25% and
“Veteran” units will have their strengths
increased by 50%. See Appendix F for
details on unit strength calculations. 

4.22 Competence and 
Command Control 

Rather than cooperating fully, forces from
different armies will launch separate
assaults. Friendly heavy artillery units will
support all attacks and defenses within two
hexes, regardless of the nationality of the
allied forces involved.

For command control purposes, the four fol-
lowing separate armies are defined:

. NKPA: North Korean People’s Army
  (Communist)
. CPLA: Chinese People’s Liberation Army
  (Communist)
. ROK: Republic of Korea (United Nations)
. Non-ROK (United Nations): The follow-
  ing four nationalities are treated as one
  army for command control purposes:
   US: United States
   USMC: United States Marine Corps 
   CW: British Commonwealth 
   UN: Miscellaneous  

Communist forces will have their lethalities
and survivabilities modified according to
the following table: 

COMMUNIST COMPETENCE  
STRENGTH MODIFIERS 

Pushover             0.8
Moderate             0.9
Challenging          1.0
Hairy                1.1
Hideous              1.2 

Communist commando units (Tomorrow’s
War) will have their lethalities increased
(when attacking) according to the following
schedule: 

COMMUNIST COMMANDO  
ATTACK LETHALITIES 

First Turn           4 * normal lethality
Second Turn          3 * normal lethality
Third Turn           2 * normal lethality 

4.23 Prepared Defensive Positions 

Units described as “entrenched” will 
benefit from a prepared defensive position
advantage.
When a unit has the time and energy to
prepare for the defense of a position, it can
put up a much better fight than otherwise.
A prepared defensive position is not just a
matter of a few trenches. Elements of a suc-
cessful defense include prepositioned sup-
plies, useful local reserves, and thorough
planning. All the trenches in the world
won’t keep the enemy out of your positions
if your troops are out of ammo and your
vehicles are out of fuel.

Any defending units which began the turn
with a readiness of at least 75 and did not
expend any of their movement points dur-
ing the turn are considered to be in a pre-
pared defensive position (entrenched) and
will receive a defensive advantage. Units
entering the game as reinforcements will
not be entrenched on their turn of entry.
Lethalities of units defending prepared posi-
tions will be multiplied by 1.65. 

Survivabilities of units defending prepared
positions will be multiplied by 2.5. It is pos-
sible for some units in a force to be
entrenched while others are not. 

4.24 Terrain Effects on Equipment
Combat Strengths 

The defending forces will receive modifiers
to survivability from some types of terrain.
Individual pieces of equipment are affected
differently. Equipment is defined as hard or
soft in Appendix B. 

Terrain          Soft Modifier    Hard Modifier 

Open             1.0              1.0
Mountain         2.0              0.5
Rough            2.0              1.0
Urban            3.0              2.0 

The only terrain which affects force lethality
is river terrain. Forces attacking from non-
frozen river terrain have their lethality
halved. Artillery and North Korean
Commando units do not suffer the river
drop in lethality. Terrain effects are cumula-
tive with the prepared defensive position
modifier. 

4.25 Combat Resolution 
All lethalities will be summed for all forces
involved in combat for the hex. Any
friendly Heavy artillery units (identified by
the heavy artillery icon) within 2 hexes will
also contribute their artillery lethalities to
the combat. All other artillery units act as
normal ground units.

In the 1950’s scenarios, United Nations
forces attacking or defending hexes adja-
cent to deep ocean hexes or attacking from
a seaborne move will receive naval gunfire
support: 

NAVAL GUNFIRE SUPPORT 

Prior to 1-August-1950                0
1-August-1950 to 22-August-1950       50
1-September-1950 to 22-November-1950  100
1-December-1950 to 22-May-1951        125 

Naval gunfire support is halved on storm
turns. 

The lethality sums are compared to the
sums of survivabilities for all forces involved
in the combat to generate a “loss ratio” for
each side. (For further details of the calcula-
tion see Appendix F.) This is the percentage
of equipment which will be lost in the com-
bat. The loss ratio is also subtracted from
the readiness of each unit involved in the
combat. Attacking units will suffer an addi-
tional 5 point readiness loss. During hot
weather or storms, all units directly involved
in the combat will suffer an additional 5
point readiness loss.

Friendly artillery firing from hexes not
directly involved in the combat will suffer a
4 point loss of readiness (per combat) but
will take no equipment losses. 

4.251 EQUIPMENT LOSSES AND UNIT 
EXPERIENCE 

The loss ratio is the percentage of equipment
which will be lost by each force involved in
the combat. Additionally, “green” units
have a loss ratio % chance of suffering bug
out losses if retreating (see section 5.22).

If a unit’s survivability is reduced to less than
1 during combat, the unit will be removed
from the map. Half of the equipment
remaining in the unit after combat will be
placed in the appropriate replacement pool.
The unit will re-appear behind friendly lines
after sufficient stockpiles of replacement
equipment are built up to re-equip the unit.
See section 6.21 for details on replacements.

If a “green” or “seasoned” unit survives a
combat and does not retreat, there is a 50%
chance that its experience level will increase
to “seasoned” or “veteran.” 

4.252 RETREATS AFTER COMBAT 

After combat, defending forces are checked
to see if they will retreat. The chance for
retreat is equal to 2 * the defender loss ratio
incurred during combat. (Exception: Forces
containing green units have a 20% higher
chance of retreating after combat than 
other forces.) Retreats will be into random
available hexes. 

United Nations forces can only retreat into
friendly controlled hexes containing fewer
than two forces. They may not retreat into
enemy controlled hexes, even if they are
empty. The mere presence of an enemy
force adjacent to a hex will not prevent
retreat into that hex. If possible, United
Nations forces will generally retreat in a
southerly direction. 

Communist forces can retreat into any hex
which does not contain United Nations
forces or more than one Communist force.
They will retreat into a friendly controlled
hex if possible. If possible, Communist
forces will generally retreat in a northerly
direction.

Units with “green” experience levels may
bug out rather than merely retreating. The
chance for this is equal to the defender loss
ratio. The effects of bugging out are
described in section 5.22. It is possible for
some units in a force to bug out while others
retreat normally. If any unit in a force bugs
out, the force will be described as having
bugged out in the after combat report. This
only means that at least one unit in the
force has bugged out.

Units will not retreat into reservoir,
unbridged, unfrozen river hexes, river/estu-
ary hexes, or deep ocean hexes. If a force
can’t retreat for any reason, the force will
remain in the hex, but will be subjected to a
second round of equipment survival checks
and readiness loss, using the combat
defender loss ratio (usually nasty). 

4.253 SEABORNE ASSAULTS 
(INVASIONS) 

Combat is resolved normally. If the defend-
ing force is destroyed or retreated, the attack-
ing forces will advance into the hex. If the
defending force does not retreat, the attack-
ing forces suffer losses as in a bug out (see
section 5.2) and will be relocated to Japan. 

5.0 SECOND ORDERS PHASE 

In order to take advantage of successful
combats (or salvage the situation after a dis-
aster), you need to be able to move your
forces after combat. It can be very helpful to
leave a few forces unmoved during the first
orders phase in order to facilitate this.

All forces which did not exhaust their move-
ment allowances during previous phases
may be moved during the Second Orders
Phase. As in the First Orders Phase, each
player will have his own orders phase. The
order of the players’ phases will vary ran-
domly from turn to turn. Supply stockpile lev-
els will influence the determination of who
moves first. Generally, the player with the
lower stockpile level will move after the player
with the higher stockpile level. (This is the
reverse of the case in the first orders phase.) 

During the second orders phase, the
player/phase indicator at the bottom left of
the screen will show “Phase: IIA” (first
player) or “Phase: IIB” (second player). 

5.1 Movement Restrictions
During the Second 
Orders Phase 

Unit movement works as in the First Orders
Phase with the following exceptions:

. No Assault Orders May be issued. If you
  attempt to move a force into an enemy
  occupied hex and that hex is not over-
  run, your force will end its movement
  immediately.
. No Airborne, Seaborne, or Rail move-
  ment is allowed.
. Green United Nations forces may be
  subject to “bugging out.” See section 5.2
  below. 

5.2 Bugging Out Both players’ forces are subject to losses as
troops panic and abandon their weapons
under stressful situations. 

5.21 Bugouts While Moving 
United Nations units with “Green” experi-
ence levels are subject to “bugging out” if:

1) The unit is moved from one hex adja-
cent to enemy forces to another hex adja-
cent to enemy forces during the Second
Orders Phase.

AND

2) The unit suffered a retreat result dur-
ing the preceding Combat Phase, and the
retreat was blocked.

The chance for this to occur is (100% - the
unit’s readiness level).
It is possible for one or more units in a force
to bug out while others move normally.  

5.22 Effects of Bugging Out 
The effects of bugging out are as follows:

1) The unit’s readiness is set to 50%
(unless already lower).

2) 100% of the unit’s equipment must
check for survival. The chance for each
piece of equipment to survive is (equipment
survivability * 7%). This will result in the
loss of much of the unit’s heavy equipment. 

6.0 THE GENERAL 
RESOLUTIONS PHASE 

After the combat phase, the program will
perform the following “bookkeeping” opera-
tions:

. Resupply Operations (section 6.1)
. Replacements and Reinforcements 
  (section 6.2)
. Intelligence Gathering (section 6.3)
. Weather Determination and Effects 
  (section 6.4)
. The 38th Parallel and CCF Intervention
  Check (section 6.5)
. Communist Guerrillas (section 6.6)
. Mine Warfare (section 6.7)
. Refugees (section 6.8)
. End Of Game Check (section 6.9)  

6.1 Resupply Operations 
As in all conflicts, the flow of supplies to the
front was complex and critical during the
Korean Conflict. Both the Communist and
United Nations transport networks were
overburdened by the demands of the war.
This problem became even more acute as
supply lines lengthened or whenever those
transport networks were called upon to
divert resources to moving troops and
equipment. This was a particularly nasty
problem for the United Nations.

During resupply operations the supply sta-
tus of each hex on the map is calculated. A
supplied hex is any hex which can trace a
line of friendly land hexes of any length to
any friendly supply source. The following
hexes will act as supply sources if friendly to
the indicated player: 

SUPPLY POINT HEXES 

Any port hex       United Nations
Any Japan hex      United Nations
0,22               Communist
2,20               Communist
7,29               Communist
9,17               Communist
14,10              Communist
29,5               Communist
33,6               Communist 

In order to act as a supply source, a port
must be free of mines (see section 6.7).

Units in supplied hexes will be checked and
readiness may be increased if less than
100%. Regardless of supply status, each unit
will have its readiness increased to at least
50%. When a unit is successfully resupplied,
there is a chance that the friendly Supply
Stockpile level will decline. This chance is:

(100-original unit readiness)%.

The exact rules for resupply differ for each
player. 

6.11 Communist Unit Resupply 

A Communist unit may be resupplied if the
unit is in a supplied hex. Generally speak-
ing, the chance for this increases with
increasing Communist stockpile level, and
decreases as the unit is further south and
with increasing United Nations Interdiction
Level (UNIL). The exact algorithm is:

chance = Communist supply stockpile
level -UNIL * (hex y coordinate) / 30%.

See section 4.1 for details on calculation of
the United Nations Interdiction Level. Note
that this means that later in the game, it is
possible for the United Nations air force to
effectively isolate the battlefield on fair
weather turns.  

If you examine the map, you will notice
that all rail traffic from North Korea to
South Korea has to pass through Seoul. The
Communist supply effort was heavily
dependent on the Korean rail net. If the
United Nations controls Seoul (hex:14,40),
the Communists will experience additional
difficulties with supplying units in South
Korea: Each unit south of hexrow 41 (inclu-
sive) which would otherwise be supplied (as
described in the previous paragraph) has a
50% chance of being unsupplied on any
given turn.

Resupply of a unit restores the unit’s readi-
ness according to the following schedule: 

COMMUNIST RESUPPLY SCHEDULE 

COMMUNIST COMPETENCE        RE-READY RATE 

Pushover                    8%
Moderate                    9%
Challenging                 10%
Hairy                       11%
Hideous                     12% 

One point is subtracted if the unit is south of
hexrow 50. If an NKPA unit is on a road
hex (on any non storm turn) or a rail hex,
the re-ready rate is doubled. The re-ready
rates for CPLA units not in urban hexes are
always doubled. If the unit (CPLA or NKPA)
is on an urban hex or supply point hex, the
re-ready rate is multiplied by three.   NKPA
units which are not successfully resupplied
will suffer a 5% decline in readiness. CPLA
units which are not resupplied will suffer no
readiness loss. Unsupplied NKPA units with
a readiness of 50% will lose 10% of all
equipment on each unsupplied turn.

Example: Assuming that Seoul is
Communist controlled, Communist com-
petence is “challenging,” the United
Nations Interdiction Level is 20, and the
Communist stockpile level is 75: an
NKPA unit in a supplied rail hex on
hexrow 52 would have a 40% chance
(75-20*52/30=40) of having 18% ((10-
1)*2) of readiness restored. 

6.12 United Nations 
Unit Resupply 

A United Nations unit may be resupplied if
the unit is in a supplied hex. The chance for
this is (United Nations supply stockpile level *
100%). The re-ready rate for United Nations
units is 10%. One point is subtracted if the
unit is north of hexrow 30. The re-ready rate
is doubled for units on roads (non storm
turns) or rail hexes and tripled for units in
urban hexes or port hexes. United Nations
units which are not successfully resupplied
will suffer a 5% decline in readiness. 

The United Nations had a limited ability to
supply units by air in Korea. If it is not a
storm weather turn, United Nations units
which would otherwise be unsupplied will
not suffer the 5% readiness decline and will
be considered supplied, although they may
not receive replacements or increase their
readiness. U.S. and U.S.M.C. units may be so
supplied beginning with the 8-July-1950
turn. All United Nations allied units may be
so supplied beginning with the 1-January-
1951 turn. Unsupplied United Nations units
with a readiness of 50% will lose 10% of all
equipment on each unsupplied turn. 

6.13 Supply Effects on 
Movement Allowances 

The movement allowance of a force for the
next turn is dependent on the force’s aver-
age readiness after resupply. While supply
status does not directly affect movement
rates for forces, it has an indirect affect
through force readiness. At the beginning of
each turn, all forces will be given a move-
ment allowance according to the following
schedule: 

NATIONAL MOVEMENT 
ALLOWANCE TABLE 

                    FORCE READINESS 

FORCE I.D.         0-50 51-74 75-100 SCENARIO 

US/USMC/CW/UN      0    12    24     (1950’s)
ROK/NKPA           0    9     18     (1950’s)
CPLA               9    9     12     (1950’s)
All units          0    12    24     (1995) 

Example: In the 1950’s, a US force with
a readiness of 75 gets a 24 movement
allowance. 

6.14 Supply Stockpiles 

Supply stockpiles represent the availability
of supplies in Korea. Each player has a sepa-
rate stockpile. In addition to drawing down
as forces are resupplied (sections 6.11, 6.12),
stockpiles are directly affected by your
actions. 

6.141 NEW SUPPLY SHIPMENTS 
1950’S 

The Communist stockpile is increased by 10
points on the first 4 turns, 11 points the next
four turns, and so on.

At hairy or hideous levels of red compe-
tence, the Communist player will receive
one extra supply stockpile point per turn.

Additionally, after a non-ROK United
Nations allied force enters North Korea the
Communist stockpile will receive an addi-
tional 10 points per turn. On the fourth turn
after a U.N. invasion of the north, the
Communists will receive an additional one
time grant of 20 points.

The United Nations stockpile increases by 2
points on the first turn, 3 points the next, 4
the next, and so on until reaching a maxi-
mum increase of 15 points per turn on the
15-October-1950 turn. 

6.142 NEW SUPPLY SHIPMENTS: 1995 

The Communist supply stockpile increases by
10 points per turn. The United Nations sup-
ply stockpile increases by 15 points per turn. 

6.143 Supply Effects of Using
Special Movement Rules 

Supplies are transported by railroad, ships,
and transport aircraft. If you use these
“transport assets” to move forces, they are 
not available to move supplies. Whenever
you use rail movement, seaborne move-
ment, airborne movement, or airborne
resupply, your stockpile will be lowered (at
the end of the turn).

. Each friendly force moved by rail will
  lower your stockpile by one point.
. Each friendly force moved by sea will
  lower your stockpile by one point.
. If you move the 187th RCT by air, your
  stockpile is lowered by one point.
. If any United Nations forces receive air-
  borne supply, the United Nations stock-
  pile is lowered by one point.
. On storm turns, the United Nations
  stockpile level is lowered by three points.
  
Since your stockpile level indirectly influ-
ences the strengths of every force you have,
you should be careful about using special 
movement rules.

Stockpile levels play a large part in deter-
mining who moves first in each orders
phase. The player with the higher stockpile
level will tend to move last during the first
orders phase and first during the second
orders phase. See Appendix F for details. 

6.2 Replacements and
Reinforcements 

Each turn, the program will replace equip-
ment losses and bring new or reconstituted
units onto the map.  

6.21 Replacement Equipment 
Each player will receive replacement equip-
ment. If any friendly units on the map have
losses (assigned equipment levels lower than
authorized equipment levels) then those
units will draw replacements from the
replacement pool. If there are not enough
replacements in the pool to replace all
losses, then replacements will be distributed 
such that units with heavier losses will
receive a proportionally larger share of
available replacement equipment. Only
units which were supplied this turn can
receive replacements. Each nationality in
the game has a separate replacement pool
which is updated as follows: 

1950’s NATIONAL LOSS 
REPLACEMENT RATES 

                  US        CW      ROK      CPLA

All replacements begin on the first turn of
the Tomorrow’s War scenario.

If after replacements are distributed to all
forces which need them there are still suffi-
cient replacements to reconstitute a previ-
ously destroyed unit, then the previously
destroyed unit will be rebuilt using replace-
ment equipment and placed on the rein-
forcement schedule for the next turn. At
least 2/3 of the authorized level of the most
numerous equipment needed by a unit must
be available in the replacement pool for the
unit to be rebuilt. Regardless of the experi-
ence of the unit when it was destroyed, it will
be rebuilt as a “green” unit.

Up to 255 pieces of unused replacement
equipment may accumulate in each cate-
gory. Due to inefficiences in supply systems,
small quantities of replacements may
remain in the force pool even though some
units are not at full strength. 

6.22 Reinforcements 

Each turn, forces may be scheduled to
appear at some location on the map. 

In some cases, forces are scheduled to
appear in specific hexes. If a force’s appear-
ance hex is not available, the force will be
held off map until the hex becomes avail-
able. In order to be available for reinforce- 
ment appearances, a hex must be friendly
controlled and occupied by fewer than two
forces. Exception: CPLA forces may appear
in enemy controlled hexes as long as those
hexes are not occupied by enemy units.

If a force does not have a specific appear-
ance hex, the program will attempt to place
the force in one of a list of general appear-
ance hexes:

. The program will attempt to place re-
  constituted US, USMC, CW, and UN
  units in Pusan (hex 26,59).
. The program will attempt to place new
  or re-constituted ROK units in any
  available South Korean urban hex.
. The program will attempt to place new
  or re-constituted NKPA units in any
  North Korean urban hex, or in any of
  the Communist supply point hexes.
. The program will attempt to place re-
  constituted CPLA units in hex 0,22.

In all of the above cases, if no entry hex is
available, the forces will be held off map
until the hex becomes available.

Air units will become available in the Air
Operations Screen on the turn of their
arrival. 

6.3 Intelligence Gathering 

6.31 Ground Patrols 

Each hex on the map is checked for change
of possession. Each force on the map will
possess a patrol radius of one hex distance
in every direction if: 

The force is in a supplied hex or has a
readiness of 75 or greater.

AND

The force has a lethality of 30 or greater.

Any hex within the patrol radius of one
player’s force and not within the patrol
radius of the other player’s forces will auto-
matically become friendly to the patrolling 
force. Exception: Urban hexes will not change
ownership unless entered by enemy forces. 

6.32 Intelligence Quality 
If playing with the Complete Intelligence
Game Control Option (see section 2.112) all
hexes are always spotted to level 2. See
explanation of spotting levels below.

Players always have complete information
on friendly hexes.

When playing with Limited Intelligence,
each enemy hex on the map is spotted to
the following levels:

. Level 0: No information is available for
  the hex. If enemy forces are in the hex,
  you won’t know about them.
. Level 1: force type information is avail-
  able for the hex.
. Level 2: force type and name informa-
  tion is available for the hex. If you are
  playing with the complete intelligence
  option, you will be given complete
  information on the hex. Otherwise: If a
  force in the hex is at less than 1/2
  strength it will be described as “under-
  strength.” There is a 1/3 chance that 
  this information will be incorrect. If a
  force is involved in ground combat, the
  information will always be correct dur-
  ing the following second orders phase. 
   
Enemy hexes adjacent to friendly forces will
be spotted to level 2.

Hexes containing heavy artillery units
which fired during the combat phase are
spotted to level 1.

Hexes containing Communist forces which
use more than 12 movement points during
the orders phase may be spotted (to level 1)
as follows: 

WEATHER     SPOTTING CHANCE 

fair        75%
cloudy      50%
storms      25% 

6.33 Special Recon Rules for 
the 1995 Scenario 

Reconnaissance has come a long way over
the last forty years. In addition to the above,
the following spotting chances apply in the
Tomorrow’s War scenario:

Each North Korean controlled hex has a
66% chance of being spotted to level 1. All
North Korean controlled road hexes are
spotted to level 1. 

United Nations controlled hexes are spotted
to level 1 according to the following schedule: 

GAME TURN     ROAD HEXES    OTHER HEXES 

First         100%          66%
Second        66%           33%
Third         33%           0%
Fourth+       0%            0% 

Due to the presumed presence of a large
network of North Korean spies in major
South Korean cities, all United Nations con-
trolled urban hexes will be spotted to level 1. 

6.34 Accumulation of 
Intelligence Reports 

If by chance a hex is twice spotted to level 1
(by different methods) the spotting level of
the hex is raised to level 2. 

6.4 Weather Determination
and Effects 

Weather conditions are updated each turn.
Forecasts are also updated to project
weather three turns in advance. Weather is
dependent upon game month: 

WEATHER DETERMINATION TABLE 

                            (VISIBILITY/

December     80% 20% 00%   70% 15% 15% 

On “Cold” turns the freeze line advances 5
hexes to the south (but at least as far south
as hexrow 21). On “Mild” turns the freeze
line retreats 4 hexes north. On “Hot” turns
the freeze line retreats 9 hexes to the north.

Weather has significant effects on air 
operations (see section 3.21), ground force
movement, and combat. A summary of
weather effects is available to players
through the weather report menu selection
(see section 3.12).

There is a weather graphic on the main
map screen. It has two components. A ther-
mometer shows the current temperature. A
sky graphic shows the current visibility/pre-
cipitation level. 

6.5 The 38th Parallel and
CCF Intervention 

This rule only applies to the 1950’s scenarios.

The greatest surprise of the Korean War was
the massive Chinese intervention in October
of 1950. United Nations commanders were
under great pressure to win the war quickly
in order to avoid political problems at
home. Historically, they chose to discount
the threat of Chinese intervention in favor
of a risky “Land Happy” strategy of over-
running North Korea. If the Chinese had
not intervened, this strategy would probably 
have brought a swift and politically satisfac-
tory end to the war. Remember this before
you criticize the United Nations deploy-
ments in the Cold Steel scenario. 

If you selected a FIXED CCF Intervention
schedule when you began the game, the
Chinese will automatically begin sending
CPLA forces into North Korea within two to
four turns of the movement of the first non
ROK United Nations allied force north of the
38th parallel. In order to trigger CCF interven-
tion, the non ROK U.N. force must be north of
the 38th parallel at the end of a turn. 

If you selected a HISTORICAL CCF
Intervention schedule when you began the
game, there is a 66% chance that the
Chinese will intervene as above. If the
Chinese do not intervene, the United
Nations player must overrun almost all of
North Korea by 8-January-1950 in order to
win the game. See section 6.9. Generally,
the United Nations player will not know
about Chinese intervention until CPLA
forces show up adjacent to U.N. forces. The
Communist player will know if the Chinese
are bluffing or intervening at the end of the
turn that the intervention selection is made.
In any case, the Chinese government will
make ominous announcements if U.N.
forces invade North Korea.

No matter what intervention schedule was
chosen at the beginning of the game, the
Chinese will only intervene if non ROK U.N.
forces enter North Korea. ROK forces may
freely enter North Korea without triggering
CPLA intervention. 

6.6 Communist Guerrillas 

This rule only applies to the 1950’s scenarios.

The United Nations had serious problems
with Guerrillas during the Korean war. To
reflect some of these difficulties, any United
Nations controlled hex has a 10% chance of
becoming Communist controlled if there is
no United Nations force within 7 hexes at 
the end of the turn (20% if also adjacent to
a Communist controlled hex). If controlled
by the United Nations player, the North
Korean cities of P’yongYang and
Hamhung/Hungnam will automatically
revert to Communist control if no United
Nations force occupies their hexes at the
end of the turn.

United Nations forces were quite effective in
controlling Communist guerrillas when they
were committed to the task. Any Communist
controlled hex adjacent to a United Nations
controlled hex, within seven hexes of a United
Nations unit, and not within seven hexes of a
Communist unit has a 50% chance of becom-
ing United Nations controlled.

Japan, port, and airfield hexes are never
affected by guerrillas. 

6.7 Mine Warfare 

In August of 1950, the Soviet Union began
supplying the North Koreans with effective
naval mines. Apparently, only a shortage of
parts kept the port of Inchon from being
mined prior to the Operation Chromite inva-
sion. Northern ports had already been mined. 

In the 1950’s scenarios, from 8-August-1950
to the end of the game, there will be a
chance that the Communists will success-
fully mine each port hex under their con-
trol. Ports south of hexrow 36 (in territory
originally controlled by South Korea) will
only be mined after the 22-September-1950
turn. The chance for successfully mining a
port is (turn+20)% on every turn. (31% on
turn 11, 32% on turn 12, etc.). In the 1995
scenario, all Communist controlled ports
will be mined automatically at the end of
each turn. Mined ports are negated as ports
for supply and movement purposes. 

If the United Nations takes control of a mined
port, it has a 50% chance of sweeping the
mines and restoring the functions of the port
on each turn. If a port is mined, its anchor
map graphic is replaced by a mine graphic. 

6.8 Refugees 

One of the more annoying problems faced
by the United Nations commanders was the
flood of refugees which would choke all
roads whenever the Communist forces
advanced. On any turn in which the
Communist player takes more than ten
hexes from the United Nations Player, takes
an urban hex, or causes more than four
United Nations forces to vacate a hex after
combat, refugees will fill the roads. On the
following turn, all roads are ignored when
calculating movement costs for United
Nations forces during both Orders Phases. 

6.9 End of Game Check 

If the United Nations controls the entire
map, or the Communists control all urban
hexes in Korea, the game will end immedi-
ately. 

6.91 Special End of Game
Conditions: 1950’s 

In late 1950, newspapers in the United
States were actually writing about “bringing
the troops home by Christmas” after mop-
ping up the last Communist resistance in
North Korea. Had the Chinese not inter-
vened on behalf of the North Koreans, this
quite likely would have been the case. To
reflect the political expectations of the
American public: if the Chinese have not
intervened and the game has not ended pre-
viously, then the game will end after the 8-
January-1950 turn.

If the war has not ended previously, it will
end after the 22-May-1951 turn. 

6.92 Special End of Game
Conditions: 1995 

If the war has not ended previously, it will
end after the 15-October-1995 turn. 

7.0 SOLITAIRE AND TWO
PLAYER PLAY 

In two player mode, the game will pause,
clear the map and display a dialog box
before beginning the next player’s phase.
This gives a break for players to exchange
places at the computer without either player
seeing information about enemy forces that
he shouldn’t see.

When a saved game is resumed, it will con-
tinue with all play selections as they were
made when the game was begun. Solitaire
games will be restarted in solitaire mode
and two player games will be restarted in
two player mode. 

8.0 SCENARIOS AND 
VICTORY CONDITIONS 

Victory conditions are simple. Victory is deter-
mined by terrain held. Urban hexes are
worth 100 points and all other hexes held are
worth one point each. Raw points are con-
verted into victory levels which are displayed
in the text box below the main map screen.

Victory levels are calculated as follows: for
each 200 point DIFFERENCE between cur-
rent holdings and territory held on 25-June-
1950 (1950’s scenarios) or the first turn of
the Tomorrow’s War scenario, one level of
victory is awarded. If the display in the
main map text box shows “U-x”, the United
Nations is winning with a victory level of x.
If the display shows “C-x”, the Communist
player is winning with a victory level of x. If
the victory level is zero (fewer than 100
hexes have changed hands) the game will
end in a draw.

If the game is allowed to continue until a
normal end, victory is awarded to the player
with the greatest victory level at the end of
the game. 

In the Tomorrow’s War scenario, each
player’s supply stockpile level will be added
to his hex count before victory levels are 
counted. Additionally, the United Nations
player will receive a handicap of one level
at the beginning of the game.

In the 1950’s scenarios: If the Chinese do
not intervene, the United Nations player
cannot win the game if the Communist con-
trols any urban hex, or more than two
Communist supply point hexes (see section
6.1). A stalemate is the best that the U.N.
player can hope for under these circum-
stances.

Since you can end the game at any time,
you may create your own shorter scenarios
by playing until a given turn and selecting
the End Game menu option. Included in the
timeline (Appendix D) is a list of actual his-
torical victory levels for each turn. You can
compare your game’s victory level with the
level listed in the timeline to determine how
you’ve done relative to actual historical per-
formance. 

8.1 The Dragon 
Wakes Scenario 

This is the full 1950-1951 campaign sce-
nario as described in the introduction to the
game. The North Korean army is poised to
attack south, and amphibious commando
operations have already “liberated” a small
area of the East coast of South Korea.

Objectives: The Communist goal is to con-
quer all of Korea. The United Nations 
player must prevent this. Initially,
Communist strength will be overwhelming.
If the North Korean onslaught can be
halted, the United Nations player must then
liberate South Korea and decide whether to
invade the North. 

If the South is liberated and the United
Nations player decides not to invade the
North, the U.N. player must request an end
to hostilities (see section 3.3, End Game).
This will result in a stalemate. 

If the United Nations player decides to invade
the North and unify Korea, he must be ready
to face possible Chinese intervention.

Should the Chinese intervene, the
Communist player once again has an
opportunity to conquer all of Korea.

Game Length: See section 6.9. Probable
game length is 45 turns. 

8.2 The Operation 
Chromite Scenario 

In September of 1950, the United Nations
was prepared to launch the Inchon invasion
(Operation Chromite) and break out of the
Pusan perimeter. North Korean forces in the
south were exhausted. The liberation of
South Korea was at hand.

Objectives: The United Nations player has
the task of pushing out of the enclave
around Pusan to crush the North Korean
army and occupy all of Korea. The North
Korean needs to delay the United Nations
for as long as possible. If the Chinese inter-
vene, Communist forces must push south as
far as possible.

Game length: See section 6.9. Probable
game length is 34 turns. 

8.3 The Cold Steel Scenario 

In November of 1950, the United Nations
forces were very close to overrunning all of
Korea. Despite a growing body of evidence,
the United Nations commanders could not
bring themselves to believe that the Chinese
would intervene. They laid their plans
accordingly and paid the price in blood.

Objectives: The United Nations player must
resist the Chinese offensive as firmly as pos-
sible. The Communist player must push
south rapidly.

Game length: See section 6.9. Probable
game length is 25 turns. 

8.4 The Tomorrow’s 
War Scenario 

North Korea has an impressive offensive
capability. If the Communists had reason to
believe that the United Nations would not
effectively support the South in the event of
a new war, they might be tempted to
attempt a re-unification of Korea. 

There have been a few significant changes
in the balance of power since the 1950’s.
The South Korean military is now a very
powerful force, supported by a robust econ-
omy. Additionally, the United States has
recently demonstrated a very impressive
ability to effectively intervene in remote
conventional conflicts. The fall of the
Communist system in the Soviet Union and
a likely lack of significant Chinese support
have forced North Korea to rely entirely
upon its own resources in any future war.
Given all of these facts, it seems likely that
the North Koreans would only attack if the
U.S. were already heavily committed else-
where. This scenario is based on that
assumption.

The North Koreans have decided to strike
quickly to destroy the South Korean military
while the U.S. is too heavily involved else-
where to intervene effectively in Korea. The
U.S. will have wrapped up its other commit-
ments within four months. Until then, only
very modest U.S. reinforcements are avail-
able. If the South Korean and U.S. forces in
South Korea are still intact, the Communist
supply system has been disrupted and terri-
torial losses have been limited after four
months, the North Koreans will inevitably
be defeated. Should the North Koreans do
enough damage to the defenders of South
Korea before effective U.S. intervention is
possible, they will at least be able to end the
current round of hostilities on their own
terms.

Special rule: The United Nations stockpile
will be lowered by 1 to 10 points due to 
North Korean special forces attacks prior to
the beginning of open hostilities. Thus the
United Nations supply stockpile will vary
from 91 to 100 at the beginning of any par-
ticular game.

Objectives: The North Koreans must push as
far into South Korea as possible. If possible,
they need to take possession of the major
urban area near Seoul. The United Nations
player needs to hang on to as much of the
south as he can while interdicting North
Korean supply lines as vigorously as possible
to prepare for offensive action once major
U.S. reinforcements become available.

Game length: See section 6.9. Probable
game length is 16 turns. 

9.0 PLAYERS NOTES 

There are a few things that you can do to
improve your chance of winning the game:

Logistics
Don’t move a force unless you absolutely
must. Find a good location for each force
and leave it there until you have a good
reason to move it. Moving a force will
deprive it of its prepared defensive position
advantage and will lower the readiness of
all units in the force. You should also be
careful to avoid excessive use of special
movement modes (rail, air, and sea). If you
find that your supply stockpile levels are too
low, its probably because you have been too
profligate with force movements. If you
launch a seaborne assault behind enemy
lines, be sure to take a port immediately. It
is dangerous to count on clearing a mined
port for supplies. Your assault will be useless
if your forces are unsupplied.

Air Power
The most effective use of U.N. air power in
all scenarios is in the interdiction mission.
This is particularly true in July to October of
1950, and the ending turns of the
Tomorrow’s War scenario. Airstrikes can be
very effective, but they should be used only 
where needed. In the Tomorrow’s War sce-
nario, both sides should place the majority
of their air units on air superiority missions
until one air force has been neutralized. The
North Korean air force can be very danger-
ous if neglected by the U.N. player.

The 38th Parallel
In the 1950 scenarios, the U.N. player’s tim-
ing in crossing the 38th parallel is critical. A
U.N. player should not cross the border with
NON ROK forces until the following condi-
tions are met:

. Seoul is controlled by the United
  Nations.
. Most or all of the North Korean army
  has been eliminated.
. The majority of the United Nations
  forces have a readiness of at least 75%.

If the U.N. jumps the gun and the Chinese
intervene, the U.N. player is in for a rough
game. This means that the North Korean
player should consider withdrawing as much
of his army as possible into North Korea once
the United Nations gains the initiative. Such
a withdrawal will place a portion of his army
out of reach of most of the United Nations
forces for a while. Unfortunately, this with-
drawal will be difficult if U.N. air power has
been used properly.

Strategic Withdrawals
If you find that the enemy seems to be
unstoppable (lots of overruns), try using
your forces in isolated, single unit strong-
points to slow him down. Concentrating
your forces in the face of a juggernaut is a
bad idea. Wear the enemy down first, then
establish a defensive line.

Combat and Unit Management
Except for the special case of a strategic
withdrawal, you should attempt to concen-
trate your units as much as possible rather
than trying to maintain a continuous line
of isolated units. This will allow you to 
inflict maximum damage on the enemy
while limiting your own losses. Avoid
attacking unless you are fairly certain that
you have a significant advantage. Bad
attacks can lead to huge losses for the
attacker. If the enemy blunders and takes
massive losses in an ill advised attack, you
should consider a counter attack on his
weakened forces. 

Grand Strategy (1950-51)
The Communist should run south at full
speed, ignoring casualties and flank secu-
rity. If you can break the United Nations
defensive line around Pusan before rein-
forcements dig in, you will win the game. If
it becomes apparent that the U.N. can’t be
broken, stop attacking immediately. Dig in
with what you have in the south and try to
form a reserve well north of the front. When
the UN begins to attack, try to slow him
down without losing too much of your
army. Prepare to defend North Korea and
pray for Chinese intervention.

The United Nations player should use the
majority of his ROK army to screen the
NKPA advance. Don’t try to form a solid
defensive line until the Commies begin to
lose steam. With careful management of
your forces, you should be able to hold on to
Taejon using ROK forces while building a
solid defensive line with U.S. units north of
Pusan. Don’t commit the U.S. army piece-
meal or they’ll be butchered (as they were
historically). Once the front has stabilized,
form divisional forces as soon as possible
and launch a few massive “sure thing”
attacks in order to give your units combat
experience. When the U.S. 7th division
becomes available, invade with maximum
strength at Inch’on and march on Seoul in
order to cut NKPA supply lines. Don’t forget
to leave a few small units behind to control
guerrillas when you move north. Cross the
38th parallel carefully. If the CPLA inter-
venes, you need to be able to form a strong
defensive line quickly. 

Grand Strategy (Tomorrow’s War)
While Communist forces will not have the
same level of early superiority as in the
1950 scenario, you can still do a massive
amount of damage in the first few turns.
Concentrate on crushing the South Korean
army and move south whenever possible.

As the United Nations commander, you
need to hold on to as much territory as pos-
sible. Move your forces north quickly and
form corps size forces. Don’t attack unless
you are certain of favorable results.
Concentrate your defensive effort near Seoul
and use your air forces to blunt the enemy
offensive. 

Both players need to be aware that artillery
is extremely important in this scenario.
Concentrate your artillery near the action
but keep it out of the front lines.

10.0 DESIGNER’S NOTES 

As the game was being tested, playtesters
frequently asked why certain design deci-
sions had been made. Many of you will
probably wonder about the same things. I’ll
tell you what I told them:

The orders of battle in the game are as com-
plete and accurate as possible. In the 1950’s
scenarios, the OOB’s are generally rock
solid. The 1950-51 campaign is very well
documented. Many units changed designa-
tions several times during the war. Others
(such as the NKPA 105 Tank Division, bro-
ken down into its constituent regiments in
the game) were merely administrative enti- 
ties. Many U.S. Field Artillery Battalions
were permanently paired with infantry regi-
ments and show up in the game only as
assets assigned to RCT’s. Unit designations
in the game were chosen with the intention
of describing the armies involved as accu-
rately as possible while avoiding hundreds
of small “independent” units and appar-
ently capricious name changes.

In “Tomorrow’s War”, the orders of battle
are a bit speculative. The U.S. information is
based partly on unit organization during
Desert Storm. The North and South Korean
OOB is based almost entirely on the latest
IISS Military Balance annual (see below).
This reference includes unit types and num-
bers and enough information to allow edu-
cated guesses on organization, but no infor-
mation on unit designations. The Korean
unit numerical designations in “Tomorrow’s
War” are entirely imaginary. A few detail
freaks have noticed that the South Koreans
don’t have any units designated 4th divi-
sion or 4th brigade. This is because the
number 4 has the same connotation for
South Koreans as the number 13 has for
Americans. The South Koreans avoided the
number 4 in unit designations in 1950-53.
Imagine a U.S. 13th division, or a 13th floor
on an older American building. Remember
Apollo 13?

Many artillery units in the 1950’s scenarios
are incapable of supporting combat at a dis-
tance. In the case of U.N. units, this reflects
the range of the guns in the unit. Some
Communist artillery units have heavy guns,
but the communications and doctrine nec-
essary for tactical flexibility are absent. In
order to support combat, the Communists
must dedicate their artillery much more
closely to individual units than the U.N.
Naval gunfire is limited to coastal hexes for
similar reasons. While a battleship’s sixteen
inch guns can fire over great distances, they
tend to be used close to the coast. 

Additionally, much of the naval gunfire
support available during the Korean war
was from much smaller guns. For most of
the war, the United Nations maintained
naval task forces off both coasts of Korea.

Coordination of forces from different armies
has always been difficult. This seems to
have been particularly true during the
Korean war. At least for the first year of the
war, the U.N. allied and R.O.K. forces fought
separate battles. This even shows up in the
way histories of the war are written. South
Korean military operations are typically
described in vague terms, with an emphasis
on their impact on United Nations opera-
tions. One odd result of this is that, when
reading these histories, it is easy to lose sight
of the fact that most of the anti-Communist
troops in Korea were Korean. The
Communists had the same difficulties.
Chinese and North Korean forces rarely
coordinated operations closely. This is partly
due to the fact that the two Communist
armies were vastly different from each
other. NKPA units were organized,
equipped, and trained along Soviet lines.
The Chinese forces were much “lighter,”
consisting of masses of infantry with rela-
tively limited support units. Even today,
allied forces tend to operate independently
rather than in concert. Desert Storm is a
good example. Even after months of close
association, Islamic and non-Islamic forces
generally did not operate together.

The unfolding of Desert Storm has raised
questions about the effectiveness of third
world military organizations in the modern
world. In “Tomorrow’s War”, it is assumed
that both of the Koreas have first class mili-
tary organizations. Everyone I know who
has direct experience with the Koreans
believes this to be true. Even if the assump-
tion were questionable, it would probably
be necessary in order to keep the modern
game scenario interesting. It is also assumed
that the massive South Korean security 
forces will keep North Korean commandos
from doing major damage to southern air-
fields and port facilities. In game terms,
North Korean small unit commando activ-
ity is limited to an attack on U.N. stockpile
levels before the game begins.

Korean geography is complicated. The
game map is of necessity somewhat simpli-
fied. Offshore islands have been ignored. In
some cases, road and rail lines have been
combined or shifted a hex one way or the
other for technical reasons having to do
with computer memory conservation.
Urban hexes represent large areas of tacti-
cally significant, solid modern buildings
rather than concentrations of population. If
you look at a generic map of Korea, you will
see quite a few cities that don’t show up on
the game map. The large increase in urban-
ization from the 1950’s scenarios to
“Tomorrow’s War” is more representative of
construction than population growth. I had
expected to see greater changes in the road
and rail nets over the last forty years than I
actually found. Other than a few small road
spurs, the nets do not appear to have
expanded. The roads and rails across the
border region have been broken, but could
quickly be repaired if the North invaded the
South. The quality of existing roads has
improved considerably. This is why road
movement in rough terrain is easier in
“Tomorrow’s War” than in the earlier sce-
narios.

Each turn in the game represents about one
week. So weather represents an average over
the period. In the case of air units, this
means that even during a stormy turn there
will be times and places where the weather
isn’t all that bad. Rather than flying into
the teeth of a storm, a unit without “all
weather” capability is actually sitting most
of the week out on the ground, waiting for 
windows of relatively good flying weather.
The week long turn is the reason why there
is no “rest” order for air units. Resting and
other “down time” is just part of a normal
weekly operations schedule for air units.
This is also why air units always find their
targets. If you order a group of 75 aircraft to
concentrate on a given area for a week,
some of the aircraft are bound to find any
targets that might be in their assigned area.
Again, the details of daily operations are
smoothed out by the game’s time scale.

In the 1950-51 campaign, the Communist
air forces were very different from their
United Nations counterparts. North Korea
began the war with a motley collection of
about 130 World War II vintage aircraft
supplied by the Soviets. In game terms, this
would be one or two weak air units. These
aircraft were never used effectively, and
were rapidly destroyed by United Nations
air power. Replacements were very limited,
and they were aggressively targeted by U.N.
air forces. After the North Korean air force
was neutralized, there was no Communist
air force until Chinese fighters began to
cross the Yalu on 1-November-1950. Except
for a few small abortive and disastrous
attempts to use their bombers, the Chinese
limited their aerial intervention to interference
with United Nations aircraft operating
in Northwest Korea. This meant that the primary
effect of the Chinese air effort was to
disrupt U.N. interdiction of the supply lines
running from China into North Korea. The
nature of this campaign was such that
while weather had some effect on the U.N.
air missions ability to find targets, it had
very little effect on the Chinese aircraft
attempting to intercept U.N. aircraft at high
altitude. Due to an aggressive U.N. air superiority
campaign, the Communist interception
efforts never really paid off. In the
game, you can see what might have happened
if the U.N. had devoted less air power
to air superiority missions. Due to the seemingly
endless supply of MiGs available to
the Chinese, a United Nations player will
probably find the Communist air force to be
a considerable thorn in his side. While the
North Korean air force is initially much
more powerful in the Tomorrow’s War scenario,
the lack of replacement equipment
will probably cause it to be much less of a
long term nuisance than in the 1950’s.
