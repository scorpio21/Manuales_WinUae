The Crinklies Revenge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The failed world dominator, mad scientist and general fruit cake,

THIS IS A JOB FOR CAPTAIN DYNAMO!!

But the world has not seen sight nor sound of him for the last
twenty five years.

Dynamo has retired to the Happyvale home for Retired Super Heroes 
(very fukkin sad!) where he grows lettuce and other assorted
salad crops.

Ousted from his bed by a phonecall from the collected world leaders;
Pres Bush, John Major, Marge Thatcher and Dave Darling (!!?! Pathetic!!),
Dynamo pledges his allegiance to the world as he sets off to retrieve the
stolen diamonds.

Go for it, GRANDADIO!!

Dynamo has been instructed to retrieve the worlds largest diamond 
collection from the booby-trapped lair of mad scienties Austen Von
Flyswatter.

The diamonds are scattered across several levels and must be collected
by running over them.

bar your way.
