CRACKDOWN PLAYERS GUIDE

After breaking through the main gate Ben and Andy now encounter the replicants
barracks.  The keen eyed gaurds are on constant watch.  The orange gaurds
are masters of kung-fu, the green gaurds are expert shots.

As Ben and Andy pass the trucks the mkung-fu masters leap out ready for
attack.  After making sure they have planted all the bombs they have but
seconds to make their way to the next level before the barracks are
totally destroyed.

Now Ben and Andy make their way through the underground caverns which lead
to the rest of Dr.K's fortress.  The green and orange gaurds are still hot on
your trail but now machine gun carrying bullet proof gaurds join in the fun.
Watch out for trap doors.

The next level is the refinery, athletic gaurds with top-of-the-range pistols
are out for blood.  Things could hot up as some carry flame throwers.  Be
careful in the water as you could drown.

The fourth level... you now eneter Dr.K's transporter room.  Be quick through
the electric doors.  On the far right the gaurds are transported across the
fortress on the huge transportation grid.

Four levels down, twelve more to go......
