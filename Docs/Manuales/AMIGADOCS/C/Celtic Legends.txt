THE LAY OF CELTIKA
------------------
MY NAME IS NIPHREDIL CELEBRIMBOR AND I AM SCLADE SINCE I WAS VERY YOUNG. I
HAVE FOLLOWED STRICT TEACHING OF THE ROYAL SCRIBES AND SUNG PRAISES OF
NUMEROUS HEROES SUCH AS ARTHUR,LANCELOT,ROBIN AND ROLAND. BUT NOW NOBLE LORDS
AND GENTLE LADIES, I HAVE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SONG TO SING YOU. TONIGHT,
THE MEAD THAT YOU HAVE GENEROUSLY PROVIDED THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE 
EVENING OPENS WIDE DOORS OF MY MEMORY. THE CRASH OF THE SNIELDS AND THE CRIES
OF BATTLE HAUNT MY SPIRIT ONCE AGAIN.YES, TOONIGHT, AS SURE AS THE NORTH WIND
BLOWS AND THE WOLVES HOWL I SHALL TELL YOU A TALE LONG FORGOTTEN BY MEN.

THE STORY TAKES PLACE IN A KINGDOM BLESSED BY THE GODS.ONLY PEACE AND HARMONY
EXISTED,AND FAIRIES AND SPRIDES LIVED SIDE BY SIDE WITH MERCHANTS AND 
PEASANTS. THIS WAS A WORLD WHERE THE UNICORN TOOK HIS PLACE BESIDE THE DRAGON,
A WORLD WHERE MAGIC WAS A NATURAL FORCE SUCH AS THE WIND OR THE RAIN. THIS
MAGIC SURROUNDS US TONIGHT. WORLD WHOSE NAME LIGHTS UP THE EYES AND INFLAMES
THE SPIRIT OF ELDERY. THIS WORLD IS `CELTIKA`. EACH PERSON CARRIES A PART OF
`CELTIKA` INSIDE HIM,A SOURCE OF OUR MYTHS.SO, SEARCH DEEPER INSIDE YOU,
SEARCH TO THE EDGE OF YOUR DREAMS, AND REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN THE WORLD WAS
YOUNGER,STRONGER...REMEMBER NOBLE LORDS.

`CELTIKA` WAS A PROSPEROUS REALM WHICH LIVED IN PEACE FOR GENERATIONS. THIS
PEACE HAD REIGNED SINCE THE `WAR OF THE SUMMITS` A BATTLE LOST BY THE MOUNTAIN
GOBLINS TO THE BIRDMEN.

THE PEOPLE OF THE REALM LIVED IN PERFECT HARMONY. FROM TIME TO TIME, A FEW
MONSTERS CAME TO DISTURB THE PEACE AND PROVIDED BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SING OF
THE HEROES EXPLOITS. CELTIKA WAS GOVERENED BY A COUNCIL FORMED OF ONE
REPRESENTIVE FROM EACH RACE,AND THE DECISIONS OF THE COUNCIL WERE RESPECTED
BY ALL BECAUSE THE RULINGS WERE GOOD AND JUST. THE EARTH IS STILL YOUNG AND 
THE TREES ARE FILLED WITH FRUIT.THE RIVERS ARE FULL OF FISHES AND THE FORESTS
RESOUNDED WITH THE CRIES OF YOUNG HUNTERS.

WITH THIS PROSPERITY AND MIXTURE OF CULTURES,CONSCIOUNESS REACHED PREVIOUSLY
UNKNOWN PERCEPTION. EACH RACE HAS ITS OWN WAY OF SEEING THINGS, AND THE WISE
MEN COMBINED THEIR VISIONS.UNDER THIS SYSTEM MAGIC BECAME AN EXACT SCIENCE.
SCHOOLS WERE FOUNDED AND AMONG THESE SCHOOLS THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS ONE IS
LOCATED IN THE CAPITAL `AVALLON`. THE MASTER OF THIS SCHOOL IS THE GREATEST
MAGICIAN IN THE COUNTRY,RATHER, HE WAS THE GREATEST MAGICIAN FOR HE RECENTLY
DIED. SINCE HIS DEATH, A DARK PERIL SHADOWS `CELTIKA`.

THE GREAT MASTER INSTRUCTED TWO EQUALLY SKILLED STUDENTS,`ESKELL` THE BLUE
AND `SOOGROM` THE SCARLET. BOTH PUPILS WERE WITH SAME THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE,
BUT THEY HAVE OPPOSITE PHILOSOPHY. ONLY SOGROM SCHEMES TO DOMINATE HIS FELLOW
MEN AND BECOME THE EQUAL OF THE GODS.

AS LONG AS THE MASTER WAS ALIVE, HE COULD CONTROL HIS TWO STUDENTS.
UNFORTUNATELY, CONFRONTATION IS NOW INEVITABLE. SOGROM PROCLAIMED HIMSELF
DEMOG(SUPREME MAGICIAN) THE COUNCIL APPOINTED ESKEL GRAND COMMANDER OF THE
ARMIES OF `CELTIKA` AND ORDERED HIM TO ELIMINATE THE USURPER. THE DEMOG ALLIED 
HIMSELF WITH THE FORCES OF EVIL AND DECIDED TO REIGN BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE.

BATTLES HAVE BEEN GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM FOR YEARS, BUT VICTORY WILL
BE DECIDED IN THE ISLANDS OF ROCHEBRUME.
THESE ISLANDS ARE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF MAGIC AND WHOSOEVER CONTROLS THEM WILL
HAVE ACCESS TO IMMEASUREABLE POWERS. DEMOG HAS TAKEN THE INITIATIVE AND ESKEL
IS GETTING READY.ONCE THERE,EACH MAGICIAN WILL BE ABLE TO TELEPORT HIS TROOPS
AND IF HE HAS THE NECESSARY POWER TO CONSTRUCT THE FORTESSES THAT HE WILL
NEED.

THE EVENING OF HIS DEPARTURE,ESKEL, IS ALONE WITH THE SEVEN SOLDIERS OF HIS
GUARD. IN HIS SACK, HE HAS SEVERAL VITAL VOLUMES THAT HE HAD FOUND IN HID
DEPARTED MASTERS LIBRARY. A MANUAL OF WAR STRATEGMS BY `GUGEL`,THE WARRIOR
KING. A BOOK OF SPELLS AND ATLAS OF ROCHEBRUM ISLANDS. ON THE STONE SLABS OF
HIS LABORATORY,HE TRACES A CIRCLE WITH POWDER OF HIS OWN CREATION AND THEN
STEPS INTO THE CIRCLE SURROUNDED BY HIS GUARDS. THIS ROOM IS SO FAMILIAR TO
HIM THAT HE SEEMS TO SEE IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. AFTER CASTING ONE LOOK AROUND,
THEN HE SAYS THE MAGIC FORMULA AND DISAPPEARS IN A CLOUD OF SMOKE WITH HIS
GUARDS.

THE PASSERS-BY HEAR A DRY EXPLOSION. THE NOISE OF THE AIR CLOSES OVER THE
VACUUM CREATED BY THE TELEPORTED BODIES.

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAIN, ON A LITTLE ISLAND IN THE ROCHEBRUM ARCHIPELAGO.
ESKEL AND HIS GROUP RE-APPEAR. THE ULTIMATE CONFRONTATION BEGINS. NOBLE LORDS,
LISTEN TO THE STANDARDS WHICH CLASH IN THE WIND, SEE THE LIMMER OF SWORDS IN
THE SUN, BREATH THE ACRID ODOUR OF FEAR WHICH FORMS HEROES. IN THE DISTANCE, 
WE CAN HEAR THE ROLL OF THE GOBLINS DRUMS AND THE LONG SAD CRY OF THE ORAQUES
BAGPIPES. THE DEMOG IS HERE AND WILL SOON PAY FOR INFAMOUS CONDUCT. HE WILL BE 
DOOMED OR CELTIKA WILL BE HIS.
ESKEL RAPIDLY CHASES THE BLACK THROUGH AWAY. WHILE ONE OF HIS MEN POINTS TO 
THE APPROACHING TROOPS. IS IT GOBLINS OR SAVAGES?. NO MATTER! YOU MUST FIGHT
FOR THAT WHICH IS DEAREST YOU...THE KINGDOM OF `CELTIKA` FOREVER THE LANDS
OF Celtic Legends....

MAGIC PLACES
------------
IN THE WORLD OF CELTIC LEGENDS,MAGIC EXISTS AS A NATURAL FORCE. THE ORIGIN OF
THIS FORCE IS IN THE CENTER OF THE PLANET. THOSE WHO KNOW HOW TO USE MAGIC
ACCESS TERRIFYING OR MARVELLOUS POWERS. THE MAGIC SCREAMS FORTH FROM SOURCES 
IN VERY	PRECISE PLACES. THERE ARE NATURAL SOURCES CALLED CROMLECHS WHICH HAVE
BEEN WORSHIPPED BY SAVAGES FOR GENERATIONS. THERE  ARE ALSO ARTIFICIAL SOURCES
CREATED BY MAN INSIDE OF FOTIFIED CASTLES.FINALLY, THERE IS ALSO A CERTAIN
QUANTITY OF MAGIC IN THE ATSMOSPHERE WHICH IS USED BY ALL MAGICIANS. THE
MAGICIANS ACT AS A SORT OF MAGIC BATTERY AND ACCUMALATE ENERGY. THEY STORE IT
IN THE FORM OF SPELLS TO USE WHEN NEEDED. THEY CAN ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THEIR COLLEAGUES MAGIC IF NECESSARY.

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CONTROL CASTLES AS IT LETS YOU GAIN MAGIC ENERGY.
MEASURED IN POINTS OF MAGIC, QUICKER AND YOU CAN CAST MORE AND STRONGER SPELLS.
WHAT IS MORE, A MAGICIANS POWER INCREASES BY TWO LEVELS OF MAGIC WHEN HE IS
NEAR THE PURER ENERGY FROM A NATURAL COURCE(CROMLECHS).

CROMLECHS
---------
THE CROMLECHS ARE THE PLACES WHICH ARE RICHEST IN MAGIC. THERE ARE NATURAL
SOURCES ARE CONSIDERED TABOO BY THE SAVAGES, WHO WORSHIP THE MAGIC WITHOUT
KNOWING IT, AND HAVE MAINTAINED THE PENTACLE SANCTURIES FOR GENERATIONS. THIS
PROLONGED CONTACT WITH THE MAGIC FORCE HAS GRADUALLY TRANSFORMED THEM:THEY 
HAVE LOST THEIR HUMAN APPEARENCE AND HAVE BECOME KOBOLDS OR FEARSOME MINOS.
MAGIC SHOULD NOT BE USED AGAINST SAVAGES.THEUY WILL ATTACK MAGICIANS AND THEIR
ALLIES FEROCIOUSLY.ONE FINAL IMPORTANT DETAIL:THE CROMLECHS ARE THE SAVAGES
ENTRY DOORS TO THE ISLANDS. IF YOU OCCUPY THEM, YOU CAN AVOID THE INRUSION
OF NEW SAVAGE LEGIONS. DONT FORGET THAT OCCUPYING THE CROMLECHS INCREASES YOUR
MAGIC LEVEL BY 2 ADDITIONAL LEVELS, AND GIVES 150 POINTS OF MAGIC PER TURN.

CASTLES
-------
THE CASTLES HAVE 2 PRIMARY FUNCTIONS. THEY ARE DEFENSIVE BUILDINGS AS WELL AS 
ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF MAGIC. AS A PLACE OF DEFENSE, THE CASTLE PRESENTS
SEVERAL ADVANTAGES.

* THE CASTLES OWNER CAN CALL UPON NEW TROOPS DURING COMBAT
.
* THE CASTLE AND ITS IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS ARE PROTECTED AGAINST MAGIC	COMING
FROM THE OUTSIDE(THE ATTACKER CANNOT USE MAGIC:HE MUST TAKE THE CASTLE USING
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT)

* THE TROOPS INSIDE THE CASTLE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE FIRST SHOT WHEN THEY
ARE ATTACKED BY EXTERIOR TROOPS.

THE CASTLES SECOND INTEREST: IT SUPPLIES 50 MAGIC POINTS TO THE OWNER PER TRUN
BUT REMEMBER THAT BUILDING A CASTLE COSTS 2000 POINTS AND CAN ONLY BE
CONSTRUCTED ON A PLAIN.

ICON. YOU CAN CANCEL A SELECTION BY PRESSING THE RIGHT MOUSEBUTTON.

SPELL CONFIDED TO THE MAGIC STUDENTS WHEN THEY LEAVE SCHOOLS. IT IS POSSIBLE
TO SHAPE  A PARCEL OF MAGIC ENERGY INTO A FIREBA;; THE SIZE OF A GRAPEFRUIT,
WHICH THE MAGICIAN DIRECTS. IT IS NOT VERY COSTLY (5 MAGIC POINTS) AND CAN
KILL A WEAKENED ADVERSARY. ITS ONLY INCONVENIENCE IS THAT IT IS STOPPED BY ANY
OBSTACLE IN ITS PART. ON TOP OF THIS, THIS SPELL DOES`NT ALWAYS WORK,SUCCESS
DEPENDS ON THE THROWERS SKILL.

[MUSCLED ARM ICON] -LEVEL 2/WEAKNESS/COST 5 MP/DIRECT-
------------------------------------------------------
AS ITS NAME INDICATES,THIS SPELL WEAKENS THE VICTIM.,DIMINISHING THE DAMAGE
THAT HE INFLICTS DURING COMBAT. ITS USEFULNESS IS EQUIVALENT TO THE CLUMSINESS
SPELL.APPLIED IN MASSIVE DOSE, THIS SPELL CAN CAUSE THE DEATH OF CREATURES 
THAT ARE ALREADY NATURALLY WEAK.

[RAISED HAND ICON] -LEVEL 3/CLUMSINESS/COST 5 MP/DIRECT-
--------------------------------------------------------
THIS SPELL IS ESPECIALLY USED BY THE MISCEVIOUS MAGICIANS WHO WANT TO LAUGH AT
THE EXPENSE OF THE TRAY BEARING INN-KEEPERS, BUT IT CAN/HAS A CERTAIN
USEFULNESS IN COMBAT.IN FACT, ANY CREATURE THAT FALLS VICTIM TO THIS
ENCHANTMENT IS SEIZED BY THE IRREPRESSIBLE TREMBLING AND HIS DEXTERITY
DIMINSHES. HIS SKILL IN COMBAT IS THEREFORE GREATLY REDUCED, WHICH CAN HAVE
FATAL CONSEQUENCES. AN UN OBSTRUCTED FROM THE MAGICIAN TO THE TARGET IS NEEDED

-----------------------------------------------------------
THIS SPELL GIVES AMNESIA TO THE TARGET; THE CREATURE FORGETS ALL THAT IT
LEARNED DURING THE PROCEEDING BATTLES. THE VICTIM LOSES A PART OF THE BENEFITS
THAT HE COULD DRAW UPON FROM HIS EXPERIENCE(GAINS IN STRENGTH,DEXTERITY AND
MAGIC LEVEL). THIS LOSS IS PERMANENT. THIS SPELL IS PARTICULARY EFFECTIVE
AGAINST MAGICIANS AND EXPERIENCED WARRIORS.

MAGIC DURING COMBAT. IF THE ONE WHO CASTS THIS SPELL FAILS, THE VICTIM LOSES A
MAGIC LEVEL ANYWAY.

SIMPLE CONTACT. ANY FRIEND OR ENEMY PASSING BY THE SICK CREATURE IS
SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONTRACTING THE VIRUS. THE OPPOSITE OF VICIOUSNESS, THIS SPELL
IS ONLY ACTIVE OUTSIDE OF TACTICAL COMBATS AND STOPS WHEN THE VICTIM HAS 1 
LIFE POINT LEFT, MAKING HIM EASY PREY. IT IS A SPELL THAT MUST BE HANDLED WITH
CAUTION SINCE IT CAN BE REFLECTED ONTO THE SPELL CASTER. HERE AGAIN, A CURE
SPELL CURES THE INFECTED CREATURE.

[MAN SURROUNDED BY DOTS ICON] -LEVEL 8/INVISIBILITY/COST 60 MP/PERSONAL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS SPELL IS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR SUBTRACTING SOME TIME FROM THE ENEMY ATTACKS.
IN FACT,THE AIMING CREATURE DISAPPEARS AND CAN NO LONGER BE ATTACKED.HOWEVER,
THE INCONVENIENCE IS THAT IT CAN NO LONGER ACT ON THE OUTSIDE.
THIS SPELL LASTS 9 TURNS THEN THE CREATURE RE-APPEARS IN THE SAME PLACE ONLY
IF ITS LEGION HAS NOT MADE A STRATEGIC MOVE IN BETWEEN AND THE HEXAGON IS NOT
OCCUPIED BY AN ALLY.A SICK,TRANSFORMED OR PARALYSED CREATURE CANNOT BE MADE
INVISIBLE.

INCREASE. NOTE: IF YOU CAST THIS SPELL ON A COLD BLOODED CREATURE OR A
BLOODLESS CREATURE, IT WILL HAVE AN INVERSE EFFECT. A CREATURE CANNOT USE THIS
SPELL WHEN IT REACHES 99 LIFE POINTS.

[LINK CHAIN ICON] -LEVEL 11/PARALYSIS/COST 100 MP/DIRECT
--------------------------------------------------------
THIS HIGH LEVEL SPELL PARALYSES COMPLETELY THE VICTIM WHICH CANNOT FIGHT,CAST
SPELL OR MOVE ANYMORE. THE VICTIM BECOMES THEN AN OBSTACLE TO THE PROGRESSION

                        THE PEOPLE OF CELTIKA
                        ---------------------
                             THE SAVAGES

THE KOBOLDS
-----------
THE KOBOLDS CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY OF THE LOCAL POPULATION. HUMANS BY ORIGIN,
THE KOBOLDS MUTATED BECAUSE OF THE CONTACT WITH MAGIC.
OVER GENERATIONS, THEY HAVE BECOME HALF-HMAN,HALF ANIMAL. WORSHIPPING MAGIC
LIKE A GOD,THEY BUILT SANCTUARIES CALLED `CROMLECHS` AND BELIEVE THAT ONE
CANNOT USE MAGIC WITHOUT BEING STAINED. FOR THEM, THE MAGICIANS AND SORCERERS
WHICH PRETEND TO MASTER THE POWERS OF THEIR GODESS,ARE EVIL INCARNATE. THEY
RUTHLESSLY ATTACK ANY CREATURE ASSOCIATED WITH MAGICIANS.

THE WOLFENS
-----------
ORIGINALLY IMPORTED WOLVES WITH HUMAN KOBOLD ANCESTORS. WOLFEN HAVE ALSO
MUTATED. THUS ADOPTED UPRIGHT POSTURE AND DEVELOPED A RUDIMENTARY FORM OF
INTELLIGENCE.ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY HAVE PRESERVED THEIR STRENGTH,ENDURANCE
AND PRIMARY HUNTING INSTINCT. THEY ARE LOYAL TO THEIR KOBOLS MASTERS. THEY 
FORM LOCAL SHOCK TROOPS, POSSESS THE BEST WEAPONS, AND CAN BE DANGEROUS, 
EVEN WHEN ISOLATED.

THE SNAKES
----------
THESE ENORMOUS REPTILES ARE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THIS AREA. THEY ARE ALSO
FOUND IN THE LOST ISLANDS, WHICH IS NOT NECESSARYILY A BAD THING SINCE THEY 
ARE ACTUALLY KILLING MACHINES. AN ADULT IS 12-15 FEET LONG AND ARMED WITH
VENOMOUS SPIKES THE SIZE OF A DAGGER.

THE MINOS
---------
MUTANTS AMONG MUTANTS, THE MINOS THAT WERE EXPOSED TO, TO MUCH MAGIC IN THE
SANCTUARIES. HALF MAN,HALF BULL. THE MINOS ARE PEACEFUL VEGATARIANS. THEY 
STAND ABOUT 9 FEET TALL AND WEIGH AROUND 5000 POUNDS. AS PEACEFUL AS NATURE IS
THEY SOMETIMES GET ANGRY. THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP WITHOUT USING MAGIC.
THEIR ONLY WEAK POINT(APART FROM THEIR LIMITED KNOWLEDGE IN MOLECULAR PHYSICS)
IS THEIR SPEED WHICH IS PROPORTIONAL TO THEIR INTELLECTUAL CAPABILITIES.
THE KOBOLDS DRUG THE MINOS FOR COMBAT BY MAKING THEM SWALLOW AN HALLUCINEGENIC
HERB CALLED `VACHFOL`.

                             DEMOGS TROOPS
                             -------------
GOBLINS
-------
THE GOBLINS ARE HUMANOID CANINE RACE. THEY ARE ABOUT 5 FEET TALL AND WEIGH
AROUND 100 POUNDS. THEY ARE WEAK AND COWARDLY, BUT SINCETHEY ARE DEDICATED TO
EVIL. THEY ARE VERY PROLIFIC AND THEIR CRUELTY IS LIMITLESS. THEY CONSTITUTE
THE MAJORITY OF THE DEMONIAC TROOPS. THEY ARE MEDIOCRE FIGHTERS BUT THEIR
NUMBERS MAKE THEM DANGEROUS FOR AN ADVERSARY THAT IS ISOLATED AND WITHOUT
MAGIC.

ORQUES
------
THIS RACE WAS CREATED BY DEMOG TO COUNTER THE APPEARENCE OF THE CHIVALROUS
ORDERS WHICH DESTROY THE GOBLINS TROOPS. ORQUES ARE LARGE HUMANOIDS WITH
IMPRESSIVE MUSCALTURE. THEY ARE ELITE SOLDIERS OF THE DEMOG AND ARE FEARLESS.
THEY LACK DISCIPLINE AND HAVE THE DISAGREEABLE HABIT OF GETTING ON THEIR
COMMANDING GOBLINS NERVE.

TROLLS
------
THESE MONSTERS HAVE ONLY ONE IDEA;EAT, AND THEY ARE NOT FUSSY. WHEN THEY GET
THEIR HANDS ON AN ENEMY, THEY BEGIN BY TENDERIZING IT WITH HEAVY BLOWS FROM
THEIR CLUBS,NOT CARING WHAT THE ENEMY DOES TO THEIR OWN LOOSE FLESH. ONCE THE
ENEMY IS COOKED(IN OTHER WORDS DEAD) THEY EAT IT ON THE SPOT. IT IS THE ONLY
TACTIC THAT THEIR TINY BRAINS HAVE DEVELOPED,BUT IT IS FATALY EFFECTIVE.

SKELETONS
---------
THEY ARE THE REST OF DEMOGS APPRENTICES WHO HAVE FAILED THEIR SUICIDE MISSIONS
THAT WERE DISCUSSED EARLIER. BEING VERY SENTIMENTAL THE DEMOG LOVES TO 
SURROUND HIMSELF WITH SKELETONS OF HIS MOST FAITHFUL STUDENTS. THE SKELETONS 
HAVE PRESERVED THEIR MAGIC AND COMBAT APTITUDES.FINALLY, THEIR FIDELITY AND 
THEIR CRITICAL LACK OF SPIRIT ENDEARS THEM TO THE DEMOG.

DRAGONS
-------
THE BREATH OF THESE MONSTERS HAS REDUCED MANY KNIGHTS TO ASHES.WITH A WINGSPAN
OF MORE THAN 18 FEET, A DRAGON CAN QUICKLY CROSS VAST DISTANCES. THE PROMISE 
OF GIVING THEM SPOILS OF GOLD PIECES PERMITTED THE DEMOG TO UNITE THESE WINGED
CREATURE. THEIR ARMOUR COUPLED WITH THEIR PHYSICAL FORCE MAKE THEM FEARSOME
WARRIORS WHO RARELY MEET FAILURE.

DEMONS
------
SYNONYMOUS WITH FEAR AND DESCLATION,EVEN THE DEMOG HIMSELF RARELY PRONOUNCES
THIS NAME.DEMONS ARE THE ABSOLUTE QUINTESSENCE OF EVIL AND THE INVOCATION OF
ONE SUCH BEING IS VERY COSTLY IN MAGIC. EQUIPPED WITH POWERS AND A `DEMONICAL`
STRENGTH, THEY DO NOT KNOW DEFEAT. THEY ONLY OBEY THE DEMOG BECAUSE OF THEIR
COMMON INTERESTS. WHEN THE DEMOG IS VICTORIOUS, THEY WILL NOT HESITATE TO ASK
FOR THEIR SHARE OF THE SPOILS(PAYABLE IN INNOCENT SOULS)

                             ESKELS TROOPS
                             -------------
SOLDIERS
--------
THE SOLDIERS ARE PRIMARILY PEASANTS ENLISTED BY FORCE(FOR THEIR OWN GOOD) AND
POORLY EQUIPPED. THEIR MORALE IS RATHER LOW AND THEY ARE MEDIOCRE FIGHTERS.
THEIR ONLY ADVANTAGE IS THEIR LOW INVOCATION PRICE, AND THEY ARE GENERALLY
EMPLOYED FRONT-LINE GUARDIANS OF FAR AWAY CASTLES AND AS `PADDING` AROUND THE
MORE HIGHLY-TRAINED TROOPS. DO NOT NEGLECT THE FACT THAT THESE MEN LEARN
QUICKLY AND THAT IF THEY SURVIVE SEVERAL COMBATS, THEY CAN BECOME VERY
POWERFUL.

LORDS
-----
THE ELITE OF THE CHIVALRY OF THE CELTIC KINGDOM IS UNITED IN THE ORDER. THEY
ARE THE SPEARHEAD OF THE CELTIC ARMY. VERY WELL EQUIPPED THEY ARE PROTECTED
BY ARMOUR PLATES AND USE THE HEAVY SWORD AND SHIELD. THEY LOOK DOWN UPON MAGIC
BELIEVING, BELIEVING IT TO BE A COWARDLY WEAPON.

MAGICIANS
---------
THESE YOUNG INTELLECTUALLS ARE ENGAGED IN THE STRUGGLE DUE TO THEIR IDEALISM.
SONS OF RICH MERCHANT FAMILIES, THEIR STUDIES IN THE GREAT MAGIC SCHOOLS HAVE
MADE THEM MORE SKILLED AT STRUGGLING AGAINST A MIGRAINE THAN A RAVENOUS
TROLL.NEVERTHELESS,THEY ARE BETTER SOLDIERS IN COMBAT BECAUSE OF THEIR
EQUIPMENT AND FANATICISM. THEIR HABIT OF STUDYING PROVES THAT THEY QUICKLY
LEARN NEW SPELLS IF THEY SURVIVE BATTLES.

CYCLOPS
-------
THE CYCLOPS HAVE A PEACEFUL NATURE. RARE ARE THOSE ENEMIES THAT ARE CRAZY
ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE CYCLOPS TRANQUILLITY. IN SPITE OF THEIR OUTWARD
APPEARENCE, THE CYCLOPS ARE POETS AND GARDNERS. THEY HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF
RESPONSIBILITY AND ARE EAGERLY ENGAGED IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FORCES OF
EVIL. SPEED IS NOT THEIR MAIN QUALITY. AS THE CYCLOPEAN PROVERB SAYS ` A BIG
SLOW PUNCH IS WORTH 2 QUICK ONES`.

ANGELS
------
THESE BIRDMEN(THAT THE PEOPLE OF CELTIKA TOOK FOR MESSENGERS OF THE GODS).LIVE
IN THE COUNTRY`S HIGH MOUNTAINS WHERE THEY STUDY MAGICAL MYSTERIES AND
MEDITATE.HOWEVER,THEIR KING IS INDEBTED TO ESKEL WHO SAVED HIM FROM A DRAGONS
CLAW`S AS HE WAS TAKEN FROM A NEST. INREGONSING THIS DEBT THE `ANGELS` LIGHT
TODAY BESIDE THE CELTS.

HYDRAS
------
THESE CREATURES NORMALLY LIVE IN THE MASRHLAND WHERE THEY FEED ON AQUATIC
PLANTS. THEY ARE THE DRAGONS ENEMIES SINCE THE HYDRAS ARE VERY PARTIAL TO
DRAGON`S EGGS AND HAVE IN THE PAST PLUNDERED MANY BROODS.

ARCH-ANGELS
-----------
THE MOST COMPLETE MYSTERY RESTS ON THE ORIGIN OF THESE FACELESS ANGELS. EVEN
THE BIRDMEN PRETEND NOT TO KNOW A THING ABOUT THE ARCH-ANGELS. THE STRANGEST
RUMOURS ABOUND THAT THEY WERE SENT BY THE GODS, A FORGOTTEN HALF PEOPLE HALF
GODS WOWED TO DESTRUCTION OF THE DEMONS...WITHOUT A DOUBT, ESKEL IS THE ONLY
ONE WHO KNOWS THE TRUTH. WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT THE ARCH-ANGELS ARE EQUIPPED
WITH FEARSOME POWERS AND CAN DESTROY A DEMON OR DRAGON FAIRLY EASY.

                             ATLAS OF ROCHEBRUME
                             -------------------
ISLANDS
-------
THE ROCHEBRUME `ARCHIEPELGOS` CONSISTS OF 23 ISLANDS WITH THEIR OWN
GEOGRAPHY,WEATHER,POPULATION. SOME ARE MOUNTAINOUS AND INHABITED BY HORDES OF
SAVAGES.OTHERS ARE STINKING SWAMPS INFESTED WITH THE ARMIES OF `DEMOG`. WHAT IS
CERTAIN IS THAT DEMOG IS AHEAD OF YOU AND THE FARATHER YOU PENETRATE THE
ISLANDS, THE MORE POWERFUL THE ARMIES YOU WILL HAVE TO FACE.

                             TERRAIN TYPES
                             -------------
THE PLAIN
---------
THE ISLANDS CONSIST MAINLY OF PLAINS,WIDE OPEN SPACES OF GRASS AND SAND. THEY
HAVE FEW STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES EXCEPT FOR ONE OR TWO HIGH SPOTS AND HERE AND
THERE A SOLITARY TREE WHICH MIGHT SHIELD YOU FROM DIRECT SPELLS. BUT THEY ARE
EASY TO CROSS AND IDEAL FOR CASTLES.

THE FOREST
----------
THE WOODS AND FOREST OF ROCHEBRUME OFFER MANY SHELTERS TO THOSE WHO LIKE 
AMBUSH TACTICS. THESE WOODS ARE CRISS-CROSSED WITH TRACKS AND THE LEGIONS CAN
MOVE THROUGH THEM WITHOUT BEING SLOWED DOWN TOO MUCH. MAGICIANS MUST BE 
CAREFUL WHEN THEY CAST `DIRECT` SPELLS AS THEIR FIREBALLS MAY GET LOST IN THE 
BRANCHES.

THE HILLS
---------
THIS TYPE OF TERRAIN IF USEFUL FOR DEFENSIVE POSITIONS, BUT THE DEFENDER MUST
GET THERE WELL BEFORE THE ENEMY. BY PLACING HIS UNITS ON THE MANY MOUNDS, A
SMART STRATEGIST IS SURE OF STRIKING IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT. BUT THESE FOOT
HILLS SLOW DOWN THE LEGIONS.

THE SWAMPS
----------
THESE STINKING SWAMPS HAVE BEEN THE BURIAL GROUND OF MANY LEGIONS. THEY OFFER
GOOD OPPORTUNITIES TO MAGICIANS SINCE THE GROUNS IS USUALLY CLEAR AND THE
ENEMIES WHICH DONT HAVE TELEPORTATION ARE OFTEN OBLIGED TO USE WINDING WAYS TO
REACH THEIR TARGETS.AGAIN THESE TRACKS TEND TO SLOW DOWN LEGIONS DURING
STRATEGIC MANOEVURES.

THE MOUNTAINS
-------------
THE MOUNTAINS OF ROCHEBRUM ARE FORBIDDING BARRIERS CONSIDERED AS VERY
DANGEROUS. THEY ARE CONTINUALLY SWEPT BY VIOLENT STORMS AND LEGIONS ARE NOT
ADVISED TO ENGAGE COMBAT IN THE MOUNTAINS EXCEPT IN DESPERATE SITUATIONS. IN
THESE SITUATIONS THE STORMS CAN BE USEFUL ALLIES. WE HAVE SEEN CASES OF LEGIONS
COMPLETELY DECIMATED BY LIGHTNING STROKES JUST WHEN THEY WERE ON THE POINT OF
OVERWHELMING A SMALLER ARMY.

                             MANUAL OF WARRIOR KING CUGEL
                             ----------------------------
THIS MANUAL HAS BEEN TRANSCRIBED BY ISUCHO THE PIOUS FROM THE MEMOIRS OF THE
FAMOUS WARRIOR WHO FIRST FOUNDED THE KINGDOM OF `CELTIKA`. IT IS A SERIES OF
TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC COUNSELS REGULARLY UPDATED BY THE BEST GENERALS OF THE
DAY.

* IF YOU END A MOVE WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF THE ENEMY,PREPARE YOUR DEFENCE
BY REGONISING THE TACTICAL TERRAIN AND PLACING YOUR TROOPS IN THE BEST 
POSITION TO WITHSTAND THE ENEMYS ATTACK. YOUR DISCIPLINED TROOPS WILL NOT MOVE 
WITHOUTYOUR ORDERS. IT IS A GOOD TACTICS TO PLACE YOUR STRONGEST UNITS ON 
THE HEXAGONS WHERE THE ENEMY WILL ARRIVE TO PREPARE A NICE RECEPTION.

* ONCE A BATTLE HAS STARTED,IT GOES ON UNTIL ONE OF THE TWO OPPONENTS HAS BEEN
COMPLETELY DESTROYED. THERES AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE. IF THERES A MAGICIAN
CHANTING ON A PENTACLE, HE WILL LEAVE THE TACTICAL SCREEN WITH HIS TROOPS AND
THEY WILL BE TELEPORTED SAFE AND SOUND TO A REMOTE HEXAGON.(THE MAGICIAN MUST
BE ON THE PENTACLE AND NOT BESIDE IT AS WHEN NORMALLY CHANTING) AND HE MUST
HAVE THE NECESSARY MAGIC LEVEL TO CREATE AT LEAST ONE SOLDIER.

* WHEN YOU ARE INSPECTING A LEGION(WITH THE ? ICON) LOOK CLOSELY AT THE
ORDERING OF THEUNITS. THE FIRST FOUR ON THE LEFT WILL BE IN THE FRONT RANK 
WHENYOU ATTACK AN ENEMY LEGION. POSITION YOUR MOST POWERFUL HAND-TO-HAND 
FIGHTERS AT THE FRONT AND YOUR SPELL CASTERS AT THE REAR. YOU CAN USE
SEPERATION ICON TO CHANGE THE ORDER OF YOUR TROOPS FOR YOUR LAST MOVE.

* DO NOT IGNORE CREATURES SEEMING WEAK AT FIRST, THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST
POTENTIAL AND LEARN FASTEST.SO PROTECT THEM AND LOOK AFTER THEM. WHEN THEY
HAVEGOT A BIT OF EXPERIENCE THEY`LL BE USEFUL TO YOU.

* DONT BE HEAVY ON THE MAGIC,VICTORY DEPENDS UPON IT. BE CAREFUL NOT TO USE UP
ALL YOUR MAGICAL POINTS IF THERES A CHANCE OF YOUR DEMOG BEING ATTACKED IN
TURN.

* SAVAGES ARE A GOOD WAY OF TOUGHENING UP YOUR LEGIONS. BUT DONOT UNDER
ESTIMATE THE MINOS AND THE SERPENTS

* THE CASTLE IS A SAFETY PLACE WHERE YOU ARE PROTECTED AGAINST A TELEPORTED
SURPRISE ATTACK. REMEMBER YOU ARE VULNERABLE TO YOUR OPPONENTS MAGIC OUTSIDE
THE CASTLE.

* CASTLE BUILDING IS VERY COSTLY ENTERPRISE. CHOOSE THE SITE CAREFULLY, THE
CASTLE CAN BE CUT OFF A PASSAGE FOR THE ENEMY.

* AT THE START, YOU MIGHT THINK THE FIREBALL IS MORE USEFUL THAN THE 
CLUMSINESSOR WEAKNESS SPELLS BUT YOU WOULD BE WRONG.SOME CREATURES ARE MORE 
SUSCEBTIBLETO LOSS OF ENERGY THAN VITALITY(A MAGICIAN WITH 1 LIFE POINT CAN
STILL THROW AFIREBALL,WITH 1 DEXTERITY POINT HE HAS ONLY 1 IN A 100 OF 
HITTING YOU.

                             THE GODS OF CELTIKA
                             -------------------
CELTIKA IS A WORLD WHERE THE GODS SOMETIMES INTERVENE IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND 
MOREOFTEN WHERE FATE OF A KINGDOM IS CONCERNED. IN THE CONFLICT OPPOSSING 
ESKEL ANDSOGROM, THE GODS HAVE DECIDED TO BE ACTIVELY NEUTRAL SPECTATORS. THIS MEANS
THAT, THERE ARE CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL RULES THAT EVEN MORE POWERFUL MAGICIANS
CANNOT TRANSGRESS WITHOUT INCURRING THE DIVINE WRATH.

THE MOST IMPORTANT RULES IS
----------------------------
YOU CANNOT CHANT MORE THAN A CERTAIN DISTANCE FROM A PENTACLE AND ONCE YOU 
HAVE 8 UNITS WITHIN A CERTAIN AREA, YOU CANNOT CREATE ANYMORE.SO FAR, NO WISE
MAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN THESE RESTRICTIONS. ALL WE KNOW IS ANYONE TRYING 
TO TRANSGRESS THESE RULES WILL FAIL AND START A HAIL OF LIGHTNING STROKES 
STRIKING THE GROUNDAT RANDOM AROUND HIM.
