Typed by SIDEWINDER of LSD.


SCENARIO
Truth and Justice are the by-words of the Bureau of Special Criminal
Investigations.  Now you are to embark on the most important case in your
life.  The Mayor's  daughter has been kidnapped by a band of vicious
lawbreakers.  She is being held within a warehouse somewhere on the south
side.  You will have to complete six missions before you can save her.  Each
successful mission will provide a new clue that will, eventually, lead you to
the girl's location.  However, it's a race against time because her only
company is a time bomb!

GAMEPLAY
Karen, from Chase Headquarters, will send a description of the criminal's
vehicle to your on-board computer.  You have a limited time period to catch
up with the offender.  A further time bonus will then be given to either
shoot or ram the car off the road.  Ramming into other vehicles slows you
down, making capture more difficult.  A limited supply of Nitro Boosts gives
you a short period of extra acceleration.  But use these wisely!  When you
have inflicted the necessary amount of damage the criminal's car will pull
over to the side of the road where he can be arrested.
Six, progressively difficult, missions will take you through a variety of
towns and landscapes.  During the game you will be offered improved weaponry
with limited ammunition from a helicopter flying overhead.

Watch out for innocent drivers who may delay your progress via their
appalling driving skills.

Above all - remember that time is ticking away, crimes are being committed
and the bad guys are getting away!

STATUS AND SCORING
You have 60 seconds to catch up with the target vehicle and then a further 60
seconds in which to inflict as much damage to the criminal as possible by
either shooting or ramming it off the road.

Points are scored as follows:

                        PASSING         SHOOTING        RAMMING
Porsche                 500 Pts         50 Pts          50 Pts
Blue Van                400 Pts         50 Pts          50 Pts
Blue Car                300 Pts         50 Pts          50 Pts
Limousine               200 Pts         50 Pts          50 Pts
Motor Bike              100 Pts         50 Pts          50 Pts
Convoy Cars                             10 Pts          1000 Pts
Criminal Cars                           100 Pts         10000 Pts

Any time left on the clock on each level will be awarded x 10000.
After you have caught up with the car a damage indicator will appear on
screen.  This will show you how much damage you have caused to the target
vehicle.  When the indicator is full your car will automatically overtake the
criminals and stop them.

HINTS AND TIPS
*       Only use your turbo when ramming the target vehicle.
*       Slow down on tight bends or when driving near water.
*       Take your time when 'ramming' to increase your score.
*       You will score less when using the continue play option.
