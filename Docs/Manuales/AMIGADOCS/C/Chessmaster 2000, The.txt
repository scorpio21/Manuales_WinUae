COMPUTER REQUIREMENTS
=====================

The Chessmaster 2000 requires the AMIGA with 512K of memory. 
Kickstart version 1.1 must be used.

HOW TO USE THE CHESSMASTER 2000
===============================

All features of The Chessmaster 2000 are activated through AMIGA style menus.
Menus are available from the Menu Bar, at the top of the screen, when
the right mouse button is depressed.
To select a choice from a menu, point to a menu title and, while keeping
the right mouse button depressed, move to one of the available menu items.
As you do this, the item will be highlighted.
Select the command or option by releasing the right mouse button when the
command or option is displayed.  For some items, sub-menus will appear. 
Consult the Introduction to the AMIGA manual included with your computer
or your computer dealer for further information on how to operate the mouse
and select commands or options from AMIGA menus.


DIRECT ACCESS TO FEATURES...
============================

Some menu items allow keyboard shortcuts. 
If this is the case, a shortcut keystroke will be shown next to the menu
item. Use these shortcut commands by pressing the right Amiga key (A) down
(like a shift key) and then pressing the appropriate letter key.
By typing these selection-shortcut-keys you may activate the function of
your choice without using the menus.

TO MOVE A PIECE:
================
 
To move the chess pieces, position the mouse cursor "hand" 
over the piece and "grab" it by depressing the left mouse button.
Move the piece to its new location and release button.
If you are familiar with algebraic chess notation (i.e., 'e2-e4') 
you may type your moves in that notation.

CASTLING:
=========

When legal, move your king to his destination square. 
The rook will move into place automatically.

EN PASSANT:
===========

When legal, capture an opposing pawn, with your pawn, after it moves
out 2 squares on its first play, by moving your pawn ahead and diagonally
behind it.  The pawn will be captured "in passing".


PAWN PROMOTION:
===============

If you move a pawn to the eighth rank, The Chessmaster 2000 will
show you the pieces to which you can promote your pawn.
Click on your choice to promote the pawn.

Choose Play Level: 
==================

This feature allows you to select game difficulty.
The Chessmaster 2000 has 12 levels of play numbered 1 through 12.
Level 1 is the easiest.  See also Newcomer and Easy Mode.

easiest game.

The Style of Play is Normal/Best/Coffeehouse:
=============================================

Select The Chessmaster
2000's style of play to be:
Normal-mixes best and random moves.
Best-always makes its best move.
Coffeehouse-makes more random moves.

Selecting the opening book On allows The
Chessmaster 2000 to consult its extensive library of proven
opening moves and tactics.

Force Computer Move ((A)f): 
===========================

Makes the Chessmaster 2000 move
immediately at your command.

Take Back Last Move (Backspace): 
================================

This feature takes back the last move made by either you or the
Chessmaster 2000.
        
NOTE: 
=====
               If a move is taken back, it may be replaced
               by selecting Replay The Move ((A)r).  If you
               take back the Chessmaster 2000's last move it
               will start thinking of a new move, but will make 
               no move until you force it to move by pressing A„f.
               This is because it does not know whether you want
               to continue to take back moves.

Replay The Move ((A)f):
=======================

If any moves have been taken back, and no new
move made, you may select this to replay the taken-back moves.

Load A Saved Game: 
==================

        The Drawer called ClassicGames contains the 100
        classic games described in the accompanying booklet.  The
        Drawer called MySavedGames will contain games you have pre-
        viously saved.  Select the appropriate Drawer from the menu
        using the mouse.

        When the appropriate Drawer has been selected, all the games
        in that Drawer will be displayed on the screen.  Select, with
        the mouse again, the desired game and then select LOAD on the
        menu.

        Once the game is Loaded, you may continue playing it from the
        point at which it was saved.  Or you may select Replay (Ar)
        to replay the game.  You may stop this sequence at any point 
        and continue the game yourself.

        The classic games begin at the initial game position.  To see
        each move, press A r repeatedly.

Save This Game:
===============

        Use this command to save the game in progress to the 
        disk.  Select, with the mouse, the Drawer title MySavedGames.
        Next, select inside the black line entitled FILE: and type the
        name you wish to give your saved game.  Select SAVE, using the
        mouse, to save the game to disk.

        There is room on the Chessmaster 2000 program diskette for you
        to save about 50 games.  You may, however, remove the program
        diskette and save over 500 games on each freshly formatted
        disk that you choose to insert.

Erase a Saved Game:
===================

        Use this command to erase any games previously 
        saved to disk whenever you no longer wish to preserve the

scroll bars on right side of the window to move through list.

Show Chessmaster Thinking (As): 
===============================

Select to view the Chessmaster's Thinking process.

NOTE:
=====

        The Chessmaster 2000 may not be 
        thinking deeply, or at all, if the Play Level is set low, or
        the present game is following opening hook moves.

        Three "lines of play" are displayed.  First is the "Best"
        line, which is the best the Chessmaster 2000 has come up with
        in its thinking so far.  If you force the Chessmaster 2000 to
        move by pressing the A f key, it will make the first move in
        its best line.

        The "Current"line is the line it is considering at this
        instant.  Because this line is a "snapshot" of an incomplete
        thought, the moves and score for the Current line will not 
        always make sense.

        The "Previous" line is the line from the previous move made by
        the Chessmaster 2000.  This is the same as the "Best
        variation" displayed by A…v.  It has nothing to do with the
        Chessmaster's thinking for its next move.

        The lines of play are displayed as a sequence of move, a
        score, and search Depth.

        In the sequence of moves, the first move is the one the Chess-
        master 2000 might make next, followed by your reply, and its 
        answer to your reply, and so on.  Of course, you might not
        make the predicted reply, and even if you do, the Chessmaster
        2000 might think of a better answer in the meantime, so the  
        further you go down the moves, the less likely it is that
        those exact moves all will actually be made.

        The Score reflects how far the Chessmaster 2000 thinks it will
        be ahead or behind if the line of play is played out to the
        last move shown.  The score is computed in pawns and fractions
        so a score of 1.00 means the Chessmaster 2000 will be ahead
        pawn (or the equivalent), and -3.00 means it will be down the
        equivalent of one piece.  Fractional scores come from the
        Chessmaster 2000's evaluation of positional considerations.

        The search Depth is the minimum number of plies, or half
        moves, the Chessmaster 2000 will look ahead.  A depth of 3, 
        for example, means it will look at its move, your reply, and 
        it's answer:  three half moves.  It may look farther if it
        sees something interesting, like a check or capture.  When the
        Chessmaster 2000 has looked at all the moves at the current
        search depth, it will start a new search one ply deeper if it
        thinks it has time to finish.

Show Best Variation (Av):
=========================

        This displays the line of play predicted by
        the Chessmaster 2000 when it made its last move.  Also shown
        are the Score, which indicates how far the Chessmaster 2000
        thinks it is ahead or behind, and the Depth of search, which
        shows how many half moves ahead it looked when planning that
        move.

        The first move in the line of play is the best move it made.
        The next move is what it thinks your best reply would be.  If
        you ask for a hint, this is the first move the Chessmaster
        2000 will suggest.
 
        For more about the display of a line of play, see "Show Chess-
        master Thinking", above.

Suggest a Move (Ah):
====================

        Provides a hint for your next move by moving the
        suggested piece and then replacing it in its original location.
        The first hint offered is what the Chessmaster 2000 considers
        to be your strongest move possible.  Other suggested moves may
        provide you with an unexpected strategy but are not likely to
        be as good.


Teaching On/Off: 
================

        When on, and a piece is selected to move, a shadow
        of that piece appears to show you all squares to which it may
        legally move.

The Sound is Now Voice/Music/Bell/Silence:
==========================================      

        This feature lets you
        change the sound from the Chessmaster voice to music to a bell
        sound, or to shut it off entirely.  Sound is heard when a 
        piece is moved, a mistake is made, a piece is captured, a king
        is in Check, a mate occurs, on piece promotion, checkmate, 
        stalemate, or when a New Game is begun.

Notation Algebraic/Abbreviated Algebraic: 
=========================================

        This feature switches the 
        format of the move list from Algebraic to Abbreviated
        Algebraic.  When typing in moves, however, you must always use
        the Algebraic format.

Enter Your Name: 
================

        Select to enter your name on-screen.  You may enter
        a name up to 11 characters, including spaces and punctuation.

If the Boss Wanders By (Ap):
============================

        A panic button for tight situations.  Be
        prepared, however, to speak knowledgeably on the subject of
        real estate investment analysis.


EXTRAS...
=========

Analyze a Game (Aa):
====================
  
        The purpose of "Analyze a Game" is to play a
        game with the Chessmaster 2000, or another person, and then
        have the Chessmaster 2000 analyze each move made, and the 
        strength of each player's position.  You can analyze a game
        played with another person by selecting a "human" opponent 
        (See Choose Your Opponent) and entering the moves of the game 
        into the Chessmaster 2000.

Begin Analysis: 
===============

        Select this feature after a game has been played,
        partly played, or loaded form disk, and some or all moves have
        been taken back.  (See Take Back All Moves below.)

        For each move analyzed, the Chessmaster 2000 will show the
        best move (with score and best line of play), and then play 
        the actual move. (If a move is made from the Chessmaster's
        opening book, no line of play is shown.) For more about the
        line of play, see "Show Chessmaster Thinking" above.

        Analysis is displayed on the screen, and on the Chessmaster
        2000 program disk in the text file CM.ANL (if Disk file 
        CM.ANL output is selected ON from the Analysis sub-menu).
 
NOTE:
=====  

        The higher the level of play you have selected (see
        Choose Play Level) the deeper the Chessmaster 2000's analysis
        will be.  You may want to let your computer run for hours, or
        overnight, to get a better analysis.


Save Analysis in CM.ANL: 
========================

        Select to send analysis to the Chessmaster
        2000 program disk in a file called CM.ANL.  Each time this
        feature is selected CM.ANL is overwritten with new analysis.
        The format of CM.ANL is standard ASCII, and may be read at the
        AmigaDOS level with your word processor, or the AmigaDOS 
        command TYPE CM.ANL.

Choose Side to Analyze; Both/Black/White:
=========================================

Selects analysis for both sides, or one, or the other.

Take Back LAST Move (Backspace): 
================================

Takes back the last move made by either you or the Chessmaster 2000.

Take Back ALL Moves:  
====================

Takes back all moves, to the beginning of the game.
You are ready to start Analysis.

Quit Analysis: 
==============

Select to stop Analysis.

Solve for Mate (Am):
====================
       
        Use this feature to solve chess problems in
        which mate will occur in a certain number of moves.  Solving
        for mate is like playing a short chess game.  First use "Set
        Up a Position" to set up the position from the chess problem.
        Then select the number of moves the Chessmaster 2000 to mate
        in, and which side it plays.  Finally select Start Solving 
        For Mate.  The Chessmaster 2000 will think for a while and 
        then make a move.  Next you make a counter move, and so on 
        until checkmate.  You can take back moves to make other      
        counter moves.

Start Solving for Mate: 
=======================

Select to start the Solve for Mate process.

Mate in how many moves?:
========================

Chooses how far ahead the Chess-master 2000 will look for a mate.

Choose Side to Mate Black/White: 
================================

Chooses which side the Chessmaster 2000 plays.

Quit Solve Mate: 
================

Leaves Solve Mate and return to normal play.

Print Moves so Far: 
===================

Prints all moves so far in the current game.
Make sure your printer is ready before selecting this feature.
 
Print Each Move On/Off: 
=======================

Prints each move as a game is played. 
Make sure your printer is ready before selecting this feature.

Save These Settings: 
====================

        Saves the current setup of the Chessmaster 
        2000's features including display and play features, such as
        play level, board dimension, sound options, colors, play
        modes, etc.  The next time the Chessmaster 2000 is run, it
        will be set as it as when you last used it.

"Factory Setting": 
==================
 
        Selection will restore the Chessmaster 2000 
        settings to the same ones it had when it left The Software
        Toolworks.  These settings will be active the next time you
        run the Chessmaster 2000.

On-Screen Menu Index
====================

Play options are shown on the left.  Menu titles and shortcut key-
strokes for each option are shown on the right.
