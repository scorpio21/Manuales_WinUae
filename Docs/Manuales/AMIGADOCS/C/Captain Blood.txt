                                THE STORY
                                ~~~~~~~~~
Trapped in a universe of your own creation - a world populated by strange
creatures in unlikely scenarios, extensions of your own over-active
imagination - but it's only a game, right? Wrong. It's every hacker's worst
nightmare..and you're living it!

As the erstwhile programmer who calls himself Captain Blood, you're in one
heck of a predicament. The Hyperspace warp that sucked you into the game
also fragmented your genetic structure, creating five exact duplicates of
yourself that are now hiding somewhere in the galaxy of Hydra. You must
find your clones and assimilate them to replenish the vital fluids you so
desperately need.

                            PLAYING THE GAME
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the game begins you will see the interior of your spaceship, followed
immediately by a view of the nearest planet. The arm you see on the screen
is your own - move the mouse to move your arm around the screen. Because
you lack necessary vital fluids, you are continually degenerating. As you
degenerate, your arm will start to shake, making it difficult to select
options from the control panel.

An on-board clock keeps track of elapsed time in hours, minutes, and
seconds. You have approximately 2 1/2 real-time hours to find a clone and
get back some vital fluid before your arm becomes completely uncontrolable.
If you do find a clone, you gain another 2 1/2 hours of playing time.

The first planet that comes into view each time you begin a new game will
always be inhabited. After that, you're on your own.

NOTE: The program recreates the galaxy each time you begin a game. This
means that the coordinates of inhabited planets are not valid from one game
to the next.

                          PLANET VISION SCREEN
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Planet Vision Screen is the first screen that appears when you begin a
new game. The planet that you see is the one nearest to your present
location. Several options are available to you on the Planet Vision Screen:
GeoPhoto Vision, Planet Destruction, and OORXX Landing Mission. These
options are described individually below.

The Control Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The control panel in front of you contains various buttons, only a few of
which are active at any one time. Six control buttons are positioned
diagonally on either side of a large central button. These buttons will be
referred to (from left to right) as Buttons 1-6. Use the mouse to move your
hand around the control panel. Unless otherwise instructed, select an
option by pointing your hand's index finget to it and clicking the LEFT
mouse button.

GeoPhoto Vision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To get a close-up view of the planet surface, activate the GeoPhoto Vision
mode by clicking on Button 6. Diamonds on the planet surface indicate enemy
missiles. Click on this button again to get an even closer view. Click on
Button 2 to return to the Planet Vision Screen.

Planet Destruction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To destroy the planet on the Vision Screen, click on Button 5 (the one
marked with an "X").

OORXX Landing Mission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To activate the OORXX landing mission, click on Button 4 (the one marked
with a down arrow) from the Planet Vision Screen. An OORXX will be
transported immediately to the planet surface and a vector image of the
landscape will appear on your viewing screen.

                              FLYING THE OORXX
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because your ship is too large to land on a planet, you must view the
planet's surface through the eyes of an OORXX - creatures designed for just
such missions. You guide the OORXX as it flies across the planet surface.
Move the mouse left, right, up or down to guide the OORXX in the
corresponding direction.

The two red markers on either side of the screen indicate your altitude
above the planet surface. The horizontal, red dotted line along the bottom
of the screen indicates your speed - the longer the line, the greater your
speed. Press the left mouse button to decrease speed, and the right mouse
button to increase speed.

Landing Sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each planet has a designated landing site, located at the end of a long,
narrow valley. As you fly, a red on-screen sight indicates your current
position. If you are headed in the righ tdirection, the sight will appear
as a flashing diamond shape. If you are off target, an arrow on the left or
right side of the sight will point you in the direction you should turn.
When you reach the landing site, the OORXX will land automatically and the
resident alien (if there is one) will appear.

Avoiding Missiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If enemy missiles are present on the planet surface, they will immediately
begin homing in on the OORXX; a continuous beeping noise lets you know that
you've been sighted. To avoid the missiles, you must fly as low as possible
without crashig.

When a missile locks in on your positon, red arrows appear on either side
of the screen and begin moving toward each other. The closer the arrows get
to one another, the closer the missile is the the OORXX; if the arrows
meetin in the center of the screen, the OORXX will be destroyed and you
will be returned to the ship's interior.

Fractal Landscapes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can request a complete fractal image of the landscape during a flight
by pressing the space bar; the OORXX will stop flying and the landscape
will gradually fill in on the viewing screen. Press the space bar again to
continue flying. You are advised not to request a view of the landscape
while flying through the vallye - the OORXX, thinking it has reached the
landing site, tends to get confused and lose its way!

                             THE UPCOM
                             ~~~~~~~~~
To communicate with aliens, you must use the UPCOM (Universal Protocol of
Communication) icon system. Once you land, the UPCOM Module appears
automatically on the screen if an alien is presnt.

Receiving a Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As the alien speaks, icons will appear on the left side of the UPCOM
Module. To receive a translation of a certain icon, simply point to the
icon in question; the translation will appear on the right side of the
screen. See your Game Manual for a complete list of all icons and their
meanings. If the central "mouth" is still moving, it means the alien has
more to say. Click on the "mouth" to read the rest of the message.

Sending a Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may respond to the alien using any of the highlighted icons shown in
the UPCOM window. The window shows only a small portion of the available
icons. To scroll left or right, simply point to one of the scroll selectors
located on either side of the icon window. To scroll more quickly, click
and hold on the scroll bar located at the bottom of the window, then move
the mouse left or right to move the icons in the corresponding direction.

To select an icon, simply point to it and click the mouse button. That icon
will then appear on the right side of the UPCOM Module. You may select up
to eight icons for each sentence. When you message is complet, click on the
"mouth" to transmit your message to the alien. The left-arrow shaped button
lets you delete an icon, and you may also insert an icon into an existing
sentence - see you Game Manual for complete instructions.

Teleporting
~~~~~~~~~~~
If an alien agrees to be teleported, the Teleport icon will appear on the
bottom left of the screen. Click on this button to teleport the alien onto
your ship. To teleport an alien from your ship onto a planet's surface,
click on the Teleport icon button once you land.

Returning to the Ship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click on the triangular-shaped button on the right side of the Module to
return to the ship.

                           THE SHIP'S INTERIOR
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To return to the ship's interior from a planet surface, click on the
triangular-shaped button located on the rifht side of the screen. From the
Galaxy Map or Planet Vision screen, click on any inactive button to return
to the ship's interior. The main control panel is shown at the bottom of
the screen - the creature to the right is an OORXX.

Interior Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Button 1 is used to save your game to a formatted data disk - do not save
to your program disk! Complete instructions for saving and loading games
are given below. To activate the Planet Vision Screen for a view of the
nearest planet, click on Button 2; click on any inacive button to return to
the ship's interior. To view the Galaxy Map, click on Button 3 (the one
marked with a "nebula" shape; click on any inactive button to return to
the interior. 

The Fridgitorium
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have teleported an alien or clone onto the ship, it will appear in
the Fridgitorium on the left side of the screen. While in the Fridgitorium,
the alien will not be able to communicate. To disintegrate a creature in
the Fridgitorium, click on the button directly below the Fridgitorium. When
a creature is disintegrated, you recover its vital fluids. However, only
the clones' vital fluids are compatible with your system.


Once you giude an OORXX to a planet's landing site, the OORXX remains ther
and may be reactivated at any time. If you have already landed on the
planet whose corrdinates are shown at the top of the screen (i.e. the
nearest planet), a question mark will appear on the right side of the
screen. Click on the question mark to reactivate the OORXX on that planet's
surface.

THE GALAXY MAP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To view the Galaxy Map, click on Button 3 from the interior. The
horizontal and veritcal lines superimposed on teh Galaxy Map allow you to
select a specific planet from among the 32,768 possible choices. 

Coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~
The location of each planet in the galaxy is expressed by a set of
coordinate numbers, X/Y. The veritcal line is the X coordinate line and the
horizontal is the Y line. The nearest planet is the one located at the
intersection of the two lines. The coordinates of this planet are displayed
at the top of the screen.

Selecting a Planet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As you move your hand aroun on the Map, the coordinates of the planet you
are pointing to at any given moment are shown in the box on the upper left
side of the screen.

To select a destination planet, first point to the vertical X line and hold
down the left mouse button. As you move the mouse right or left, the value
for the X coordiante will change accordingly in the box on the upper right
side of the screen. When the desired X coordiante appears in this box,
release the mouse button to lock in that coordinate number.

To select a new Y coordinate, point to the horizontal coordinate line and
hold down the left mouse button. As you move the mouse up or down, the
value for the Y coordinate will change accordingly in the box on the upper
right side of the screen. When the desired Y cooridate appears in this box,
release the mouse button to lock in that coordinate number.

Hyperspace
~~~~~~~~~~
To travel to the new planet you have selected on the Galaxy Map, activate
the Hyperspace option by clicking on the centrol control panel button (the
one marked with an up-arrow). When the Hyperspace sequence is over, the new
planet will appear on the viewing screen. NOTE: To bypass Hyperspace, click
first the LEFT mouse button then the RIGHT mouse button on the centrl
control panel button.

                              SAVING A GAME
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may save your game to a formatted data disk at any time AFTER five
minutes of play. To save a game, insert a formatted data disk into Drive 0.
Return to the ship's interior and click on Button 1 (the disk icon). The
faved file will be called BLOOD.CPT. If the game was not successfully
saved, the disk icon will flash for a few seconds; in this case, check your
data disk and try again. Each tme you save to the same data disk, the new
saved game will replace the old saved game. Although you cannot pause the
game during play, you may save your progress at any point and return to
your game at a later time.

Loading a Saved Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may load a saved game ONLY DURING THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF GAME PLAY.
To load a saved game, first begin a new game using your program disk. When
the Planet Vision Screen appears, click on any inactive button to proceed
to the ship's interior. Then insert your data disk into Drive 0 and click
on Button 1 (the disk icon). Should you wish to load a saved game after
five minutes have expired, you will have to reboot your computer.

                               THE END
                               ~~~~~~~
To survive, you must find all five clones and disintegrate them in your
ship's Fridgitorium. The last clone should give you the coordinates of the
planet where Torka - the beautiful alien Ondoyate - is waiting. once you go
there and teleport her onto your ship (note that she does not stay in the
Fridgitorium!), you've won. Now all you have to do is figure out how to get
yourself out of the game....

                             TIPS & HINTS
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Whatever you do, don't blow up the first planet without going down and
speaking to the alien there - you MUST get him to give you the coordinates
of another inhabited planet. (The chances of finding one on your own are
about 1 in 500!)

2. Be persistent! It almost always pays off to keep talking to an alien,
even if it seems like you're not getting anywhere at first.

3. Keep going back to planets you've already visited, even if you didn't
get any information there the last time - aliens often change their minds
and decide to talk.

4. Some aliens will not give you information until you tell them what they
want to know, or perform a certain task.

5. Don't be too quick to kill aliens, even if other aliens ask you to; your
intended victim may have the information you're looking for.

6. If youtransport certain aliens to a strange planet, they may provide
helpful information. Keep track of where you leave them - you may need to
bring them back!

7. Be sure to keep track of planet and character NAMES as well as planet
coordinates; other aliens may ask you for them.

8. Because people and place names are translated from alien languages, they
often don't sound like names at all - here are a few examples; Alien Names:
DEAD GENETIC, MISSILE BRAVE, INSULT 4, NO NO, GOOD UNKNOWN, HOWDY PRISION,
GREAT BOUNTY, GOOD NONSENSE. Planet Names: TRAP 4, SMALL HOME, IDEA 762,
KILL YOU, INSULT 80, GREAT FEAR, BOW BOW, REPRODUCTION 14, BAD TRAP.

9. Aliens use a variety of icons to identify themselves and their planets.
Some variations: Me_________, Identity________,Identity Me =_________;
Plante ________, Planet Me_________, Planet =__________, Identity
Planet_____. For example a Buggol might say: "IDENTITY ME = POP UNKNOWN"
and "PLANET = MIND 137".

10. Some important aliens to look out for: Izwals (especially YOKO and NO
NO), Buggols (especially GOOD UNKNOWN), Croolis-Ulvs, Croolis-Vars, Migrax
(GREAT BOUNTY and MISSILE BRAVE), Sinox (GOOD MIND and BRAIN
RADIOACTIVITY), Antennas and Robheads.

11. If you're having trouble getting information, try asking questions
based on what an alien says to YOU. For instance: 
Alien: CROOLIS-VAR GREAT PEOPLE GREAT WARRIOR
You: ME WANT KNOW IDENTITY CROOLIS-VAR
Alien: IDENTITY CROOLIS-VAR = POOR GENETIC
You: ME SEARCH PLANET POOR GENETIC
Alien: PLANET POOR GENETIC = TRAP 1
You: YOU SAY COORDINATE PLANET TRAP 1
Alien: COORDINATE 178/102

                             THE STORY
                             ~~~~~~~~~
	The computer game to end all computer games...that was Blood's goal.
(No one knew his real name - he had always gone by the programming
pseudonym "Captain Blood".) There were more than enough mindless
shoot-em-ups out there, Blood decided. He was determined to create the
ultimate science-fiction adventure, complete with incredible visual
effects, a strange and complex story, and most important of all, a life of
its own...
	Months went by, and Blood programmed on. A whole world came into
being, lovingly created down to the last detain. The world was Hydra - a
vast galaxy of innumerable planets, each one different. He created 14
unique alien races, complete with their own languages and complex social
systems. To facilitate nterplanetary communication Blood developed the
UPCOM (Universal Protocol of Communication) Module - a sophisticated system
of icons available to all aliens. For speedy travel between planets, Blood
envisioned Hyperspace (a somewhat psychedelic spacewarp option). And, of
course, he inserted an adventure-loving, intergalactic hero named (what
else!) CAPTAIN BLOOD. Finially, it was done. The last routines were in
place. Holding his breath, Blood gave the mementous commands:
EDIT....COMPILE....RUN.
	The monitor went blank for a moment, then began to glow with an eerie
blue light that grew stronger - and stronger. Blood was mesmerized. He
stared nto the monior, unable to look away. Stars and planets began
approaching; slowly at first, then faster and faster. Blood felt himself
being drawn into the screen, pulled by some incredibly powerful force. As
the force intensified, he started losing consciousness.

The glow in the room began to fade, as the monitor dimmed - an then went
black. Blood had disappeared.

He regained consciousness slowly. An intense paid shot through his
head...and his right arm felt kind of funny, too. He looked around, unable
to figure out what had happened. "Where the @#%$!?#! ami I?" he mumbled to
himself.

A computerized voice immediately responded, "Well, Captain, we were headed
for Corpo 1, but something went wrong during the Hyperspace warp. I'm not
sure, but I think - uh, that is, I'm afraid you've been...."

"Who are you?" barked Blood, as he tried to focus on his surroundings.
"Whaddya mean, 'Corpo 1'? That's a planet in Hydra - the universe I
created!!...."

"This is the Bio-Monitor speaking, Captain. You ARE travelling through the
galaxy of Hydra. You'd heard about the Ondoyante, remember? Beautiful
creatures, but very lonely. You thought perhaps you'd pay a visit, and..."

"Oh my god, it's true," groaned Blood, noticing for the first time the
immense, blue-lit control panel in front of him. "I've been sucked into my
own game - trapped..probably for good! Now what!!!?"

"Don't get excited, Captain," the Bio-Monitor answered soothingly, "I'm
sure you'll find a way out sooner or later. In the meantime, I'm afraid
I've got some bad news for you. The malfunction during the last space
warp..well, your genetic structure was fragmented, slightly. That is to
say, you've been cloned. Five clones, to be precise. Ther're hiding
somewhere in the galaxy, and you've got to find them - fast. It's the vital
fluids, you see. The clones absorbed most of YOUR vital fluids, and without
them you're not going to survive much longer - not in human form, anyway.
You may have noticed that the auto-bionic sensor has already started
replacing some of your essential parts..."

Blood looked down at the wires and fuses that now comprised most of his
right arm. "Great, just great," he snapped. "Not only do I get draggedinto
my own @#$%$^#! computer game, but I end up being cloned on top of it!
Clones...the last time I wrote a game with clones was back in..."

"Captain," the Bio-Monitor interrupted, "we'd better get started. You've
only got a couple of hours left before.."

"O.K., let's get on with it," sighed Blood, "What do you suggest?"

"I'm not sure of our location," came the reply, "Why don't you activate the
viewing screen and see what's out there? Just press that button to your
left..that's it."

Blood manipulated his partially bionized arm over the control panel and hit
the indicated button. A revolving planet immediately appeared on the
viewing screen.

"Yes, there's life down there all right," said the Bio-Monitor
encouragingly, "Why don't you go in for a closer look - someone in this
universe has got to know where your clones are hiding. Just activate one of
the OORXX - you'll be able to guide it simply..."

"I know, I know," Blood grumbled as he reached for the button, "I did
create the game myself, remember?" Captain Blood activated the OORXX for a
landing mission, thinking to himself, "Five of them - and I'm sure they
can't wait to be found. Why did I have to create so many planets?!! How
many are there? 32,000!?

"Almost, Captain. To be exact, 32,768...."

                           PLAYING THE GAME
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	As Captain Blood, you must find your five clones and disintegrate them
in the ship's Fridgitorium to replenish the vital fluids you so desperately
need. Because you lack these vital fluids, you are continually
degenerating. The ship's auto-bionic sensors are gradually replacing your
limbs and internal organs with mechanical gizmos. unless you find your
clones and restore your vital fluids, you will eventually become a
completely bionic human substitute...a robot.
	All game functions are directed from the control panel in front of
you. The slightly mechanical arm you see is your own. Most options are
selected by pointing the index finger of your mechanical hand to the
appropriate control and pressing the selection button. See your Reference
Booklet for complete instructions on how to select options.
	An on-board clock keeps track of elapsed time in minutes and seconds.
Because you are degenerating, your arm will start to shake as time goes by.
You have approximately 2 1/2 real-time hours to find a clone and get back
some vital fluid before your arm becomes completely uncontrollable. If you
do find a clone, you gain another 2 1/2 hours of playing time.

Locating Aliens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	When the game begins you will see the interior of your spaceship,
followed immediately by a view of the nearest planet. The galaxy of Hydra
contains a vast number of planets - 32,768 to be exact - only a handful of
which are inhabited. If you decide to search for life forms at random in
the galaxy, you will almost certainly get lost and not see anyone for
millions of years. Be forewarned: Don't go flying off without first getting
the coordinates of an inhabited planet!
	Fortunately, the first planet that comes into view each time you begin
a new game will ALWAYS be inhabited. To find out the coordinates of other
inhabited planets (and hopefully the planets where your clones are hiding),
you must fly an OORXX landing craft onto the first planet and speak to the
alien there. With a little luck, the alien will eventually give you the
coordinates of other inhabited planets. Follow up all leads, no matter how
unlikely they seem - it's your only hope of getting the information you
need before time runs out!
	It's very important to keep track of planet coordinates as you play
the game. Write down the coordinates of the first planet that appears, and
the name or race of the alien on that planet (they should identify
themselves for you). When you are given other planet coordinates by an
alien, be sure to write them down immediately - the alien might not repeat
them!

NOTE: THE PROGRAM RECREATES THE GALAXY EACH TIME YOU BEGIN A GAME. THIS
MEANS THAT COORDINATES OF INHABITED PLANETS ARE NOT VALID FROM ONE GAME TO
THE NEXT.

                             THE CONTROL PANEL
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The control panel remains visible at the bottom of the screen
throughout the game. It contains various buttons, only a few of which are
active at any one time. Six control buttons are positioned diagonally on
either side of a large central button. These buttons will be referred to
(from left to right) as Buttons 1-6.

The Planet Vision Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	On the Planet Vision Screen, oly three buttons are active: The OORXX
Landing Activator (Button 4), the Planet Destruct Activator (Button 5), and
the GeoPhoto Vision Activator (Button 6). See your Reference Booklet if
your have difficulty selecting one of these options.
	The GeoPhoto Vision Screen reveals the presence of enemy missiles on
the planet surface. Furing GeoPhoto Vision, you may alternante between
standard and magnified screens. Button 2 returns you to the Planet Vision
Screen.
	The Planet Destruct Activator will destroy the planet on the Vision
Screen. Before you decide to vaporize a particular planet, however, make
sure that you don't need anything (or anyone) on it! Once it's gone, it's
gone for good.
	The OORXX Landing Activator will eject an OORXX onto the planet
surface for a reconnaissance mission - then get ready for the flight of
your life as you guide its every move through steep mountains and narror
canyons!

                              THE OORXX
                              ~~~~~~~~~
	Your ship is equiped with an unlimited supply of OORXX - useful little
creatures designed especially for reconnaissance (and destruction) missions
on the planets of Hydra. You guide the OORXX by remote control, never
leaving the control panel of your ship. Although the ship is itself far too
large to land on a planet surface, you will be able to see and hear all
that goes on down below through the eyes and ears of the OORXX.
	To begin an OORXX landing mission, select the OORXX Landing Activator
(Button 4 - the one marked with a down arrow) from the Planet Vision
Screen. An OORXX will be transported immediately to the planet surface and
a vector image of the landscape will appear on your viewing screen.

Flying the OORXX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The OORXX are very sensitively calibrated creatures that respond
immediately to your every command. You can accelerate and decelerate, as
well as move the OORXX up, down, left or right by using the proper
controls. See your Reference Booklet for complete instructions on guiding
the OORXX.
	All planets have a designated landing site, located at the end of a
long narrow valley. As you fly, an on-screen sight indicates your current
position. If you are headed in the right direction, the sight will appear
as a flashing diamond shape. If you are off target, an arrow on the left or
right side of the sight will point you in the direction you should turn.
	If enemy missiles are present, they will immediately begin homing in
on the OORXX; a continuous beeping noise lets you know that you've been
sighted. To avoid the missiles, you must fly as low as possible without
crashing. If the OORXX is destroyed by a missile, you will be returned to
the ship's interior.
	Although OORXX are hardy creatures, they're not indestructible...after
seven or eight crashes, an OORXX will be damaged beyond repair and will
disintegrate into a thousand little pieces. If this happens, you'll be
returned to the interior of the ship and will have to start the flight over
again - with a new OORXX.

Landing
~~~~~~~
	Once you reach the narrow valley, you will no longer need to watch the
direction arrows on the sight - simply follow the valley as it twists and
turns. When you reach the landing site, the OORXX will land automatically
and the resident alien (if there is one) will appear.

Receiving a Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	When the UPCOM appears the alien will speak first, after which you
will generally be given a chance to respond. As the alien speaks, icons
will appear on the left side of the UPCOMM Module. To read the icons,
simply point to them one at a time; the word for each icon will then be
shown on the right side of the screen.
	If the "mouth" in the center of the UPCOMM Module is still moving, it
means that the alien has more to say. Point to the mouth and press your
selection button to view the next set of icons. When the mouth stops moving
the alien is finished speaking.

The Icon Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The icon window is located in the center of the UPCOMM Module. You
will notice that some icons are not highlighted when the UPCOMM Module
appears. This means that those icons are not part of the present alien's
vocabulary, and are therefore unavailable for use.
	Only a small portion of the available icons are displayed in the
window at any given time. Point to the scroll selectors on the bottom left
and right sides of the Module to view all the available icons. To scroll
through the icons more quickly, point to the scroll bar at the bottom of
the screen and press and hold your selection button; then move your control
left or right to move the icons in the corresponding direction.
	To see the meaning of a particular icon, simply point to that icon;
the English translation will then appear on the right side of the screen. A
complete list of all the icons and their meanings is given below in the
section entitled ICON DICTIONARY.

Sending a Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	To respond to an alien, point to an icon in the icon window and press
your selection button; that icon will now appear on the right side of the
UPCOM Module. The response area can accommodoate up to eight icons at a
time. If you seleect a ninth icon, it will take the place of the eighth
one. A small cursor located under the response area allows you to insert
and delete icons anywhere in the sentence.
	To insert an icon into an existing sentence, point to the icon TO THE
LEFT OF WHICH you wish to insert another icon and press your selection
button; the cursor will now appear under that icon. Then point to the icon
to be inserted and press your selection button again. The new icon will now
appear to the left of the cursor.
	To delete a selected icon, point to the icon TO THE RIGHT of the icon
you wish to delete and press your selection button; the cursor will now
appear under that icon. Then point to the left-arrow shaped delete button
located on the right side of the Module and press your selection button
again. The icon to the left of the cursor will not be deleted.
	When you message is complete, point to the central "mouth" and press
your selection button to transmit your message to the alien. To return to
the ship, select the triangular-shaped button located on the right side of
the Module.

Teleporting
~~~~~~~~~~~
	To teleport an alien, you must first gain its confidence and convince
him that he will not come to any harm. If he agrees to be teleported, the
teleport icon will appear on the bottom left of the screen. Select this
button to teleport the alien onto your ship. If you have already teleported
an alien onto the ship, the button will allow you to place him down on an
uninhabited planet.

Getting Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Easy type of alien has its own vocabulary; some are quite talkative,
others just say nonsense or speak in code. Some races are timid and
peace-loving while others do nothing but insult and threaten - a large part
of your strategy should be determining the best way to get information out
of each type of alien. Bribes work with some, threats with others. If an
uncooperative alien agrees to be teleported, try putting him down on an
uninhabited planet and see if he changes his tune! Some aliens cannot
survive on certain planets; if you put one down on a planet whose
atmosphere is inhospitable, you may be unpleasantly surprised.
	An alien can, for reasons best known to himself, break off a
conversation at any time. If this happens, you will be returned to the
interior of your ship. Select the triangular-shaped button located on the
right side of the control panel to return to the ship of your own accord.

                          THE SHIP'S INTERIOR
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	As was mentioned above, the triangular-shaped button located on the
right side of the control panel will return you to the ship's interior from
a planet surface. To return to the ship's interior from the Galaxy Map or
Planet Vision Screen, select any INACTIVE button. In the ship's interior,
the main control panel is again shown at the bottom of the screen - the
creature to the right is an OORXX. Elapsed time is shown under the planet
coordinates at the top of the screen.

 |Disintegrate Being in Fridgitorium

The Fridgitorium
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	For safety reasons, a teleported alien will be placed in the
Fridgitorium located on the left side of the ship's interior. The
Fridgitorium is a cryonization cylinder which keeps the alien in a state of
suspended animation until needed.
	For your convenience, the Fridgitorium is also equipped with a
disintegration feature. This is especially useful once you locate a clone -
disintegrating your clones is the only way to assimilate their vital fluid
and regain a portion of your strength. (Unfortunately, all other forms of
vital fluid are incompatible with your system.) The icon located directly
below the Fridgitorium allows you to disintegrate the creature in the
Fridgitorium. If you teleport an alien into the Fridgitorium while it is
occupied, you will unfortunately disintegrate the alien already in there.
In some cases, an alien will not agree to be teleported unless the
Fridgitorium is empty.

OORXX Reactivation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Once you have guided an OORXX to a planet's landing site, the OORXX
remains there and may be reactivated at any time. This feature lets you
return to previously visited planets and quickly resume your conversation
with the resident alien. If you have already landed on the planet whose
coordinates appear at the top of the screen (i.e. the nearest planet), a
question mark will appear on the right side of the ship's interior. Select
the question mark to reactivate the OORXX on that planet's surface. Of
course, if you ENJOY flying the OORXX, you can always guide another one
down - just for the fun of it!

Interior Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Button 1 is used to save your game to a formatted data disk - DO NOT
ATTEMPT TO SAVE TO YOUR PROGRAM DISK!  Complete instructions for saving and
loading games are given in your Reference Booklet.
	Button 2 activates the Planet Vision Screen for a view of the nearest
planet. Button 3 (the one marked with a "nebula" shape) allows you to view
the Galaxy Map. See your Reference Booklet if you need help selecting these
options.

                          THE GALAXY MAP
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Select Button 3 to activate the Galaxy Map. The location of each
planet in the galaxy is expressed by a set of coordinate numbers separated
by a slash (/). The first number is the "X" coordinate and the second
number is the "Y" coordinate. The coordinates of the nearest planet are
displayed at the top of the screen.

	As you move your hand around the Map, the coordinates of the planet
you are pointing to at any given moment are shown in the box to the upper
left of the screen. The box to the upper right of the screen shows your
destination planet.
