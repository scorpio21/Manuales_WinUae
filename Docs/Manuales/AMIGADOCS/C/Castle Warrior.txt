                   The Story And Instructions

		        Typed By THE TWINS OF TRILOGY




 For so many years have the people of the kingdom lived in harmony an
tranquility that the former battleground of warlords has now become
known as PACIFIA: The land of peace.

 It was EDELWULF The Great, a strong and mighty warriorlord who, nearly
fifty years ago, bravely, skillfully and mercilessly vanquished his 
neighbouring opponents to unite the land as one and claim the crown.

 Following EDELWULF`s death some years later the throne was ascended
by his eldest son EDELRED The Good. A learned and dutiful
administrator, EDELRED has ruled over his country with a combination
of efficient government and diplomacy towards neighbouring lands. The
people of PACIFIA are happy with their lot and most loyal to their
king.

 Except one. the evel wizard ZANDOR has been banished to a bleak castle
on the furthest borders of the kingdom where he can do least harm. It
is there that he has schemed and plotted EDELWULF`s downfall in order
that he may sieze the kingdom for himself. To this end he has in-
filtrated the royal castle and poisoned the king`s food.

 The king is near death and a black cloud hangs over his family and
subjects. There is only one way to avert disaster - you, EDRED The
Brave, son of EDELRED, must find ZANDOR and force from him a oure.

 The king has been poisoned. You have one day to find the antidote.
