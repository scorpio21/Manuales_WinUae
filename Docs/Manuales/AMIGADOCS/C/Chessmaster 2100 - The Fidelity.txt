    BOARD MENU

    BOARD DESIGN:THE CHESSMASTER OFFERS YOUR THREE DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT
    THE BOARD:

         2-D:AN OVERHEAD VIEW OF THE BOARD
         3-D:A PERSPECTIVE VIEW
         WAR ROOM:A SMALL 2-D BOARD PLUS THE MOST FREQUENTLY USE STATUS DIS-
         PLAYS:CAPTURED PIECES, MOVE LIST AND THE CHESSMASTER'S THINKING.

    CHESS SET:USE THE CHESSMASTER'S ELEGANT STAUNTAN PIECE SET, OR ONE OF FOUR
    OTHER PIECE DESIGNS, OR DESIGNS YOUR OWN! USE DELUXE PAINT II OR III. THE
    CHESSMASTER EXPECTS THE PIECES FILE TO BE IN A SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT. THE
    EASIEST METHOD IS TO MAKE A COPY OF THE FILE HOLDING THE STANDARD STAUNTON
    PIECES AND MODIFY THE COPY. THE STAUNTON PIECES ARE FOUND ON CHESSMASTER
    DATA DISK UNDER THE CHESS SET SUBDIRECTORY.

    MAKE A COPY OF THE APPROPRIATE FILE;LOAD IT INTO DELUXE PAINT II, AND THEN
    DRAW YOUR PIECES WITH THE RECTANGLES SHOWN. THE PIECES MUST BE DRAWN IN THE
    SAME LOCATIONS AS IN THE ORIGINAL FILE, BUT YOU MAY USE ALL OF THE AREA
    WITHIN THE RECTANGULAR REGION FOR EACH PIECE.

    THE PIECES ARE "MASKED" WHEN THEY ARE DRAWN ON THE CHESSBOARD. THE MASK
    REPRESENTS THE AREA WHICH MUST BE "CUT OUT" OF THE BACKGROUND PRIOR TO
    DRAWING THE PIECE. WHEN YOU DRAW NEW PIECES, YOU MUST ALSO MAKE SURE THE
    MASKS ARE CORRECT. THE BEST WAY TO MAKE A MASK FOR A NEW PIECE IS TO MAKE
    A COPY OF THE PIECE IN THE MASKED ARE, THEN ADD ONE EXTRA PIXEL(COLOR DOT)
    OF WHITE COMPLETELY AROUND THE PIECE. FINALLY, FILL IN THE ENTIRE MASK 
    WITH SOLID WHITE. THE SAMPLE PIECE FILE SHOULD MAKE THIS PROCESS CLEAR.

    CLOCKS:FOR EACH PLAYER, THE CHESS CLOCKS SHOW THE NAME, THE ELAPSED TIME
    AND THE LAST TWO MOVES MADE.

    COORDINATES:USING THIS OPTION, YOU MAY TOGGLE THE DISPLAY OF RANK(1-8)
    AND FILE (A-H) COORDINATES ALONG THE EDGE OF THE CHESS BOARD. IF YOU 
    ENTERS MOVES FROM THE KEYBOARD, YOU MAY FIND COORDINATE DISPLAY
    CONVENIENT.

    ROTATE:FOR ADDED INSIGHT INTO THE GAME, USE THIS OPTION TO VIEW THE CHESS
    BOARD FROM ANY SIDE. IF YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO PLAY BLACK, YOU WILL PROBABLY
    WANT TO ROTATE THE BOARD SO THAT WHITE IS AT THE TOP.
