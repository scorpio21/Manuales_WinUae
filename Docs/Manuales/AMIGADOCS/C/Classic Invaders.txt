Gameplay: Classic Invaders is based on the everlasting space invaders arcade game. The objective is to destroy the incoming invaders with your laser base. You must avoid the bombs by moving left to right and hiding under the shelters. When you have destroyed a complete screenfull of invaders, another, more difficult screen will appear. Your performance is measured by a scoring system shown at the top of the screen. You will receive extra points for hitting the mothership which appears from time to time across the top of the screen.

You have three lives initially and will be awarded an extra life for every 10,000 points scored.

The game is over when either the invaders land, or when all of your lives have expired.
