1. Description of the Game
Hang Foy Qua, the hero of this story finally reached the monastry of shao-lin
after a long exhausting way and was accepted as a novice. He has to conquer
the Chambers of shao-lin. Each of these Chambers will help to unite body

become a master. Therefore we will pass six selected chambers to help him.

will try to pass the examination with the best results he is able to get.
