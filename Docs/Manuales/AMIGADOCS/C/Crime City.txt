INTRODUCTION

I woke up at ten a.m.It was a cold, grey morning,one
of those mornings when you dont realise you,ve
woken up until noon, and then you wish you hadn't. 
An icy wind whined through th city, and below my
window people scurried from doorway to doorway
clenching their coats about them like corsets.

My head was a little foggy from the night before,
so i took the glass of water next to my bed and splashed 
some on my face before getting dressed. I put on my 
thick, green plaid shirt and heavy blueslacks, with my 
favourite Italien shoes.
   
Leaving the house was like running into a wall of 
packed snow. I stumbled down to the corner shop and
picked up a news paper and a fresh supply of coffee. The 
girl behind the counter gave me a look that said she was
doing me a favour by serving me, and she wasn't happy
about it. It seemed that nobody was going to be cheerful
today. I ran back to the house as fast as i dared on the
icy stone surface.

Breakfast was cold leftovers and hot coffee, alone-the
sort of meal you endure, rather than enjoy. The paper
was the same as usual,everybody fighting and
swindling each other.

Eventually, I resigned myself to the inevitable and went
reluctantly to my study. The typewriter sat on the desk by
the window. The keys seemed to form a laughing face.
Not a cheerful laughter, but cruel and taunting, revelling in
my inability to write what i had to, and daring me to try.

Mentally, I cursed muderers and detectives and missing
guns and alibis. More than ever, I wished that I
actually was a private eye, instead of being stuck with
writing about them. It was fate's cruelest trick, to give me
a job of sitting endlessly alone at home, doing nothing
real, and yet forcing me to immerse myself in a world
of vividly real actions and people and decisions. I shook
my head and sat down. Maybe one day lady luck would
shuffle the deck and I would get a better hand, but things 
were what thay were and I just had to play what I had.

Jack Blunt had writen himself into a corner. To let him
move on to the next chapter, the girl in the white 
Mercedes had to be in two places at once and the fat 
Korean from the starlight club had to tell him about the
statue, even thought he had no reason to do so.

I tried my best for Jack, but my thoughts kept drifting
into bitterness and self recriminations. Detective work was
in my blood. My father had been a policeman since before
I was bornan then a private eye. Why didn't I just 
do the same? Maybe if this was the closest that I could get,
I didn't deserve to get any closer.

There seemed to be a strain of weakness running through
me that i didn't like to think about, but did anyway
could I think and dream and wish as much as I liked, but
whenever I actually came close to doing anything about 
it, someone a lot stronger than me took control of my emo-
tions. they whispered about the risks and uncertainties, about
an established career and six well respected books. And
then I just turned away, back to the gloating, triumphant
typewriter, like a man who sees the best thing in the world
across some deep divide, runs to the edge and simply 
stops, even though he had decided for certain to jump.

My self chastisement was interupted bu the harsh buzz
of the door bell. Grateful for the stimulus, I pulled myself
out of my private pool of pointless reflection, and went to
see who it was.

On the door step was a slim, blonde girl twenty or maybe
a little more. She was wearing a blouse with way to many 
colours on it for my still half sleeping mind, and a thin 
black skirt which could have been made out of a handker-
chief. I briefly wondered why i was frozen right through,
and she looked as if it was june in hawaii. Some women
could wear bikini on a glacier and be comfortable.

The girl was about five six ,with legs that look longer
than that. She had an expresion that rang warning bells
in every part of my mind. On the surface, she looked
composed and in control, but i got the feeling that if I 
gave her taut face one little tap, it would shatter like
breaking glass. I didn't know what was worrying her, but
it had obviously gotten to her in a big way. A faint voise
in a corner of my mind said i have seen her somewhere
before.

"don;t i know you?", I asked, stepping aside to let her into
the hall.

"I'm Gloria, your father's new secretary. You came to the 
office once a couple of months ago.

Even nervous and upset, she had a voice that you could
pour onto waffles and eat for breakfast. She came into my
small living room. I shifted the papers off of the couch
to let her sit down, but she stayed on her feet, pacing
around like a condemned man waiting for the sound of a 
door to be opened, knowing it's the last time he'll ever
hear it.

"take your time", I said as gently as could ."whatever
you have to say is important, so think it through and
say it right."

She froze for a few seconds, not thinking but dreading.
"it's about your father, Mr White. Some policemen came
this morning to ask him some questions about David
Walker. "She froze up again, exhausted at having forced
out that much.

"That's not surprising. When a man's best friend and
police partner for twleve years is suddenly murdered, you
naturally hope he will ba able to give you some ideas. And
call me steven. I'm only Mr. White to salesmen and bank
managers. "The thought of David dead ran through me for
the hundredth time in two and a half days. I felt it, not like
the pretty whining of my early mood, but as a deep
and profound emptiness. I had known the man too, and
had considered him a good friend.

She shook her head rapdidly. "No, you don't understand.
It's not like that at all". Her tongue got tied up in itself
and she trailed away into nonsense sounds and frantic
gestures.

"slowly, slowly. grab a good firm hold of the story and
get it out."

She gave me a look so sad a spaniel would give a thousand
adoring humans for and still win out on the deal. "they
think he did it, Mr White. was something about a argument. 
Henary White was arrested for the muder of David Walker
this morning."

I guess I just stood for a few seconds. The words hit me
like a hard right to the jaw by Mike Tyson. When i came 
back to my self I could tell from her expessions that my
own must have been pretty strong. I pulled myself together 
as well as i could and took a deep breath.

When i had a hold of myself, I could see that there was no
question about what i had to do. If they thought the old
man had killed his best friend, they obviously were
wrong. The only way to investigate the whole
case and try and find out what really had happened.

The thought of what i had been praying for has just a few 
minutes ago went through me like a cold wind. Fate had
indeed passed me a new hand, but in the unpredictable way
it always did. Now it was worse than ever. Far worse


YOUR
OBJECTIVE

The aim of the game is straight forward, if challenging to
achieve. You must clear your father of the charges against
him. To do this, you will have to investigate what as actually
did happen to David Walker, and present your evidence to
the police.

Remember -  while you wander about exploring, your
father is stuck behind bars. with his guilt becoming more 
and more of an established fact in everyone's mind. Keep 
an eye on the time passing, shown at the top of the screen 
in the office. If too many weeks go by, you will run out
of time. Finally, be sure to take care of your self - you will
be descending into a murky and dangerous world. you
have been warned!

THE 
OFFICE

You start the game in you father's office. Much of your
research and investigation will take place here. On and
around your desk are various objects which you can use
or examine. To do so, just move your mouse pointer onto
the picture of the object, and press the left mouse button
All commands in crime city are given this way.

NOTICE
BOARD

For example, to look through messages
your father had left pinned, click with the mouse on the
notice board, which is on the wall towards the right of
the office. You will then see the board enlarged. To read
a note, just click on it. In the same way, you can use
then EXIT sign in the top left corner to go back to
where you were.

DIARY

THis contains information on your father's
schedule and telephone numbers. it also has some general 
information on the game, and summary of how well you
are doing so far. Click on a section's divider to look it up.


LETTERS

From time to time, you will recieve some
mail. a letter icon will apear on the desk for you to click 
on and read.

LETTER 
RACK

Once you have read your mail, it is filed in 
the letter rack on the wall. Accessing this will allow you 
to cycle through everything you have received.

COMPUTER

The modern gumshoe is naturally equipped
with a coputer. You can use this to look up records
on various people, to order surveillance on somebody and
to use a number of telecommunication functions such as 
on line share trading, bulletin boards and possibly a 
surreptitous computer hacking. You can even pass the 
time playing a game!

By no means everything that you will need will be free.
Travel expences can mount up, and as will see,
skills training can be expensive too. Playing the 
computer's stock market is one way to generate money.
The price in pence of each share is displayed next to
the company's name. To puchase shares, click on buy
and the on the company you wish to invest in. A three
digit number will appear. Specify the number of shares 
by clicking on the +  and - icons surrounding the
number. Your holding will not het added into your cash
total until you sell them, Obviously, you want to buy
shares that look like thay will rise, and sell them at a higher
price than you paid.

The computer also contains a tradional racade game.
The aim is simple - stop the ball escaping off the
bottom of the screen, and demolish the wall at the 
top. Guide the bat left and right with the mouse. Use
it to bounce the ball back up. It will destroy any
bricks that it hits. The mouse button will start
each screen. the right quits the game.

You will have to find out about the other activities for your self!


TELEPHONE

Use this to call someone up. A panel will
appear allowing you to dial their number, and the phone
should ring. If they are in and answer the call, a dialogue
box will pop up showing what they say, and giving you a 
number of options for reply. chose one by clicking
on it. You can then ask for something else. as the co-
versation progresses and you learn more, the options will
change, allowing you to follow a train of thought through 
the diccussion.

DISK  

Use this to save or load a game, to start again,
or to quit the game. see SAVING AND LOADING, below.

TIME

Another thing you can do in the office is
to inspect and control the passage of time. A bar across
the top of the screen tells you what time  and date it is
You can also turn in for the night by clicking on the sleep 
bubble on the right of the desk.

TRAVELLING

To leave your office, just click on the icon of the map
on the wall. this will bring up a full screen map of
the area. A large arrow will indicate your current
position - the office, start with. All of the
locations you might want to visit are indicated by
small labelled arrows.

To go somewhere, simply click on the site in question.
you will be asked how you intend to travel. some ways
are quicker than others, but they tend to be more
expensive. Remember that not all places are open all of
the time, so you may have to wait around or go back if
you turn up at an unsociable hour. You can see and
advance time using the same information bar available
twenty four hours a day, don't expect to be in a clear 
state of mind for very long.

LOCATIONS

To start with there are eight locations marked on your
map. these are:

        YOUR PARENTS, HOME        
        YOUR GIRLFRIEND,S HOME
        THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
        THE POLICE STAITION
        THE HOSPITAL
        THE LOCAL PUB 
        THE CHURCH

More will apear later, as your investigations progress.

Once you are in a location, you can explore it by clicking on
any interesting objects within the scene. A message will appear
at the top of the screen telling you what you have found. look
carefully through the places you go to. Some of the things in
them are vital clues which you will need to complete the game

You will also encounter many different people during the
game. Clicking on them will allow you to start a conversation.
This will work the same way as the telephone
conversation described above.

   SAVING
   AND
   LOADING

To save a game in progress or load a previously saved
game, click on disk icon in office. You will then 
be presented with five options:

     /       /    /    /\        /        /        /           
    /       /    /    /  \      /        /        /___________

 /       /    /    /        \/        /         ___________/

Steven White, whom you play, fully characterised in -
dividual, with various natural abilities and talents. During
the course of the game, you also have the opportunity
to learn a number of skills. These will all help you in your 
quest to clear your father. Above all, though, crime city 
is a mystery game. You will need to find clues, to get 
important information from the people you meet, and so to 
piece together the entire sequence of events

Take note of all of the information in the office. It may
be useful immediately or at some point later on.

If want to know what someone is up to, watch them!

If you find someone who is willing to help you, use
them. Call on them now and again to see if
anything has come up.

Remember that the clock is ticking, and time is important.
However, you won't solve the puzzle on your first 
day on the job. Sometimes you have to call it a day, and
wait to see what tomrrow brings.

If you get stuck, take stock of the situation. Look at all 
of the infomation you have found outside or in the office.
See if there is anything you could do that just might lead
to something, even if it does not relate to your current 
problems.

End.......
