                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MEANWHILE.....
~~~~~~~~~     AFTER A GREAT MANY ADVENTURES AND A FRENETIC CHASE IN A 
SPATIO-TEMPORAL UNIVERSE,YOU HAVE FINALLY CAUGHT WITH YOUR FATHER'S
MURDERER AND YOU ARE ABOUT TO RETURN TO THE FAMILY CHATEAU IN 1922.

EXPLORA IS STILL THERE,BUT DOES THIS TECHNOLOGICAL WONDER INVENTED BY AN AGED
SCIENTIST AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HAVE ENOUGH FUEL TO
BRING YOU BACK TO YOUR ORIGINS?
UNFORTUNATELY,THE TELEPORTATION PHASE IS DISTURBED BY A MAJOR INCIDENT - A
DISORDER IN THE TEMPORAL TURBINES HAS CAUSED THE ENGINE TO OVERHEAT AND TO
USE UP TOO MUCH OF THE METAL ESSENTIAL TO FUEL THE SUPERGENERATOR.
ONCE AGAIN CATAPULTED INTO THE WORLD OF THE UNKNOWN,YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
USE EVERY LAST BIT OF INTELLIGENCE TO COME OUT ON TOP OF THESE NEW TRIALS.
YOUR MAIN PREOCCUPATION WILL BE FINDING THE METAL SO NECESSARY TO FUEL 
EXPLORA.

A BLUE LAGOON SURROUNDS YOU AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE,BUT YOU SEEM TO BE ABLE
TO MAKE OUT A ROCKY COAST LINE IN THE DISTANCE.YOU HAVE BEEN CATAPULTED ON TO
THE BRIDGE OF A VERY STRANGE SHIP;AN ODD FRIGHTENING HUMMING MIXES WITH THE
SOUND OF THE WAVES AND SEA MONSTERS JUMP OUT OF THE WATER CAUSING THE SHIP TO
FOUNDER.QUICKLY YOU THROW THE FEW COINS LEFT IN YOUR POCKET INTO THE 
SUPERGENERATORS AND FIND YOURSELF IN THE COURTYARD OF A SUMPTUOUS PALACE.WHAT
ARE THOSE METALIC SOUNDS? COULD IT BE MUSKETEERS SHARPENING THEIR FOILS? A
HORSESHOE YOU FIND ON THE GROUND WILL ONCE MORE FUEL THE SUPERGENERATOR WHICH
SEEMS TO ACCEPT ANY KIND OF METAL.SCARCELY HAVE YOU RECOVERED FROM THIS NEW
TRIP THAN YOU MEET A WOMAN AS SEDUCTIVE AND BEAUTIFUL AS THE SIRENS OF 
ANCIENT LEGEND,WHO EMBRACES YOU,CALLS YOU ULYSSES AND INVITES YOU INTO HER
BED!

GAME PLAY
~~~~~~~~~
THE SOFTWARE IN CHRONOQUEST II HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO BE "USER
FRIENDLY".THE SELECTION OF ICONS AT YOUR DISPOSAL HAVE BEEN KEPT TO A MINIMUM
SO THAT THE GAME CAN BE CONTROLLED BY ADVENTURERS OF ALL AGES.DON'T BE MISLED
HOWEVER,THE CONTROLS MAY BE SIMPLE BUT THE GAME IS FAR FROM EASY TO SOLVE!

ONLY A VERY PRECISE AND INEVITABLE ORDER WILL ALLOW YOU TO PASS THROUGH THE 
DIFFERENT STAGES AND TO RETURN TO YOUR ORIGINS.
GEOGRAPHICAL MOVEMENT WITHIN EACH OF THE 13 STAGES IS ACCOMPLISHED BY USING
THE ICONS "ADVANCE" AND "RETREAT".

TIME TRAVEL FROM ONE STAGE TO ANOTHER HAPPENS WITH THE HELP OF EXPLORA.BY 
PLACING A METAL OBJECT IN THE FABULOUS MACHINE'S REACTOR,YOU PROVIDE THE
ESSENTIAL FUEL,ALLOWING YOU TO MOVE THROUGH TIME.MOVEMENT WILL BE 
PROPORTIONAL TO THE RADIOACTIVE VALUE OF THE METAL OBJECT PLACED IN THE 
FLASHING TANK (REACTOR ACTIVATED).THE STRATEGY TO ADOPT THEREFORE IS TO JUDGE
THE VALUE AND STRENGTH OF THE DIFFERENT METAL OBJECTS YOU MUST FIND,KNOWING
THAT THEIR COMPOSITION MIGHT BE NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE.

IN ORDER TO KNOW THE RADIOACTIVE COMPOSITION OF AN OBJECT AND TO SEE THE 
POSSIBLE DESTINATIONS ON THE TEMPORAL METER,BEFORE USING THE REACTOR,YOU MUST
"EXAMINE"THE OBJECT IN THE INVENTORY WITH THE APPROPRIATE ICON.THIS OPTION IS
ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN EXPLORA IS PRESENT ON THE SCREEN (REACTOR ACTIVATED).

IN ORDER TO MOVE THROUGH TIME,YOU MUST "USE" THE DESIRED METAL OBJECT IN THE
FLASHING TANK.BUT REMEMBER,ONCE AN OBJECT IS "USED"IN THE TANK IT CANNOT BE
USED AGAIN.IT SHOULD ALSO BE REMEMBERED THAT SOME METAL OBJECTS MIGHT HAVE 
OTHER FUNCTIONS THROUGHOUT THE GAME.

THE "EXAMINE" ICON WILL HELP YOUR SEARCH FOR DIFFERENT OBJECTS.DO NOT 
HESITATE TO SEARCH IN THE SMALLEST NOOKS AND CRANNIES OF THE SCREEN.
WHEN YOU FIND AN OBJECT,IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO "PICK UP" THE ITEM 
WITH THE APPROPRIATE ICON.IT WILL THEN BECOME PART OF YOUR INVENTORY AND YOU
WILL BE ABLE TO "USE" IT WHRN YOU WISH.

YOU CAN ALSO GET RID OF UNWANTED OBJECTS BY USING THE ICON "PUT DOWN".BUT
REMEMBER,ONCE AN OBJECT IS "PUT DOWN",IT WILL BE LOST FOREVER.

THROUGHOUT YOUR JOURNEY,YOU WILL MEET MANY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS WITH WHOM YOU
CAN CONVERSE.THERE ARE A SELECTION OF ICONS DESIGNED FOR THIS FUNCTION.
THE ICON "TALK" WILL PERMIT YOU TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION.YOU WILL THEN HAVE
THE POSSIBILITY OF CHOOSING BETWEEN TWO PHRASES BY USING THE ARROW SITUATED
TO THE RIGHT OF THE PHRASES.NOW CLICK ON YOUR CHOSEN RESPONSE AND WAIT FOR 
THE CHARACTERS REPLY.

IF YOU WANT THE CHARACTER TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION,YOU MUST CLICK THE ICON
"LISTEN".YOU RESPOND BY USING THE PROCEDURE "TALK" AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED.
DURING A DIALOGUE,YOU ALSO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO "GIVE" AN OBJECT TO A
CHARACTER OR TO "USE" AN OBJECT,THANKS TO THESE TWO SUPPLEMENTARY ICONS.

WHEN A CHARACTER GIVES YOU AN OBJECT OR PROPOSES THAT YOU TAKE ONE,IT WILL
AUTOMATICALLY BE PLACED IN YOUR INVENTORY.

SOME LAST WORDS OF ADVISE BEFORE BEGINNING THIS FABULOUS ADVENTURE:
 - YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PASS THROUGH THE SAME STAGE SEVERAL TIMES,BUT MEETING 
   MOST OF THE CHARACTERS WILL ONLY TAKE PLACE ONCE.
 - BE CAREFUL:-DO NOT SYSTEMATICALLY TAKE EVERY OBJECT THAT YOU FIND AND BE
   SURE TO USE THEM WISELY.
 - USE THE "SAVE-GAME" FEATURE REGULARLY.
 - GOOD LUCK....YOU'LL NEED IT!
