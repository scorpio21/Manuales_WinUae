                       CRASH GARRETT

 
     As in the film, Crash Garrett keeps up a permanent dialog  
with a 'voice' in his head. He's the only one who can hear it.  
Nobody else knows about it. The exact nature of his 'internal  
friend' is a mystery to both Garrett and the voice itself. 
 
     When Garrett needs help he will turn to you and ask. Type in  
your idea on the keyboard and your message will show at the bottom  
of the screen. 
     Validate by pressing RETURN or ENTER. Be clear and brief. 
     Moving around. 
     To tell Garret where to go, just type GO TO GLORY'S or  
whaterever. 
     Normal adventure directions also work. 
Objects wil be available to Garrett. These can be picked up and  
will be displayed on the right of the screen. 
     Not only must you guide Garrett but you also must give him  
power. It is divided into doses at the top left corner of the  
screen. Using a dose of power helops garrett do whatever  he's  
doing more efficiently. To activate validate your order by  
pressing the '$' key instead of the normal RETURN or ENTER.
