The Plot:
*-*-*-*-*
        Out in the nether regions of Deepest space (in the far bottom right
of the Milky Way) lies a small, insignificant little planet named Blot.
Although a pretty place, its deserted after its enhabitants were froced to
flee from an awful fate - being called by such an unhip name as BLOTiANS.
As soon as they were able, they built a crude but sufficient colony ship and
spluttered off into space, in search of a trendier planet. Until such a place
was found, they renamed themselves as Fuzzy Wuzzies in search of real hipness,
(They were the original Astro Hippies from Hell).
        Unfortunately, a collision with an asteroid led to a crash landing on
Earth. As luck would have it, they landed on some blue wobbly stuff - 
commonly known as the Pacific Ocean - next to an undiscovered island.
After the Fuzzy Wuzzies swam ashore they promptly began building a village
and named the island `The Hippest Place in the Known Universe'.
        What the Fuzzies didn't know was of the existence of the none too
hip and ever so slightly irritable Demons living on the far side of the
island. These demons were more than a little peeved by all the noise made
by the cheerful Fuzzies, not to mention mildly horrified by the new island
name.
        The demons came up with a cunning plan to put an end to the commotion
and the general good time being had by these intruders - they invited them to
the biggest party ever held on the island. Fuzzies cannot resist a good party
and all of them, fur neatly brushed, attended. Just as they were starting to
enjoy themselves the demons threw a net over everyone and carted them off to 
the torture chambers, (oh dear, how could anyone wish to hurt such cute
creatures - pass the chainsaw!).
        The only one who wasn't caught was Clyde Radcliff, a tanked up little
fuzzy who was decorating the brushes with carrot peices. The next morning
Clyde awoke with a splitting headache and the remains of a camels armpit on
his tongue, needless to say his breath was so bad it could strip paint at
fifty paces.
        Nevertheless, our courageous little hero vowed to destroy the demons
and rescue his fellow Fuzzies.


Gameplay.
*-*-*-*-*
        Each stage in the game represents part of the island. Once the end of
the stage is reached and completed, Clyde enters a Witches Hut. Inside is a 
good witch who has a Fuzzy fetish and offers to mix Magic Potions which, when
drunk by Clyde, give him special weapons.
        However, to enable the witch to mix any potions, she needs
ingredients. These dome in the form of `Magic Potion Creatures' found during
each stage. Its important for Clyde to collect as many MPC's as possible
before entering the witches hut, the more MPC's you have, the better the
weapon potions can be.
        Once two stages have been completed Clyde will have to rescue one of
his buddies from a torture chamber, (don't do it Clyde). A successfull
rescue allows you to continue along with any MPC's the grateful Fuzzy donates
to your cause.


The Shop.
*-*-*-*-*
        In the Shop you can exchange Magic Potion Creatures for new and
improved weapons, (and they thought they were being rescued!!).
        Moving the joystick left and right will scroll you through the various
weapons available. Shown will be the number and type of MPC's needed and the
grade of the weapon, (weapons all come in one of three strengths).
        To select a weapon during the game, pull down on the joystick and
press the firebutton. Whilst holding the firebutton you can scroll through a
menu of previously purchased weapons, and when the weapon of your choice is
aligned with the selector, release the firebutton and come out blasting!

        o  DROOPY:        This is standard shot and travels in a 
                          downward arc.
        o  SUPER DROOPY:  Similar to your standard droop but a more 
                          gentle arc.
        o  FIREBALL:      If you have the enemy in sight don't mess
                          around, get straight to the point with 
                          this hotshot.
        o  FALL UP:       If the aerial atrocities are beginning to 
                          get your nose catch them unawares with this 
                          upward curving blast.
        o  WIGGLER:       If the nasties won't stay still select a 
                          shot that's just as energetic.
        o  CURLY WURLY:   You don't have to be too accurate with this
                          one, it goes everywhere.
        o  FLAMER:        The range may not be great but when this weapon
                          strikes the bad guys are serious toast.
        o  SCATTER BALL:  If the ball doesn't get the bounce will.
        o  INFORMATION:   With a friend in need you want all the help 
                          you can afford.
        o  EXIT:          Leave the shop to try out those newly
                          purchased goodies.

Game Hints:
*-*-*-*-*-*
        If a creature does not flash when hit, it cannot be destroyed and must
be avoided.
        Some indestructable creatures are linked to destructible ones. Blast
one and both bite the dust.
        Flashing items are collectable, but be careful where you blast, for
they are also destructible.
  
       CREATURES IS ANOTHER STONKINGLY GOOD THALAMUS EUROPE PRODUCT.
