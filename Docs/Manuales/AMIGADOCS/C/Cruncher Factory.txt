Ensure that the disc is NOT write protected. Insert the KICKSTART disc
(version 1.2). This applies to AMIGA 1000 only. 500 and 2000 versions do not
need the KICKSTART. When the computer asks for the WORKBENCH disc,
insert the CRUNCHER FACTORY disc. Please leave the disc in the drive.

PLAYING
-------
The cruncher moves about the screen eating the little dots being chased by the
monsters. The magic pills make the monsters vulnerable and they change
colour. They can now be chased and destroyed only to re-appear again.
Sometimes a fruit appears and can be eaten for bonus points.

To start the game, press the joystick button (port 2) when the title screen
appears. The main menu will now appear.

Move joystick UP or DOWN to select the start level. Move joystick left or right to
select.

Enter The Game - Takes you to the game menu.
Score Table    - Shows the points for each object.
High Score     - Shows the high score table.
Level Editor   - Allows you to create your own labyrinths.

Press the Joystick Button to make the selection.

When you select Enter The Game option, move the joystick Left and Right to
select ONE PLAYER or TEAM or COMPETITION.

In TEAM mode, two players play together as a team for one score while in the
COMPETITION mode, they play for individual scores.

LEVEL EDITOR - You can build your own mazes and play them later. At the
bottom of the screen, following symbols are displayed from left to right.

WALL - POINT - MAGIC PILL - STARTING POINT FOR THE CRUNCHER -
STARTING POINT FOR THE MONSTER - MONSTER EXIT - SECRET
PASSAGE (players only) - ERASE - EDITOR EXIT - SAVE - LOAD. Use
joystick (or F1 - F10) to move the red rectangle to any one of the options and
press the joystick button to select. Place the selected object in the playing area.
When you have finished, use cursor keys to give the new maze a level number.
Keys F (Fill), C (Clear) and U (Undo) can be used to help in the design.

During the game, you can pause using the SPACE BAR or abort using the
ESCAPE key. The BACKSPACE key removes the small wall that appears from
time to time during the game. The key combinations ALT-HELP, CTRL-ALT,
TWO AMIGA KEYS and decimal point on the numeric pad have special
functions and the players are invited to try these functions.
