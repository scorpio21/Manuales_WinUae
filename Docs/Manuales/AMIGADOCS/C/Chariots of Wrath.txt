                          TYPED BY THE TWINS OF TRILOGY

 While fighting for your King in far off lands, you, Prince Agar of the
Forgotten Kingdom, have been commanded to remain in the King's castle
following accusations of excessive acts of barbarism in battle.
Confined to your quarters, suddenly a Bard tells you that the Baronn,
your arch-rival, has brutally kidnapped Princess Arthena - your future
Queen.

 Enraged by the terrible news, you have no option but to disobey your
King, and return to save your Princess - and at the same rid the world
of the Baron for ever. So once again, you wearily climb into your space
chariot, and commence the voyage home.

 The journey will be far from easy. On the way you must cross paths on
which many travellers have perished, and few survived. Your only
guidance comes from the Bard, who's map will direct you, and who's
warnings of what lies ahead you should heed.

 But you have to do it - to save Arthena from the evil Baron...

 In the rush to escape from the King's castle unnoticed, you were
unable to replenish your chariot's fuel and weapon supplies. You
therefore have only a simple light-bolt gun with which to confront any
foes your perchance might meet. You should look out for any weaponary
dropped by slain attackers - you will need all the help you can get if
you are to succeed in your quest. Fuel will also be available on your
journey.

 There can be no other help - the way ahead is far from clear, its
hazards unknown. You must be alert at all times, and must ride swiftly,
ever watchful of the need to use your light-bolts should anyone, or
anything, attempt to hinder your voyage.

 Your chariots is controlled by joystick. To launch a smart bomb,
rotate the joystick around 360 degrees without pressing the fire
button.

 THAT'S ALL FOLKS   THE TWINS/TRILOGY IN AUGUST
