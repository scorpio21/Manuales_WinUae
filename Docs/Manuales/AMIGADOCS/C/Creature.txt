                           Creature Manual

Distress calls received from deep space report hostile alien life forms,
and you are the only space security captain within range.  A spaceship,
a space station and a lunar base have been attacked and only you can
save them from complete destruction.  As you make your journey towards
them, you wonder what you're up against.  Are you prepared to battle
vicious beastoids, alien attack-droids, and deadly acid leaks on your
own?  Unfortunately, that's the way it has to be.  Nearing the first
ship, your heart races, beating faster and harder with each passing
moment.  Before losing contact, the message stated that a reactor was
set to self-destruct to prevent the ship from falling into alien hands.
Where is the reactor?  And how soon will it go off?  These are just a
few of the uncertainties, for what you are really up against is still
a mystery.  Rumors describe an unstoppable beast that lurks within the
walls of the space station.  This may turn out to be your worst
nightmare, for it is...
                           C R E A T U R E

                              ATTENTION

   For those who can't control the urge to play Creature without reading
the manual be advised that your goal to destroy the Mother Creature will
take more than just shooting everything that moves.  Briefly, you must
go to the ship, get important material, disarm the nuclear reactor and
then put the explosives in the teleporter room on the moon.  Good Luck!!!

                              REMEMBER

                 If all else fails, read this manual.

Important Notices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   MEMORY REQUIREMENTS.  Creature requires 512K of memory.  Additional
sound effects and enhanced graphics are automatically available in 1
meg machines.

   DISK DRIVES.  Each floppy disk drive or hard disk you have requires
some of the computer's memory.  Creature will work in a 512K AMIGA with
up to two drives connected.  If you have more drives you may find you
need to remove the additional drives.  If you have a hard drive with
512K and multiple partitions, you may also run out of memory.

   DEMO MODE.  A continuous demo starts from the Creature title screen
when no input is sensed for approximately 30 seconds.  If the demo mode
begins, just press the gun trigger or left mouse button to begin.

   SKIPPING THE INTRO.  Once you have seen the introduction sequence,
you may skip it by hitting the left mouse button, or pulling the phaser
gun trigger.

   PAUSE.  To pause the game hit the keyboard's "Space Bar", hit again
to start.

   HIGH SCORE TABLE.  Creature lets you save the top players.  If the
disk is write protected, the top players will be saved only for the
playing session.  If the disk is write enabled, the top players scores
are saved to disk for future reference.

   GUN USERS.  The Actionware Phaser gun makes games very unique.  Capone,
POW, and SideShow are perfect examples.  Creature also makes use of the
gun.

   DUAL GUN USERS.  Creature allow users with 2 phaser guns and the dual
gun interface to play simultaneously like previous gun games Capone and
POW.  See directions for proper connection of the dual gun interface.

   SOUND EFFECTS.  For best results connect your AMIGA to a Stereo
System with good bass response and pump up the volume.

AMIGA Loading Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Turn on your AMIGA and monitor in the normal manner.  Insert Creature
   disk ORBIT1 into the internal drive (df0:) when the display prompts
   for a WORKBENCH disk, AMIGA 1000 users must insert the KickStart disk
   first.
2) Using your mouse move the pointer to the Program Disk Icon and double
   click.  When the Creature icon appears double-click on it and the
   program will begin.
3) Choosing your weapon
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Assuming you have your gun or mouse connected as indicated elsewhere
   in this manual, the program detects your weapon at the Creature Title
   Screen.  Press the left mouse button or pull the gun trigger to
   select mouse or gun respectively.

   Note: You will be required to insert the ORBIT 2 disk.  For your
   convenience you will no longer need the ORBIT 1 disk.

                      Mouse users skip to instruction 6
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4) 1 or 2 Gun Players (Not available in Mouse Mode)
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Only users with 2 Phaser Guns and the Dual Gun interface can play
   Creature with a partner simultaneously.  To select this mode, using
   a gun shoot at the PLAYER 2 area on the control panel.  Shoot again
   to toggle back to singe player/

5) AIMING (GUNSIGHT CALIBRATION)
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   From the control panel screen press the letter "A" (not the AMIGA
   key).  The aiming screen will appear.  Aim your gun at the center of
   the crosshairs, then press (and hold) the gun trigger.  The shot
   will follow your gun's aim.  Repeatedly strike the arrow keys to align
   your shot.  Note: we say repeatedly because the increments of
   movement are small.  Don't be worried if your gun shots jump around;
   this movement is normal.  When your sights are calibrated, hit the
   SPACE BAR to continue.
   If you are using two guns with the DUAL GUN INTERFACE, each player will
   have the opportunity to aim (calibrate) his or her gun sights
   seperately by pressing the 1 or 2 key to select either gun.
6) Select Destination
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   After you have selected a destination, you will be asked to consult
   your codewheel.  (Not anymore, this sucker has been cracked)

HARD DISK INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The program SETUP located on the Orbit 1 disk moves Creature to a hard
disk.  With disk ORBIT 1 inserted in DF0:.  From the CLI type SETUP or
from the WORKBENCH double click on the SETUP icon.  Under the SETUP
menu select INSTALL, you will be prompted for the proper action to
perform.

YOUR MISSION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Responding to the distress call, you hurry to save a spaceship, a
space station, and the lunar base that have become infested with Creatures.
Armed only with your light phaser gun, you make your way onto the ship.
Finding nothing valuable, the Creature has abandoned the ship, but it
left behind its own guard dogs, beastoids that fire weapons to protect
their evil master.  You must survive their attack to find life
sustaining supplies and the key needed to disarm the reactor.  Upon
retrieving these important supplies, you must quickly leave the ship
and return to the docking bay to get back to your own spaceship and
begin the short ride to the terror-filled space station.
   You quickly realize that your stay on the space station will not be
pleasant, for the danger here is much greater and your task more life-
threatening.  You must gather more essential supplies, but more
importantly, you must disarm the reactor before it self-destructs.  You
have the key, but where is the reactor?  No one said these missions
were easy!  What makes your job so difficult are the surprises the
aliens left behind: alien attack-droids, acid leaks, and more vicious
beastoids.  Once you've succeeded in disarming the reactor, you
must survive long enough to make your way back out.
   As you head towards the underground station, you realize that you
have yet to see the Creature.  It doesn't take much common sense to
figure  long enough to make your leaks, and more vicious
beastoids.   where it's hiding and that worries you.  How much worse can
it get?  When you land on the planet's surface, you are relieved
to see that a space-scooter has been left behind.  You cautiously board
the scooter and begin your descent down the shaft and towards the lunar
base.  After fighting your way down the shaft and along the tunnel,
you reach the base itself, where you finally encounter the dreaded
Creature.  You quickly realize that your worst fears were nothing
compared to reality.  The Creature can't be killed!  Your light phaser
can only stun it!  Repeat hits will prolong its dormant state, but that
won't make your job easy.  Ward off the aliens' attack while looking for
more provisions and the explosives needed to destroy the transportation
unit that the Creature will otherwise use to send for more of his own
kind.  Place the explosives by the unit and set the timer.  However,
there will be Queen Creatures lurking in many of the store rooms
that will try to prevent you from collecting the items you need.
   If you can, make it back to the moon's surface with your supplies
and your mission will be declared victorious! (Piece of cake).

The Scoreboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   On the top of the screen is located a box which indicates important
supply levels.  The levels are Energy 1, Energy 2, Distance, Damage,
Air and Fuel.  A solid green line means a full supply, but as the supply
id depleted, it begins to turn red becoming a solid red line on empty.
Keep an eye on those because if vital supplies such as air or damage
reach a full red line your mission will come to a quick end.
      ENERGY 1 and 2 refers to the charge left on your light phaser.
  Replenish your supply by finding energy hidden on board the ships.
      DISTANCE indicates how far away you are from exits.  It is also
  used as you are traveling through the shaft and the tunnel.  It shows
  relatively how far you have gone through the shaft or tunnel and how
  much farther there is to the end.
      DAMAGE level indicates how badly you have been hurt.  Being hit
  by the beastoids' and the Creature's missiles, the droids' plasma
  bolts, and the acid drips will increase your damage level and it may
  become great enough to kill you.  Your damage level will decrease
  slowly over time if you protect yourself well enough to heal.
      AIR supply is measured by this level indicator.  You must find
  oxygen to stay alive long enough to finish your mission!
      FUEL is almost as crucial as oxygen for the completion of your
  mission.  You may not be able to leave the ships without finding more
  fuel because you will use up your own fuel supply each time you
  travel between ships.
      The CLONE indicator tells you how many lives you have left.  Upon
  hearing the distress call, you started making clones of yourself
  realizing that you needed all the help you could get.  By the time
  you reached the first ship, the cloning devices on your ship had only
  made 2 clones.  Thus, you begin the game with 3 lives.  Each time you
  are killed, a new clone boards the ship to continue your mission.
  Additional clones of yourself are produced each time you get 15,000
  points.
      The CLOCK is a timer that lets you know how long you have been
  on your mission.  The clock is crucial when you are on the space
  station because it tells you how much longer you have before the
  reactor self-destructs!  On the lunar base the clock begins to count
  down once you have placed the bomb, giving you just minutes to get
  more energy and get out!
      The MAP window shows the route you have taken on the ship.  You
  are indicated by a red dot which moves as you do trailing a green line
  showing your course.  This is especially helpful when you make your
  way back out of the ships.
      The MASER BOMBS indicates the number of masers (smart bombs)
  available.  A Maser destroys all harmful creatures except the Mother.
  Strike the "M" key on the keyboard to activate.

   Hit the PHASER GLOBE whenever possible.  This will give your mouse or
gun 100 rapid fire shots (like a machine gun).  This can come in very
handy.

   Hit the MEDIC DROID whenever possible.  This will repair damage that
you have sustained.

CONTROLLING YOUR MOVEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The person in the spacesuit is you.  You will automatically walk
forward, turning around at dead ends, as well as automatically
retrieve supplies from open doors and perform other necessary tasks
such as disarming the reactor and placing the explosives by the
teleportation unit.  You as a player need to do nothing to stimulate
these actions.

            Controlling your movement depends on your weapon.
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   MOUSE USERS.  Press the right button of the mouse to turn yourself
around (left button is used for shooting).
   GUN USERS.  Change your direction by firing at the bottom of the
scoreboard.

   Firing your gun or mouse is also required to go up and down ladders
as well as to open doors.  While you are facing a ladder, fire at its
base to go down it or fire at its top to go up.  You may also change
direction while on the ladder.

                              Hints
1. Don't waste bullets.
2. Don't waste time, the more time you take gives the Creatures more time
   to multiply.
3. Be careful at what you are shooting at.  There are both good and bad
   objects to hit.
4. When you find yourself blinking, you cannot die, take advantage of
   your omnipotence.
5. Don't let the Beastoids or Creatures get you, they will tear you to
   shreds.

Putting Yourself in Space (The Death Scene)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   We have made it possible for you to actually put yourself, a friend,
or enemy into the Creature Dieing scene.  It requires you to paint or
digitize yourself using a paint program or a digitizer/camera.  It also
requires some skill.  Here's how:

   Before making any changes, be sure to backup your disks!

   There are 3 important files located on the Orbit 1 disk.
      TEMPLATE.IFF.  This file contains the proper palette and size
                     requirements.   
      PLAYER.IFF.  This file is the graphic before being attached.
      SKULL.IFF.  This is the graphic after being attached. 

       1) Use your paint program to load in the TEMPLATE.IFF from Orbit 1.

       2) Draw the image you want into the indicated area in the
          template.  The image can be anything you want as long as it fits
          within the boundaries.

       3) IMPORTANT !!!  Save only the image youve just painted (not the
          entire picture) as a brush (not a picture) with the name
          "PLAYER.IFF".  In Deluxe Paint for example, you would capture
          the image using the BRUSH SELECTOR gadget in the toolbox then
          save it as a brush.

       4) Repeat this again for the "after" graphic and save as
          "SKULL.IFF".

       5) Exit your paint program and return to the CLI or WORKBENCH.

       6) With disk Orbit 1 inserted in DF0: from the CLI type SETUP.
          From the WORKBENCH double click on the SETUP icon.

       7) Under the INTERACTOR menu there is ADD PLAYER, ADD SKULL,
          REMOVE PLAYER, REMOVE SKULL, HARDDISK/FLOPPY (Floppy is
          default).

       8) To add the new Player Face select ADD PLAYER.  The program
          will look into the current directory for the file PLAYER.IFF
          and install it in the the game.   

       9) ADD SKULL installs the Skull face.

      10) REMOVE PLAYER, restores the default Player face.

      11) REMOVE SKULL, restores the default Skull face.

      12) Select QUIT to exit the program.

IMPORTANT:  We at Actionware think we are breaking new ground in offering
this unique ability.  We suggest only users familiar with a paint 
program and manipulating disk files should try this.  If you have
difficulty, we suggest you consult your local dealer whom we rely on
to support our products.
