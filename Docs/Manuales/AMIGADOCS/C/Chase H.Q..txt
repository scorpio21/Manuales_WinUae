The heat is on! The steaming roads beckon your turbo-charged Porsche 928 as
the screeching of tyres in the distance heralds another crime being
committed.
"This is Nancy at Chase HQ" - we gotta few perps to catch, Algernon. Looks
like you ain't gonna get much sleep tonight"
"Gotcha, Nancy baby! We're on our way!"
Details of the perpetrators vehicles flash across your in-car computer
screen as you tear away down the busy L.A. streets in search of your
quarry.
You are the head of SCI (Special Criminal Investigation) and the type of
guys you chase don't stop for no-one! After years of experience, you have
discovered that the only way of stopping these people is to ram 'em off the
road!
Your limited Turbo Chargers help you catch up, but these guys seem to drive
the best (and fastest) sports cars on the road, so catchin 'em ain't easy.

                                  CONTROLS
				  --------

This is a one player game which is controlled by joystick only. Press fire
button on the joystick to change gear.
SPACE BAR - TURBO
CONTROL/ESC - QUIT
If you run out of time during play you can press SPACE BAR to continue if
you have credits remaining.

                             STATUS AND SCORING
			     ------------------

You have 60 seconds to catch up with the target vehicle and then a further
60 seconds in which to ram it off the road.
Points are scored as you progress along the road.
Points are also awarded for passing cars as follows:-
First car passed - 200 points
Second car passed - 400 points
This continues up to 8,000 point, but if you hit another car (other than
your target) the scoring will restart from 200 points.
When you reach the target vehicle you will score 10,000 points for each hit
on the first level and 20,000 points for each hit on the second level etc.
There is also a 'hidden' special bonus which may be awarded.
Points are also awarded for time remaining on each level, with a cumulative
bonus for completing each level starting at 100,000 points.
There will be an extra bonus for completing the game.
When you catch up with the criminals car the hit indicator will appear on
the screen. This will show how many times you have to hit the target
vehicle; when this indicator is full your car will automatically overtake
the criminals and stop them.

                                  GAMEPLAY
				  --------

Your instructions come from Nancy at Chase Headquaters as she sends a
description of the criminals vehicle to your on-board computer. You have
limited time to catch up to the villian, at which point you will be
allotted a further time bonus to force him off the road. To achieve this
you must ram his car a number of times - as shown on your status panel. If
you run into any other vehicles this will slow you down and make the
capture more difficult. However, you have a limited number of Turbo Boosts
which will give you extra acceleration for a very short period. Use them
wisely! When you have inflicted the necessary number of collisions, the
criminals car will pull over to the side of the road, and you can arrest
him.
There are five missions in all, each successively tougher than the last,
taking you over various landscapes and through different towns.
Occasionally you will be presented with a fork in the road and an arrow
will indicate the shortest route to take. A constant hazard is the presence
of other innocent, but appalling drivers whom you must avoid, or pay the
time penalty.
The clock is ticking, crimes are being committed, your Porsche is tanked-up
and the bad guys are getting away.
"LET'S GO MR. DRIVER!"

                               HINTS AND TIPS
			       --------------

Only use your turbo when ramming the target vehicle.
Slow down when the road splits and follow the correct turn-off.
Take your time when 'bashing' to increase your score.
Try and find the hidden bonuses.
You will score less for using the continue-play option.
