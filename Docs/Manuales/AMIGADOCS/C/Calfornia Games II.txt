                   California Games ][ - Real Quick Docs

    California Games ][ takes up right where California Games
    left off!  Start out blowing by some surfers as you catch
    a few waves on your body board.  Then freeze them off on
    your snow board.  Also try jet skiing, hang gliding and
    more!  Five new events.



         HANG GLIDING

         In this event you over look one of the many cliffs in
      California, and it is from here that you'll compete in
      the Hang Gliding event.  First, watch the wind-sock, and
      when it blows to the left then begin your aerial assault.
      Move the glider left & right to try to gain altitude, and
      the slowly work your way across the screen.  You will now
      see three rubber tires, which you can try to hit with your
      five (5) water balloons (it proves to be somewhat difficult).
      You can also try to do a few 540 degree spins, or loops. Now
      you may continue skimming across the Ocean, or you can turn
      back and land from where you started (1000 Point Bonus).

         BODY BOARDING

         This event was relatively easy.  You simply paddle out and
      catch a wave.  From here you can turn back & forth, ride the
      crest of the wave, or do a few "loop-da-loops".  Be careful
      not to go over the peak of the wave and succumb to the tide.
      Once you ride the wave out, you must not dodge the obstacles
      in the water and then you'll arrive at the beach where you
      will receive a standing ovation (even from the guy drinking
      the Shiner Bock Beer in his reclining chair!).

         SNOW BOARDING

         Snow Boarding was the most difficult, simply because I
      couldn't figure out where to go with the damn Helicopter.
      You board the helicopter on the beach, and it allows you
      to travel to the top of the mountain.  There is a platform
      here where you can drop yourself onto, and you can rest,
      relax, & enjoy the view!  Or you can drop yourself off
      to the immediate Left of the Platform (the icey white
      slopes).  Once on the slopes, you try to avoid the lumps
      of wood, the jagged rocks, & the hidden depressions in
      the snow.  The Second Stage is a basin where you can
      "Free-Form" Snow board by carving up the powder.  Just
      gain speed from going back 'n forth and then try a few
      aerial spins to "Rack up the Points".  The Third Stage
      entails making it to the bottom of the mountain, by
      again avoiding the obstacles.  If you make it down in
      One-piece you will again be greeted with a round of
      applause.

         JET-SKIING

         In the Jet-skiing event you solely race against the clock.
      By staying inside the buoys, and running full throttle in the
      straight aways you will increase your score.  The graphics are
      good, and I had been looking forward to playing this event
      from the ads that I had read (Plus I own a Jet Ski!), but
      this was by far the most disappointing/boring event in the
      game.

         SKATEBOARDING

         Much work went into creating this event.  There is an
      opening animation screen which shows a Skater jumping over
      the lawn, and then down the street to the jump, and then
      into the air.  Once you are skating yourself you can do
      hand-plants, etc. and it all works on the same principal
      as the Snow boarding Free Style event.
        * Be careful to go into the center of the Tubes, because
      if your out to the side you'll smack into the wall (which
      will show you slumping to the ground with blood stains on
      the wall!) *
        If you're not careful, you will end up seeing your own
      funeral, Literally!
