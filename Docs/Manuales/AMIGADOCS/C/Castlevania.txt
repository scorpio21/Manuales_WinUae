Castlevania 
Typed by John 'Fireball' Dagen" <jdd@lancnews.infi.net>.


Notes from the typer:

*I have left out the password table which is halfway through the
document. Sorry, but the thing is HUGE,and if someone else wants to
put in all 640 passwords, then it is perfectly all right with
me. You'll just have to find yourselves a hacked copy to play the
game, which shouldn't be too hard. -jd

*Also, there are a LOT of graphics I had to leave out from the manual.
Every item on the "TOLLS TO DEFANG THE COUNT" section, plus every
enemy on the "FEATURE CREATURES" and "PRIMARY EVILS" section has an
accompanying illustration.Unfortunately, you'll have to do without
them. -jd

*On a final note, the table in the "TOOLS TO DEFANG THE COUNT" section
is a bit rough, but I did the best job I could. Unfortunately, plain
vanilla text does not have the luxuries of justified spacing and
different font sizes, but the manual did. So in case you were
wondering why it looks so rough,that's why. I hope all the hard work I
put into this was worthwile and that it'll help someone else out! -jd

GOOD EEEEVENING!

Step into the shadows of the deadliest dwelling on Earth. You've
arrived at Castlevania, and you're here on business: To destroy
forever the curse of Evil Count Dracula.

Unfortunately, everybody's home this evening. Bats, ghosts, dead
heads,every kind of creature you can imagine. You'll find them all
over the place. If they don't find you first.

And to survive you've got to sneak and creak through six monstrous
floors before you meet up with the master of the house.Your mystic
whip will help, and you'll probably find a weapon or two along the
way.

But the fun will really begin when you make it to the tower, where you
can count (get it?!) on a duel to the death with the death defying
Count.

YOUR MAIN OBJECTIVE(BESIDES JUST SURVIVING!)

The object is to move through the passages and stairways of the castle
to reach the tower,dodging or destroying every creature in your path
until you find and destroy the Count.Use the controls, as directed, to
activate your mystic whip, special weapons and magical items you'll
find along the way. Be sure to capture hearts and crystals.

A hint from the Great Beyond:Be sure to watch for magic walls that
lead to secret doors and passageways.
