ABOUT CAPONE

CAPONE, is one of several new style action adventures that requires the
agility and marksmanship of an action arcade game, but also gives the
atmosphere of an adventure.

The 20's in Chicago was a rough time.  A time when gangsters rules the
street, crime was a way of life and corruption was everywhere.  Don't sit
back and take it anymore, pick up your machine gun and blow'em away.

As the adventure begins you find yourself back in the 20's.  The streets are
quiet.  It seems a day like any other.  As an undercover copy you have seen
a lot of crime, too much crime.  You hurry to catch a bus when a window
shatters across the street.  A gunshot rungs out and the pain in your leg
tells you where the bullet hit. "It's one guy", you say to yourself.  But
as you look across the street at the house where the bullet came from you
find you're in big trouble.  Every member of the mob is there to get you. 
Resigning yourself to your desperate plight, you hurl yourself to a parked
car for protection and start giving them a taste of their own medicine.

And so the adventure begins...

The gun icons indicate the number of time you can be hit before the game is
over.  You will start out with 3 guns (lives)_ and if you are good enough,
you can accumulate up to 6 guns.  The bullet icons are very important since
they show the number of bullets you have.

Good things to hit.

Gangsters in Window............50 and up
Dynamite.......................50 and up
Machine Gun....................500
Mystery........................30,000 & 6 lives

Women on street...............-2,000
Cats..........................-1,000

HINTS

1) Don't hit innocent people, kids, dogs, cats, etc.

2) Don't shoot too fast, you'll run out of bullets.

3) Try to shoot the gangsters as soon as they appear since you
   will get more points.

4) Younger players (or those who are not marksmen) may prefer the
   mouse over the gun, it is a little easier.

5) Outside the post office is a surprise, can you find it? It's worth
   30,000 points and 6 lives. 

6) When the machine gun appears on the street, hit it to turn your revolver
into a machine gun. 

7) If you loose all your lives, you are given an 8 second period to
continue from the point that you left rather than going back to the
beginning.  This is of course cheating!

8) Avoid the machine gun in the warehouse, believe me you don't want it. 

9) Don't hit TNT in the warehouse. 

10) Beware of hidden dynamite sticks.
