		*** FULL DOCS FOR: THE COOL CROC TWINS ***

THE GAME
~~~~~~~~

Punk Croc & Funk Croc are twins, as handsome and sophisticated as each
other. Daisy (Daisy Crocette) is smitten with them both as any 
Crocette in het right mind (or left) would be. Unable to decide 
between the two twins, she has forsaken love and run off to a 
Crockery, leaving Punk & Funk to battle through 60 screens to win back
her hand.

The game is a straight forward platform game for 1 or 2 players, 
playable on joystick(s) only.

Om the title screen you may select 1 Player, 2 Player, Joystick or 
codes. The joystick allows you to use the `classic' control mechanism 
(up/down/left/right & fire to jump) or the default `special' control 
where moving the joystick right moves Punk (or Funk) clockwise around 
a platform and moving it left moves him anti-clockwise. This control 
mechanism is harder to begin with but practise really pays off and 
improves the playability no end.

If the program appears to wait/pause at any point (eg. When bonus 
score is displayed) simply press the fire button to continue gameplay.
Hi-scores can also be loaded and saved from the disk.

As for the actual way to play the game, here are the guys to take you 
through it:

Funk: Yo!
Punk: We are...
P&F:  THE COOL CROC TWINS!
Punk: You`re gonna steer me thru' 60 slammin levels to get me stepping
      out with Daisy, right!
Funk: Or me, man, that`d be cool too.
Punk: Just hit FIRE to jump and light all them lights to zap thru' the
      levels.
Funk: Uh-huh. Tell it like it is, bro.
Punk: On the way, watch out for nasty little suckers switching the 
      lights back off - don`t touch those things, man, they`re lethal.
Funk: They sure are. But hit them in mid-air or land on them and they 
      like dissappear, man.
Punk: SPLAT!
Funk: Giving cool bonuses like....
Punk: Don`t tell `em. Let `em find out for themselves.
Funk: Whatever you say, bro, Do you think I should tell them about the
      Special blocks and stuff?
Punk: Nah. They`ll pick it up, if you dont like it - TOUGH!
Funk: Or you could switch to Classic control just to get up and 
      funkin`.
Punk: Yeah, if you cant take the pace. Its tough out there. 
      Remember... 
Funk: Stay Cool,
Punk: And keep on Crockin`
