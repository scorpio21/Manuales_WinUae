SOURCE; HARRIS THE POLICEMAN
RE; THE COOL WORLD DOODLES AND THE EXPLODING UNIVERSE.

COPIES TO; ALL THE DEPARTMENT HEADS

THE FACTS
---------
THE DOODLES ARE USING CONNECTING VORTEXES BETWEEN COOL WORLD AND THE REAL
WORLD TO TRANSFER OBJECTS FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER, THIS IS SERIOUSLY 
DISTURBING THE COSMIC BALANCE. THE DIRECT RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS WILL BE
DESTRUCTION OF THE UNIVERSE...GOODBYE TOMMORROW - HELLO OBLIVION.

THE SOLUTION
------------
BASED UPON MUCH CAREFUL STUDY OF INFORMATION RECIEVED AND THE `GOOD
POLICEMANS HANDBOOK`, (SECTION 47,PARAGRAPH 12 ) WHAT TO DO WHEN THE
UNIVERSES IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE DUE TO DOODLE INTERFERENCE WITH THE COSMIC
BALANCE) I PLAN TO USE THE VORTEXES IN A SIMILAR MANNER AND RESTORE ALL
OBJECTS TO THEIR RIGHTFUL PLACES. THE DIRECT RESULT OF THIS ACTION WILL BE
NORMAL CONTINUATION OF THE UNIVERSE.

REQUIREMENTS

                             --------
HARRIS MUST FIRST TRAVEL THE COOL WORLD STREETS TO THE DISTURBANCE,
SHOOTING DOODLES, AND COLLECTING COINS TO BRIBE HIS WAY PAST THE DOOR 
TO THE LEVEL.

IN THE LEVEL ITSELF THE DOODLES ARE MOVING OBJECTS FROM THE REAL WORLD INTO
COOL WORLD,IF THEY ARE NOT STOPPED THE UNIVERSE MAY EXPLODE.

IF YOU COMPLETE ALL 16 LEVELS YOU WILL THEN HAVE TO BATTLE WITH THE EVIL
HOLI DISGUISED AS A CLOWN.

ON EACH LEVEL THE DOODLES WILL TRY TO ENTER THE REAL WORLD THROUGH
VORTEXES.IF THEY SUCCEED THEY WILL PUSH OBJECTS BACK TO COOL WORLD AND
CREATE A COSMIC IMBALANCE.

THE MORE DOODLES THAT MAKE IT MTHROUGH TO THE REAL WORLD. THE MORE OBJECTS
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PUSH BACK TO COOL WORLD. THE DANGER BAR COUNTS UP AS
THE NUMBER OF DOODLES IN THE REAL WORLD GROWS. WHEN THE BAR IS FULL THE
IMBALANCE IS TOO GREAT AND YOU WILL NOT SURVIVE.

IN ORDER TO COMPLETE A LEVEL YOU MUST DESTROY THE DOODLES BY SHOOTING AND
SUCKING THEM UP WITH YOUR HANDY PEN,RETURN THE OBJECTS AND MAINTAIN THE
BALANCE FOR THE DURATION OF THE TIME LIMIT.

SUCKING BUBBLES INTO YOUR PEN DESTROYS DOODLES.HOWEVER, SHOOTING THE
BUBBLES OR LEAVING THEM MEANS THEY BECOME WOODEN NICKEL BAITERS!. SUCKING
BUBBLES INTO YOUR PEN WILL DECREASE YOUR TIME LIMIT,AND IF YOU LOSE A LIFE
YOUR TIME LIMIT WILL BE INCREASED.
