"MEDIABREAK NEWS" is loaded up and the player is presented with the
night's headlines. Each headline is a different type of game section.
This allows the player instant access into different sections [these
sections are totally different from the game].

ARCADE SECTION 1 : DRIVING
--------------------------
The police force is on strike as Detroit becomes a 'no go' zone. On
the highways Robocop is attempting to apprehend runaway drivers &
stolen vehicles.

ARCADE SECTION 2 : STREET FIGHT
-------------------------------
The back streets of the city are plagued by punks who bring terror to
the neighbourhood. Robocop is about to clean up !

ARCADE SECTION 3 : HOSTAGE SITUATION
------------------------------------
OCP tower is in the hands of a terrorist faction who are holding the
executives hostage for a billion dollar ransom...
Nobody plans on paying it. So robocop must penetrate the tower &
destroy all the terrorists.

ARCADE SECTION 4 : FLYING
-------------------------
Security concepts are proud to present the latest addition to the
robocop inventory, a gyropack! A trail combat situation has been
arranged against the military over the skies of old Detroit.

ARCADE SECTION 5 : HAND TO HAND COMBAT
--------------------------------------
A new robotic ninja has been created by Hanemetsu industries who are
keen to impress the world of it's superior combat facilities. Only one
person is up to the job...Robocop !

After the section has been completed you then return to the main
arcade selection menu. If you are eliminated or fail to complete your
mission, you return to Mediabreak, then a high score table.

                   The story so far...

It has been 6 months since the announcement of the delta city project;
OCP are now in a desperate situation as they stand to lose billions of
dollars if work does not commence within the week. The citizens of old
Detroit have been reluctant to move from their homes so OCP has hired
a special army group called THE REHABS. They are urban rehabillitation
officers, who are routing people from their homes...

        ROBOCOP IS DRAWN INTO A BATTLE AGAINST THE AUTHORITIES
         AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF DELTA CITY MOVES EVER CLOSER.

The movie section of the game runs like an adventure. Like all
adventures it has many twists and turns, so it is difficult to give an
accurate flow of how the game will run. So we are not attempting to do
so! Media break is used to provide an update of the events so far and
creates the back drop to the game.

NOTE : While loading mediabreak hold down ESCAPE to abort loading.

                        DIRECTIVES:

                   1.PROTECT THE INNOCENT
                   2.UPHOLD THE LAW
                   3.SERVE THE PUBLIC TRUST
ROBOCOP cannot violate these prime objectives - any violation will
result in shut down. In the game Robocop is able to function in all
environments. He is capable of walking,flying,driving & all forms of
combat.

DRIVING SECTION
---------------
As a member of the metropolitan police force of Detroit, the security
concepts ROBOCOP will be provided with a police turbo cruiser for
active patrol duty.

PAGE 6
******

DESCRIPTION OF THE WORLD
------------------------
1.Active Patrol Area [also refer to map of Detroit]
All of Detroit's precincts are within the jurisdiction of Robocop from
up north & west to the interstate and south and east to the seaway and
Canada. A restraining device has been fitted to the vehicle so the
city boundaries are not violated.

Robocop has also been provided with full geographical data of the
city, complete with map displays, radars and location pointers to aid
navigation around the city.

The city is split into different urban areas:
1.Downtown business district complete with skyscrapers and modern
ultra
                 tech show case buildings.
2.The surburbs, the outskirts of the city with nice housing, tree's &
                       shopping mall.
3.The docks, an industrial area showing signs of decay as the
recession
                         bites hard.
4.The inner city of old Detroit, the run down slum area of Detroit
where
  the site of Delta city is to be laid [This area is now sealed off
with
                  an electrified perimeter fence].

On the map, particular attention has been put to the main areas
involved in the game. At various times during the game, you may need
to visit some of these locations :-

PAGE 7
******

1. Rocket Motors - Abandoned disused car factory.
2.   OCP Tower   - The HQ of OCP.
3.   Metro South Police HQ.
4.   Twenty-four hour hotel.
5.   Church

In some driving sections, when you arrive at any of these locations
the computer automatically takes over the game as the player see's a
graphic backdrop with the 3D superimposed over it. From this point,
Robocop will be on foot.

Whilst on patrol Robocop will recieve mission orders,reports and
updates from police HQ. This data will be printed across Robocop's
visor. It is through this system that mission orders will be conveyed
to Robocop. Missions will include apprehending stolen "411" vehicles
and the capture or destruction of criminals.
It is likely, during patrol, that gunfire will be aimed from these
vehicles; great care should be taken to avoid the unneccesary gun-
fire.

DRIVING PARAMETERS
------------------
The turbo cruiser is a fast efficient police car, it is able to
accelerate to 60mph in 8 seconds with a top speed of 140 mph.
It is able to pull hard at fast speeds & decelerate rapidly for
turning corners, making it less hazardous.

PAGE 8
******

The vehicle's Turbo boost cuts in at 30mph up to 80mph, which is very
useful for overtaking and for accelerating out of tight corners.

DISPLAYS
--------
The car dashboard has a speedometer mounted in the middle of the
console and a map on the left hand side. On the steering wheel a small
white display dot shows how far the steering wheel is turned and in
what direction it is pointing. The car is also fitted with flashing
police lights; these lights are automated and will flash automatically
during arrest mode.

The car has an active moving map display to show the player the
location of any adversaries and himself in relation to the world. This
is essential during high speed chases. Due to the map resolution it is
split into 4 sections for the North East, South East, South West,
North West areas of the city. Your vehicle is indicated by a GREEN
square, the suspect vehicle with a RED square.

DAMAGE & EFFICIENCY
-------------------
The car is able to withstand a great deal of damage, although the more
damage the car recieves the less responsive & more difficult it may
become to control. During the driving section, Robocop's efficiency
reading is dedicated to the car & not Robocop.

The effieciency reading shows the overall turbo cruiser efficiency.
When Robocop is in action this reading will diminish due to the effect
to weapons which can damage Robocop i.e. Head on collisions with
buildings and other vehicles or heavy gunfire can destroy the turbo
cruiser and light gunfire can slowly wear down the efficiency reading.

PAGE 9
******

Any reading below 30% will show a warning as the vehicle will have
sustained a large amount of damage. It also may prove more difficult
to drive and may incur loss to power and reaction due to the damage.
The turbo cruiser will be destroyed when effieciency is reduced to
zero.

The player's score is calculated on the following :-

How quick the mission is achieved.
How much efficiency Robocop has remaining.
An overall mission score.
Score for the individual number of those eliminated.

NOTE : It is possible to get a negative score if Robocop shoots any
innocent people whilst on duty i.e. women & children. If a negative
score is achieved at the end of the mission it is likely that the
player will be decommisioned from the force and deactivated.

GAMEPLAY HINTS & TIPS FOR DRIVING
---------------------------------
"Your adversary is intelligent so treat him with respect."
"Keep on the road......although you can drive on sidewalks & open
areas
 it will damage your vehicle & wear down efficiency."
"Keep an eye on the brake lights as you know if your chase vehicle is
 about to slam on the brakes or turn rapidly."
"When in pursuit of a vehicle, don't get too close as it is likely
that
 it's doors will swing open with machine guns firing at you. Also look
 out for people shooting at you from the roadside or other vehicles."
"To apprehend a vehicle it is best to choose your moment , e.g. when
on a long straight section of road use your turbo acceleration to move
up
 to the side of him and run into him."
"It could take several collisions to force the vehicle off the road,
 during this you may also be under fire."
"Watch out for obstacles in the road such as oil spills, destroyed
 vehicles and debris."
"On turning, use full width of the road, but don't oversteer."
"Squealing tires will let you know if you are cutting it to fine."
"When in pursuit of faster vehicles you will struggle to keep up with
 them let alone overtake them, so use your powers of judgement to find
 an alternative shortcut/route. Many roads lead into one."

FLYING SECTION
--------------
The latest addition to the Robocop Amoury is a GYROCYCLE. This is a
specially adapted jetpack which allows Robocop to achieve full flight.
The GYROCYCLE is interfaced to the Robocop software as a new helmet
mounted display called the HUD.
On the helmet mounted display mission directives are printed and also
data which may be relevant. Below this the efficiency reading is
printed permanently.

EFFICIENCY
----------
The efficiency reading shows the overall Robocop efficiency. When
Robocop is in combat this reading will diminish due to the effect of
weapons which can damage Robocop i.e. *helicopter fire can blow
Robocop out of the sky, and ground gunfire can slowly wear down the
efficiency reading.

Any reading below 30% will show a warning as Robocop will have
sustained a large amount of damage. It also may prove more difficult
to fly and may incur loss of power and reflexes due to the damage.
Robocop will be destroyed when efficiency is reduced to zero.

PAGE 13
*******

WEAPONS
-------
Whilst in flight Robocop is fitted with a multi-weapon arm which is
capable of firing cannon and rapid machine gun fire. The weapon
selected and the amount of ammunition remaining is printed on the
bottom of the screen. The cannon is more powerful than the multi-
weapon machine gun. The cannon is able to knock out heavy armour such
as tanks and helicopters much more efficiently than the machine gun.

Robocop's avionic software has a new target acquisition system similar
to fighter aircraft where a lock can be achieved which will allow the
weapons to bear. It is up to the player to then fire when ready.

COUNTER MEASURES
----------------
1. Altitude bar - this is the left hand indicator bar. A warning will
           appear if the altitude level is to low.
2. Thrust bar - this is the right hand indicator bar showing the
thrust
     of the jet pack. The greater the thrust the greater the velocity
                            obtained
3. Radar - the central area of the display shows a radar display of
    various threats relevant to your position. Objects are split into
                     three colour codes...
1 - RED is an aerial threat i.e. helicopter.
2 - GREEN is for friendly i.e. police cars.
3 - BLACK shows the location of important relevant buildings
                      e.g.OCP Tower
4 - YELLOW indicates a ground-based threat i.e. ED209,tanks.
5 - Horizon bar indicator - this toggles with the radar to show the
             pitch and roll in relation to the horizon.
6 - Target lock indicator [used with cannon]: When a valid target is
    within the HUD, a green target 'lock' appears. When within range
to
    fire, a red target circle will overlap; wwhen they meet each
other,
    you can fire.

SCORING
-------
The player's score is calculated on the following :-

How quick the mission is achieved.
How much efficiency Robocop has remaining.
An overall mission score.
Score for the individual number of those eliminated.

NOTE: It is possible to get a negative score if Robocop shoots any
innocent people whilst on duty i.e. women, children and other police
officers. If a negative score is achieved at the end of the mission it
is likely that the player will be decommisioned from the force and
Robocop will be deactivated.

Keep low! Although susceptible at this altitude to small arms fire
which will slowly lower your efficiency it is far less dangerous than
large AAA and helicopter gunfire. Also at high altitudes missiles
prove very effective.

The helicopters are perhaps the most dangerous adversary so should be
avoided. Tactics suggest that all aerial threats should be eradicated
before ground engagements. It is therefore feasible to deal with the
helicopters immediately. Try to conserve fuel as full thrust will
deplete fuel rapidly. Keep thrust low during evasive manoeuvres
allowing quicker reaction. Chaff should be launched as soon as a
missile is launched.

PAGE 17
*******

Robocop was primarily designed around the use of urban pacification
which includes heavily built up areas. Robocop has fully functions
around all environments and can penetrate almost any building. Robocop
is able to map a zone he enters and is able to use weapons in a closed
environment against anything hostile. He is able to walk through
doors, or punch down closed doors, and with the use of his targeting
system is able to operate elevators by using the up or down cursors on
the keyboard.

WEAPONS & TARGET ACQUISITION
----------------------------
Robocop has an advanced target acquisition system which is able to
detect anything hostile.

The player must position the target cross hairs over a valid target,
Robocop's software will automatically designate and lock on to the
target, and the player is then able to fire weapons.

The target will flash green for an instant for confirmation.

Robocop is now fitted with a detachable multi-weapon arm. This arm has
a built in heavy calibre cannon and a rapid fire machine gun.

PAGE 18
*******

EFFICIENCY
----------
The efficiency shows the overall efficiency. When Robocop is in action
this reading will diminish due to the effect of weapons which can
damage Robocop i.e. bombs or heavy gunfire, which can cause severe
damage, and light gunfire which can slowly wear down the efficiency
reading.

Any reading below 30% will show a warning as Robocop will have
sustained a large amount of damage. It also may prove more difficult
to move and may incur loss of power and reaction due to the damage.
Robocop will be destroyed when efficiency is reduced to zero.

The cross hairs are also used to direct the motion of Robocop. When
using a mouse if the cross hairs are pushed to the top or side of the
screen Robocop will change direction accordingly.

This will not however interfere with the target lock system as the
cursor is able to be positioned over any target within the screen
allowing Robocop to be accurately positioned for a shot.

In some urban areas, Robocop can use an active Sonar Homing Device to
locate a person. The audio bleep will accelerate as he gets closer to
the source. This device works automatically.

PAGE 20
*******

HINTS & TIPS
------------
Caution should be taken at all times as danger lurks around every
corner. You should always take extreme caution when turning corners
and be prepared to fire.

Always aim for a body shot to achieve an accurate target lock.

        AVOID INNOCENT CIVILIANS AT ALL COSTS !

Targets should be chosen carefully, e.g. if there are 3 baddies
attacking you, figure out who is the most dangerous. A man about to
throw a grenade is far more dangerous than a man with a hand gun...
Attack the man with the grenade first before he has a chance to throw.

If a grenade is thrown, you still stand the chance to destroy it with
your gun, as the damage sustained will then be greatly reduced.

It is very easy to become lost so pay attention to any particular land
marks or signs. Many alleyways and corridors have countless doors,
many of them lead no where. Exploring every doorway will only waiste
time; many of them are booby trapped so care must be taken.

Make a note of the direction baddies are coming from as they may lead
you to your overall mission objective.

If you shoot women and children, it may result in system shut-down.

PAGE 21

To operate elevators, simply walk inside and press cursor-up or
cursor-down key on keyboard.

CLOSE QUARTER COMBAT
--------------------
In an urban environment, an enforcement droid is likely to encounter
all different modes of attack. Weapons such as a machine gun are not
always avaliable, and only a minimum amount of force may be required
to perform an arrest.
Robocop is able to manipulate limbs for use in mind in unarmed combat.
He is able to punch low and high, block on coming thrusts, perform
evasive manouevres and is able to recover himself from the ground.

HINTS & TIPS FOR CLOSE QUARTER COMBAT
-------------------------------------
Otomo is a highly advanced machine and in many ways far superior to
Robocop and is able to out manouevre Robocop at any level of combat.
Some of the basic rules of engagement:

DO NOT get trapped in a corner, and wait for Otomo to move on you, do
not run straight into him.

Otomo may seem to far away to strike but be careful, he is able to
leap great distances with flying kicks.

If otomo moves close in and starts punching, don't slug it out in hand
to hand fighting because he is able to quickly pull his sword out and
strike a deadly blow. So keep your distance and move away.

Only draw out your gun when Otomo is in a position not to attack. When
he has his sword out is best as he has to put it away before he can
kick or punch it out of your hand.

             III-LE SCENARIO DE LA SECTION FILM

    Résumé de l'histoire...
Il y a six mois déjà qu'a été annoncé le projet de cons-   
truction de Delta City:la société OCP est dans une situa-  
tion désespérée car elle va perdre des milliards de dollars
si les travaux ne commencent pas d'ici 8 jours.Les citoyens
du vieux Détroit refusent de quitter leurs maisons ,et     
l'OCP a donc engagé un groupe spécial de l'armée appelé LES
REINTEGRATEURS.C'est un commando de réintégration urbaine 
qui expulse les gens de leur domicile.
  ROBOCOP EST ENTRAINE DANS UNE BATAILLE CONTRE LES AUTORI-
TES ALORS QUE LE JOUR DE LA CONSTRUCTION DE DELTA CITY AP- 
PROCHE.

La section film se passe comme une aventure .Comme dans    
toutes les aventures , il y a de nombreux coups de théâtre 
et il est donc difficile d'expliquer le déroulement du     
jeux.Mediabrake sert de mise à jour des évènements et cons-
titue donc la toile de fond du jeu.

             IV-PARAMETRES OPERATIONNELS DE ROBOCOP

              Directives:
        1-Protéger l'innocent
        2-Faire respecter la loi
        3-Servir l'interêt public

Robocop ne peut pas enfreindre ces objectifs essentiels-   
toute infraction aura des conséquences fatales.

        4a SECTION "CONDUITE"
Comme il fait partie de la police de Détoit , Robocop dis- 
pose d'une voiture de police turbo pour patrouiller en
ville

          PARAMETRES DE " CONDUITE"
La voiture de patrouille turbo est une voiture de police   
rapide et efficace ,capable d'aller de 0 à 100 km/h en 8   
sec.avec une vitesse de pointe de plus de 240 km/h.
Elle a une bonne reprise à vitesse élevée.Le turbo s'en-   
clenche entre 50 et 130 km/h ce qui est utile pour doubler 
et sortir des virages difficiles.
          ECRANS
Le tableau de bord de la voiture a un indicateur de vitesse
au milieu de la console et une carte à gauche.Un petit     
point blanc sur le volant indique de combien et dans quelle
direction le volant est tourné.La voiture est aussi équipée
de gyrophares de police :ces feux sont automatique et   
clignotent en mode arrestation.L'affichage de la carte dans
la voiture est évolutif et montre au joueur la position de 
ses adversaires et de lui même par rapport au monde extè-  
rieur. 
Votre véhicule est représenté par un carré VERT ,et le vé- 
hicule suspect par un carré ROUGE..
          DEGATS ET RENDEMENTS
La voiture de Robocop peut supporter des dégâts importants 
mais plus elle est endommagée,moins elle a de reprise et   
plus elle est difficile à manoeuvrer.Dans cette section ,le
rendement se rapporte à la voiture et non à Robocop.
Toute valeur de rendement infèrieure à30 % est  accompagnée
d'un avertissement car le véhicule a subi des dégâts impor
tants .La voiture est détruite quand son rendement est à
zéro.

             LE SCORE


Le score est calculé à partir des éléments suivants:Temps
mis à accomplir la mission.Rendement restant de Robocop.
Score global de la mission.Score du nombre de ceux qui ont 
été éliminés.
REMARQUE:il est possible d'avoir un score négatif si Robo- 
cop abat des innocents.Aussi il se peut que le joueur soit 
destitué de la police et désactivé.

Pour arrêter un véhicule utilisez l'accélération du turbo  
pour arriver à sa hauteur et rentrez lui-dedans.Plusieurs  
coups sont parfois nécessaires .Si vous poursuivez un véhi
cule plus rapide vous aurez du mal à aller aussi vite que  
lui,ilvous faut évaluer la situation et trouver un rac
courci
             4a SECTION "VOL"
Le plus récent équipement dont bénéficie robocop est un    
GYROPROPULSEUR, sytème de propulsion à réaction lui permet-
tant de voler.
             RENDEMENT
Le rendement affiché est le rendement global de Robocop
Quand Robocop est en combat ,cette valeur diminue en fonc- 
tion des dégâts occasionés: les tirs des hélicoptères peu- 
vent faire exploser Robocop et les coups de fusil venant du
sol font diminuer lentement son rendement.
Toute valeur de rendement infèrieure à30 % est accompagnée 
d'un avertissement car Robocop  à subi des dégâts impor
tants  .Il lui est difficile de voler et il peut avoir per-
du de sa puissance et de ses réflexes .
Robocop est détruit quand son rendement est à zéro.
             ARMES 
Quand il est en vol ,Robocop est équipé d'une arme complexe
qui peut tirer des coups de canon et des rafales de mi-    
trailleuse.L'arme sélectionnée et la quantité de munitions 
restantes sont affichées en bas de l'écran.
Le canon est fait pour démolir des engins lourds (hélicos,
tanks).

             CONTRE-MESURES
HUD-Cet écran est destiné à monter au joueur toutes les 
informations se rapportant au vol,c'est à dire la puissance
,l'altitude ,le radar et d'autres indications.
1.Barre d'altitude:barre indicatrice de gauche.Un avertis- 
sement apparaît quand l'altitude est trop basse 
2.Barre de poussée:barre indicatrice de droite qui montre  
la poussée du propulseur.Plus la poussée est grande plus la
vitesse est élevée.
3.Radar:c'est la partie centrale de l'écran.Les objets sont
de différentes couleurs:
1=rouge ,une menace aérienne
2=vert,un ami 
3=noir,position des bâtiments importants
4=jaune,menace terrestre
5=barre indicatrice d'horizon,alterne avec le radar pour 
montrer le roulis et le tangage par rapport à l'horizon
6=indicateur d'acquisition de cible( utilisé avec le can-  
non):Quand une cible valable se trouve dans la ligne de    
mire du HUD , une "acquisition"de cible verte appparaît 
.Quand cette cible se trouve à portée de tir , un cercle   
cible rouge la recouvre ; qunad les 2 cercles sont superpo-
sés ,vous pouvez tirer.

             4c PACIFICATION URBAINE  
Robocop a été créé pour des missions de pacification urbai-
ne,c'est à dire pour évoluer dans des zones urbanisées avec
des ruelles ,des bâtiments très grands et des zones piéto- 
nes.Il est capable de dresser le plan de l'endroit où il se
trouve et d'utiliser des armes dans un lieu clos contre    
tout ce qui lui est hostile.Grâce à son système de pointa
ge il peut faire fonctionner les ascenseurs en utilisant   
les curseurs haut et bas sur le clavier

             ARMES ET ACQUISITION DE BUT
Robocop a un système avancé d'acquisition de but qui lui   
permet de détecter tout ce qui lui est hostile.Le joueur   
doit positionner le réticule sur une cible valide.Le logi- 
ciel de Robocop indique la cible et la capte.Le joueur peut
alors faire feu avec ses armes.

             RENDEMENT 
Le rendement indiqué est celui de Robocop .Cette valeur    
diminue en fonction des dégâts :les bombes et les les mi-  
trailleuses font de sèrieux dégâts ,les coups de pistolet  
font diminuer lentement le rendement .
Toute valeur de rendement infèrieure à30 % est accompagnée
d'un avertissement car Robocop  a subi des dégâts impor-   
tants.Il lui est difficile de se déplacer et peut avoir    
perdu de sa puissance et de ses réflexes à cause des dégâts
Robocop est détruit quand son rendement est à zéro

             MOUVEMENTS ET COMMANDES
Le réticule est aussi utilisé pour diriger les mouvements  
de Robocop .Quand on se sert d'une souris ,Robocop  change 
de direction suivant que le réticule est dirigé vers le    
haut ou vers un côté de l'écran.Cependant ceci n'interfère 
pas avec les système de blocage de cible puisque le curseur
peut être positionné sur une cible qui se trouve dans l'é- 
cran ce qui permet à Robocop  d'être positionné avec préci-
sion pour tirer.Dans certaines zones urbaines Robocop peut 
utiliser un dispositif de repérage sonique pour trouver une
personne.Le signal sonore s'accélère à mesure que Robocop  
s'approche de son but .Ce dispositif fonctionne  automati-
quement

             4d COMBAT CORPS A CORPS
Dans un environnement urbain, un mutant qui fait respecter 
la loi va se trouver confronté à plusieurs modes d'attaques
différentes.Les armes comme les mitrailleuses ne sont pas  
toujours disponibles et il faut donc un minimum de force   
physique pour effectuer une arrestation.
Robocop peut utiliser ses bras et ses jambes dans les com- 
bats à mains nues.Il peut frapper ,bloquer les coups de ses
adversaires et esquiver les attaques ennemies.

Voilà ,c'est terminé.Je vais quand même en guise de conclu-
sion vous mettre la conclusion du manuel car elle vaut     
franchement le coup:
"[...] ET EN CONCLUSION ..N'essayez pas de copier !-       
N'oubliez pas que la piraterie est interdite par la loi et 
nuit à tous ceux qui travaillent dans l'industrie des logi-
ciels ...POUR UN DOLLAR ,J'ACHETE !  "
l'ennui c'est que des jeux à un dollar j'en vois pas des
