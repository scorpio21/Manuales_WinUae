                RICK DANGEROUS 2.5 - THE ONE COVERDISK JAN 1991

Typed in by PARASITE of LSD.


INSTRUCTIONS
You now have 10 brand new screens for Rick Dangerous 2, which have never been
seen before.  You won't find them on the original, and can't buy it in the
shops, its exclusive to THE ONE magazine, and software pirates everywhere!

The aim is to guide Rick through each screen while avoiding the adversaries
and traps.  By punching the bad guys you can momentarily stun them, whereas
the ray-gun zaps them permanently.  Electronic detonators are best used to
remove awkward objects.

The joystick is used to control Rick thus...

WITHOUT FIRE BUTTON DEPRESSED
UP    - Climb Up or Jump
DOWN  - Climb Down or Duck
LEFT  - Punch Left
RIGHT - Walk Right

WITH FIREBUTTON DEPRESSED
UP    - Fire Gun
DOWN  - Drop Detonator
LEFT  - Punch Left
RIGHT - Punch Right

End.
