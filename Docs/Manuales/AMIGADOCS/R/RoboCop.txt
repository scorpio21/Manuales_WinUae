 GAMEPLAY

 Armed with a standard police pistol you seek out the criminals responsible
 for Murphy`s death.You can then collect capsules giving you more ammunition,
 better fire power or three way bullets.You can also pick up baby food to 
 give you extra energy.
 As ROBOCOP you must make your way through numerous sections in order to
 complete the game.Making your way from left to right and shooting/punching
 any villians that confront you.You will be shot at both from the ground and
 from above.All bullets must be avoided as each hit reduces your energy
 substantially.Crates and boxes may be found along the way which contain extra
 energy(in the form of babyfood),or extra weapons.You will then progress onto
 a shooting gallery enabling you to practise the accuracy of your fire power
 and increase your score accordingly.After the second patrol you will be
 confronted a photo-fit identification screen.You must match up the face on 
 the right with the one portrayed on the left,changing the hairline,eyes,nose,
 mouth,chin and ears in order to build up the similar composite.Having
 identified the perpetrator,you then proceed to the junk yard where many of 
 the villans lie in wait.Having completed your mission in the junk yard,you
 will be confronted with a hostage situation whereby one of Clarence Boddickers
 men is holding a girl hostage.You must now use all the abilities you learned 
 in the shooting gallery to shoot her captor without harming the hostage.
 having successfully cleared up the hostage situation,you will then enter the
 drugs factory,used for the manufacture of illegal narcotics.After this you
 will be confronted with a thermograph photo-fit,similar to normal photo-fit
 mentioned before.Having successfully identified all the main perpetrators,
 you then make your way to the OCP Headquarters wherein you must evade the
 boobytraps and villans and defeat the deadly ED209 which lies in wait at the
 end of the level.Another shooting gallery gives you more oppotunity to hone
 your abilities which may have impaired through injuries sustained,after which
 you make you way inside the OCP Headquarters where even more challenges lie
 in wait.The game culimates in a final hostage confrontation,where Dick Jones
 is holding the President of OCP hostage.If you manage to defeat Dick Jones
 the game will be completed and ROBOCOP will be hailed as a hero>
