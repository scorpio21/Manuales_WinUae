                                   ROME

From the time when its legendary founders, Romulus and Remus - fresh from
sucking wolf milk in the forests of Central Italy - began to build a city
on the Palatine Hill, the story of Rome is one of almost constant
expansion.

Initially, the tiny city-state of Rome suffered the attentions of
neighboring kingdoms, the kings of which were constantly giving unwelcome
advice of how to run things and generally trying to conquer everything in
sight. Wisely, therefore, the Romans killed all the nearby kings and set
themselves up as a republic.

At first, the society of the infant republic was divided into two classes:
the patricians, who had most of the money, did none of the work, lived in
the biggest houses and spoke the best Latin (these qualities naturally
making them the best choice for running the government), and the plebians,
who had no money and did all the work (so, naturally, they could have no
say in government). After a century or so, this state of affairs being
somewhat irritating to the plebians, they marched out of Rome and
threatened to start their own city. The patricians, horrified at the
thought of having to do their own cooking, let them back in and gave them
the vote.

The next few centuries were ones of unrelenting expansion as the Romans
began conquering all the neighboring states. Once admitted to the fold of
Roman rule, the new citizens were equipped with full voting rights. Alas,
as the republic grew, the tedius business

============================================================================

of counting so many votes was such that democracy was dropped in favor of
nice, straightforward dictatorship, and the rise of the emperors began.

Rome had many emperors: some good, like Julius Caeser and Augustus, some
bad, like Caligula and Nero, and some ugly, like... well, like most of them
really. Under its emperors Rome continued to expand, north, east and west,
until the empire covered most of the known world. (Actually, most of the
world wasn't known until the Romans conquered it!) As they swept across the
world, the Romans took with them the chief fruits of their civilization:
plumbing, literature, art, fine wines, plumbing, pavements, hot baths and
plumbing.

However, all good things must come to an end. The Roman citizens, made
decadent by too many hot baths and hot orgies, and poisoned by the lead in
their plumbing, stood by and watched as their empire crumbled into decay.
Until, at the end, the once-mighty Roman Empire stood at the mercy of any
ruthless, conniving, merciless, bloodthirsty adventurer who thought himself
capable of scheming, plotting and murdering his way to the ultimate prize -
the Imperial Crown itself.

Someone just like you perhaps...?

                                 CONTROLS
                                 
                                IN GENERAL

In this game, you use a mouse to guide Hector, your hero, by selecting
buttons in the control box or clicking directly on the landscape.

Some buttons will act immediately (e.g., MAP), while others open a "toolbox"
containing further choices (e.g., USE: MESSAGE).

Some commands, after you select them, require you to specify a target
person or object by clicking directly on it. In these cases, the cursor
will change from an arrow to a cross.

For example, to greet a person, select (click on) DO. A toolbox will open
containing various things you might want Hector to do. Select GREET/ The
cursor will now change to a cross. Point at the appropriate person with the
mouse and click. Hector will do the rest.

You can abort a toolbox selecting by clicking on its CANCEL button, or
abandon a "cross' object selection by clicking a second time on the
command button.

Because each character in the game has a mind of his own, characters
sometimes tend to walk off screen before you have had the chance to select
the appropriate buttons for interacting with them. If you find this a
problem, simply click on the character first, and Hector will divert his
attention for a while, allowing you time to press the required buttons.


                                 MOVEMENT

There are three ways of getting Hector to walk around the landscape:

1. Use the arrow buttons in the control box. Hold them down with the mouse,
   or hold down their keyboard equivalents (A, S, Z and X).

============================================================================
Page vi                                               Rome: Pathway to Power
============================================================================

2. Click directly on the landscape where you want Hector to go. The
   advantage of this method is that Hector will take care of the tedious
   business of avoiding obstacles for you. It is easiest to use this method
   most of the time, and resort to the arrow buttons only when more precise
   positioning is required.
   
3. Open the MAP view and click where you want Hector to go. After you
   click, the map will close and hector will walk towards this spot.
   (Clicking somewhere off the actual map will close the map without
   signaling a new destination.)


                           THE MAIN CONTROL BOX

This is what all the buttons in the control box do:

USE - Clicking on USE opens a toolbox that fills with the objects that
Hector collects during the game. When you want to use these objects, select
USE, then click on the object you want to use.

DO - Clicking on DO opens a toolbox of all the possible actions Hector can
perform at a given time. The available actions in the DO toolbox change,
depending on the specific situation Hector is in at the moment. For
example, if someone asks Hector a question, AGREE and DISAGREE buttons will
temporarily become available inside the DO box.

The precise way in which Hector will respond to a particular command often
depends on the context in which it is used. For example, select DO: INQUIRE
and Hector will ask a question appropriate to that person and to the
current situation.

         NOTE: If you are not sure how to achieve something, it
         is always a good idea to look in the DO box, to see if
         an appropriate button has become available.
         
WHO - Click on this button to identify characters. When you choose this
button, the cursor changes to a cross. Point at a person and click the
mouse button to see a description of the character.

============================================================================
Page vii                                              Rome: Pathway to Power
============================================================================

MAP - click on this button to bring up a map of the entire level, complete
with the location of all characters. hector is represented by a flashing
yellow dot. Once the map is open, you can click in it. After you click, the
map will close and Hector will begin to make his way to the spot where you
clicked.

FOLLOW - This button directs Hector to follow a character. When the cursor
changes to a cross, point at the character you want Hector to follow.

RUN - Run speeds up Hector's movement and is an efficient way for him to
cover ground when he is in a hurry.

SYSTEM - Use this button if you would like to turn on/off the sound, or
quit, save or restart a game.

ARROW BUTTONS - Click on these buttons when you want precise control of
Hector's every step.


                         THE MILITARY CONTROL BOX

The DO, USE, etc controls described above are relevant to many parts of the
game. However, some sections involve military action. At these times, the
control box chnages to a different set of buttons. These open toolboxes and
generate cross-cursors in the normal way, but there are a few other things
you will need to know in order to make good use of them.

Firstly, many buttons cause Hector to issue commands to his troops. Some of
these he makes by blowing his trumpet, and these can be heard from very far
away. Others, however, are verbal instructions, which can only be heard
over a moderate distance. It's no good with Hector staying safely back at
base and giving orders - he'll need to be up there in the thick of it!

Secondly, you should note that Hector commands four units of me, and can
choose to issue orders to any one of these units at a time, or to all at

============================================================================
Page viii                                             Rome: Pathway to Power
============================================================================

once, the I, II, III, IV and ALL buttons at the top of the screen determine
which unit or units receive future commands.

The individual controls act as follows:

I II III IV ALL - Determine which unit(s) respond to subsequent commands.

FORM - Click here to open a toolbox full of orders which Hector can decree.
Experiment will tell you how each order is carried out, but you may not
notice (unless we tell you) that the WATCH button allows you to use the MAP
function to see the whereabouts of any enemy soldiers currently within
range of those men on watch.

STD - This button controls Hector's use of the Roman War Standard. Pressing
it once will cause him to go to the Standard and pick it up. the Standard
is an important element in the game: it is the symbol of the Roman Empire,
and of immense psychological importance to the troops - never let it fall
into enemy hands! The most important fact about the Standard is that it
marks the point to which your men will run if you select the RALLY button.
Because of this, it is a useful way of gathering your men together, perhaps
in a place of safety.

The SYSTEM and the ARROW BUTTONS work as they do in the main control box.

============================================================================

                            THE SYSTEM CONTROLS

In either the main or the military control box, click on the System button
to access these controls:

CONTINUE GAME - Clicking here closes the System box without doing anything.

SOUND ON/OFF - This button toggles the sound on and off.

QUIT AND SAVE - This button saves the current state of the game under the
name entered when the current session was started, and quits Rome.

QUIT WITHOUT SAVING - This button ends the game without saving it.

RESTART THIS GAME - This button returns you to the beginning of the game if
you are playing a new game, or the place where a saved game was loaded.

RESTART WHOLE ADVENTURE - This button returns you to the beginning of the
game even if you're playing from a saved game.

      SOME NOTABLE EPISODES IN THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
      
                                  753 BC:
                                  
Tired with mucking about in forests amongst the wolves, the two brothers
Romulus and Remus decided instead to found a city. Keeping in mind future
expansion (shopping malls and such), they decided that seven hills' worth
should be just about enough, and so set about laying out the streets.
Unfortunately, during an argument about the meaning of a portent ("Was that
twelve eagles or thirteen?"), Remus freaked out and started jumping over
the city's walls. Romulus took affront at this act (Well, you would,
wouldn't you?) and quite understandably clubbed his brother to death, thus
setting the tone for much of Rome's future history.

                                  600 BC:
                                  
Rome got its first leisure center: the Circus Maximus. (Circus because it
was round, and Maximus because it was big - not ones to waste words, the
Romans!)

                                  390 BC:
                                  
If the Greeks had a word for it, the Romans probably invented it: as in
their invention of the airborne early warning system, the use of which was
most effectively demonstrated in 390 BC when the Gauls invaded Rome. As the
Gauls attempted the ascent of the Capitoline Hill, the sacred geese of
Juno, resenting this attack on their privacy, took wing. They cackled so
loudly they awoke the defenders of the Capitol and thus saved Rome from
defeat.

                                  73 BC:
                                  
The Romans took their maiming and murdering very seriously - so seriously
that they set up schools to teach the slaves how to do it for them. The
contribution of the citizens to all this was to go along to the games at
the Circus Maximus (see above) and complain that slaves just didn't kill
each other as well as they did in the old days.

============================================================================

============================================================================

One slave, Spartacus, took an understandably dim view of having a life
expactancy of about five minutes and therefore escaped from gladiator
school. His unlikely hideout choice was Vesuvius (fortunately not erupting
at the time, or his life expactancy would have been about five seconds!).
He gathered together a motley crew of other runaways, who, in a display or
sever ungratefulness for their education, proceeded to kill the Romans,
rather than each other, for the better part of two years. Spartacus'
followers were eventually rounded up and crucified, but the rumor is that
Spartacus himself escaped and went on to star in a major Hollywood epic.

                                  55 BC:
                                  
As an autumn holiday for his troops, Julius Caesar decided to let them
invade Britain. However, the invasion itself was not exactly a display of
Roman military might - the ships were wrecked and Caesar himself fell flat
on his face on the beach. In the face of this awesome display of Roman
power, the tribesmen of Kent had no option but to submit.

Returning the following year for his annual invasion holiday, Caesar this
time managed to remain upright, but once again left his ships on the beach
to be wrecked. Despite this, Caesar persuaded the tribes of Kent and Essex
to come under Roman rule, but wisely discovered a previous engagement in
Gaul which prevented him from actually coming to battle.

                                  51 BC:
                                  
Ptolemy, the Greek king of Egypt, died in 51 BC. His children, Ptolemy Jr.
and Cleopatra, obeyed the well-known saying "keep it in the family," and
married each other. Alas, familiarity soon bred contempt and Cleopatra
found herself thrown out of the marital palace. She threw herself at the
feet of the recently arrived Julius Caesar (literally; she turned up rolled
in a rug!) and, let us say, excercised her considerable charms. In return,
Caesar's army killed Ptolemy and installed his brother Ptolemy as king.
Cleopatra, in a triumph of hope over experience, promptly married him,
whilst poor old Caesar had to hurry off and subdue Asia. We presume he
would willingly have returned, but was, sadly, prevented from doing so by
an unavoidable appointment on the Idles of March, 44 BC.

                                  41 BC:
                                  
Cleopatra's next Roman conquest was one Marcus Antonius, sometime Master of
Caesar's Horse. Obviously, mucking-out and polishing saddles wasn't too
strenuous a job, since Mark Antony managed to find enough time to... dally
with the lovely Cleopatra - successfully too, since she later gave birth to
twins!

============================================================================

============================================================================

According to Shakspeare (who was quite clearly there at the time and saw
the whole thing), Cleopatra was a woman of "infinite variety; age could not
wither her, nor the years condemn." Obviously an early client of the
cosmetic surgeon!

                                  16 AD:
                                  
Rome's first and greatest emperor, Augustus, died after ruling Rome for 44
years. His reign so impressed the citizens that after his death they
promoted him to a god. Other emperors thought this a pretty nifty idea,
with all sorts of benefits - nice temple to live in, permanent supplies of
ambrosia and so on - so naturally they wanted to be gods as well.
Unhappily, these later emperors showed far less taste than the great
Augustus (who at least had the good manners to wait until he was dead
before achieving deification), and instead tended to deify themselves while
still alive. The Roman populace gradually got used to humoring their
emperors in this way - and at least all the bowing and scraping kept the
streets clean!

                                  40 AD:
                                  
Britain again... and in a brilliant piece of military strategy, never tried
before or since, Caligula arranged his infantrymen, catapults and siege
engines along the south side of the English Channel, facing north, and
sounded the charge. The British, protected from this onslaught by nothing
more than a paltry forty miles of water, were undoubtedly unnerved by this
radical approach - it's a wonder the entire island didn't capitulate on the
spot! Having thus shaken British resolve, the emperor and his soldiers
spent the rest of the afternoon collecting seashells from the beach.

                                  43 AD:
                                  
Continuing the mysterious imperial infatuation with a soggy island at the
edge of the world, the Emperor Claudius decided to sort the British out
once and for all. To the normal troops, weapons, armor, etc., Claudius
added a squadron of elephants and camels, possibly on the grounds that the
Londinium Zoo needed to start a breeding program.

============================================================================

============================================================================

The British, fighting (as usual with them) entirely naked, protected only
by gold necklets and tasteful blue woad body paint, put up stiff resistance
to the Roman troops. Commanding the British were the Druid Priests and
priestesses, heroically keeping to the rear of the battle, urging on their
men with fearsome cries and the use of captured Roman soldiers as nighttime
illuminations.

Claudius fought his way as far up as Gloucester and Lincoln, but there
halted, defeated by the northern tribes. Was their woad bluer or their
necklets bigger. At any rate, their resistance would seem to have been
stiffer!

                                  55 AD:
                                  
Seeking professional fulfillment, which he could nto find in mere
Emperorship, Nero had serious ambitions in the world of entertainment.
Having assured himself of success by having all his critics put to death
(not an unjst treatment in the eyes of many an actor!), his foremost
performance was held during the burning of Rome, in which he personally led
the firefighters in a song of his own composition. Finding that the people
of Rome were unaccountably unrecptive to having their city burnt as
performance art, he rapidly pushed the blame for it onto a new religious
sect, the Christians.

                                  58 AD:
                                  
The Emperor Nero, fed up with always being told what to do by his mother,
Agrippina, decided to be rid of her at last. Being too frightened of her to
dare involve himself in a straightforward assasination, he instead hatched
a cunning plan. After inviting her to tea on one of his islands, he kissed
her good-bye and helped her into a boat, surrounded by her maidservants.
Agrippina's boat set sail for the mainland, shadowed by another containing
soldiers (for her own protection, you understand). However, the boat had
been specially designed to fall apart at a given signal (presumably
radio-controlled from a joystick in Nero's pudgy little hand), and this it
proceeded to do, leaving the women floundering in the sea. It was at this
point that a maidservant had the brightest idea of her short life, and
shouted to the soldiers, claiming that she was actually Agrippina and would
they kindly rescue her, please?

Unfortunately for her, the troops had already been primed to feign a rescue
attempt by flailing around wildly with their oars, and so promptly clubbed
the poor girl to death. Agrippina, meanwhile, swam to safety, and Nero was
somewhat distressed the following day to receive a letter from his mother,
thanking him for the tea and recommending that he change his shipwright.

============================================================================

============================================================================

                                  60 AD:
                                  
In an early and unwise example of sexual discrimination, and little knowing
of the leadership qualities of Lincolnshire ladies, the Roman governor of
Britain ignored the claims of Queen Boudicca to the leadership of the tribe
of the Iceni. Scorned, Boudicca unleashed her fury, and attacked the Roman
town of Camulodunum, killing all its inhabitants. Alas, the revolution was
rapidly crushed, and Boudicca is chiefly remembered today for her early
form of armored car - a knife-wheeled chariot - and for her unusual choice
of burial place: beneath platform 10 of St. Pancras Station (perhaps in an
effort to ensure a seat on the train?).

                                  79 AD:
                                  
On the 24th of August, 79 AD, the citizens of Pompeii had their afternoon
peace interrupted when nearby Mount Vesuvius burst into an enormous
eruption. Most of them (quite wisely, one feels) fled from their homes
immediately, but one or two took a little more time...

The priests of the temple of Isis, for example, were just sitting down to a
light lunch of eggs and fish when the eruption began. Reassured by their
belief that the worship of Isis conveyed immortality on her followers, they
finished their meal, popped into the temple to collect the goddess and the
temple treasure, and only then started to leave. Unfortunately, the goddess
failed to come up to scratch; her priests perished in the lava.

As did the historian Pliny, who was sunbathing on the beach when the
eruption began. Not wishing to have an uneven tan, he remained there, until
called away to help a friend who was trying to save his household goods,
wife, children, etc. Having organized their rescue, Pliny went for a swim,
then had lunch and took a little nap. Only then did he feel himslef ready
to stroll down to the beach and get on a boat. Unhappily, he had left too
late, for once there, he drank a glass of cold water and promptly fell down
dead - thus clearly shwoing the bad effects of drinking water. He should
have stuck to wine, like any sensible Roman.

                                  125 AD:
                                  
The conquest of Britain was finally completed by the emperor Hadrian. His
troops swept up the island like a giant military vacuum cleaner, pushing
the nastier northern tribesmen before them. When the last long-haired,
kilt-wearing, haggis-eating Pict had been finally tidied up into the
rockier parts of Scotland, Hadrian, in an effort to keep the place looking
nice and neat, built a wall right across Britain, so the Picts could be
hidden from view. It also, happily, hid the view of them eating haggis, a
sight ever painful to delicate Roman sensibilities.

                                  300 AD:
                                  
The expansion of the Roman Empire came to a halt during the reign of
Diocletian. Nine hundred years of never missing an opportunity to take over
any available (or even not-so-available) country had left sever strains in
the board of directors. Diocletian therefore led a management buy-out, in
which he wisely took control of the eastern half of the empire (much better
weather, nicer food, well-trained concubines etc.), leaving the
less-desirable western half to an associate, whose impact on history was so
great that he is now, sadly, completely anonymous.

                                  410 AD:
                                  
Although the outposts had been behaving oddly for some time, the fifth
century saw the very heart of the empire, Rome itself, under threat. From
the north came hordes of very unpleasant barbarians, the Goths; swinging
great battle-axes and manes of red hair and struggling under the weaight of
some very peculiar names (well, could you cope with Vercingetorix?), these
hard men of the north swept down upon Rome and, pausing for only the
briefest bit of rape and pillage, captured it. The people of Rome,
insulated for many centuries by the width of their empire from any actual
fighting, were unable to put up any resistance.

Thus ended the great Roman Empire.
