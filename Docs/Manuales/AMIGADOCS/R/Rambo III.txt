HOW TO PLAY

  The enemy is holding Colonel Trautman in a heavily guarded fort,

somewhere in the desolate plains of Afghanistan. An agonizing end is
imminent! Half a world away, the spy masters play their only card and
dispatch the one man who can defy the odds and snatch victory from the
jaws of defeat. The enemy's worst nightmare is about to come true.

RAMBO III consists of three missions:

The Fortress
 
   Rambo breaks into the fort where Colonel Trautman is being held
prisoner. Stealth is important; the enemy is everywhere. Search the
fort, find the Colonel, and release him. You'll find various items
along the way to add to your inventory and accomplish your objective.

The Vehicle Compound

   The only escape route from the fort is through the enemy's vehicle
compound. Neutralize this facility by priming bombs in strategic
locations around the compound. The guards are under orders to shoot
first and ask questions later! Get to a waiting helicopter and leave
the area before the fort becomes tomorrow's headline!
