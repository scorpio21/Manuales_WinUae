           THE DOX TO RICK DANGEROUS II--SCOOTER<->GENESIS
           !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES:...

BACK IN A FLASH AND AS FEARLESS AS EVER.....
RICK DANGEROUS INTREPID SUPER HERO AND PART TIME STAMP COLLECTOR IS BACK AFTER
HAVING TACKLED THE FAT MAN IN HIS FIRST GREAT ADVENTURE,THE FAT MAN HAS ONCE
AGAIN RETURNED AND RICK MUST DO BATTLE TO SAVE EARTH FROM VILLIANOUS ALIENS.IF
HE SURVIVES THE FIRST PART OF THE MISSION IN THE SPACE SHIP AT HYDE PARK-
LONDON,RICK WILL FACE NEW HAZARDS IN THE ICE CAVERNS OF FREEZIA,THE ATOMIC MUD
MINES,THE FORESTS OF VEGETABLIA,...AND FINALLY, CONFRONT THE FAT MAN AT HIS
PLANET BARF!!..

RICK IS EQUIPPED WITH ELECTRONIC DETONATORS!!!!

THESE MAY BE DROPPED IN ORDER TO TRIGGER TRAPS,BLOW AWAY WALLS,ENEMIES AND
GENERALLY DO LOTS OF DAMAGE,ALLOWING OUR HERO TO CONTINUE HIS QUEST.BEING VERY
DANGEROUS,RICK MUST GET AWAY FROM THEM IF HE IS TO AVOID BEING BLOWN UP!.THESE
HAVE THE ADDED ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE TO BE SLID BY RICK ACROSS THE FLOOR AND
LEDGES.

THE BIG PUNCH:...

RICK HAS TWO FISTS,GUARANTEED TO MOMENTARILY STUN ANY ENEMY.HE CAN ALSO PUNCH 
SWITCHES ON WALLS TO TRIGGER LIFTS,OPEN TRAP DOORS AND SWITCH OFF LASERS.

TRAPS:

TO AVOID TRAPS BE RESOURCEFUL.THE TRAPS ARE DEVIOUS,RICK MAY NEED TO PUNCH,RAY
GUN ,ELECTRONIC DETONATOR OR SIMPLY USE HIS WITS TO SURVIVE,DEPENDING ON THE
NATURE OF THE TRAP.THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS AS HOW EACH TRAP IS TRIGGERED OR
AVOIDED SO BE CAREFUL AND THINK AHEAD.THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS AS THEY SEEM.

THE RAYGUN:...

THIS FIRES LASER BOLTS!..THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE NUMBERS OF SHOTS THE GUN
HOLDS,THERE WILL BE THE OCCASIONAL CONTAINER THAT RICK CAN PICK UP,ENABLING HIM
TO REPLENISH HIS SUPPLY,USE THE AMMO WISELY,REMEMBER THAT THE RAY GUN CAN BE
USED TO ACTIVATE SOME TRAPS AS WELL AS SHHOT THE ENEMY.

ANTI-GRAVITY BIKE:...

OCCASIONALLY,RICK COMES ACROSS AN ANTI-GRAVITY BIKE PARK,RICK CAN THEN JUMP ON
AN ANTI-GRAVITY BIKE AND FLOAT AROUND THE CORRIDORS,AVOIDING TRAPS ON THE
WAY,THE ANTI-GRAVITY IS EQUIPPED WITH A FORWARD FIRING LASER CANNON WITH WHICH
RICK CAN DESPATCH ALIENS AND TRIGGER TRAPS.

ONE LAST THING.....ONCE HE MANAGES TO COMPLETE A LEVEL,RICKS SUPPLY OF LASER
BOLTS AND ELECTRONIC DETONATORS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REPLENISHED AND RICK WILL
GAIN AN EXTRA LIFE..BEFORE STARTING THE NEXT LEVEL.
