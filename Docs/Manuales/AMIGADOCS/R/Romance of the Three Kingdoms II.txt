AMIGA MOUSE OPERATION

The AMIGA version of ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS II has been designed
with complete mouse support.  Except for Hot Keys, there is little
occasion to use the keyboard.  While almost all of the gadgets used in
this version are self-explanatory, the following explanations are
included to help you get started.
In general, the mouse is used in this way:

       Left Mouse Button:      To select items, commands, generals
       Right Mouse Button:     To display the command menu

Selecting Items And Generals

When you are prompted to make a selection (a general to train or send
to war, goods to buy or sell, etc.), simply move the cursor to the
desired item.  A highlighted bar will appear where the cursor touches
a selection.  Press the select button to make the desired selection.
Choose "Continue" to end selection.

Selecting Commands

Commands are selected in the same way as items.  With main display
commands, you may cancel before executing a selected command by
clicking on "Cancel."  Combat commands will be executed as they are
selected.

COMMANDS

All commands appear in Command Menus.  To execute a command, find the
appropriate menu item, and select it with the cursor.
Tip: Some commands have Hot Keys for quicker execution.
