YOUR TASK

Resolution 101, sub section (a):

'It is hereby passed as law that, from the nineteenth of January in the year
two thousand and thirty eight, any offender held within a State or Federally
owned prison of the United States of New America, wishing to receive amnesty
from the Government for any past crimes that he/she has been judged guilty
of, may receive his/her amnesty through the successful application and comple-
tion of a State Sheriff's Termination Warrant. These Warrants shall only be
for the termination of the most highly dangerous criminals in the United
States of New America - NFBI classed type 'A' only.'

It had to happen. Crime was ripe and the Government could no longer control
it. In a desperate attempt to contain the soaring levels of crime the U.S.
Senate has passed a new article of law - Resolution 101. Under this resolution
convicted criminals are being offered the chance to earn their freedom by
tracking down and terminating high profile criminals and gangland bosses.

You are one of these convicted criminals and you have been given your Search/
Destroy license and a Theta 4000 ground skimmer vehicle with a light machine
gun weapon system. You will also be given insurance with the International
Vehicle Insurance Corporation (IVI Corp.) with an initial insurance rating of
five (this is basically your number of lives).

Your mission briefing is to track down four drug running criminals operating
in Los Envegas, a small city in the south, and confiscate their drug supplies
as evidence against them. When enough drug supplies have been amassed to
convict them you may proceed with their termination.

Each quarter of the city is controlled by a different drug runner: the East-
side by Toby Komazuki, the Southern Boulevards by Johnny Psyclops, the West
End by Lord Camamile and the Northern Suburbs by Jake Joukowski. You will
confront each runner individually.

Each runner is also insured by the IVI Corp. and will receive a new vehicle
each time that you defeat him. The runner will then lie low, re-equiping his
vehicle, making it even meaner and tougher and recruiting even more criminals
whilst you carry out your mission to defeat the three runners operating in the
ohter three sectors of the city.

When you have defeated a runner for the third time, his insurance rating with
the IVI Corp. will have expired and you can finally terminate him for good.
Once you have terminated all four of the runners (ie completed twelve levels),
you will have won the game and you will earn your freedom!

However, you shoud be aware that your own insurance rating will be reduced by
one for every time that your ground skimmer is destroyed and has to be re-
placed by the IVI Corp. Your rating will also be reduced by one if a runner
ever manages to complete his drug run. Whenever your rating is reduced you
will be allowed another attempt to defeat the current active runner.

It is not unknown for Sheriff's to place 'discreet' bets on the success of
their men before embarking on a mission and indeed you have even heard rumors
that the Sheriff in charge of your mission, SHeriff Stone, has placed his
entire life savings on you - to win! It is also not unknown for criminals to
meet with severe and harmful 'accidents' after returning from missions empty
handed and with their targets still at large. Should this be the case, then
it can be presumed that you will meet with a rather large 'accident' if you
fail this mission and will be making a stay at the prison hospital.

If you run out of credit with the IVI Corp. (ie your insurance rating reaches
zero) you will not receive any more vehicles and you will be treated in the
hospital for any injuries received from crashes before being returned to the
State Penitentiary - your mission a failure!

THE CITY

On the city streets, everyone travels around in a vehicle of some sort - and
every vehicle is armed with some form of weaponry from a humble machine gun
to the deeply menacing spider-mines.

Your vehicle is a Theta 4000 ground skimmer which has various items of
instrumentation mounted on the dashboard, a turbo-thrust jet engine, an
automatic light machine gun weapon system and full titanium armour. The
skimmer has the ability to float above the ground on a cushion of air, even
over rough terrain and water but you should be aware not to stop moving over
the latter or your vehicle will sink. You will have the opportunity during
the game to visit shops within the city to re-equip or upgrade you vehicle
and this will become necessary as your vehicle becomes damaged and as your
adversaries become tougher. There are nine shop complexes throughout the city
and each complex contains three shops.

As you progress through the city, your vehicle armour will be damaged by
collision or by coming under fire. When your armour has been completely
penetrated your vehicle will be destroyed. Armour 'patches' are available
from Android Mabel's "Odds'n'Ends" shop.

If your armour is less than one quarter full strength, then enemy fire may
result in the loss of an item of instumentation which can then be replaced
at a shop. In these conditions, if the particular fire is received from
enemy mines then the damage will be sustained to the underside of the
vehicle, directly into your engine and you will slow down. Engine booster
packs are available from Henry's Status "Engine" Shop.

Weaponry can be bought at Old Timer Clive's "Smoking Gun" Shop. More detail is
given on the shops later on.

THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE

If you have just loaded the game you will be asked to type in your criminals
name before you start. If you do not type in a name then you will be issued
the name 'Crusader'.

You start the game from the sheriff's office, about to enter the city. The
following options are available to you from the Sheriff's Office.

PLAY - seleting this option will put you into the city in your Theta 4000.

LOAD - when you select this option, ten of your saved positions will appear
on the screen. Each saved position will appear as a criminal name followed by
the amount of cash that he has and what level he is on. Double-clicking on
the position will load it.

SAVE - as per loading a position but by double-clicking on a position, your
current status will be saved over that position.

RECORD - (PC Version only) this option enables you to look at your criminals
record, which is also displayed whenever you start a level.

NEW - this option enables you to start the game again.

When you select PLAY, the authorities will give you details of the current
drug runner that you have to hunt down. This includes his name, the level
number that you are about to start on and the sector of the city that you are
about to enter.

You will also be issued your criminal record showing the following informa-
tion: Your criminals record number along with your alias or name (PC version
only), your resources (ie cash balance), current level number (1 to 12), 
insurance rating and the number of yellow 'life' canisters collected so far.
Your vehicle hardware is also displayed showing your vehicles current armour
statis and weapons. There are three weapon types available (though if you have
just started you will only have a light machine gun) of each weapon system
and each has a class of 1, 2 or 3 - designating it as Light, Medium or Heavy
respectively.

THE DRUG RUNNER AND HIS GANG BOSSES

When the drug runner begins his run the sky will darken. Whenever one of his
henchmen appears, a bolt of lightning will preceed it for a split second to
show where the henchman is about to appear.

The runner has a set route through his sector, dropping off drugs from
building to building - this is called his drug run. He appears in the game as
a distinctive orange/red ship stopping at buildings to do his deals before
moving on to the next one. Whenever the runner stops off at a building, the
whole building will disappear so that you can see that the runner is still
there.

Drug runners are protected by bodyguards. Some of them will hang around the
runner and follow his movements. If he comes under fire he can dispatch any
number of these bodyguards to protect himself.

The runner cannot be defeated until you have collected enough of his drug
canisters (see later) as evidence against him. If you fire on the runner
before collecting enough of these canisters, then you will not be able to harm
him but his bodyguards will still come to attack you. The number of canisters
that you need to collect is displayed in the dashboard underneath your cash
balance in the form of a contraband counter.

There also a number of gang bosses within the city who are mainly controlled
by the drug runner who has given each of them a special task. Each boss has a
number of henchmen that follow him about to help him carry out that task.
Tasks include protecting the runner, going to particular points in the city,
making drug pick-ups, defending particular areas and buildings or even
attacking you (if you have upset the runner enough!).

If you destroy a boss you will automatically be attacked by any of his hench-
men that are still alive. The drug runner will have organized all of the gang
bosses and their tasks in a cunning strategy to prevent you from defeating
him.

On the last leg of the drug runner's run, a red 'run complete' warning light
will flash on the far right-hand side of the dashboard, warning you that the
run is about to be completed. If the runner completes a run, you will see him
laughing at you and Sheriff Stone will 'see to it' that you lose an insurance
rating. You will then be given another attempt to defeat his run unless, of
course, your insurance rating has expired, in which case the authorities will
'put' you into the hospital for failing.

Throughout each level, more and more criminals will appear in the form of
robotic snipers, guardians, assassins and drones that just happen to get in
the way. And as the levels progress, each runner will be protected by more
and more of his bodyguards and gang bosses making your task increasingly
difficult.

Every criminal in the city has a reward on his head and you will be credited
with a bounty for each criminal that you terminate. You will receive a
particularly high bounty for killing bosses and even more for bosses making
a pickup (see later).

CASH AND DRUG CANISTERS

As you destroy criminals, they will drop either cash or drug canisters on the
ground. You should drive your vehicle over these to collect them.

Cash canisters only remain on the ground for a short time before they dis-
appear. They contain the illicit takings of the criminals and will vary in
value according to how important the criminal was. Remeber that bosses carry
the most cash.

Under Resolution 101, sub-section (b) i):
'Any monies confiscated or seized, for or on behalf of the Government, that
are known to have been illicitly, immorally or illegally earned, may be used
by the offender seeking amnesty to aid or further him in the successful
completion of his/her termination warrant.'

Put into plain English this means that you will be credited for any cash
canisters that you collect and this money can be used by you in shops at any
time to upgrade or repair your ground skimmer.

Drug cannisters contain the illicit contraband of the drug runner and remain
on the ground for nearly a minute. Various coloured canisters can be dropped
by both the runner himself or any of his henchmen. Each of these canisters
collected will cause the contraband counter on your dashboard to tick down
one and you will also be credited with fifty New American Dollars on your
dashboard cash balance.

As the runner makes his run, he will deliberately drop drug canisters at set
posistions along his run. These canisters come in one of four coloursa and
each has it's own different effect:
Red 'drug' Canisters - Safe to pick up.
Yellow 'life' Canisters - Safe to pick up - for every four of these canisters
            that you collect, your insurance rating will be increased by one.
Grey 'booby' Canisters - Booby trapped - these explode and damage your armour
Black 'death' Canisters - Terminator trapped - these explode and destroy your
            ground skimmer causing your insurance rating to decrease by one.

Sometimes, when a drop is made by the runner, one of the gang bosses will be
oredered to pickup the drug canister and take it somewhere. The boss will then
make the pick-up. Once the pick-up is made, the boss will flash and take the
contraband elsewhere. Destroying the boss whilst he is flashing will credit
you with a very healthy sum of cash. Also, destroying a boss who has made a
pickup will cause him to drop a normal red drug canister, even if the canister
he picked up was not a red one. This is a very useful way of obtaining a drug
canister which was black. In some situations, black drug canisters will be the
only canisters that you will find in a sector in which case this tactic will
become essential to be able to proceed further in the game.

Henchmen holding drug canisters will always drop red coloured canisters when
shot and these are safe to pick up.

                Contraband Counter/

On the dashboard you will see four small vid-screens on the left hand side.
From top-left going clockwise, these units are:

Local Radar - this unit shows all of the surrounding enemies in your local
vicinity with your own position at the center of the vid-screen. This radar
will rotate as you turn so that your forward view is always shown north on
the radar. Moving vehicles appear as 'red blips'. Static drones appear as
amber 'blips'. Cash and drug canisters appear as green 'blips'. The drug
runner will appear as a white 'blip'.

Armour Status Indicator - this unit shows the status of your vehicle armour.
When your armour drops below one quarter, enemy fire may penetrate your
armour and internal damage may occur. When your armour is completely
penetrated, your vehicle will be destroyed.

City Map - this unit shows enemy activity in the form of red 'blips' for
moving vehicles and amber 'blips' for static drones overlaid on a tiny map
of the city. Your own position is shown within the city as a white 'blip'.
The drug runner is also shown as a white 'blip'.

Direction Finder - this unit points to the position of your nearest shop or
the drug runner himself. If the target is very close to you then the middle
of the pointer will light up. If the target is the drug runner and he has not
started his run yet then the finder will appear inactive. Press 'F5' to
toggle the target between your nearest shop complex and the drug runner him-
self - a small icon will appear for a split second so that you know what your
current target is.

Note that it is possible for any one of these units to be destroyed by enemy
fire penetrating areas of your armour. When a unit has been destroyed, the
expansion unit plug will be removed next to the relevant vid-screen and the
vid-screen will appear blank.

The CBTV Link - is on the far right side of the dashboard and enables you to
see the drug runner operating on this level and it also enables him to see
you! He will laugh at you whenever one of his henchmen scores a heavy hit on
you or he will sneer at you whenever you manage to kill one of his henchmen.

Weapon Indicator - shows you which weapon you have currently selected. One of
the three indicators will always be lit to show you which weapon you currently
have active. The lights represent from left to right: machine gun, cannon and
heat seeker missile launcher.

Compass - tells you which direction you are facing in the city.

Resources - is an eight digit readout of your current cash balance.

Contraband Counter - is a digital readout of the number of drug canisters that
you need to confiscate before you are able to defeat the drug runner.

Run Complete Warning Light - will flash red when the drug runner is about to
complete his run. The light starts to flash when he leaves his last building
before returning to his home building. The amount of time he takes to reach
'home' will vary from level to level.

SHOPS

There are three shopping complexes within each quarter of the city. Refer to
the map at the end of this file for there locations. You should use your
Direction Finder to locate the closest one. Once you have reached a shopping
complex you should park outside it (just stop your vehicle on the dark grey
shop forecourt) and you will then automatically enter the shopping complex.

Inside the shopping complex you can access any of the three shops and buy
items. Click on the 'NEXT' window in a shop to move round to the next shop-
keeper. You will be able to light up a small light under each item for sale
and the price for that item will appear in the PRICE window. If the light
does not appear or a SOLD message appears in the window then the item is no
longer available for sale.

Note that in Clives shop, the weapon trade-in price is displayed in the PRICE
window.

On the Amiga click on the item to buy with the left mouse button, then click
on the BUY window to buy the item. Click on the EXIT window to leave the shop.

When you buy an item, the shopkeeper will wink an eye at you, the cost will be
deducted from your cash balance and the item will be fitted on your vehicle.

Note that when you leave a shop, your Direction Finder will automatically
target back onto the drug runner.

F1 - Switch to Machine Gun Fire.
F2 - Switch to Cannon Fire (if you have one).
F3 - Switch to Heat Seekers (if you have them).
F5 - Toggle Directional Finder Target (if you have a directional finder).
F6 - Toggle Sights on/off.

At any time the following keys can be used:

F7 - Toggle Music on/off.
F9 - Toggle Joystick/Mouse
F10 - Toggle Pause on/off.
SHIFT & HELP - Quit game.
HELP - Restart this level and lose an IVI rating.

STRATEGY

There are many ways to approach the game, although the basic strategy is to
kill alot and collect the red drug canisters. It is always safer to pick off
henchmen and bodyguards before gang bosses and drug runners as these can be
tackled in isolation.

It is worth trying a level a few times to find out whether gang bosses are
used to pickup contraband, and if so, to wait until they've made their pickup
before killing them, to earn more cash and to convert black drug canisters to
red ones.

It is important to keep buying weapons - bigger weapons have more power and as
the levels go on, the criminals need more and more powerful weapons to destroy
them.

Engine booster packs are not needed unless you start to slow down.

Keep shield level above half way so as to avoid taking extra damage.

Also you can fire through bushes and enemies can't. Keep moving. Keep buying
weapons. Good Luck!
