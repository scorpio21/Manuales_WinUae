			      - Foreword -
 			      ------------
 
 It is Summer 1992 - and you know the Olympic games have started now...
 Most software firms join the olympic reign and release sport games.
 
 Even ANIMATORS gets olympic - but we dont care about atlethics,so we
 decided to convert a much more funnier event  -  the PARALYMPICS.

 After a long time of lazyness (especially of CHRIS), here it is .... 
 - Roll Or Die !!!!
 It is the first game over two disks that is released only for the scene.
 That means that we have no prophit, but only the hope that you like it !!
 We also could not test it on all amiga versions cause of time probs ....
 The game is a little bit sadistic but as we already mentioned in the game
 we regard it as a joke. Hope you like it anyway ......... Morbid/ANIMATORS

			    ----------------

Mountain Roller: Move Joystick as fast as possible to the left and to the
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ right!! When the Powerbar is on it's end, the wheelchair
		 climbs up the hill.... Calculate yar power cause the higher
		 you are, the more difficult it is !!!
		 But don't be too slow cause the faster you are the more
		 points you will get! When you need more time than six
		 minutes the wheelchair driver will fuck up, too !!!!

Street Roller:	 Try to reach the finish line in the given time.. Do not
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	 crash too often cause the following time penalties will
		 make it impossible for you to reach the finishing line!
		 Accelerate by pushing the joystick button.

Long Jump:	 In this part you also have to move yar joystick as fast as
~~~~~~~~~~	 possible to the left and to the right !!! The more the
		 powerbar is on it's end the longer is yar jump !!!

Hospital Race:	 Your goal is to escape from hospital with your wheelchair.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	 Avoid to crash with the walls, beds, patients and 
		 hospital personal.
		 The more you are at the bottom of the screen, the more
		 points you will get, and the time is also running slower !

       These were all the hints you need to get a better highscore.
