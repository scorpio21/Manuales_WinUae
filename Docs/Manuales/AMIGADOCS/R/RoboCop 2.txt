ROBOCOP 2
SCENARIO

Foreboding, futuristic skyscrapers soar into the polluted, grey sky. Decay and decline - this is the decadent city of Detroit in the near future. A city that is slowly crumbling into ruin.

With the police on strike, the helpless citizens and the legions of the homeless are easy prey for gangs of heavily armed hoodlums, none more ruthless than the evil Cain and his gang of psychopathic killers.

One force stands in anarchy's path. One force that can prevent the innocent residents falling into an abyss of lawlessness and chaos - Robocop.
