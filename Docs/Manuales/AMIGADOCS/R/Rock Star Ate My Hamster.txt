                   THE CECIL PITT GUIDE TO ROCK MANAGEMENT
		   ---------------------------------------

HI THERE POP-PICKERS!
---------------------
I'm Cecil Pitt: rock entrepreneur, creative genius, friend and confidante
to the stars. No doubt you've heard of me. I;ve been a starmaker for some
time now, and I'd like to share my inside knowledge of the ROCK BIZ with
you in this article: THE CECIL PITT GUIDE TO ROCK MANAGEMENT.

PICKING YOUR STARS
------------------
How many superstars can you manage? One may be cheaper and easier, but the
more you have, the more popular you'll be - THINK BIG!
Should you go for the up-to-the-minute groovy pop megastars, or save money
on boring old has-beens? It's up to you, and what you can afford. As a
general rule, cheaper stars are less popular, less talented, and most prone
to petty fits of rage and jealousy. This is only a guide through, some of
the nicest, most talented and hard working rock stars I've managed have
been willing to work for only a few pounds a week. Remember, there's one
born every minute.
Get to know the stars, their talents and their moods. That way you can pick
the members that suit your style of management best, and GO FOR IT!

MAKING THE BREAD
----------------
OK, you've got the stars, you've got the management ability, but how are
you going to get that record deal.
Can the band play together? Get them to practise, listen to what they sound
like, do they sound like an outsight happening chart phenomenon to you?
Now it's time to build their popularity. Record companies will only be
interested in your band if they've got the FANS who are willing to buy
their latest records.
Touring and publicity helps, of course, but choose your venues and ticket
prices carefully if this is your band's first outing then they're unlikely
to fill a stadium with ticket's at £20.
Don't push the band too hard either. Continued touring is great for
building up income and skills, best give them a break now and again. Lavish
gifts and affection on them: show them you CARE. Otherwise you might find
them causing trouble, asking for unneccessary creative control, or worst of
all threatening to leave!

WHICH RECORD DEAL?
------------------
If you're president, and can manage your income and star's successfully,
it's inevitable that the record companies will start approaching you. THINK
CAREFULLY before you accept any deal though, is a better offer going to
come along soon? On the other hand, don't be too choosy. Your band might
not always be as popular, and that's the very time those tempting records
offers dry up.

GOING PLATINUM
--------------
That's the name of the game isn't it? (Actually no, the game's called 'Rock
Star' -ED). So get the best possible studio you can afford. And think
carefully about naming the band's groovy songs.
Now you've got a healthy stack of material to release, so plan your
releases carefully. It's up to you whether you release a single or an
albumn first, or hit the global marketplace with them both together. One
thing's for sure - successful singles boost the sales of an L.P, so try to
get the maximum exposure for your potential toe-tapping chart-toppers. Make
a video whenever you can, but choose your directors, locations, and
contents carefully.
Then, who knows? Instant megastardom, or terminal oblivion down the annals
of history? It all depends on YOU; your skills, your decisions, your
mistakes.
And there'll be more to deal with as well: sponsors, music pirates, taxman,
the list goes on. Yes, it's hard work, and it often means firing your best
friends, or telling them things they don't want to hear. It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it. The rewards are there for the taking though,
collecting those 4 silver discs, watching your band climb the steep slopes
of commercial success, counting the money as it flows in. And who could be
better informed that you right now, thanks to my immense generosity in
shring my vast knowledge of the ROCK BIZ with you, in this CECIL PITT GUIDE
TO ROCK MANAGEMENT. So, what are you waiting for? Grab your slice of glory
now - THE CECIL PITT WAY.
