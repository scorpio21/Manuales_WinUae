TIMING!
-=-=-=-

Round the Bend is a game against the clock, with the time ticking away before
the next publication of the comic.  At the start of the game, and when a page 
is completed and goes to press, the time is set for when the next page of the
comic must be completed.  If the timer runs out before the next page is 
completed the game ends.
Arriving at a comic pages punch line sends the page to press and returns the
character to the office.  It is therefore up to the player to decide how
many parts of the video press Lou Brush can collect before going for the next
comic page Punchline.
