Afradi of dizzying heights? Queasy at the thought of plunging a hundred feet
in just seconds? WARNING: ROLLER COASTER RUMBLER IS ONLY FOR THE TOTALLY
RADICAL RUMBLER!

This truely amazing game is like nothing you've ever seen before! Encounter
the ultimate challenge as you dip and weave, turn and climb...while at the
same time trying to shoot moving targets before you get ejected from your
seat!

Realistic 3D graphics make you feel like you're on an actual roller coaster!
Compete against the computer or pair up with a fellow player to shoot the
targets and double your chances of winning!

This action packed shoot-em up starts off slowly as you move down the Course,
but just watch that speed building up.

Completing a full Course takes you on to the next level with different levels
of attack waves and targets to shoot at.

Having ridden the Roller Coaster try something a little different. Leave the
Roller Park and venture into the surrounding landscape, speed up your craft
and shoot on sight. To enter this mode press F4 when on the Option Screen.
