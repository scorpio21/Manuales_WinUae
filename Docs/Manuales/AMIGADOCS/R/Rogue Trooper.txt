Typed by Belgarath

The war on Nu-Earth continues, The Southers have created a genetically
engineered fighting force, The Genetic Infantry.

On their first mission, all but one of the G.I's are wipoed out. The location
of the drop zone was given to the Norts, they were betrayed by one of
their own Souther Generals.

The surviving G.I. rescues three of his buddies bio chips which are
attached to and become part of his weaponry.

Our G.I. turns ROGUE and has to fight both Southers and Norts in his
quest to find and kill the traitor general.

Bland and Brass Equipment Stores

Bland and Brass are battlefield scavengers who will buy and sell
anything for a profit. You will encounter these two characters periodically
during your flight across Nu-Earth.

When you meet them you can trade your points for components or even
a new ship. To buy a component, position the pointer over the spare you
require and hold down the fire button. While still holding the fire button
move the component onto your spacecraft in the upper left corner of the
screen. Releasing fire buys the component and it will appear in one of
the boxes surrounding your ship. If you cannot buy a component, then
that component is too expensive or is not suitable for your current craft.

To sell a component attached to your ship, move the pointer over it and
press fire. While still holding fire drag the component to the money icon.
Releasing fire sells the equipment.

To buy a new ship, press fire with the pointer over the ship icon at the
bottom right of the screen, next to the exit icon. You then select the ship
you desire by pressing fire with the pointer over the ship you want. You
must have enough credits for this. Be warned, some ships cannot have
certain components fitted to them. When choice of ship is complete,
press fire with the pointer over the toolbox icon and you will then be
returned to the upgrade screen.

When all your choices are made, press fire with the pointer over the exit
icon. You will then return to the game.


Level 1

Rogue has just escaped from a Nort cell. You must guide him through
four sub levels to rescue his bio chipped companions and also to gain
information pertaining to the identity of the traitor general.

Trying to stop Rogue in his task are many sentry robots, Nort troops and
sun legionnaires. Kill or be killed.

To complete this level, the chem-seals need to be broken. High
explosive works wonders in these situations.

Hints and Tips

(i)   If you see a switch - flick it, it probably does something.
(ii)  Examine anything that looks different.
(iii) Avoid floor mines - they hurt.
(iv)  Avoid electric floors -  they are shocking.
(v)   If it moves - kill it, if it doesn't move - kill it before it kills you.
(vi)  Use lifts to go up and down.
(vii) Generally kick butt, they deserve it.


Level 2

Having escaped from the Nort prison in a stolen craft, Rogue must now
fly his craft back to the Souther lines. Which craft he has depends on
what was left for him to steal. Rogue's main task on this level is to catch
the fleeing Prison commandants ship in order to get the IFF device which
will allow him to fly a Nort spaceship to the Souther base.

Rogue is flying over Nort controlled territory, nothing would please them
more than to smash him into thousands of Genetically Engineered 
Fragments.

This level is completed by Rogue destroying as many Nort craft as
possible, finally destroying the prison commandants craft.

Hints

(i)   Upgrade your ship as much as possible by buying spare parts from
      Bland and Brass.
(ii)  Do not trust Bland and Brass.
(iii) Avoid enemy fire.
(iv)  Make certain all your equipment is compatible. Bland and Brass will
      sell anything for a profit.
	  

Level 3

Rogue is now over Souther lines, but they are being heavily attacked by
the Norts who are using "Dreamweaver" gas. This gas effects Rogue
causing him to experience hallucinations. His objective in this level is to
survive until reaching the Souther base where he can expose the identity
of the Traitor General.

Hints
(i)  Kill everything that gets in your way.
(ii) Don't get killed yourself.


Level 4

Rogue must now get through the outer defences of the Souther base,
and get the evidence to the Souther high command. The Souther
generals are in readiness to escape their base which is being over-run
by a massive Nort offensive. Souther technology is more advanced than
Nort, and Rogue can put this to use.

Hints
(i)   Solve the puzzles
(ii)  Expose the traitor general.
(iii) Be a hero.
