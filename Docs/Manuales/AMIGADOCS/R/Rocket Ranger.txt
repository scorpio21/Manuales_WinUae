DO NOT THROW THIS MANUAL AWAY!  READ IT CAREFULLY!  GOOD MEN HAVE RISKED
THEIR LIVES TO SEND THIS MANUAL TO YOU:

One hundred years ago, in 1940, the Nazis won World War II. It was
a horrible mistake, a cosmic  error that plunged our world into
a century-long nightmare of fascist terror. But you are going to 
change history. With our help you will prevent the Nazis from winning
the war. You will end this nightmare before it begins.

We, an underground group of freedom loving scientists, sent the
objects that have appeared in your laboratory. If the coordinates
on our time machine were set properly, it is now May, 1940. Please 
examine these objects closely. Nothing like them exists in your time.
The large device is a rocket pack and the smaller objects are a decoder
wheel, radium pistol and wrist monitor. These tools give you the power
to change history.

We your children, beg you to help us.

After the Nazis won the war, Hitler's Third Reich established a world
government run by the Fuhrer's fascist puppets, an empire of evil
dominating the entire earth. The members of our  group are scientists
forced to work at a Nazi weapons research facility located at the place
you called Fort Dix, New Jersey. But it bears little resemblance to
the New Jersey you know in 1940.

We live and work as virtual prisoners, developing new weapons for the 
Nazi conquest of space. Our loved ones are held in the Reich's 
"Permanent Vacation" camps, allowed to live only as long as we continue
our obscene research. The building housing our laboratories occupies
the site of your laboratory; so we are in the same physical space,
although we exist in different times.

One of our projects is an experimental time machine. We have not yet
perfected human time travel and we cannot send objects through space.
But we can project inanimate objects through time. In the physical 
sense, the objects we sent you did not move-we simply altered the
time-plane of their molecular structure.

Our Nazi masters are about to discover that the time machine works.
This, then, is our only chance to attempt contact with the past; if
the Nazis discover that we have used the machine, our lives are
forfeit.

In the year 2040, no power is great enough to resist the Reich; but
in your time, there is a chance. We believe that one man, armed with
the right tools and advance warning of coming events can stop them.
Though the Nazis have rewritten history to justify their perverted
doctrines, we have uncovered proof that the country you call the United
States was the world's strongest industrial power. With enough time
to marshal her resources, the United States and her allies would have
defeated the Nazis.

But in 1940 the balance of power suddenly shifted. German technology
leaped ahead several decades, perhaps through the discovery of lunarium,
and the Nazis won the war before America could intervene.
According to legend, the Nazis attacked in zeppelins that flew in the 
stratosphere, so high that even the newest American fighter planes
could not reach them. There was no defense against the power of these
Death Ships. Entire nations were conquered from the air by the Nazi
zeppelin fleet.

We know that the Germans had several key bases in different parts of
the world. Your mission is to find these bases, use the rocket pack 
and radium pistol to penetrate their defenses, and destroy their 
sources of power.

You were not randomly chosen to lead this mission. You were selected
from an old personnel roster, after we discovered that you attended
school with the daughter of Otto Barnstorff, America's 
top scientist, was somehow linked to the source of the Nazi's power.
From an old family diary, we have learned that the Nazis will soon
kidnap Barnstorff and his daughter Jane and send them to Germany in
a zeppelin. Use the wrist monitor to track their movements, and use
the rocket pack to save them. It has a full load of lunarium fuel;
you may be able to steal more from the Nazis....

So we place our fate in your hands. We cannot predict how your actions 
will affect the future-in fact, our own lives may no longer exist in
the altered world that results. But we see no other way to stop this 
Thousand Year Blight, and it must be stopped.

We have given you the power to change history. My God! The Gestapo
is at the door...goodbye and good luck!

FOR USE ONLY BY PARTY MEMBERS IN GOOD STANDING UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH


            HIMMELWURFER ROCKET PACK Model M2000
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------
Congratulations! You have been allowed to purchase a Himmelwurfer, the Reich's
most reliable rocket pack since 2025. This manual contains important
information about your rocket pack's safe operation and maintenance.
 Reichlaw Number 52237-2 requires you to read these instructions carefully,
familiarizing yourself with the controls described in order to make your
flights trouble-free and enjoyable, under penalty of death.

BREAK-IN PERIOD
---------------
During the first 3,000 kilometers of flying, avoid cruising for
extended periods at a constant speed. This break-in procedure also
applies to exchanged or refitted engines. During and after the break-in
period, be sure to fly the rocket pack at moderate speeds until the engine
is warmed up. Remember, your Himmelwurfer Dealer knows your pack best.
 Consult him for factory-approved service assistance, under penalty 
of death.

HARNESS PRECAUTIONS
-------------------
Your harness is a one-piece combination harness with an emergency release
designed to unlock easily in the event of a water landing. Before buckling,
adjust the rocket pack to a comfortable position; stand erect and allow the 
pack to settle naturally onto your shoulders.

     *Comfort clips sold on the black market are not recommended since they.
       could impair the function and safety of the harness.
       Note that use of these clips is a capital offense.
     *Never attempt to buckle more than one person into the harness.
       This practice will lead to your immediate arrest and imprisonment in 
       the Lithuania Vacation Camp.
     *All parts of the harness should be regularly inspected for fraying,
       loosening, wear and other damage. In accordance with Reichlaw Number
       43368-7, treatment for injuries caused by latch or retractor failure
       can be withheld.

PARACHUTE CARE
--------------
Your emergency parachute is designed for safe descents with a maximum load
of 150 kilograms. Maintenance of the parachute is not required under Reichlaw,
but it should be repacked and maintained regularly to insure safe operation. 
 The release pull is located on the left side of the rocket pack. To release
the emergency parachute, pull down on the lever.
 
Replace the emergency parachute if:
 
    * The fabric appears frayed, damaged or worn.
    * Any holes or tears appear in the fabric.
    * Its condition is questionable.
    * It fails to open.

IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS
-------------------
    * When flying at high altitudes be sure to wear a Himmelwurfer 
       Climatizer Flightsuit, available only to Party Members in good
       standing. Cold temperatures and thin atmosphere make high altitude
       flight extremely hazardous. Also note that this is punishable 
       by death.
    * Although your M2000 model rocket is rated for transoceanic flights,
       specialized advanced training is recommended before undertaking long  
       flights over water. Names of unauthorized persons attempting 
       transoceanic flights will be turned over to Permanent Vacation Squad.

GUIDANCE SYSTEM
---------------
Your Himmelwurfer rocket pack is equipped with an automatic guidance system 
allowing easy navigation between all major regions of Europe, Africa, North
America and South America. To use your SECRET DECODER WHEEL, simply enter
the code for your destination and your Himmelwurfer will automatically fly
the most direct route at a comfortable altitude.

If desired, your Himmelwurfer's guidance system can be connected to other
aircraft. Simply use the built-in retracting interface cable to connect the
pack to the aircraft's control unit. The guidance system can then be used to 
guide the aircraft to any participating Reichport as well as to approved 
planetary destinations in the Solar System.

LUNARIUM SAFETY
---------------
The Himmelwurfer M2000 is designed to use lunarium fuel, available at your
nearest Reichmart Filling Station at prices established by the Party's Fair
Pricing Commision. The prices are fair. You will like them. Due to known
hazards involved in handling lunarium, always have a factory-trained, female 
Reichmart attendant refuel your rocket pack, under penalty of death.
      * Contact with lunarium will cause sterility and loss of intelligence     
         in males. Females are unaffected.
      * If lunarium is ingested internally, victim will begin glowing.
         Do not touch victim. Call the nearest hospital or Body Disposal
         Squad immediately.
      * We hope you enjoy the convenience of safe, clean lunarium fuel.

OUR WARRANTY
------------
At a Fair Party Price, Himmelwurfer will repair or replace any factory-
installed part that is defective in material or workmanship under normal use.
Normal use excludes any use that is punishable by death. This warranty 
begins on the date the rocket pack is sold to the first retail purchaser.
The rocket pack is covered for 20 years or 20 kilometers, whichever comes 
first. Thank you for choosing Himmelwurfer, and Heil Hitler!


                 SCHMEISSER RADIUM PISTOL
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AUTHORIZED USE
--------------
The Schmeisser Radium Pistol is the official hand weapon of the Waffen SS,
and is authorized for use only by Party Members in good standing. Any other use 
of this pistol is prohibited by Reichlaw and is punishable by death or 
Permanent Vacation.

SAFETY GUIDELINES
-----------------
The Schmeisser Radium Pistol power supply fires a bolt of energy that
explodes on impact with great destructive power. Users of this weapon are
cautioned to handle it with extreme care, especially within range of Nazi
Party Members in good standing.

Each pistol contains a shielded radium power supply guaranteed for 50,000
trouble-free and lethal shots. Follow these precautions to avoid possible 
exposure to excessive radium energy:
        * Do not attempt to open power supply since exposure to charged 
           radium can be dangerous.
        * Do not operate the pistol if it becomes damaged. Damaged pistols
           can explode.

      
                     TELEFUNKEN WRIST MONITOR

                    ROCKET RANGER
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
         Quick reference card - Amiga version
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to use this card
--------------------
Rocket Ranger is not just a game, it is an experience. Playing Rocket Ranger
is very intuitive, so try exploring on your own for a while. Then if you need
help, consult this reference card.

System Requirements
------------------
1. An Amiga 500, 1000, or 2000 with at least 512k of ram.
2. A joystick connected to port 2.

Optional Equipment
------------------
1. An external disk drive (strongly recommended).
2. Mouse connected to port 1.

Getting Started
---------------
If necessary, boot your Amiga with Kickstart 1.2. At the Workbench prompt put
Reel One in the internal drive. If you have an external drive, put Reel Two 
into it. The game loads automatically. If you have only one drive, follow the 
prompts on screen to change reels. Press any key to skip the intro.
NOTE TO 512K USERS: Rocket Ranger uses ALL of the memory in a 512k machine.
 You must shut down any other applications and windows you have to run the 
game. It is suggested that you start Rocket Ranger up directly after Kickstart.

Object Of The Game
------------------
As Rocket Ranger, you must stop the Nazi war machine from spreading over the
entire planet. Steal the five randomly placed parts needed to build a rocket
ship, then obtain enough lunarium to fly to the source of the Nazi's power--
the moon!

Pausing/Saving the Game
-----------------------
To pause the game, press the right mouse button. A screen containing the 
options "Resume" and "Screen" will appear. The game is now paused. To continue
playing, click on the "Resume" option. Click on the "Screen" option to hide
the game. This looks like a cli screen. To continue playing close up the cli
window, pull down the Workbench screen and click on "Resume". 
 Note: A complete game usually takes less than an hour, so there is no 
save game feature.

How to play the Game
-------------------
You will have to figure out much of what is going on in this fantastic 
universe on your own, but along the way you must master eight arcade sequences
and a complete strategy game. Rocket Ranger is completely joystick controlled. 
NOTE: For best results, tap the joystick lightly when changing menu selections.

Ft. Dix Menu
-----------
After reading Chapter 1, press the button to continue (to advance past text
screens, and most other screens in the game, press the button.) You will see
the Fort Dix menu. The choices on the menu are: WAR ROOM, FUEL DEPOT,
ROCKET LAB, and TAKEOFF.
IMPORTANT: You cannot remain in Ft. Dix longer than twelve months in a row
or you risk a court martial for cowardice. Wars are won by fighting, NOT by
hanging out in New Jersey.

War Room
--------
You have five agents that will help you find the rocket parts, enemy targets,
and enemy bases. There are 26 different regions you can access here, 
corresponding to your Secret Decoder Wheel. The following icons can appear
on the map--some immediately, and some only after your agents find them:



Zeppelin Fleet | Agent | Nazi Base | Your  Location| Nazi Zeppelin | Rocket Lab

(I can't draw them here but they're fairly obvious)
 
The War Room is the ONLY place you will be able to contact your agents. To 
direct an agent, move the tip of the arrow pointer onto the region he is in 
and press the button. You will hear a sound cue if you are not in a valid
region. 
The following information will be shown on the screen when you select a region.

                             <REGION NAME>
                            <REGION STATUS>
                            <AGENT ORDERS>
                            <AGENT COVER>
                   RESERVES              ASSIGNED
                               AGENTS
                            CHANGE ORDERS
                            CHANGE COVER
                               REPORT
                              CONTINUE

AGENTS: You can transfer agents in and out of regions by placing the selector
bar around this choice and pressing the button. If you have several agents in 
RESERVES or ASSIGNED, this may take several presses until you have the
combination you desire.
CHANGE ORDERS: The first time you place an agent into a region, you may not
select this option. You may only order an agent to ORGANIZE RESISTANCE
*after* he has successfully INFILTRATED a country. Put the selector bar on 
this option and press the button to change orders. The new orders will be 
reflected in <AGENTS ORDERS> above. When an agent has successfully organized
resistance, the region will change to the same color as the United States. 
 The Nazi war effort will be delayed for several months when they try to 
conquer regions that are resisting. The regions will flash red as they 
battle with the Nazis.
CHANGE COVER: Orders will be carried out more quickly by agents in HIGH 
PROFILE (white icons on the War Room map) or if two or more agents are 
assigned to the same region. However, in both cases the agents run a higher
chance of blowing their cover and being shot. Agents who are located in 
countries occupied by the Nazis face a greater risk of exposure as well.
 Agents in LOW PROFILE (black icons) will take longer to accomplish their
mission, but have less chance of being caught.
REPORT: When an agent wishes to REPORT, his icon will FLASH rapidly on the 
War Room screen. Put the selector bar on REPORT and press the button. As long
as you keep the agent in the same region, you may read his latest report as
often as you wish.
CONTINUE: Select this option to go back to the main War Room map.

NAZI EFFICIENCY: This is how quickly the Nazis move. Several things affect
this rating. They start at 80% efficiency but if the Nazis take Professor
Barnstorff to the moon, they will use his expertise to raise efficiency to 
100%! Besides protecting the Professor, you must also pay close attention
to your agents. Occasionally they will find important Nazi targets. You can
slow down the Nazi war machine by hitting these vital targets, as well as by
raiding bases for lunarium.
 
Fuel Depot
----------
This is where lunarium is handled. The three places lunarium can be moved 
to/from are: LUNARIUM STORAGE, ROCKET PACK, ROCKET SHIP. To move lunarium
from one place to the other, push the joystick up or down to move the
transfer arrow, then left or right to move the lunarium. You cannot carry
more than 250 units in the rocket ship. Click the button to leave.

Rocket Lab
----------
After you successfully find and steal rocket parts, you may go here to see the
ship being built, or to see how many of the five parts you still need.
Click the button to leave.

Takeoff
-------
Whenever you leave Ft. Dix, you must do the takeoff sequence. Choosing Takeoff
from the Ft. Dix menu will bring up the "destination" screen. Follow the 
prompts on the screen to take off.

Secret Decoder Wheel
--------------------
The rocket pack has a self-navigation system. By transferring the proper amount
of lunarium into the pack, you may travel to any region of the world using
your Secret Decoder Wheel. To use the Wheel, line up the name of your current
location (see the RR icon on the destination map) with the notch on the wheel
and scan down the potential destination regions, noting the proper lunarium
amount for the destination you desire. Then, to enter this amount, press the
joystick button. You will be prompted to load the lunarium from your tank to 
the rocket chamber. Move the joystick LEFT or RIGHT to INCREASE or DECREASE
the indicated units of lunarium. When satisfied, press the button AGAIN.
 Should you accidentally enter the wrong amount, you will be given an
opportunity to correct the error. If you wish to STAY in your current 
location, enter ZERO for the amount of lunarium in your rocket chamber.

Wrist Computer
--------------
When you are in a region other than the USA (Ft.Dix) you will access your
Wrist Computer at the end of any action. The choices on the wrist computer
are: PICK DESTINATION, and SEND SOS. PICK DESTINATION works the same way as
the Takeoff option from Ft.Dix, but you will automatically takeoff after you
transfer the lunarium to your rocket chamber. SEND SOS should be used when you
do not have enough lunarium to make it back to Ft. Dix.

Lunarium
--------
This is the key to winning the game. You must be efficient in using your 
lunarium, as well as finding new supplies. You may obtain more lunarium in 
two ways: organizing resistance at a base or by raiding the base yourself.
 When you organize resistance, the partisans in that region will raid the 
base from time to time and send back whatever lunarium they steal. This will
be reflected in your lunarium storage at the Fuel Depot back at Ft. Dix. 
 Raiding the base yourself is faster but clearly more dangerous. If you
capture more than your pack can hold the remainder will be sent back 
to Ft. Dix.

Combat
------
War is hell. You won't be able to just fly around casually stealing rocket
parts and lunarium. Hostile forces will assault you constantly in a variety
of ways. Keep a tight grip on your radium pistol and be prepared for the
following:

AERIAL COMBAT: Press the button to fire your radium pistol. There is a limit on
how many shots you can fire at once, so be alert. To control your movements in
the air, move the joystick UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT to go in those directions.
When moving UP and DOWN, tap the joystick for a slight change in altitude. If 
you hold the joystick UP or DOWN, you will also change the way you are aiming 
the pistol. Avoid exploding flak or moving directly in front of attacking 
planes. Don't be discouraged if you have difficulty with control at first, 
it takes a little practice. After all, it isn't easy steering when you're 
flying at over 300 miles per hour!
GROUND COMBAT: Press  the button to fire your radium pistol. You will usually
be in a position that doesn't provide much cover. To protect yourself move to
the lowest firing position and HOLD the joystick DOWN to duck. You cannot
be hit this way. Move LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN to adjust your aim.
 Stay on your toes!
HAND TO HAND COMBAT: No help from futuristic technology here. Attacking your
opponent takes two steps. First, PRESS and HOLD the button. Then, push the
joystick UP to swing HIGH, or DOWN to swing LOW (including shots below the
belt. Remember, this is war!).
 Push LEFT to swing left-handed, and RIGHT for the right hand. If the button
is NOT pressed, you can guard your HEAD by holding the joystick UP, and 
guard your BODY by holding the joystick DOWN. Watch your opponent closely.
 When he lowers his arms, go for a blow to the head. When he covers his 
face, work on the body.

                     SECRET DECODER WHEEL


The SECRET DECODER WHEEL prevents unauthorized use of your Himmelwurfer 
Rocket Pack. Whenever starting a flight to a new destination, you must
consult the decoder to obtain the correct access or destination code. For
further information you must consult the enclosed Quick Reference Card,
upon penalty of death.
