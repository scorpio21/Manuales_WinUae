                 COLUMN 1
                 --------
1     Ashton, now a desolate place ruled by
2  the strongest, was once a land of
3  tranquility and peace. Before the region was
4  seized, several wise elders controled the
5  land. One elder was selected by his peers
6  from each kingdom, and together they
7  guided the nation. The elders met at each
8  change of season and carefully planned
9  what was to be done throughout the next
10 phase. Using peace and tranquility as
11 guides, Ashton flourished and its people
12 were all untroubled. As Ashton matured,
13 word of its prosperity spread throughout the
14 world, amd many came to ponder this
15 glorious land.
16    One year, as winter set in, the elders of
17 Ashton all gathered in the town of
18 Fairshire. The meeting began and the doors
19 of their hall blew open and the room filled
20 with smoke. When the cloud vanished, a
21 mysterious scroll remained. Zandar, the
22 wisest of the Elders, opened the scroll and
23 quietly read the contents of the paper. It
24 demanded that the people of Ashton erect a
25 palace for a new leader and for all the elders
26 to resign their positions immediately. There

                 COLUMN 2
                 --------

1   was also a small crest burned into the scroll
2   which Zandar recognized as an ancient
3   symbol of the black arts. The elders,
4   although concerned, ignored the demands of
5   the parchment and claimed that the forces
6   of good would always prevail.
7       At the next seasonal change, the Elders
8   again travelled to Fairshire. When they
9   were seated in the hall, the doors again blew
10  open and smoke filled the room. When the
11  smoke cleared, however, the room was
12  completely empty.
13      Without the wisdom of the Elders,
14  Ashton quickly became troubled. The strong
15  took control, and greed and ignorance 
16  became commonplace. You alone decide to
17  search the hall in which the Elders were last
18  seen, and come across the mysterious scroll.
19  Upon opening it you notice, that the black
20  symbol has a faint glow surrounding it.
21  You touch the symbol with your finger and
22  the room around you transforms into some
23  sort of laboratory.
24      Now, it is up to you to exorcise this
25  wasteland, and return the elders to
26  Ashton.

telling you whether your request is possible at this point in the story,
and what happened as a result.

   To move around, just type the direction you want to go. Direction can be
abbreviated: North to N, South to S, West to W, East to E, or use the arrow
keys for directions, North (up arrow key), South (down arrow key), East

several examples that might help in the story.
>TAKE THE BOOK

SHIFT 5 (FIVE) UP ARROWS would move you five rooms to NORTH if the moves

For example:
>Warlock, Pick up the magical wand

3. If you find an object that you think you can use, TAKE IT. Some objects

4. Save the game often.

5. Read the story carefully. There are a lot of clues in the description of
   locations and objects.
