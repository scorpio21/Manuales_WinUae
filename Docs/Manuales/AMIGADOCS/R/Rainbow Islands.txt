GAMEPLAY

Basic Movement

Rainbow Climbing  :- Make Rainbows on each level of the floor and walk up them.
                     It is possible to stand on the top of a Rainbow.

Rainbow Attack    :- Hit you enemies with a new Rainbow to kill them.

Rainbow Breaking  :- By jumping onto a Rainbow, you can break it.  This causes
                      the Rainbow to drop down the screen, killing anything
                       in its path.

Picking Up Objects

You can pick up objects by either walking into them or by hitting them with a
Rainbow.  Also, running a Rainbow to drop down the screen, killing anything
in its path.

Three Important Pickups

Magic Shoes       :- Picking up the magic shoes will give you greater speed.

Red Potions       :- Collecting a red potion will add one to the number of
                      Rainbows that you can throw, up to a maximum of three.

Yellow Potions    :- Collecting a yellow potion will speed up your Rainbow
                      throws.

HINTS AND TIPS

1. There is a secret room on each island, how to access it is confidential!

2. Master the use of Rainbows.

3. When the `Hurry' message appears, get to the top of the screen as quickly
    as possible.
