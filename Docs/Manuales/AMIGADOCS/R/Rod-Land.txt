THE STORY SO FAR
----------------
Tam and Rit live in a fairy village.  Having led a happy life full of
sticky cakes and endless parties, they find that something awful has 
happened overnight to their fellow inhabitants.  They've turned nasty
and captured their mom and locked her in the top of the Maboots tower.
Luckily for Tam and Rit they've inherited the Rods of Sheesanomo from
a village elder and some rainbow shoes from their pop.  Armed with
these they can tackle the tower by wopping cuddly beings on the head
with their rods and climbing ladders built with the help of their
Rainbow Shoes.  Its not easy though, when your former friends have 
some rather mean surprises for you!.

HOW TO PLAY
-----------
The game consists of over 40 levels of cuddly-bashing action.  You must
work through each screen, wopping the nasties and collecting the flowers.

Wop them often enough and you'll pick up a useful weapon, or just tickle 
them with the rod and see what happens.

To get around the screen you must build ladders either up or down to 
collect the platforms.  As soon as you build a second one, your first 
ladder will disappear.  If you dont clear the screen of your opponents in 
time, the game will change to "meany" mode where life will become far more
difficult.  Collecting all the flowers switches you into EXTRA GAME.  Here
you can collect an extra life by picking up letters to form the word EXTRA.

You can play 1 or 2 players, but 2 player games can only be started on the 
1st screen.
