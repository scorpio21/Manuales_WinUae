GAME PLAY

Renegade has five levels: Subway; Pier; Sleezy Street; Mean Street; and Mr.
Big's Hideout. On each level you will meet a gang of armed and unarmed
assailants. You must defeat the gang's leader to complete the level.

Energy levels for Renegade and the gang leader are displayed at the top of
the screen. A knock-down decreases energy by one point. A zero energy
reading spells defeat. The gang leader won't join the fight until the gang
members are about to lose.

In LEVEL I, you are attacked by a gang of vicious thugs. You must "punch"
or "kick" your assailants to defeat them, (each one must be knocked to the
ground twice). You can jump on top of them when they hit the ground the
first time; a few quick blows will finish the job.

In LEVEL II, you confront a gang of bikers on the pier. The level starts
with four attackers on motorcycles who try and run you over. A flying kick
will knock them off their motorcycles. Once they're defeated, watch out for
the other Angels of Death.

LEVEL III takes place in the sleazy downtown streets, where a group of
female marauders hang out. A number of these "ladies" wield whips and
clubs. Keep an eye out for "Big Bertha"!

LEVEL IV is comprised of razor wielding thugs. Avoid the razors at all
costs and watch your back!

Defeat Mr. Big and his skinhead guards at LEVEL V. Gorgeous Lucy will be
waiting for you if you survive! But your time with her will be very short,
because the action starts again - only this time the fight is tougher than
before. Each level has a time limit and you lose a life if the gang leader
isn't defeated.

There are various ways of attacking your assailant:

  Punching
  Punching a floored assailant 
  Flying Kick
  Back Kick

STATUS AND SCORING

Remaining lives, current score, high score, and current strength are
displayed at the top of the screen.

    Punches        100 points
    Back Kicks     150 points
    Flying Kicks   200 points

BONUS ITEMS

Capture these special bonuses to help you win the fight:

    HEART       Gives you an extra life.
    HAMBURGER   Restores your energy level to normal.

HINTS AND TIPS

   Keep moving.
   Opponents can be made to fall off the edge of the playing area in levels
   one and two. But so can you!
   Defeat the most dangerous opponents first (e.g. weapons carriers).
   In level III, avoid Big Bertha until all her "lady friends" are defeated.
   Don't stand in Mr. Big's line of fire!

                        ! GOOD LUCK - YOU'LL NEED IT !
