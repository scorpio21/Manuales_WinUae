to alternate them.

This is the PARALLACTION system.

INTRODUCTION
============

NIPPON  SAFES  INC.:the  wonders,innovations,contrasts and paradoxes of the
present-day Japan through the indiscreet eye of the West.

NIPPON  SAFES  INC.   is  in no way intended to be disparaging or offensive
towards  the  Japanese culture and people,whose conquests and traditions we
admire and respect.

We   apologise  in  advance  should  any  facts  or  (purely  coincidenatl)
references to existing people or things offend anyaone`s sensitivity.

NIPPON SAFES INC.:  so let`s fasten our seat-belts (or braces) and take off
without  waiting  any longer for Tyoko,somewhere not better idnetified half
way between Tokyo and Kyoto as the crow flies.

THE STORY
=========

In  the most disreputable parts of the Japanese metropolis of Tyoko,a shady
character  wanders  around  looking  suspicious.   What can this mysterious
person be up to?

Discover  it  for  yourself  by  helping Doug Nuts,the cratty technological
thief,by taking the place of the perturbing Lady Fatale or putting yourself
in the shoes of Dino Fagioli,the knocked about former boxer.

During  the  adventure pay attention to the suggestions from the people you
meet.By  using  the appropiate command to examine the things and people you
find,you  can  get information about them.Collect all the objects you think
might come in handy.

Once you start the adventure you can save the game so that you will be able
to  start off again from the same place.Whatever happens you will never get
stuck,and you won`t die!

Some  of  the puzzles to be solved are fairly complex.Think carefully about
the  situation,don`t  just  make  a  guess.If  you  find  one  of the three
adventures  too  difficult,just  go  ahead with the others.Perhaps the same
situation  seen  by  another  character will provide some clues for getting
around  the  problem.Don`t  be  discouraged when you find a close door or a
character   who   doesn`t   give   you  any  useful  information.Try  again
later.Perhaps  the  situation  will  have changed due to something you have
done somewhere else.

THE MAIN CHARACTERS
===================

DOUG  NUTS.   He  is  an  electronics genius who uses his knowledge for not
exactly a lawful purpose (with meagre results).His career as an electronics
engineer  at  Oxford ended abruptly when he was caught fiddling the results
of  the  exams  stored  in  the  faculty computer.After moving to Japan,the
homeland  of  electronics,he has problems with the law each time one of his
breaking in gadgets dooesnt work quite like it was meant to.

LADY  FATALE.   A  variety  actress,she  abandoned  a promising career as a
ballet  dancer  to  follow  the  path  of  the  glittering  world  of  show
business.She  arrived  in  Tyoko  dazzled  by the promises of a self-styled
impressario  who,after  having squandered all her possessions,left her to a
life on the border of legality.

DINO FAGIOLI.  A former boxer of italian origin,basically a good and honest
soul,often  falls into the traps set by people taking advantage of the fact
that  he  tends  not  to  think  very hard.After a series of defeats in the
boxing  world,he boarded a ship bound for Japan as a deckhand.After getting
into  the  umpteenth scrape he was thrown off the ship in Tyoko,where he is
trying to make ends meet.

O.k  folks  now  follows  some  information  about  Japan.This is where the
protection creeps in!


PACHINKO
========

Pachinko   is   a   typically  Japanese  form  of  fun,and  also  the  most
widespread.In   Tyoko,for   example,where  the  number  of  inhabitants  is
1.732.461,at   leat  70%  of  Japanese  men  and  30%  of  the  women  play
regularly.It  consists  of  a machine half-way between a slot machine and a
flipper.The game takes place on a vertical surface with holes in it and the
nails  hammered into it.The players ability consists of making a metal ball
bounce  on the nails so that it falls into the holes.In this way he can win
more  balls,until he has won enough or all the balls are finished.The balls
won  can be exchanged for prizes in proportion to their number.They usually
consist  of  things one uses daily such as chocolate,perfume,cigarettes,and
so    on.Strictly    speaking,exchanging    the    balls   for   money   is
prohibited,although  it is a common practice throughout Japan.Scattered all
over  the  country  there  are  over  15.000  Pachinko  halls.Each of these
contains  an  average  of  over  200  machines,and  when in use they make a
defeaning sound.


JAPANESE CHARACTERS
===================

There are two types of japanese characters:

The  KANA:   these  are  phonetic  symbols  originated  in  Japan.Each  one
represents a syllable.

There  are  two  types  of  kana  representing  the  same  syllables:   the
hiragana,used   for   grammar  particles  (suffixes,articles,ect.),and  the
Katakana,used to write words of foreign origin.

There are 46 characters in each of the two groups:

The KANJI.

These   are   ideograms  derived  from  chinese.Each  symbol  represents  a
concept.There  are  about  10.000  kanji  in Japanese,but the most used are
4.000.

The origins of the Japanese characters date back to the fourth century AD.

It  was  at  the  time  that  Chinese  manuscripts arrived in Japan,and the
characters  used in them were adopted for writing Japanese,which until then
had no system of its own.

The  characters were used phonetically,without taking their original nature
into account.

Since   the  Chinese  characters  were  very  complex,thay  were  gradually
simplified  until  they  toook the shape of the hiragana,towards the end of
the millenium.Soon afterwards this the katakana were developed.

These were introduced by buddhist scholars to make notes in their texts.

At   the   same   time,the   Chinese   characters   began  to  be  used  as
ideograms,without taking their pronunciation into account.

This  allowd  a  more  compact  style  of writing ass compared to using the
phenomes of the two kana alphabets.

For  many  years  the three types of characters were used independantly,and
the number of kanji characters continued to grow.

In  the  late  19th  century,the Japanese government decided to simpify the
writing  system,and  established  a limited number of officially recognised
kanji characters (1.900) for the drafting official documents.

Nowadays  a  Japanese  with an average culture is familiar with about 3.000
kanji,while about 4.000 are used in the written language.

The most complete Japanese dictionaries contain 10.000 kanji.

THE JAPANESE RAILWAYS
=====================

Shinjuku  station,in  Tokyo,is  the  most crowded in the world.The Japanese
call the rush hour "tsukin jigoku",litterally "the commuter`s hell."

Japanese  commuter  trains  are  very  fast,impressively  clean  but  often
brutally overcrowded.

It  is fairly common fact for passengers,crushed against each other,to fall
over  like  ninepins.For  this  reason  the  elderly and parents with small
children  keep  well away from these trains in the rush hours.To understand
just  how  crowded  thay  are,you  should  know  that  most  stations  have
"oshiya",or   throwers-in.These   are   people  charged  with  pushing  the
passengers  inside  the carriages.Each passenger is determined to get in,in
order  to  reach  his  place of work on time,but the doors of the carriages
will  not  work  until  until everyone has either got in or out.  Since the
other  passengers  are  far  to  well-bred to interfere,these "oshiya".with
their impecabble white golves,help the poor devil make up his mind.

In  winter,escpecially,when  people  wear heavier clothes,the railways hire
extra  staff  for  the  job.The  Tyoko  railways,include  all  of 179 Km of
underground railways.

FISH IN JAPAN
=============

It  is  well-known  fact  that  Japanese  are among the most voracious fish
eaters.Not  so many people realise,however,that with a mene 2% of the world
population,they eat 15% of the world`s fishing catch,that is to say 8 times
more  than Americans do and 15 times more than the Chinese.They are also at
the  top  of  the list as far as concerns volumes and qualities of fish.Off
the  coast  of  Japan,the  warm  "kuroshio" current and the cold  "oyashio"
current  meet  and  give  life  one  of  the richest fishing grounds in the
world.In  addition,the  widespread  consumption of fish was favoured by the
lack  of  pasture lands and by buddhism,which prohibits killing in order to
eat them.

The   Japanese   eat   their   fish   in   many   ways,cooked  one  by  one
(smoked,stewed,salted,grilled  or  baked)  or  raw  in the typical Japanese
dishes "sushi" and "sashimi."

One  of the most famous markets is the Tsukiji fish market.It is an immense
maze  of  building  built near the original site of Edo,which later beacame
Tokyo.

On  this  market  practically every  type of fish is sold,but in particular
tunny  fish,a  basic  element  of "sushi." This is the most popular type of
fish  in  Japan,and  supplies come in from all over the world.Every morning
retail dealers,restaurateurs and sushi cooks crowd the market to secure the
best tuna fish,sold for astronomical amounts.

THE GEISHA
==========

The geisha is the image that more than any other reminds us of Japan.Many
Westerners,however,do not realise the role played by the geisha in Japanese 
society.

The  term  "geisha"means  "artist","talented  person".In  actual  fact  the
geisha`s  activity is one of entertainemnt,particularly at parties,attended
by  men  only,during  which  large  quantities  of beer,whisky and sake are
drunk.The geisha has the specific task of making sure that the guests enjoy
themselves  and  that  the  party goes on without a hhitch.Geisha`s play an
instrument  known  as the shamisen,sing popular songs and dance complicated
dances,but their real ability is in flirting with men,making them laugh and
rink  endlessly.In the eyes of a Westener,they might appear to be a special
type of "ladies of pleasure".Actually they only attend parties for rich and
powerful  men  who  can  afford the costly "present" of flowers,since for a
geisha  it would be inconceivable to speak of money.They count theyre horly
wages  in  flowers,which  normally means 10.000 yen each.There are now less
than one thousand top-class geishas in Japan, and their average age is over
forty.Many   of   them   develop   long-lasting  relationships  with  their
customers,learning  enough  about  about  their business to be able,if need
be,to provide economic advice.

The main topic of the conversations,games and songs is in any case sex.

Some  of  them even have love affairs with selected customers.The figure of
the  geisha  is  in  any case starting to decline,even in cities like Kyoto
where  the  tradition  resists  longest;in Tyoko there are only 1622.At the
beginning of the century there were over 80.000 geishas in Japan.

Japanese  feminists  hate even the idea of a geisha,and more and more girls
find  long  years  of  apprenticeship  with the prospect of having to amuse
drunkards  unattractive,in  spite  of the fact that many of them marry rich
businessmen and important politicians.

THE PUBLIC BATHS
================

As  time  goes  by,every  civilisation  channels for socialising which vary
greatly  depending  on  the  local  traditions,climate,economy and so on.In
Western  society  this role remained the prerogative of places of amusement
(discoteques,pubs,bars  and  so  on).In Japan,for a long time ,this meeting
place has been the "public baths".Strange as it may seem,the "sento" (which
means  public baths) was a centre of social life.As domestic bathrooms have
become  more  common,many  public  baths  have  whirlpool baths and massage
facilities.The latest fashion when it comes to baths is the coffee fad.This
drink is supposed to have specific invigorating qualities for the body.

A  bath  in  coffee  is in any case not a luxury for the furtunate few:  on
average it costs about one pound.

HOTELS IN JAPAN
===============

Japan  is definetly one of those countries in which extravagance has become
a  way of life for its inhabitants.If you want confirmation of this,all you
need  to  do  is observe the hotels,in which the country is teeming.Some of
them,right  in  the centre of town,have the appearence (and the dimensions)
of  medieval  castles,others  og  gigantic round-abouts,where the beds move
around in the air to imitate spaceships,including the smoky exhaust and the
roar  of the "take-off".The most common,however,are the "capsule" hotels.In
these   hotels  the  guests  do  not  have  a  comfortable  room  at  their
disposal,just a space of about two cubic metres,arranged like burial niches
in  a cemetry.Originally built in the Osaka amusement district for dawdlers
who  had  lost the last train,these "capsule" hotels now offer arrangements
for  all  types  of  guests  throughout  Japan.The  tiny rooms are strictly
single.
