  THE ROBINSONS GARAGE!
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  This is the main selection screen covering all of the action in the races
  ahead.

  Use this screen to pick the characters that you wish to challenge to a 
  race, the additional obstacles that you will come across on the tracks 
  and the type of skateboard that you wish to compete on.

  THE RACE CHALLENGERS!
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  The following Neighbours characters, past and present, are selected by
  positioning the map of Australia above their name and pressing FIRE. A
  highlighted name indicates that the character has been challenged to
  appear in the races.

  CHARLENE RAMSAY :    Charlene borrows a Go-Kart from Jim Robinson's
                       garage, tunes it up, and is raring to go!

     HENRY RAMSAY :    Landscape Gardener extraodinaire, Henry takes 
                       to the track in his Tractor Lawnmower.

       MIKE YOUNG :    Still Studying hard as a student, Mike races 
                       on a Skateboard against his best pal from high
                       School dayz at Erinsborough High.

    MATT ROBINSON :    Matt has borrowed Mike's motorbike to give him
                       a race advantage.
 
   BRONWYN DAVIES :    Bronwyn, complete with three wheeled motorcycle
                       takes to the track ready to burn some rubber!

  THE SKATEBOARDS
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  There are Three Skateboards hanging up in Scott's garage, each with 
  their own particular handling characteristics.  Looking at them from 
  Left to Right on the screen:

  BEGINNER'S BOARD-      Average speed with smooth handling.
  INTERMEDIATE BOARD-    Fast speed with sports Handling.
  ADVANCED BOARD-        Championship slalom board for experts only.

  Trial and error will enable you to select the skateboard that suits 
  your own racing style.

  SPECIAL OBSTACLES
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 
  At the bottom of The Robinson's Garage is a blanket covering special
  obstacles that can be included or excluded from the races.

  Pressing FIRE enables you to drag the blanket back to have more obstacles
  included.  The more objects revealed, the more obstacles appear on the 
  race track:

  DES CLARKE'S CAR        Des is late for work at the Bank, and will tend
                          to pull out without looking where he is going.

  RADIO CONTROLLED CAR    Todd Landers has just recieved a new RC Car for
                          his birthday from Jim and Beverly.  He is just
                          getting to gripps with the controls, so the car
                          can cause havoc everywhere!

  KANGAROO                Erinsborough Wildlife Park has accidentally let
                          one of its Kangaroos escape.  The animal passes
                          through the Neighbours Locations on his way home
                          to the outback.

  Remember that the special obstacles not only cause havoc for Scott, but
  also for all of the other race opponents.

  Clicking on EXIT after selections have been made starts the first race
  on Ramsey Street.

  RACE LOCATIONS!
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 
  There are Eight individual races that make up the Neighbours Challenge
  These races take place over the following locations, under the guidance
  of Harold Bishop:

  			    RAMSAY STREET

  			  LASSITERS COMPLEX

  			  ERINSBOROUGH HIGH

  			   ANSON'S CORNER

  There are Two races at each location, each race consisting of two laps
  of every track.

  Each race scenerio has its own particular layout and design.  As well
  as obstacles relevant to that Neighbours location.

  POPULARITY METER!
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  At the bottom of the racing screen, Scott Robinson's Popularity Meter
  is displayed as a large Neighbours logo.  During the race, this will
  increase and decrease as the viewing audience judges Scott's performance
  in the race.

  Colliding with popular characters will reduce your popularity, whereas
  picking up pieces of rubbish will increase your ratings in the eyes of
  the audience.  Bonuses are awarded at the end of every race based upon
  Scott's current Popularity Rating.

  If Popularity drops to Zero during the course of a race, Scott is Auto-
  matically dropped from the series and the game ends.

  The aim of the game is therefore to keep Scott's popularity high, whilst
  at the same time arriving in the highest possible scoring position in
  the race.

  Your current position is indicated on the map of Australia, with Scott's
  score and laps completed shown on the opposite side of the screen.

  RACING!
  -=-=-=-

  All players line up at the starting line at the beginning of the race.
  The starting pistol cracks into life, and the game begins.

  As you race around the track, avoiding obstacles as well as other 
  contestants, you must pass through the gates set up by Harold Bishop
  to mark out the agreed course.  If you do not pass through all of the
  gates, you do not advance your score and you cannot win the race.

  The Television Sets on the Left hand side of the screen register the
  positions of the first Three characters across the line.  On the Amiga
  version, the top Screen also acts as a Finish Line Scanner allowing
  the progress of your competitors to be monitored.

  RACE OBSTACLES!
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  There are many obstacles littered around the Four locations.  This is
  just an example of some that you may find:
