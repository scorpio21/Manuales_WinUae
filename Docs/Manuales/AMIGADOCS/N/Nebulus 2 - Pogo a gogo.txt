The cracked version
-------------------
      The only thing to be mentioned is how the disk change works.
      When you start the game (instead of reading the instructions)
      the screen flashed. Insert GAMEDISK 1 and press joystick boutton.

      Follow the instructions of the game (f.i. ดINSERT GAME DISK 1ด)
      When the screen flashes you have to replace your current game
      disk with this disk. This disk is called ดBOOTDISKด.
      When the screen flashes again and the BOOTDISK is already in
      DF0: ,simply insert the gamedisk that you removed before.
      Thatดs all !
