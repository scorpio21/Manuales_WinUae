INTRODUCTION

     In a toxic ocean on the distant planet NEBULUS, far from sight of land,
stands eight mysterious rotating towers. They were put up by evil people.
You are the top dog at Destructo, Inc. Only trouble is that you have to
climb the top of these towers to bring them down. And each one is guarded
by different enemies - indestructible mutant molecules, weird floating eyes,
vicious robots, and huge rolling cannonballs that barrel out of nowhere.
You're armed, sure, but your weapons are no good against some of the 
creatures, and others come back to life even after you stun them.
     Remember you start your mission with three lives, and you use one up 
every time you go for a swim. The clock starts running from the moment that
you step out of your sub.

PLAY

     Object of the game is to topple all eight towers. Reaching the top of a
tower automatically starts the destruction sequence. Each tower is more
difficult to topple than the last and there is a set time limit for each one.

          Action                           Joystick

       Walk left or right              Push handle left or right

       Enter tunnel or take            Push handle up
       outside elevator up

       Take outside elevator down      Pull handle back

       Jump                            Press fire button while walking

       Shoot                           Press fire button while stopped


     You're armed with a snowball gun, and you can destroy flashing block
barricades by shooting them. You have to that in order to get past them.
You can also destroy all the rolling cannonballs except the silver ones. You
can stun these for a few seconds, but you can't get past them. All other
creatures are indestructible. You have to time your movements to avoid them
or they'll knock you down the tower and maybe even into the water. If that
happens you lose a life.
     Your footing on the towers is shaky at best. Some ledges are slippery,
others crumble beneath you. If you are unlucky, you'll find yourself taking
an unplanned bath.
     When you topple a tower, you return to the sub and travel to your next
mission. While under water, use your gun to stun and catch fish and pick up 
extra points.

SCORING

     Scoring is based on the amount of time you take to topple a tower, the 
number of mistakes you make in your route, and the number of times you're
knocked part way down or all the way down.

     You earn 100 points for each bouncing cannonball you destroy
     You earn 50 points for each flashing block you destroy
     You earn 35, 50 or 75 points at random for each fish you catch.
     You gain an extra life for every 5000 points you earn.
     Each second remaining on clock is multiplied by 10 and added to score.
     You start with 100 technique points. Each time you fall off a ledge
        you lose 2 points.
     Each remaining technique point is also multiplied by 10 and added to
        your score.

     Use your joystick to enter your initials in the high-score chart. Push
the handle up or down to select a letter, and press fire button to enter the
selected letter in the chart.
