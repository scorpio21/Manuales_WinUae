              INTRODUCTION

    Welcome to Toy Town and the amazing world of Noddy`s Playtime, a unique
fun-filled educational package for young children. NODDY`S PLAYTIME
contains no less than ten exciting programs which will inspire, delight
and, most importantly, instruct children in a range of different skills.

     NODDY`S PLAYTIME has been produced following extensive research by
educationalists and psychologists. The programs contained within this
package have been carefully designed, within the frame work of the early
requirements of the National Curriculum, to make learning an enjoyable
process. This is, we believe, the most complete entertainment and learning
package for young children.

    Each of the programs which make up this package can be used, unaided,
by even very young children. At the lowest levels of play there is no
reliance upon the use of language. Control of each of the programs is by
colourful and simple to use icons. To add to their involvement, children
should look out for various active areas on each program screen. Some of
these are hidden and must be discovered. To find out if an area is active,
children should take the cursor around the screen and click on various
objects. Those which are active will animate.

 NODDY`S PLAYTIME contains

   * Eight educational and fun to play activities:
   * Railway Station : send the train on its journey by using memory and
     shape and colour matching skills.
   * Noah's Ark: match the different parts of each animal puzzle together
     then watch Noddy as he takes a ride in the Ark.
   * Farm Yard: match together different halves of animals.
   * Four Chimney House: play different tunes and animate characters from
     Toy Town.
   * Market Place: find objects which match letters or words and bring PC
     Plod down to earth with a bump!
   * N & B Works: find the odd one out and keep the wheels of Toy Town's
     factory in motion.
   * Post Office: use counting and simple arithmetical skills to help Noddy
     climb a magic ladder.
     * Police Station: guide Noddy through a variety of mazes.
     * A junior paint package, Noddy`s Paint Pot.
   * A linking program in which children can drive Noddy`s car around Toy
     Town. Not only does this link the games and form a unique menu system
     but it forms a game in itself which children will want to return to
     time and time again. As children drive Noddy around Toy Town they
     will be able to control the actions of the characters in the town by
     using various key depressions. As Noddy drives to various points in
     Toy Town, children will be able to load different programs in the
     package.

                               PROGRAM HELP


  While each of the games in this package has been designed to be as easy
to use as possible children may sometimes hit upon a problem. If they
experience any difficulties Big Ears will always be on hand to help. If
children call upon Big Ears (by clicking on the icon in the bottom of the
screen) he will offer a clue to help children complete the task in hand.

                                 CONTROLS

  The controls within NODDY`S PLAYTIME have been designed to be as simple
as possible for children to use. The programs can be controlled using the
mouse, the keyboard or a joystick. Full details on how to operate each
individual game can be found in SECTION 2 of this manual. The majority of
the techniques used are the same for every program:

                                   MOUSE

  Every part of this package, except the Driving Menu, can be controlled
using the mouse. The left mouse button is used to select an item and the
right button is, used to confirm selections.

                                 KEYBOARD

  From the computer keyboard the on screen cursor (or Noddy`s car in the
Driving Menu) can be moved around using the cursor or arrow keys. In some
games (see SECTION 2) alternative options can be selected using the
SPACEBAR. ENTER or RETURN are used to confirm the currently selected
choice.

                                 JOYSTICK

  The joystick can be used instead of the mouse with the FIRE BUTTON
confirming any selected choice.

  A number of operations are controlled in the same way regardless of which
input method is used:

  To leave any game and return to the Driving Menu, click on Noddy`s car
(which can be found in the bottom right of the games screen) or press ESC
on the keyboard.

  To change the level of play within any game press F10 on the keyboard.
You will then see a Level Selection Screen from which you should select
which level you wish to play.

                          HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL

  The remainder of this manual is laid out in four sections.

         SECTION 1
  Describes how to load NODDY`S PLAYTIME and use the Option screens

         SECTION 2
  Describes each of the games within NODDY`S PLAYTIME along with Noddy`s
Driving Menu which forms a link between the games.
This section takes the form of a short story which should be read aloud to
children. Instructions on how to use Noddy`s Driving Menu and the games are
interspersed throughout this story and are placed inside boxes.

         SECTION 3
  Describes Noddy`s Paint Pot, a fully functional junior art package, which
forms an integral part of this computer package.

         SECTION 4
  Explains how NODDY`S PLAYTIME responds to early requirements of the
National Curriculum.

  Throughout the manual you will find a number of outline pictures. similar
to those used in Noddy`s Paint Pot, which children should be encouraged to
colour in.

                                SECTION 1:


         LOADING AND USING THE OPTIONS SCREENS

ATARI ST'S AND AMIGAS
Single Drive Owners
    Insert Disk 1 into Drive a (ST) or Drive 0 (AMIGA) and switch on the
computer. After a short while you will see the Introductory Screen.
Occasionally you will be asked to swap disks.

Double Drive Owners
    Insert Disk 1 into Drive A (ST) or Drive 0 (AMIGA) and Disk 2 into Drive
B (ST) or Drive 1 (AMIGA) and switch on the computer. After a short while
you will see the Introductory Screen.

IBM-COMPATIBLE PCs
    Insert the program disk in Drive A. From MS-DOS activate this drive by
typing a: then press Return or Enter. To load the program type in noddy and
press Enter or Return.

    Once you have followed the relevant loading instructions for your
computer, you will be presented with a screen which introduces NODDY'S
PLAYTIME. You can bypass this at anytime by pressing ESC on your computer
keyboard.

         The Main Option Screen

  Shortly after you have seen the Introductory Screen you will be presented
with the Main Option Screen. Whilst driving around TT, if at any time you
wish to return to the Main Option Screen, press ESC. The Main Option Screen
allows you to set the parameters which control how children play NODDY'S
PLAYTIME:

         EASY, HARDER or HARDEST

  Each of the eight games within NODDY'S PLAYTIME can be be played at one
of three levels. The easiest level is designed for very young children or
those unfamiliar with this package. The most difficult will tax even bright
seven year olds.

  You should set the starting levels for each of the games by clicking on
the relevant icon. This level will be used in every one of the games when
children first enter them. While playing, the level can be altered at any
time by pressing F10 and reselecting a new level of difficulty.

         Play or Use Noddy's Paint Pot

  The Driving Menu contains eight locations can be loaded. At each of these
Noddy's Paint Pot can also be loaded. Additionally, Noddy's Paint Pot can
be accessed from the Main Options Screen. There is an advantage in doing
this. When Noddy's Paint Pot is loaded from a location on the DRIVING MENU
two location specific outline pictures are made available for children to
colour in. If it is loaded from the Main Options Screen all 16 pictures are
available to children.

  If your children wish to use Noddy's Paint Pot rather than enter the
DRIVING MENU, they should click on Noddy's car.

         Driving Around Toy Town

  NODDY'S PLAYTIME consists of eight games and an art package. These are
linked together through a tenth program, NODDY'S DRIVING MENU, in which
children can drive Noddy around Toy Town and load each of the games. You
can opt to play NODDY'S PLAYTIME in one of two ways.

  Children can decide to drive Noddy around Toy Town themselves. In this
way they can explore the map which makes up the Driving Menu. Placed on the
map are eight taxi ranks. These represent load points for the remaining
parts of the package. If, for example, children wish to play Noah's Ark
jigsaw puzzle game they should park Noddy's car in the taxi rank outside
Noah's Ark.

  Alternatively, children may wish to see Noddy's take control of his car
and drive it around Toy Town.

  You should select which of these options you wish to use by clicking on
the relevant icon on the final line of the MOM.

  If children have opted to take control of Noddy's car, NODDY'S DRIVING
MENU will load with Noddy parked outside his house ready to move off.

  If they have selected the automatic driving facility, they will see a
second menu with icons representing each of the eight locations.

  They should now select one of these by clicking on it. NODDY'S DRIVING
MENU will then load and noddy will drive directly to the selected location.
(If this facility is used, each time children leave a game Noddy's car will
be returned to outside his house and they will be able to select another
location.)

         The Games Options Screen

  As Noddy drives into a taxi rank children will be represented with a
Games Option Screen which contain three icons. If they wish to use Noddy's
Paint Pot they should click on the first icon which shows Noddy holding a
large paintbrush. If they driven into the Taxi Rank by mistake, they can
return to the Driving menu by clicking on the second icon, Noddy's car. To
load the game associated with the location they should select the final
icon which shows a scene from the game.

                                 SECTION 2

         THE DRIVING MENU AND THE GAMES

DRIVING AROUND TOY TOWN

    Noddy lives in a tiny house on the edge of Toy Town which he built using
toy bricks. Because it is a house for one person it is called "House-for-
One".

    Noddy has many friends in Toy Town most of which he sees every day as he
drives around in his little yellow car. Noddy's job is to help his friends
get to wherever they want to go. his little yellow cat is a taxi and Noddy
is a taxi driver.

    On Friday night, Noddy went to bed early. He was very tired. He had been
taking people backwards and forwards all over Toy Town every day that week.
As he crawled into his little bed he remembered that tomorrow was Saturday
and that he did not have to work. For a change he thought that he would take
his little yellow car just where he wanted to go to. He decided to see all
of his friends and have some fun! Slowly, the exhausted, but happy, little
Noddy fell asleep thinking of all the adventures that he could have the next
day.

    Earl next morning Noddy jumped out of bed. After brushing his teeth and
combing his hair he was soon dressed and eating his breakfast. When Noddy
opened his front door he saw that the sun was shining and he heard the birds
singing in the trees. As he walked towards his car he saw Mrs. Tubby Bear,
his next door neighbour, hanging out her washing.

    "Good morning Noddy," she shouted, "what a lovely day it is. What are
you going to do today?"

    "I'm going to be very busy," Noddy replied, "I'm going to drive around
Toy Town and see all my friends."

    As Noddy climbed into his car Mrs. Tubby waved and shouted, "Good-bye
Noddy, have a nice time!"

    With that, Noddy waved and drove off.

 *  You can direct Noddy's car around Toy Town using the arrow keys on the *
 * keyboard or using a joystick. If you let go of the joystick or the      *
 * arrow keys while the car is moving it will come to a halt.              *
 *                                                                         *
 ***************************************************************************
  As Noddy drives along he sees lots of his friends. How many can you find
as you drive around Toy Town with Noddy?

  When Noddy is not sure of where he is going he always looks at his map.
You too should check where you are guiding Noddy's car by looking at your
map of Toy Town. If you do this you, and Noddy, will not get lost.

  One road at the bottom of the map leads out of Toy Town and into the
country side towards Noah's Ark Town. Be careful if you drive here as
neither you nor Noddy have a map of the area to guide you back to Toy Town.
Noddy often gets confused as he drives around the country side and must
carefully try to remember where he has been.


 ***************************************************************************
 *                                                                         *
 *  To the bottom right hand corner of Toy Town is a road which leads off  *
 * into the country side. This takes the form of a maze which children can *
 * explore. If they should get lost they can magically return to Noddy's   *
 * car to outside his house by pressing Q on the keyboard.                 *
 *                                                                         *
 ***************************************************************************

  As you help Noddy drive around, perhaps you will be able to surprise some
of his friends by sounding the horn of Noddy's car.

 ***************************************************************************
 *                                                                         *
 *  As you drive along, don't forget to remind Noddy to wave to his        *
 * friends.                                                                *
 *  You can make Noddy and his car do various things. These are controlled *
 * by keys on the keyboard:                                                *
 *                                                                         *
 *  Press H  to make Noddy sound the horn of his car.                      *
 *  Press W  to make Noddy wave.                                           *
 *  press B  to make the car brake suddenly.                               *
 *  Press N  to make Noddy nod                                             *
 *  Press E  to make the car's engine roar.                                *

 ***************************************************************************

  As you, and Noddy, drive along you will see some places in the road with
the word "TAXIS" on them. If Noddy's car is parked in any of these, Noddy
will be able to get out of his car and play a game with you.

  When the car is being driven automatically it will park in the spot
selected before the Driving Menu was last entered.

 ***************************************************************************
 *                                                                         *
 *  When the car is being driven manually it will park in a parking place  *
 * if children take their hands off of the controls as they approach any   *

 * Once the car has parked in a  space, you will see a menu screen. If you *

POST OFFICE

    Noddy pulled up outside the Post Office where Mr. Tubby Bear had just
finished painting a new sign which said, in bold red colours, "POST OFFICE".
As Noddy climbed out of the little yellow car he saw the wet paint sparkle
in the bright sunshine. Tubby was climbing down his ladder which was leaning
against the wall in front of the building.

    "Hello Noddy," he said, "do you like the new sign?"

    "Yes," replied Noddy, "It's the same colour as my shoes."

    Tubby smiled. "Painting is hungry work. I'm going home to cook my lunch,
then I'll come back and collect my ladder," he said. With that, he wandered
off towards his house.

    Noddy walked towards the Post Office. In front of him was the row of Toy
Town post boxes. As he walked in he was surprised to see letters scattered all
over the floor. "That's odd," Noddy whispered to himself, "Where did all
these letters come from?"

    Noddy looked up. On the low roof which was at the side of the building
sat a Naughty Goblin. He was grinning and clutching onto a letter.

    "What are you doing up there?" enquired Noddy, walking to the side of
the Post Office.

    "Shan't tell you!" replied the Goblin.

    "What are you holding?" said Noddy.

    "Shan't tell you!" repeated the Goblin.

    "Whatever it is. I'm sure that it doesn't belong to you," Noddy shouted.
He then remembered the mess in front of the letter boxes. "Did you do this?"

    "Maybe, maybe not," said the Goblin whose grin became even wider.

    "Come down here at once and clean this mess up!" shouted Noddy.

    By now, Noddy was getting very angry. How could he possibly get up as
high as the Goblin? Just then, he remembered that Tubby had left his ladder
in front of the Post Office.

    Noddy ran around the building and pulled at the ladder.

    "This is heavy!" he grunted.

    Noddy pulled again. The ladder started to swing towards him. He took a
step back and steadied the ladder. Slowly he managed to tip it onto its
side. Noddy let the ladder rest against his legs as he caught his breath.

    With a hup-two-three, Noddy had lifted the ladder and was carrying it to
where the Naughty Goblin was perched.

    The Goblin, still smiling, looked down at Noddy as he struggled to prop
the ladder against the wall. Suddenly, the smile disappeared and he began to
look sad and worried.

    "You won't get this letter!" he yelled.

    "Oh won't I?" said Noddy who had now managed to rest the top of the
ladder against the small roof.

    "No," replied the Goblin. "You see, that's a magic ladder. To climb it
you must sort out the letters on the floor. You can't do that and climb the
ladder at the same time and there's no one here to help!"

    BUT THERE IS! YOU CAN HELP NODDY TO CLIMB THE LADDER AND TAKE THE LETTER
FROM THE NAUGHTY GOBLIN. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS POST THE LETTERS IN THEIR
CORRECT BOXES.

 *  On the screen you will see a hand. To pick a letter up you should move *
 * the hand over it (using the mouse or the arrow keys) and click on the   *

MARKET PLACE

    Next Noddy decided to drive to the Market Place and visit Dina Doll.
Noddy likes visiting Dina and looking at all the exciting different things
which she has on sale.

    Noddy pulled up into a parking space to Dina's stall and jumped out of
his little yellow car.

    As he was walking towards Dina's stall he noticed that something very
odd was happening. Floating above the market stalls and holding onto five
coloured balloons was Mr. Plod the policeman.

    Noddy wandered over to Dina's stall.

    "Hello Dina," he said "what's happened to Mr. Plod?"

    "Noddy," she replied, "you'll never guess."

    "So tell me Dina," said Noddy.

    "Well, just a short while ago Mr. Plod told off some naughty goblins.
They were hitting people over the head with their balloons."

    "That couldn't have hurt anyone," said Noddy butting in.

    "But it could give them a nasty shock and even make them drop something.
Milko dropped six bottles of milk when they tried to surprise him."

    "Oh dear," said Noddy.

    "They just didn't stop doing it even when Mr. Plod got very angry. So he
chased them and took their balloons away. The trouble is that Mr. Plod has now
picked up so many balloons that he's floating above the market square and now
one of those naughty goblins has decided to have some more fun and burst the
balloons using his pea-shooter."

    "Well at least that will make Mr. Plod drop down," said Noddy, "but we

NOAH'S ARK

    Noddy then headed off to see Mr. Noah and the animals on the Ark. Noddy
liked visiting Mr. Noah. Not only did lots of different types of animals live
with him but sometimes he took Noddy for trips in the Ark.

    Mr. Noah was a large jolly man with a long beard. Noddy was fascinated by
his tales of all the different lands which he had visited and the different
animals which he had seen.

    As Noddy parked his little yellow car he saw Mr. Noah at the side of his
Ark.

    "Hello Mr. Noah," shouted Noddy clambering out of his car. As he walked
closer to the Ark he could see that Mr. Noah was trying to sort out some
pictures of his animals.

    "Can I have a ride in the Ark today please?" asked Noddy.

    "I'm sorry Noddy, not today, I'm far too busy," Mr. Noah said.

    "Why, what are you doing?" said Noddy.

    "I'm trying to put pieces of these pictures together," replied Mr. Noddy
pointing to some big pictures of his animals. "Last year I decided to cut
them into pieces so that I could put them away in a box. Now I want to check
that all of the pieces are there and stick them back together again."

    "Why do you want to do that?" said Noddy.

    "The Toy Town Art Gallery has asked if I could put them on display so
that everyone in Toy Town can see them," Mr. Noah said. "I'm in such a mess
Noddy, do you think you can help me?"

    Noddy smiled and nodded. "I'd love to help you," he said. "If we finish,
then can we go for a ride?"

    "Of course we can," said Mr. Noah smiling.

    CAN YOU HELP NODDY AND MR. NOAH SORT OUT THE JUMBLE PIECES OF EACH OF THE
PICTURES? IF YOU CAN, YOU CAN JOIN THEM IN A RIDE ON THE ARK.

N. & B. WORKS

    After having such a nice time with Mr. Noah, Noddy decided to see his old
friend, Farmer Straw.

    The road between Noah's Ark and the farm took Noddy past Toy Town's
factory, the N. & B. Works. Usually, on a Saturday, the factory is closed
and its gates are locked. This day was an exception. As Noddy drove up to
the factory he could hear the "Chug, chug, chug" of the large machines
inside. The lights were on and the door to the building was wide open.

    Noddy was curious. He parked his car car outside and wandered through
the big front door. The "Chug, chug, chug" of the machines became louder as
he entered the building.

    "Hello!" Noddy cried, but no-one heard him.

    Very cautiously, Noddy wandered through the factory. All of the machines
were working but he saw no-one. Noddy continued to walk.

PAGE 18

    He went past the huge yellow machine which sorted out the materials.
Next he saw the strange red mixing machine. Then he tip-toed past the
massive green machine. He watched as a group of hambergers came out of this
machine followed by a batch of gingerbread men.

    The last room in the factory was where all of the things which were made
were checked and put in boxes. Noddy slowly wandered towards the room and
there he saw Big Ears.

    "Big Ears, what are you doing here?" asked Noddy.

    "I'm helping out in the factory," replied Big Ears. "Last week some new
machines were delivered which do most of the jobs in the factory on their
own. Because it took all week to put them in we didn't make any new things.
So, I'm spending today catching up. If I don't there will be no ice cream,
no hambergers, no trifles..."

    "Stop!" cried Noddy, "I can't bear to think of it!"

    "Could you help out while I go check the other machines please Noddy?"
Big Ears asked.

    "Of course," said Noddy, "what do you want me to do?"

    "Just make sure that everything in each box is the same," replied Big
Ears. "Ever time you find something which is different, it must be crushed.
The items that are left can be out in boxes and delivered all over Toyland."

    Big Ears walked away with a spanner in his hand.

    "Oh well," Noddy muttered to himself, "I can't let my friends in Toyland
down, I hope I don't make any mistakes."

CAN YOU HELP NODDY TO CHECK THE ITEMS PRODUCED IN THE FACTORY AND PLACE THEM
INTO THEIR BOXES?

 *  The purpose of this program is that children identify objects which   *

FARM YARD

    With all of the nice things now in boxes, Noddy could leave the factory
and continue his journey to visit Farmer Straw.

    Within a few minutes Noddy had parked his car outside Toy Town Farm. It
was nearly four o'clock and this was when Farmer Straw fed his animals.

    Noddy wandered around the farmhouse and headed towards the barns at the
back where the animals slept and were fed. As Noddy walked along, Bumpy Dog
ran up behind him and barked.

PAGE 21

    "Hello Bumpy Dog," said Noddy bending down to stroke him, "let's go and
find Farmer Straw."

    Noddy continued to walk towards the barns. Every so often. Bumpy Dog
barked and jumped up Noddy's legs. Once or twice he nearly knocked Noddy
over. Each time Noddy just laughed and said, "Careful Bumpy Dog."

    When they arrived at the animals' barns they found Farmer Straw angrily
stamping his feet and going red in the face.

    "Those naughty animals!" he shouted. "They're playing a game and won't
come out for their food."

    "What sort of game?! asked Noddy.

    "A mix-up game," replied the farmer. "They've mixed up pictures of their
heads and tails on the door of the barn. They won't come out for their food
until the two halves of the pictures match!"

    "That sounds fun," said Noddy, "can I play the game and try to feed
them?"

    "Please do Noddy," answered Farmer Straw, "the sooner these animals are
fed the better for everyone." In his temper, he stamped his feet once more.

CAN YOU HELP NODDY TO SORT OUT THE HEADS AND TAILS OF THE ANIMALS AND GIVE
THEM THEIR FOOD?



 **************************************************************************
 *                                                                        *
 *  The large barn in the centre of the screen forms the playing area for *
 * this game. This is divided into two sections: the one on the left      *
 * contains an animal's head and the one on the right contains a tail.    *
 * The purpose of the game is to correctly match these two halves         *
 * together.                                                              *
 *                                                                        *
 *            LEVEL ONE                                                   *
 *                                                                        *
 *  On this level a complete (and correctly matched) animal appears in    *
 * the barn with its name at the bottom of the screen. Once any key has   *
 * been pressed the tail will be replaced by that of another animal.      *
 * Children must return the correct tail to the animal.                    *
 *  To step through the available tails they should click on the tail     *
 * using the left mouse button, push the joystick to the right or press   *
 * the SPACEBAR on the keyboard. Once the correct match has been made     *
 * this should be confirmed by clicking on the right mouse button (with   *
 * the cursor anywhere on the screen), taking the cursor to Noddy or      *
 * Farmer Straw and clicking on the left mouse button, pressing FIRE on   *
 * the joystick or by pressing RETURN on the keyboard                     *
 *                                                                        *

 *                                                                        *
 *  This level operates in much the same as Level One except that         *
 * children must match the heads of the animals to their tails and they   *
 * are not shown the correct match at the start of the puzzle.            *
 *                                                                        *
 *            LEVEL THREE                                                 *
 *                                                                        *
 *  On this level children must step through the heads and tails and find *
 * the only animal which can be matched together. On this occasion        *
 * children will have to step through both heads and the tails. To move   *
 * between the two halves of the barn they should click on the relevant   *
 * section using the mouse, push the joystick backwards or forwards or    *
 * press the LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys on the keyboard.                       *
 *                                                                        *

RAILWAY STATION

    To the north of Toy Town stands the Railway Station. Noddy likes it
here. Its such a busy place. Noddy's friends can catch trains to any town in
Toyland. Many of them ask Noddy to drive them to the station in his little
car. Some ask him to pick them up after their journeys.

    On Saturdays the trains in the Railway Station do not take passengers on
long journeys through Toyland. Instead, they are used for games which the
characters in Toy Town love to play.

    After visiting Farmer Straw, Noddy decided to go to the station and join
in the fun.

PAGE 23

    When Noddy arrived most of his friends were already aboard the train
which was waiting at the platform. Noddy spotted the Station Master.

    "Hello Mr. Station Master, what game are we going to play today?"
enquired Noddy.

    "I thought that we would play a hide and seek game," replied the Station
Master. "The idea is to find out where someone is sitting on the train."

    "How do we play this game?" asked Noddy.

    "The train will be standing at the next platform. Some of the characters
will jump in and sit down. It will the pull into this platform and you'll
all pull your blinds down. I'll then ask someone where one of you is
sitting. If they get it right I'll the see who is hiding behind one of the
ticket office windows."

    "That sounds fun!" replied Noddy.

    "The only problem is," continued the Station Master, "who is going to do
the guessing?"

    "I know just the person!" Noddy replied as he wandered off to join his
friends on the train.

 *  This is a game which encourages children to remember certain          *
 * characters which are present on a railway train. This may be a         *
 * somewhat tall order for some smaller children so the various helps     *
 * which are available in the program allow children to use shape and     *

 *  A train pulls into the station with the blinds to the windows open.   *
 * Children should at this point carefully examine the positions of each  *
 * of the characters on the train. After a short while, or when a key is  *
 * pressed, the blinds drop and children are asked where one of the       *
 * characters is sitting. children should now select one of the windows   *
 * on the train. They can do this using the mouse (left clicking with the *
 * cursor on the window), the joystick (pressing FIRE with the cursor on  *
 * the window) or the keyboard (by pressing RETURN). If children do not   *
 * answer the question correctly the blinds will rise partially and they  *
 * will have the opportunity to have another go in LEVEL TWO there are     *
 * more carriages and characters.                                         *
 *                                                                        *

 *  The train pulls into the station as before. Again children should     *
 * carefully look at the positions of the characters on the train. After  *
 * a short while the blinds again fall but on this occasion one of them   *
 * re-opens. The character which was sitting in that position is now      *
 * missing. Children must now try to identify which character was sitting *
 * in that position from the five shown at the bottom of the screen.      *
 *                                                                        *

FOUR CHIMNEY HOUSE

    Noddy next drove through the Market Square in the centre of Toy Town. He
stopped at Mr. Spark's garage to fill you his little yellow car with petrol
ready to pick up lots of passengers on Monday. Then he set off home past
Miss Thimble's house.

    At the end of the road Noddy turned right by Four-Chimney House where
Angela Goldenhair lived. (This house is called Four-Chimney House because it
is the  only one in Toy Town which has four chimneys.) As Noddy turned the
corner he saw Angela running down her garden path and waving at him. She did
look excited!

    Noddy suddenly stopped his car.

    "What's wrong Angela?" he shouted.

    "Wrong? Why, nothing's wrong Noddy!" replied Angela. "I'm so excited. We
have just finished making a new musical keyboard and it's wonderful."

    "What's so good about it?" asked Noddy.

    "It plays all my favourite tunes," said Angela, "and, if I play anything,
models of all my friends in Toy Town pop out of  the pipes. I can make it
sound like an organ and I can make it sound like a piano..."

    "Slow down," said Noddy, "why don't you just show me?"

    "Good idea," Angela replied.

    With that, Noddy climbed. out of his car and followed Angela into Four-
Chimney House, not quite sure what to expect.

YOU CAN TRY ANGELA GOLDENHAIR'S AMAZING NEW MUSICAL KEYBOARD. YOU CAN MAKE
IT DO EVERYTHING THAT SHE SAYS IT CAN DO?

 *  The on screen keyboard can be played as a piano or as an organ. To    *
 * change between these modes press O on the computer keyboard for organ  *
 * or P for piano.                                                        *

POLICE STATION

    Noddy drove along happily singing the songs that he had just played with
Angela Goldenhair.

    Up ahead he noticed Mr. Plod who was outside the Police Station and
looking very angry.

    Mr. Plod had just banged his head and was feeling very strange. He saw
Noddy's car trundling along the road. "Where's Noddy?" he said "Why is a
goblin driving his car?"

    As Noddy drove closer, Mr. Plod started to jump up and down at the side
of the road blowing his police whistle. With a sudden screech of the brakes,
Noddy stopped his car. "What's wrong?" asked Noddy.

    "You are a very naughty goblin!" replied Mr. Plod. "Why are you driving
Noddy's car?"

    "I'm not a goblin? It's me, Noddy!" By now, Noddy was very confused.

    "Don't you be cheeky to me," said Mr. Plod, "I can see that you're a
goblin and I'm going to put you in prison until you tell me where Noddy is."

    Mr. Plod grabbed hold of what he thought was a goblin and took him to the
Police Station. After only a few seconds Noddy found himself being locked up
in a cell. As Mr. Plod closed the door Noddy noticed a large bump on his
head.

    "What's wrong with Mr. Plod?" Noddy said to himself as the door slammed
closed. "I Know, he must have banged his head and he thinks that I am one of
those naughty little goblins."

    Noddy paced up and down thinking hard. Just how could he put everything
back to normal? Then he say a spade in the corner of the cell.

PAGE 28

    "That's just  the thing," he said, "I can use the spade to dig my way
out of this cell. My little yellow car is just outside the Police Station.
If I can get out I will be able to fetch a doctor who will put poor Mr.
Plod's head right."

    Noddy took hold of the spade and he began to dig. He was soon digging
downwards, but which way now?

NODDY NEEDS YOUR HELP TO FIND THE WAY TO HIS CAR. CAN YOU GUIDE NODDY TO THE
CAR BEFORE THE CONFUSED MR. PLOD CATCHES HIM?

                             NODDY'S PAINT POT

    Noddy's Paint Pot is a unique art package which has been
specifically designed so that even the youngest child can enjoy using it.
Using a variety of simple to use functions (including freehand draw, line
draw, colour fill and pattern fill) it allows children to be be as creative
as they want to be. Noddy's Paint Pot contains the major functions found in
dedicated art packages (such as Electronic Arts Deluxe Paint) which children
will be required to use as a part of the National Curriculum. As a result,
it will give children the confidence to be able to creatively use such
utilities at an early age.

PAGE 30

    Noddy's Paint Pot is very simple to use but at the same time, it has
sufficient complexity to allow children to produce detailed and colourful
pictures using a range of simple, icon driven commands.

THE SCREENS

    Noddy's Paint Pot is presented on two screens:

    The Menu Screen contains the various icons from which this program is
driven.

    The Drawing Screen is the active drawing area. By selecting a drawing
function on the Menu Screen the screen will rise to reveal the Drawing
Screen. To return to the Menu Screen children should click on the right
mouse button or use one of the functions described below.

CONTROL

    It is recommended that a mouse be used in Paint Pot. However, the
controls within this program can be carried out using the keyboard of a
joystick. The table below summarises the main functions within this package:


    FUNCTION            MOUSE

    Select a Drawing    Left Button    Return    Fire
    Function

    Move the cursor     Mouse          Cursor    Joystick
                        movement       keys      movement

    Start any Drawing   Left Button    Return    Fire
    Function

    Stop any Drawing    Left Button    Return    Fire
    Function

    Move from Menu      Right Button   Spacebar  Spacebar
    to Drawing Screen

PAGE 31

SEE PIC 1

FREEHAND DRAWING

    Clicking on this icon will take the program to the Drawing Screen with
Freehand Draw selected. To start to draw, children should click on and
release the left mouse button. The mouse can be moved to any point on the
screen and a line will be drawn. To stop drawing children should click and
release the left mouse button a second time.

    IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON SHOULD NOT BE HELD DOWN
WHILE THE CHILDREN ARE ATTEMPTING TO DRAW, THIS WILL HAVE NO EFFECT. THE
REASON FOR THIS IS THAT YOUNG, SMALL, HANDS MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT (IF NOT
IMPOSSIBLE!) TO HOLD DOWN THE MOUSE BUTTON AND DRAW AT THE SAME TIME. THIS
APPROACH HAS BEEN USED FOR ALL THE OTHER DRAWING FUNCTIONS THROUGHOUT THIS
PACKAGE.

SEE PIC 1

SPRAY CAN

    A similar function to freehand draw is the Spray Can. This allows an
array of dots to be placed on the screen.

SEE PIC 1

LINE DRAW

    Using this icon takes the program to the Drawing Screen with the Line
Draw selected. This will allow for the drawing of straight lines. Left mouse
clicking on the Drawing Screen will select the start point for the line, a
second left click, its end point.

PAGE 32

SEE PIC 1

OUTLINE BOX

    This allows children to draw an outline box. Left clicking on the
Drawing Screen dictates the start point for the box.    f the mouse is moved
and the left mouse button pressed a second time the complete shape will be
drawn.

SEE PIC 1

FILLED BOX

    This works in the same way as Outline Box except that the shape which is
produced is filled with the currently active colour.

SEE PIC 1

OUTLINE CIRCLE

    This allows children to draw an outline circle. Left clicking on the
Drawing Screen dictates the centre of the circle. If the mouse is moved away
from this point and clicked a second time a complete circle is drawn.
SEE PIC 1

FILLED CIRCLE

    This works the same way as Outline Circle except the shape which is
produced is filled with the currently active colour.

    All of the above functions use the currently selected:

         Colour,
         Pen Shape,
         Pen Size.

   These can be altered using the icons on the top right of the Menu Screen.

PAGE 33

SEE PIC 1

COLOUR

    Clicking on the arrows to the left or right of this selector strip
alters the currently available colour. Left clicking advances the selector
strip by one character, right clicking by three. The active colour is shown
in the centre of the strip.

    A large colour selector strip is also available from the Drawing Screen.
This allows children to alter the currently selected colour without either
returning to the Menu Screen or altering the currently selected drawing
function. This strip can be made to drop away from the Drawing Screen (and
reveal the whole of the picture) by pressing the letter Z on the keyboard.
Pressing this letter a second time will make the strip return to the Drawing
Screen.

SEE PIC 1

OOPS!

    On the far right of the colour selector strip on the Drawing Screen is
Noddy's Oops! button. Clicking on this will remove the last function which
was carried out.

SEE PIC 1

PEN SIZE

    Four pen sizes are available each of which can be selected by clicking
on the required icon.

SEE PIC 1

PEN SHAPE

    The pen shape can be altered by clicking on the arrows to the left and
right of this selector. There are six different pens to choose from, these
are :

    Circle, square, triangle, star, arrow and hand.

PAGE 34

SEE PIC 1

PATTERN FILL SELECTOR

    Paint Pot contains 50 different fill patterns which can be used to flood
enclosed areas of children's work. To scroll between the available patterns
click on the arrows either side of the selector box. Left clicking advances
the selector strip by one character, right clicking by three. The active
fill pattern is shown in the centre of the strip. To use the selected fill
pattern children must first click on the Fill Pattern icon.

SEE PIC 1

PATTERN FILL

    Clicking on this item will take the program to the Drawing Screen with
Fill Pattern selected. The active pattern will be shown in the centre of the
Fill Pattern Selector Strip (see above). To use this function the cursor
should be carefully placed inside the area to be filled. Pressing the left
mouse button fill the area. If the area is not entirely enclosed the pattern
may flood over the whole screen. If this should happen the pattern can be
removed from the screen by clicking on "Oops" (see previously mentioned).

SEE PIC 1

COLOUR FILL

    This works in the same way as Fill Pattern except that the selected area
is filled with the currently active colour rather than a pattern.

PAGE 35

SEE PIC 1

CHARACTERS AND OBJECTS

    Paint Pot contains a number of characters and objects which can be
pasted onto pictures. These can be scrolled through by clicking on the
arrows either side of the selection strip. If children click on any of the
three visible objects or characters the program will move to the Drawing
Scree with that object selected. This can be pasted anywhere within the
picture by clicking on the left mouse. Two special facilities are also
provided:

    To turn an object upside down, press U on the keyboard. To produce a
mirror image of an object, press M.

SEE PIC 1

OUTLINE PICTURES

    As children drive Noddy's car into each of the eight taxi ranks on the
map of Toy Town they will be given the option to enter the associated game,
continue to drive or to enter Paint Pot. If they opt to enter Paint Pot the
program will be loaded with two location-specific outline pictures available
to them. These pictures can be called up by the program and used as the
basis of children's' work.

    Icons representing each of these outline pictures can be found at the
bottom of the screen. To select one of these click on it using the left
mouse button. After confirming that they wish to load this picture children
will be presented with it on the Drawing screen. At this stage colour fill
is active by default.

    Children can therefore select the colours with which they wish to shade
various parts of the drawing. If they press the right mouse button at any
time the program will return to the Main Menu and any function can be
selected as described above.

PAGE 36

    As well as loading Paint Pot from each of the taxi ranks it can be
loaded from the Main Options Screen which appears shortly after Noddy's
Playtime is booted up. If Paint Pot is entered in this way all 16 outline
pictures will be available. To scroll through the different pictures the
cursor should be placed over the icon and the right mouse button should be
pressed.

SEE PIC 1

ERASE PICTURE

    If children select this function and then confirm their choice they will
be able to clear the whole of the drawing screen.

SEE PIC 1

SAVE PICTURE

    To save a picture insert a blank, formatted disc into Drive A (or 0 in
the case of the Amiga). Amiga users should, when they format their disk,
label it NODDYPICS. Once children have confirmed that they do wish to save
their picture it will be saved with the sequential file name starting with
pic1. Pictures will be saved in the .IFF (PC and Amiga) or .PI1 (Atari ST)
format and can be later loaded into a stand-alone, commercial, art packages
such as Deluxe Paint or Degas Elite and printed.

SEE PIC 1

QUIT

    To leave the program either click on Noddy's car or press Escape.

SECTION 4

PARENT/TEACHER SECTION - NODDY'S PLAYTIME AND THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM

    Noddy's Playtime is a complete learning and entertainment package for
young children. Its primary aim is to introduce important educational
concepts in a fun-to-use manner. Children are encouraged to develop a number
of basic skills while at the same time enjoying themselves.

    NODDY's DRIVING MENU links each of the programs in this package. As well
as encouraging children to refer to reference sources (in this case, the
printed map which is enclosed in this package) it will help them to develop
an appreciation of different directions. Children should be encouraged  to
describe the routes in which they direct Noddy using simple terms such as
"turn right", "turn left" and so on. Indeed, this program could be used to
encourage collaborative effort between children with one child acting as
"navigator" and the other as "driver".

    The Driving Menu is controlled entirely by the child. Even the various
animations which can be found on this menu can be controlled in response to
the sound of the car's horn or Noddy's wave which are themselves under the
control of children.

    NODDY's PAINT POT is a unique and amazing art package designed specially
for young children. At its simplest, children will be able to load in one of
16 outline pictures, which they will be able to colour in. Beyond this, they
will be able to use a number of standard art package functions. The use of
these will introduce them to standard art packages which is the requirement
of the National Curriculum in Technology (Information Technology).

    Despite its apparent simplicity, Noddy's Paint Pot will enable children
to produce colourful and even complex pictures. Children should be
encouraged to experiment with  the various functions and discover for
themselves the effects that they can produce with each of them.

    RAILWAY STATION is a program which aims to encourage memory skills as
well as shape/colour matching.

PAGE 38

    On Levels One and Two a train draws into the station. The blinds on the
train are up and children can see the characters on the train. Now the
blinds fall and children are asked where a particular character is sitting.
They should try to remember where this position is and click on it. If they
should get the answer wrong (or call Big Ears' help) the blinds will rise a
short way and they may be able to locate the character by matching the shape
and colour of the partially revealed icons to the one shown in the question
strip at the bottom of the screen.

    On Level Three, children see ten characters on the train. The blinds
fall. Now only one rises with a character missing. On this occasion children
must select the missing character from a selection of five given at the
bottom of the screen. Again, if they should select the wrong character or if
they call on Big Ears' help a part of the contents of each window will be
revealed. They may be able to discover which character is missing using
shape and colour matching.

    NOAH's ARK is a jigsaw puzzle game. While playing this children will see
the names of each of the animals as their picture appear within the puzzles.
They should be encouraged to look at these words and use them as "clues" in
putting together the different parts of the pictures. The words introduced
in this program are:

    Bear, Camel, Crocodile, Dolphin, Duck, Elephant, Giraffe, Hippo,
Kangaroo, Lion, Monkey, Ostrich, Penguin, Polar Bear, Rhinoceros, Snake,
Swan, Tiger, Whale, Zebra.

    FARM YARD is a game in which children must match two halves of an animal
together to form a complete, logical, picture. On level One they are
initially presented with a completed animal. After a short while the tail
becomes "muddled" and has to be found again. Level Two is similar to Level
One except that children are not shown the completed animal at the start of
each game. Additionally, They must match the heads rather than the tails,
and there are more alternatives from which to select. In the final level.
children have to discover the missing animal by scrolling through both heads
and tails.

    As with Noah's Ark this program introduces a simple vocabulary of the
different animals. In Farm Yard these are:

    Badger, Beaver, Bull, Cat, Chicken, Cow, Dog, Donkey, Duck, Fish, Fox,
Frog, Goat, Goose, Horse, Pig, Rabbit, Sheep, Squirrel, Tortoise.

PAGE 40

    FOUR-CHIMNEY HOUSE presents children with an on-screen musical keyboard
which covers a single octave. On the first level children are able to play
the keyboard in any way you wish. This provides an introduction to this
program and familiarises children with the method by which it is controlled.

    On Levels Two and Three children must select a song (from a list of 14
familiar tunes). After choosing a song they will hear it play. They should
then replay it following simple instructions which are found at the bottom
of the screen. On Level Two these instructions take the form of numbers
which are relevant to each of the keys on the musical keyboard. On Level
Three they must follow notes on a stave. Here, they will gain an
appreciation that each note represents a different sound.

    The sounds used in this program are:

         * Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
         * Old MacDonald
         * London Bridge
         * Little Bo-Peep
         * Jingle Bells
         * Oranges and Lemons
         * This is the way
         * Here we go Looby-Loo
         * Pop Goes the Weasel
         * Row, Row, Row the Boat
         * Baa Baa Black Sheep
         * Three Blind Mice
         * Hickory Dickory Dock
         * Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

    MARKET PLACE introduces children to initial letters as well as a simple
spelling list of 55 common objects.

    On the first level their task is to find an object with a certain
initial letter. As they move the mouse pointer over the screen the names of
each of

PAGE 41

    the objects will appear. They should be able to match the coloured
flashing letters at the start of these names to an identical letter on the
bottom of the screen.

    This level introduces children to 13 different letters. The words chosen
in this activity each use these letters phonetically. As young children use
this program they should be encouraged to say these letters (phonetically)
out loud followed by the word of the object that they select (for example:
"a is for apple", "b is for ball").

    On Level Two children must match single objects to the words on the
bottom of the screen. This level will encourage them to read each of the
words as they appear and to recognise that each object is represented by a
unique combination and order of letters.

    Level Three extends and reinforces the ideas in the previous two levels.
Here children must now hunt through the market stall to find a number of
objects which each share initial letter.

    The words used in Market Place are:

         apple, anchor, apron, axe
         ball, bananas, bat, bicycle, boat, boat, book, broom, bus
         cakes, candle, car, carrot, clock, coat
         dog, doll, drum, duck, dustbin
         egg, elephant
         fire engine, fishing rod, flags, flowers, frog
         giraffe, gloves, grapes
         magnet, monkey, mushroom
         nails, necklace, newspaper, nuts
         oars, orange
         saw, scissors, shirt, shoes, spider, socks, sweets
         telephone, television, tomatoes, towels, train
         umbrella

    N. & B. WORKS is an "odd-one-out" game where the complexity of the
problems increase between each level. This activity will encourage children
to recognise and describe differences between objects. They should also be
encouraged to realise that they are using the computer to control the
actions of the machine which they see on the screen.

PAGE 42

    POST OFFICE has been carefully designed to introduce four important
skills:

         * number recognition,
         * counting,
         * addition,
         * subtraction.

    Each of the three levels has been "staged" so that questions gradually
increase in difficulty. As children complete one stage they can move into
the next by pressing F10. Alternatively they can repeat the task again.
 
    Level One is concerned with number recognition and counting. Here
children must count a number of letters into any of the post boxes. In the
first two stages the number of letters available is identical to the number
which must be posted. In Stage Three the number of letters available is
greater than or equal to the number quoted in the question strip.

    Level Two extends the idea introduced in Level One. Now each post box has
a number above it. Children have to match the numbers on the letters with
those above the post boxes. As with Level One there are three stages. In the
first there are three letters at the bottom of the screen. This increases to
four in Stage Two and five in Stage Three.

    Level Three introduces simple addition and subtraction facts. The
letters on the bottom of the screen now have sums on them rather than just
numbers. Children must work out the value of each sum and post the letters
in the relevant box labelled with this value. Stage One deals with addition
facts where the answers are between 2 and 12 and subtraction facts where no
integra used exceeds 10. Stage Two combines addition facts where the answers
are between 8 and 24 and subtraction facts where no integer used exceeds 16.
Finally, Stage Three contains addition facts where the answers are between
12 and 37 and subtraction facts where no integer used exceeds 25.

    POLICE STATION is, essentially, a fun-based activity in which children
must guide Noddy through a maze. The size and complexity of the mazes
increases between each level. As Noddy's Driving Menu and N. & B. Works,
children should appreciate that they are using the computer to control
Noddy's movements.

PAGE 43

NODDY'S PLAYTIME AND THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM

    Noddy's Playtime responds to various early aspects of the National
Curriculum, most notably in the English, Mathematics and Technology. As
such, this package will assist children in acquiring some of the basic
skills demanded within the education sector today. The lowest level of study
within the National Curriculum is Key Stage 1. This is directed at children
in years 1 and 2 (ages 5 to 7).

    This package can be used, at its lowest levels, by pre-school children.
As such it will prepare children for a number of important aspects of Key
Stage 1 of the National Curriculum. The highest level of each activity
within this package may tax even the bright six or seven year olds and will
therefore reinforce work carried out in school.

    A summary of the Attainment Targets (ATs) of the National Curricula in
English, Mathematics and Technology covered (in part or in full) at Levels 1
and 2 (Key Stage 1) by Noddy's Playtime are shown as Asterisks (*) in the
following tables.
