INTRODUCTION
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -

WELCOME TO F117
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -

As the twentieth century drew to a close, the U.S. Military invited a
number of manufacturers to submit designs for a lightweight multi-role
attack stealthplane.  The prime design criteria were for an aircraft
capable of true all weather nap of the earth (NOE) flight, delivering a
wide range of ordinance over a short range.  The prototype designation
meing Multi-role Experimental (MRX).  Of the several proposed designs
only one received funding for Phase I development, this being the ultra-
silent F117-AFM.
This spendid airplane with it's special avoid-radar design was in a
calss of it's own. Now the human being could enter with a whole flying
army without the enemy even would notice it, not before the feel their
own blood be spreaded at their tounghs anyway.

The F117-AFM design centred around an extensive use of carbon composites
to provide an exceptionally light airframe.  Power came from twin
turboshafts themselves incorporating many ceramic components to further
reduce weight.  The main motors were of glass-fibre construction
incorporating a LIVE (Liquid Inertia Vibration Elimination) system.

Flight efficiency was increased by the use of STEALTH (no tail motor)
technology instead of the traditional tail motor.  (STEALTH uses the flow
of the exhaust-gasses channelled through a number of slots in the
tail-boom to counteract main-rotor torque.)

A comprehensive array of flight and fire control systems reduce load on
the pilot and allow effective night and poor visibility attacks.

To complement the new stealthplane, a new range of compact missiles were
developed, designed for use at long range and at low altitudes.  These
weapons included both air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles and a new,
huge calibre rocket system.

To this date, only a single example of the F117-AFM is flying, the AFM,
'F117'.

You join the Stealth-Service, a crack assault team commissioned by the
United Nations.  Your job is to defuse crisis situations around the
world, preventing their escalation into a full-scale conflict.  With
Stealth-Service you will fly the newly commissioned F117 attack stealthplane
against forces around the world.

GETTING STARTED
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -

THE COMMON ROOM
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The common room is the place where pilots rest between missions and is
the place where all games begin.  From here you can:

a)   Use the flight simulator to improve your piloting skills.  To enter
     the simulator simply click the hand cursor anywhere on the
     simulator.

b)   Enter the war room to choose a campaign or recap on the current
     campaign.  To enter a war room, click on the door on the far right
     of the screen.

c)   Enter the mission briefing room to begin a mission.  To enter the
     briefing room, click on the door on the right of the screen.

d)   Use the Desktop computer to save your current game or to reload old
     games.  To use the computer simply click anywhere on the computer.

e)   View you current rank and decorations.  To review your pilot
     information, click on the locker in the middle of the screen.

THE FLIGHT SIMULATOR
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The flight simulator allows inexperienced pilots to improve their flying
skills without endangering their lives or a multi-milliard dollar machine.
On entering the simulator you are presented with an options menu allowing
you to select the campaign to simulate, the time of day and the skill
level of enemy units.  Use the cursor to change the options and click on
the GO icon to enter the simulation.  The simulator accurately recreates
the flight characteristics of the F117 although you will be
provided with unlimited weaponry.  Throughout the simulation you will
receive 'radio messages' from the flight instructor as he assesses your
ability and helps you improve your combat skills.  The simulator can be
exited at any time by pressing the escape key at which point you will be
presented with an overall assessment from the instructor.

THE WAR ROOM
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The war room is the place from which all campaigns are commanded.  Teams
of tacticians constantly monitor military and political situations around
the world.  From here you can select one of the six campaign theatres or
recap on the current campaign.  To view a campaign, click on one of the
circles marked on the world map in the middle of the screen.  This will
bring up a map of the campaign (on the right of the screen) and a
tactician will provide you with background information.

To select the campaign, simply click on the campaign map.  From there you
will be taken to the briefing room where you will be given a detailed
briefing of the campaign's objectives.

THE BRIEFING ROOM
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Before you enter combat, Jack Marshall, your chief tactician, will
provide you with a full mission briefing allowing you to carefully plan
your attack and select appropriate ordinance.  Jack has access to all
relevant information and will provide you with the latest strategic
updates.  Jack is an expert in his field and only a foolhardy pilot would
ignore his advice.  Each section of the briefing can be stepped through
by clicking anywhere on the screen, the escape key will exit the
briefing.

THE DESKTOP COMPUTER
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
F117 is a very large game and only a player with great stamina
would attempt to complete the game in one sitting, therefore a game save
option has been provided.  On entering the file system a large disk is
displayed on screen with a list of options:

LOAD PILOT     -    Load a previously saved game from current disk.
SAVE PILOT     -    Save present game to current disk.
ERASE PILOT    -    Erase pilot off current disk.
EXIT GAME      -    Exit current game and return to startup screen.

To exit the desktop computer, click the pointer anywhere outside the
disk.

VIEW PLAYER STATISTICS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
As you progress through F117 you may be awarded various
decorations for your skill and courage.  A good player may also recieve
increments in rank if the Pentagon are sufficiently impressed by your
performance.  In addition to these you will always recieve a campaign
ribbon on completion of a campaign.  You can judge your overall
performace by rank and medals bearing in mind that the ultimate player
may recieve 6 medals, 6 ribbons and the rank of colonel.

ARMING SCREEN
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
On exiting the briefing room you are taken to the arming room where you
select appropriate ordinance for the forthcoming mission.  The
F117 can carry a wide range of offensive and defensive equipment
but the right selection is vital if your mission is to be successful.

At the top right of the screen is a picture of the currently selected
weapon with an information panel below.  Clicking over the two arrow
icons will flip through the list of available weaponry.  To add a weapon
to the stealthplane, click the cursor over one of the underwing pylons (or
wingtip pylons when adding air-to-air missiles).  Pylons can often carry
more than one weapon each and clicking the left button (or space bar)
again will add more of the same weapon.  To remove weapons from a pylon,
click over the pylon with the right button (or backspace key).  To
replace the weapons on a pylon, simply select a new weapon and click over
the pylon.

Although each pylon is capable of carrying the same weight of weapons,
bombs can only be added in pairs, the bombs occupying the same pylon
under each wing.

To make life easier, an auto-arm option has been included which will
automatically add a suitable weapons load.  This is particularly suited
to new pilots as the more experienced flyer will develop his (or her) own
combat style suited to a more varied weapons load.

In addition to the weapons you select, you will always have the 30mm
cannon, a formidable weapon in itself.

To exit the arming screen, click on the EXIT icon at the bottom right of
the screen.

FLYING THE MISSION
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Your mission may begin from your home base or, if the objective is some
distance away, the auto-pilot will fly the aircraft into the mission
area.  The mission area is defined as 'An identifiable area of
concentrated enemy forces' and in practical terms consists of a circle of
action around the mission objective.  In all attack missions the primary
target must be destroyed for the mission to be successful, failure will
usually result in the campaign being lost and you being demoted or
dismissed from service.  Secondary targets are generally opportunist
targets, unnecessary for mission success although the destruction of air-
defences may well make later missions easier.  Generally the best idea is
to use stealth tactics to reach the primary target and leave and leave
any secondary targets for the trip home.  The quickest way to leave the
mission area is to follow the base way-marker on the compass.  Depending
on the mission, once you have completed your objective, either the
autopilot will return you to base, or you will have to follow the base
way-marker above the compass and land your aircraft back at base.

THE DEBRIEFING ROOM
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
After each mission is completed you will receive a full debriefing from
Jack.  Your performance will be discussed along with any tactical
updates.  Should your performance prove to be unsatisfactory, Jack may
have no alternative but to dismiss you from service.  Particular note
will be taken when allied lives are at stake, although a poor performance
will never go unnoticed.  Should your performance be particularly good,
Jack may well recommend you for promotion.  The debrief can be stepped
through by clicking the left mouse button, the Escape key will return you
to the common room.

COCKPIT INSTRUMENTATION
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
In a move to reduce load on the pilot, the F117 features a system
of multi-function monitors coupled to an intergrated TADS (Target
Acquisition/Designation Sight).  The system is designed to reduce the
percentage of the pilot's time actually flying the machine and so improve
combat performance.  The system features just three multi-function
displays in the cockpit, all other information being displayed on the HUD
(Heads Up Display).

1. AIRSPEED
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Displays your horizontal speed in knots

2. ALTIMETER
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
On the left is your altitude in feet; on the right is the scale on which
each mark represents 20 feet.

3. COLLECTIVE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The position of the bar represents the amount of power being fed to the
main rotor.  When the bar is over the centre mark the engine is producing
the correct amount of power for level flight.  If it is above the centre
mark the engine produces more power, if it is below the centre mark it
will produce less power.

At low altitudes ground effect and turbulence will affect airflow over
the rotors and the amount of power needed for level flight will change.
A wise pilot will not attempt to fly fast at low altitudes.

4. COUNTER MEASURES
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The R symbol represents the status of your radar jammer, the three lights
below it represent - from top to bottom - radar guidance, radar track and
radar search.  The guidance light warns that the enemy have launched a
radar guided weapon towards you.  The tracking light warns that an enemy
radar has locked on to your precise position.  The search light warns
that an enemy has detected you on radar.

The I symbol represents the status of your infrared jammer.  The light
below it warns that the enemy have launched an infrared guided weapon at
you.

Below the two sets of lights are two digits representing the number of
chaff and flare cartridges you are carrying.

5. CROSS-HAIR
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The cross-hair appears when you select an unguided weapon.  All weapons
are calibrated to fire at the centre of the cross-hair although you must
take gravity into account when using your cannon.  Below the cross-hair
is the name of the currently selected weapon along with the quantity
remaining.

6. CYCLIC JOYSTICK
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The cyclic joystick is represented by a small box within a larger box
(below the air-speed indicator).  Moving the mouse/joystick moves a small
cursor.  When the cursor is positioned within the smaller box, the
stealthplane will hover.  If the cursor is moved out of the smaller box the
stealthplane will move in the direction of the cursor.

7. DAMAGE CONTROL COMPUTER
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The computer provides you with a constant update on the condition of your
aircraft as well as listing your available weapons.  Pressing D will
switch the computer between Damage & Stores mode although the computer
will switch to damage mode if you take a hit.

8. HEADING INDICATOR
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The vertical line below the compass indicates your current heading.  The
arrow above the compass shows you the course to follow to your current
target.  The vertical line above the compass will always indicate the
correct heading back to your base.  This should always be used after
completing your mission.

9. MULTI-MODE CAMERA
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The camera has two modes of operation, Targeting mode and Landing mode.
Targeting mode provides a video image of the currently designated target
along with its range in feet.  If you have selected bombs as your current
weapon, the display will switch to Bombing mode and give a view directly
below the stealthplane.  Landing mode simply displays a view downwards from
your stealthplane.

10. THREAT DISPLAY
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
This displays all radar threats within a range of 4 km.  Ground threats
are displayed as orange dots, air threats as red dots and missiles as
white dots.  As you approach a target, the display will switch to
close-range mode with a range of 1.8 km.

11. VERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR (VSI)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Displays how fast the stealthplane is ascending or descending.  When the
slider is above the centre-line, the stealthplane is climbing and when it
is below the centre line you will be descending.


FLIGHT CONTROLS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The traditional flight controls of a stealthplane compromise of three
separate inputs.  These effectively tied up both hands and both feet
making it difficult for the pilot to do anything else but fly.  With the
advent of fly-by-wire control systems, designers managed to replace two
pedals, two joysticks and a twist-grip with a single joystick.  The
4-axis control stick allows the pilot to control the stealthplane with just
one hand.  F117 is controlled by using a mouse, a joystick or on
keyboard although in all cases a few key presses will be necessary.

MOUSE/JOYSTICK CONTROL
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -

THE MOUSE BUTTONS:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Clicking the right mouse button changes the current selected weapon for
the next available one.

Clicking the left mouse button fires the currently selected weapon.

Clicking the left button with the right button held down selects the next
designated target.

WITH NO MOUSE/JOYSTICK BUTTONS PRESSED:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Moving the mouse/joystick forward causes the stealthplane to tip down
allowing it to move forwards.

Moving the mouse/joystick backwards causes the stealthplane to tip upwards
allowing it to move backwards.

At low speeds, moving the mouse/joystick left or right causes the
stealthplane to move sideways.  With the mouse/joystick pushed forwards and
to the left or right, the stealthplane will bank and turn in that
direction.

HOLDING DOWN THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Moving the mouse/joystick forwards with the right button pressed
increases power to the main rotor, allowing the stealthplane to rise.

Moving the mouse/joystick backwards with the right button pressed
decreases power to the main rotor, allowing the stealthplane to fall.

In level flight, at low speeds, moving the mouse/joystick left and right
with the right button pressed causes the stealthplane to rotate around its
own axis.

THE CAMPAIGNS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -

CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
F117 features six campaigns, each comprising of a number of
individual missions.  As you progress through the campaign, you will be
asked to perform the roles of ground attack, escort, interceptor, etc.
In all cases, many hundreds of lives rest on your skill and commitment.
The team of Stealth-Service hand you all the required information and support
but there is only one pilot, YOU.  An inexperienced pilot should take
care when choosing a campaign.  Always consult the technical information
on each campaign and ascertain the number and type of enemy units you
will be up against.

CAMPAIGN ONE - EUROPE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Vladimir Arastov, the top Soviet nuclear physicist who's been on
Washington's most wanted list for the last fifteen years.  A man who has
been responsible for so many significant Soviet nuclear developments,
Moscow has kept him under very tight security for obvious reasons.  In
fact, he's on his first outing from Moscow for twenty years, and the news
has broken, that he wants to defect.

He's scheduled to visit a power plant in Soviet Eastern Europe tomorrow
night as part of a scientific advisory tour.  It's the closest he's ever
likely to get to western soil and he's contacted Washington with details
of his movements and an outline of his own plan to get out.

This is where you come in...

As part of the Stealth-Service team you are to make an air strike on the
power plant to create a diversion for Arastov.  He is confident that in
all the confusion he can escape by road along a route towards the border.
Whilest he's running, your tasks will be to draw Soviet attention from
him.  He'll be in contact via a scrambled radio link so that if anything
goes wrong your team can react quickly and improvise.  Washington has
given its assurance that his plan is solid, but you never know...

They want him so badly they're prepared to go along with it, after all,
it's probably the only chance they'll have to get him.

Of course, Arastov has picked a fine time to do this.  Latest
intelligence information on Soviet armoured units in the area, shows that
they're currently on manoeuvres.

But, if you can really create some havoc, they won't know what's going on
until he's been debriefed in Washington!

CAMPAIGN TWO - SOUTH AMERICA
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
'Our message to the drug cartels is this:  The rules have changed.  We
will help any government that wants our help.  When required, we will for
the first time make available the appropriate resources of America's
armed forces.'
                                        George Bush - September 5 1989

Stealth-Service was sent to South America as part of a goodwill gesture by
the U.S. government.  The government of this republic have been cracking
down on drugs operations and have asked for assistance.  So, after Bush's
declaration in '89, Washington can hardly refuse.

You are to assist in destroying the operations of a major drugs cartel
whose base is out in the desert.  They are very well armed and employ
numerous foreign mercenaries who will stop at nothing to keep intruders
at bay.

Firstly, you'll be sent in to strip out their communications network.
Then, cut off their escape routes before finally destroying their
processing labs.  You've got to wipe them off the face of the map, but it
won't be easy.  They know this region very well and there's an awful lot
of ground cover for them.  Also, how much hardware and expertise they've
managed to accumulate is unknown.

It's chiefly a U.S. operations, but local troops will be working with
Stealth-Service to do some mopping up, so you're there to impress.
The operation has great political significance, that's why Washington
has sent several million dollars worth of military hardware to some
backwater desert.

It's the first time the U.S. has gone against the drug cartels in this
region.  So, your performance will reflect on the capability of America's
armed forces.

You can't afford to mess this one up.

CAMPAIGN THREE - CENTRAL AMERICA
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The U.S. has a long term involvement in this region.  Your hosts, the
government, has been fighting a war against Soviet backed guerillas for
the past twenty years. Stealth-Service was called in to regain control of
a town which has fallen into the hands of the guerillas.

It seems the locals have been having a great deal of trouble keeping the
place secure for some time.  They finally lost control of the situation
about ten days ago and have had no choice but to leave the area.
Obviously they are desperate to return but are outnumbered by the
guerillas, so that's why they need your help.

The entire territory to the West of your base is guerilla occupied and
it's all dense jungle.  That should work in your favour, by slowing down
their movement quite considerably, since they can only move their heavy
armour by road.  However, it's their territory, and there's plenty of
cover.

Whatever you do, don't underestimate their ability.  They're serious
about their cause and we gather from intelligence sources that they may
be able to call in heavy air support if it proves necessary.

CAMPAIGN FOUR - MIDDLE EAST
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Stealth-Service has been selected to help sort out a situation which
always seems likely to happen.

This region has always been prone to territorial disputes.  These have
previously been left to be resolved by the parties involved.  However,
our enemy has decided that the Straits belong to them, a problem, since
they are officially designated as International waters.

You're to go in to help rid the area of gunboats which are preventing
normal shipping from passing through the Straits.  This area is one of
the world's busiest shipping routes, and when you have supertankers laden
with millions of gallons of highly inflammable oil products, you can see
the urgency.

Intelligence reports show that their airforce is also showing a fairly
heavy presence in the area and are equipped with MIG-29 Fulcrums.
They're also using Hind-A gunships.  Certainly some heavy duty hardware
and they also have the pilots to match.

As the offshore oil terminals and rigs are of strategic importance,
control of these installations means control of the Straits.  You have to
protect them from enemy occupation.

Once the enemy has been forced back into ihs own territory, you'll be
making a number of retaliatory strikes, in order to persuade them not to
do it again.

The Straits have great international importance as most major oil
companies have facilities out there.  You can't afford to mess this one
up.  The world's eyes will be upon you.

CAMPAIGN FIVE - SOUTH EAST ASIA
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The U.S. have had a fairly active involvement in this area, ever since
the troubles began there more than twenty years ago.  You will be based
on one side of the border between two opposing countries.  Your
neighbours across the border, have been trying to take control of your
host's country since the early 70's.

Recently their actions have taken the form of raids across the border,
into friendly territory.  Each raid has been designed to disrupt
transportation or interfere with the political system, but as yet have
failed.  This has been due to the strength of your host's army, a small
but highly trained force.  However, something has happened recently which
could easily tip the balance in the enemy's favour.

In several recent border incidents, chemeical weapons have been used by
the enemy.  This came as a total surprise and serious casualties were
taken.

Initialy it was believed that the chemical weapons were being brought in
from external sources.  However, after a successful reconaissance mission
we have confirmed sightings of laboratories where these deadly substances
have been made.

The use of such weapons has so far been limited, but on a larger scale it
could mean the enemy could just walk in.

That is why Stealth-Service has been called upon, to eradicate the chemical
threat.

Your operation will begin with a raid to strip out the enemy's early
warning capabilities.  You will then make raid on sites identified as
laboratories which are being used to manufacture the chemical weaponry.

It is the intention not to leave the area until the chemical threat has
been completely neutralised.

CAMPAIGN SIX - ALASKA
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
There's nothing like a sudden change of climate - three U.S. special
research bases in a remote part of Alaska - Alpha, Beta and Omega - have
been out of contact for the past week.

They have been working on biological research, in particular, defences to
known biological weapons.  They were located so far north because of
their remoteness from population centres and the climate.  In theory, if
an accident occurs here, any escaping biological matter would not survive
the intense cold.

Recently, the Soviets have been showing an interest in the area, and have
made several complaints to the U.S. Government concerning the proximity
of these bases to their border.  It is certain that they know that the
U.S. have been shipping biological weapons to these bases, but we don't
they know why.  It appears they fear some form of biological weapon is
being developed rather than defences against them, despite our assurances
to the contrary.

Five days ago, a recon. satellite picked up a large amount of Soviet
hardware heading towards the border.  Shortly afterwards, all contact was
lost with the three bases.

You're to go in to check out why.  Unfortunately, due to the top secret
nature of the research you have limited information.  What is known is
that Stealth-Service must prevent the biological weapons falling into
the wrong hands.
Otherwise, you could have a real crisis on your hands.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -

CANNON
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Fitted as standard to the F117 is a 30mm three barrelled chain
gun.  The gun is only effective at ranges under 1/2km but inside that
range it is a potent weapon against both ground and air targets.  The
only things the gun is ineffective are large structures such as bridges
and factories.  The 1200 rounds of ammunition are fired off in 6-round
bursts and normally 3 or 4 bursts are sufficient against soft
(unarmoured) targets.

FFAR Rocket Pod
Fitted in pods of 26 or 47 rockets and with a maximum range of
approximately 1.5km the unguided Folded Fin Aerial Rocket is a highly
versatile weapon.  Although only accurate to around 1/2km, the FFAR is a
potent weapon within that range, being effective against vehicles and
small structures.

MWAR Rocket Pod
Fitted in pods of 6 or 10, the MWAR is a 4-warhead version of the FFAR
with similar range and effectiveness.  A single large rocket is fired
which splits into 4 separate warheads at a range of around 1/4km.

MK-81 Bomb
Standard 250lb. high-drag bomb effective against all structures.  It
should be noted that use of these bombs below 250 feet will cause blast
damage to your aircraft.

MK-82 Bomb
Standard 500lb. high-drag bomb highly effective against all structures (a
single MK-82 will destroy most structures outright).  Due to the size of
these bombs, its use below 500 feet is not advisable.

RCS-233
Runway Cratering System, developed from a larger British version designed
for fixed-wing aircraft.  The RCS fires a cluster of small bombs
downwards into the runway causing a large number of deep craters.  The
targeting system automatically selects the best launch pattern to ensure
maximum damage.

AGM-214 Firestorm
Short-range deriative of the laser-guided Hellfire missile.  HIghly
effective against all ground vehicles up to a range of around 4km.  Using
the TADS system to designate target means that the target must remain
selected up to the point of impact.  This fact can be used to your
advantage by firing multiple missiles and redesignating as each missile
hits.  The Firestorm is available in pods of 4 or 7 missiles allowing you
to carry a maximum of 28.

AGM-65P Maverick
Compact version of the original AGM-65D featuring advanced thermal-image
targeting for an effective range of 5km.  Being a fire-and-forget weapon,
the Maverick is ideal for use with pop-up tactics.  Available in packs of
1, 2 or 3 missiles.

AGM112-L SMARM
The Smart Anti-Radar Missile is designed to home in on enemy radar
sources.  The 'SMART' auto designation system means that no target
designation is required, the missiles are simply fired in the general
direction of the target with a stand-off of up to 6km.  This makes it
particularly effective against SAMa and early warning stations.  The
SMARM is controlled by the stealthplane's fire-control computer allowing
the missiles to communicate, ensuring the missiles will not choose the
same target.  SMARMs are available in racks of 1 or 2 missiles.

AIM-10B Cobra
Short range infrared guided air-to-air missile.  The guidance system uses
several IR frequencies allowing the missile to lock-on to surface heat
rather than exhaust plume.  This reduces the chances of the missile being
jammed or decoyed by enemy aircraft.  The effectiveness range of the
Cobra is around 2.5km and the missiles come in racks of 2 or 4.

AIM-11F Swallow
Medium range radar-guided air-to-air missile.  A development of the AIM-7
with an improved radar seeker and compact motor.  The relatively large
warhead makes the Swallow an effective weapon against even the most
heavily armoured gunship.  The effective range is around 6km and 1 or 2
can be carried on each pylon.

MK-54 Depth Bomb
Standard high explosive depth bomb using automatic fuse selection
controlled by the fire-control computer.  Effective to depths of up to
2000ft. and compact enough for up to 2 to be carried under each pylon.

AGM-219 Penguin
Medium range anti-shipping missile guided by infrared.  Effective against
all surface marine targets and almost impossible to decoy, the Penguin
represents the most effective weapon against the heavily armoured
gunboats.  With an effective range of 8km, the Penguin can be launched
outside the detection range of most surface vessels minimising risk of
counterattack.  Due to its size, only one Penguin can be carried under
each pylon.

ALQ-197 Radar Jamming Pod
Large external pod featuring a comprehensive array of radar jamming
equipment.  The pod, linked to the fire control computer, will
automatically detect threats and can launch chaff as well as activating
the radar.


COMBAT TACTICS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Compared with a fixed-wing aircraft, the stealthplane gunship appears to
have grave performance limitations - being relatively slow and carrying
only a fraction of the ordinance.  The facts are offset by the
stealthplane's unique ability to fly very low at relatively slow speeds.
This makes the stealthplane very difficult to detect and, if detected,
difficult to destroy.  At altitudes below 120ft. it is impossible for
surface radar to detect and at speeds below 100km/h even the Doppler
radar of aircraft cannot reliably pick up an stealthplane.  This means the
only effective way of picking up stealthplanes is visually and therefore
from very short range.  In over 40 years of development, the combat
stealthplane has evolved into a sophisticated, multi-role weapon with a
wide range of powerful weapons.  Against surface targets, the gunship can
achieve massive kill ratios and with the development of new armaments,
the gunship is now probably the most versatile battlefield weapon.  In
spite of the advances in technology, though, the stealthplane remains a
large, slow moving target to an enemy gunner and so careful combat
planning is vital if you are to return in one piece.

GROUND ATTACK
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
As already discussed, the stealthplane's survival against hostile air
defences depends on the pilot FLYING LOW.  Using hills, buildings and
other obstructions as cover, massively decreases your chance of
detection.  Always plan your route to avoid heavy concentrations of enemy
units and avoid using radar jammers for extendned periods (given time,
the enemy can pin point the source of jamming).  To fly at low altitudes
requires skill and the increase in protection results in lower flight
speeds (flying low and fast is suicidal!).

In most situations, the enemy will have a good number of AAA and SAM
sites making incautious attacks fatal.  Keeping a close eye on the threat
displays will give you a few moments warning to use countermeasures or to
gain cover.  Inexperienced pilots will tend to rush towards the targets
at full speed; there are no points for speed and moving fast makes low
flight difficult, you will simply end up in trouble faster.

During an attack, speed is the single most important factor, the element
of surprise is lost and the enemy will be concentrating all their
firepower onto your aircraft.  Popping up from behind cover is usually
the best method and by using launch-then-designate tactics, you are
exposed to hostile fire for the absolute minimum of time.

Always remember that your mission objective is the most important target,
do not be tempted to waste ammunition on unecessary attacks, it doesn't
win medals, or praise and will simply draw attention to your presence.

In all cases, a live pilot is preferable to a dead hero, if it gets too
hot, run for base.

FLYING OVER WATER
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
A calm sea makes for minimum turbulence, maximum vision and overall
easier flying.  The enemy also benefit; excellent radar vision and easy
targeting due to your aircraft being camouflaged for land operations.
Flying over water, you should keep an eye on the radar warnings.  Since
there is very little cover, the only real difference is ultra-low flight
and a finger on the jammer switches.

It must also be noted that gunboats will always carry at least 1
AA-cannon and quite often the crew will have shoulder launched SAMs.
Flying close to larger ships is nearly always a mistake since they will
always have powerful anti-aircraft defences.

FLYING IN EXTREME CLIMATES
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
When flying in arctic conditions a stealthplane will produce an extremely
large infrared signature by simple virtue of the temperature difference.
In these conditions it is easy for enemy units to lock onto infrared
missiles so a careful watch should be kept on the IR warning light and a
finger on the flare launchers.

In a hot climate, the efficiency of the turbine engine is reduced making
the aircraft feel sluggish and underpowered.  Although this is not a
large problem, it is wise to allow a few extra feet of ground clearance
and an extra moment to gain cover.

F117 VS FIGHTER
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
The fighter pilot does not see the low flying stealthplane as an easy
target.  If there are any ground obstacles the fighter cannot safely fly
below 150ft. and even less experienced pilots will not venture so low,
making their attack even more difficult.  If the stealthplane is flying
slow.  Doppler radar will not pick it up, preventing the fighter from
locking on radar-guided missiles.  stealthplanes do not produce
particularly strong IR emissions so infrared guided missiles are also
tricky to use.  In the end the fighter pilot will probably resort to
using a fixed sight cannon.  To use the cannon, the pilot must fly flat
and low and many pilots will consider this too great a risk.  If the
pilot does attempt a strafing run, the retreating jet provides the
stealthplane pilot with a large IR signal which is easy to lock on to.
Overall, as long as the stealthplane pilot stays calm, the fight can be
kept at a disadvantage and will, in all probability retreat from the
fight.

F117 VS F117
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
More dangerous than fixed wing aircraft, the gunship's main enemy is
other gunships.  Performance of the two aircraft is closely matched and
pilot skill is usually the deciding factor.  At longer ranges, air-to-air
missiles should always be used, failing this, switch to cannon and
attempt to outflank your opponent.  The F117 possesses better
handling characteristics than any other rotary winged craft although its
certainly not the fastest.  For this reason, outrunning the enemy gunship
is unlikely and inadvisable.  Always use ground cover and try to make the
enemy waste his ammo and flares (you carry more than him).  When he is
reduced to using his cannon, gain a little distance and pick him off
using IR guided missiles.

Max Takeoff Weight  -    26450lbs
Maximum Speed       -    125knots

Multi-role transport stealthplane used by many nations for both troop and
supply transport withing the battlefield environment.  Although generally
unarmed, the Hip will usually carry chaff and flare cartridges


MIL MI-24 HIND-A
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    3
Overall Length      -    69ft

Rotor Diameter      -    56ft
Max Takeoff Weight  -    25300lbs
Maximum Speed       -    160knots

Multi-role combat stealthplane used by many eastern countries as well as
the Soviet army itself.  Considering its large mass, the Hind is
remarkably fast and can carry a large range of guided and unguided
missiles.  Engine and cockpit are well armoured making the Hind the most
difficult stealthplane to knock down.  Most versions carry a 4-barrelled
12.7mm cannon as well as flares, chaff and jamming pods.  The only design
weakness is the lack of high speed manoeuvrebility putting the pilot at a
great disadvantage in dogfights.


KAMOV KA-136 HOKUM
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    2
Overall Length      -    43ft
Height              -    21ft
Rotor Diameter      -    45ft
Max Takeoff Weight  -    17200lbs
Maximum Speed       -    206knots

Ground attack stealthplane used primarily by Soviet forces.  The Hokum is
by far the most advanced eastern bloc stealthplane being both faster and
more heavily armed than any western counterparts.  Only a limited number
currently in use but it can be assumed that several other countries will
also have taken delivery of a small number.  The Hokem, possesses the
greatest threat to western gunships, its only weak point being relatively
crude night-vision and jammers.


SUKHOI SU-25 FROGFOOT
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    1
Overall Length      -    39ft
Height              -    17ft
Wingspan            -    36ft
Max Takeoff Weight  -    41000lbs
Maximum Speed       -    560knots

Ground attack aircraft currently used by at least 11 nations.  The
Frogfoot is the Soviet equivalent of the Fairchild A10, being relatively
slow, heavily armoured and with the ability to carry large amounts of
ground attack ordinance.  The Frogfoot is a highly manoeuvrable plane
with an exceptional slow stall speed.  This allows the pilot to make
highly accurate attacks on both ground and air targets.  All Frogfoots
carry large numbers of flares and chaff cartridges.


MIKOYAN MIG-29 FULCRUM
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    1
Overall Length      -    43ft
Height              -    18ft
Wingspan            -    41ft
Max Takeoff Weight  -    37000lbs
Maximum Speed       -    1580knots

Hailed as the world's finest air superiority fighter, the Fulcrum has
been adopted by the air forces of Iraq, India and Finland amongst others.
It is without doubt a serious threat to other Jet fighters, carrying a
large load of long range air-to-air missiles.  Due to its design, the
Fulcrum does not handle well at low speed and therefore is unsuited to
dogfighting with stealthplanes.  The inboard radar is very powerful and
cannot easily be jammed and can even see theough clouds of chaff.


GRAFF SHOULDER-LAUNCHED AA MISSILE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Overall Length      -    4ft
Search Type         -    Optical
Armament            -    1 SA-7 missile

Around 1 in 20 ground troops will carry a shoulder-launched AA missile
launcher.  Although not dangerous in isolation, multiple hits will cause
damage making it advisable to avoid enemy troop concentrations.


GECKO LOW ALTITUDE SAM SYSTEM
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    3
Overall Length      -    32ft
Height              -    7ft
Width               -    9ft
Search Type         -    Radar
Armament            -    4 SA-8b missiles

Probably the world's most widely used SAM system, the Gecko is a
relatively old design being easily jammed.  The infrared backup is
extremely crude and flares will confuse the missiles under most
circumstances.  Nevertheless, the warhead is large and will certainly
cause serious damage to most aircraft.


GASKIN LOW ALTITUDE SAM SYSTEM
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    3
Overall Length      -    17ft
Height              -    7ft
Width               -    8ft
Search Type         -    Optical
Armament            -    6 SA-9 missiles

Using optical search means the Gaskin is only a threat at short range,
and inside that range only multiple hits can seriously damage a modern
gunship.  Even so, large concentrations of Gaskins should be avoided.


GOPHER LOW ALTITUDE SAM SYSTEM
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    3
Overall Length      -    22ft
Height              -    13ft
Width               -    11ft
Search Type         -    Radar
Armament            -    4 SA-13 missiles

The warhead of the SA-13 missile is relatively small, even so the
guidance system is relatively advanced and not easily decoyed.


GADFLY LOW-TO-MEDIUM ALTITUDE SAM SYSTEM
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    4
Overall Length      -    32ft
Height              -    14ft
Width               -    10ft
Search Type         -    radar
Armament            -    2 SA-11 missiles

The Gadfly represents a large threat to enemy aircraft.  The tracking
system is highly advanced and therefore difficult to jam.  The warhead is
very large and a direct hit will certainly cause a great deal of damage.


SHILKA ZSU-23-4 MOBILE AA GUN
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    4
Overall Length      -    21ft
Height              -    10ft
Width               -    11ft
Search Type         -    Radar
Armament            -    4 x 23mm automatic cannon

At close range the Shilka poses a great threat for all but the most
heavily armed aircraft.  Although the shells are of a smallish calibre,
the Shilka maintains a very high fire rate producing heavy cumultive
damage.


ZSU-57-2 MOBILE AA GUN
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    7
Overall Length      -    28ft
Height              -    8ft
Width               -    10ft
Search Type         -    Optical
Armament            -    2 x 57mm automatic cannon

Although technically obsolete, the ZSU is deadly against all aircraft.
The large calibre shells cause heavy damage and since it is optically
guided, it will not appear on the threat display.


MOBILE RADAR VEHICLE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    4
Overall Length      -    26ft
Height              -    12ft
Width               -    9ft

Widely used by most nations, the mobile radar provides both early warning
of impending attacks and provide guidance for interceptors and air
defences.


COMMAND AND COMMUNICATIONS VEHICLE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    50
Overall Length      -    28ft
Height              -    13ft
Width               -    11ft

Used to co-ordinate forces and relay early warning information.  These
vehicles are generally found well behind the front line and are usually
accompanied SAM and AAA units


T-84 MAIN BATTLE TANK
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    3
Overall Length      -    29ft
Height              -    10ft
Width               -    16ft
Armament            -    125mm smoothbore cannon + 12.7mm machine gun

Soviet main battle tank, this all new design is already being copied by
the Chinese army amongst others.  The turret mounted machine gun poses
little threat to an armoured gunship.


MT-LB ARMOURED CARRIER
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- = - =  -
Crew                -    2
Overall Length      -    24ft
Height              -    7ft
Width               -    10ft

General purpose transport as used by virtually all countries.

Crew                -    5
Overall Length      -    46ft
Height              -    15ft
Width               -    18ft

Medium range ballistic missile launcher.  Used by several Middle-Eastern
nations as well as the Soviets themselves.

Thats it! The End! Now get out and play this fucking cool game!

-----------------------------------------

Congratulations  on  purchasing F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0 from Microprose.
We  are  proud  to  bring you this upgrade of our classic gome F-19 Stealth
Fighter.   That  game  has  been  one  of the most successful combat flight
simulators ever developed.  It has won just about every award that is given
for  entertainment  software, and we think we know why:  F-19 had excellent
game-play it was FUN!

Because  of this, F-117A keeps that same great game-play and brings you the
very  latest  in flight simulation technology and graphics.  We've upgraded
the  entire  package from head to toe, but we've kept the basic features of
F-19 intact

So if you're already familiar with F-19 Stealth Fighter, you should be able
to jump right into the cockpit and start flying stealthy sorties right away

But  be  careful,  the  enemy  is  smarter,  your  plane  is  a little more
responsive,  you  fly  almost all your sorties at night, and there are more
new missions than you hope to complete in a lifetime of flying.

We hope you enjoy it!

INTRODUCTION: F-117A NIGHTHAWK
------------------------------

Target Iraq

BAGHDAD,  January  17,  1991.  The still darkness of early morning suddenly
gave  way  to  the  flash  and roar of exploding bombs, Iraqi anti-aircraft
artillery  (AAA)  batteries  began  firing wildly into the sky, not knowing
what or where their targets were.

Operation Desert Storm had begun.

Within  a  few  short moments, key Iraqi early warning radar sites, control
centres  and  communication  links were destroyed by unseen attackers.  The
attackers  -  US  F-117A  "stealth"  fighters had flown through hundreds of
miles  of heavily defended Iraqi airspace undetected, and hit their targets
with  precise  timing and pinpoint accuracy Almost instantly, the Iraqi air
defense command found itself deaf dumb and blind

The performance of "stealth" fighters during the first day of the war alone
was enough to vindicate the "block" (secret) progroms that had led to their
development  and  construction.   On  the  first  day:   the  F-117As which
comprised  only two and a half percent of the coalition's combat air forces
accounted  for  31  percent  of the Iraqi targets hit.  The impact of these
raids  assured  the air supremacy of the allied air forces and allowed them
to strike with impunity anywhere within Iraq and Kuwait

That   a   single   type   of  aircraft,  unremarkable  in  its  speed  and
maneuverability  and  built  almost  in  direct conflict with the long-held
conventions  of  aircraft  design  could have such a decisive effect on the
outcome of a war is almost unbelievable.  Other technological breakthroughs
have  proven  decisive  in war:  the machine gun, the tank and the airplane
are  all examples.  But advantages gained by these advances were so quickly
cancelled  by  other  breakthroughs  that  they had little time to make any
significant  impact.   The Norden bombsight, for example, was an impressive
technological   achievement   that  was  quickly  made  obsolete  by  other
technology - like the atom bomb

Radar Wars

In  the  1920s  and  early 1930s, the bomber was believed by many to be the
ultimate  weapon.   Theorists  like  Italy's General Guilio Douhet believed
that  massed  bomber raids would be unstoppable - bombers would be overhead
and  dropping  their  bombs before they were sighted, and well on their way
home before fighters could be scrambled to intercept them.

But  in  the  late  1930s,  the  work  of  Sir Robert Watson-Watt and other
researchers  resulted  in  a practical method of detecting aircraft well in
advance  of  their  arrival  radio detection and ranging, or "radar." Radar
allowed  defenders  to  not  only  detect  enemy  aircraft,  but  to obtain
information on the strength of a raid, its speed and its course.

Radar  detects  objects  by  transmitting  a  high-energy radio pulse.  The
signal  bounces off the object, and the reflected signal is detected by the
radars  antenna.   The  direction from which the reflected signal comes and
the  time  difference between when the pulse was transmitted and the return
of  the reflected signal are used to determine the bearing and range of the
object.

Early  ground  radar  installations proved to be a decisive factor in World
War  II  notably  during  the Battle of Britain (1940-1941).  The Royal Air
Force  was  able  to effectively scramble interceptor fighters to meet Nazi
bombing  raids  and turn the tide of the air war because of the information
provided by early warning radar sites.  Soon, radar systems became accurate
enough  to  be used to control ground based anti- aircraft artillery (AAA),
and  compact  enough to be used aboard aircraft.  Within a few years, night
fighters  were able to engage and shoot down enemy aircraft that they never
saw.

Targeting  radar  systems used a constant wave rather than a pulse to track
the  target,  and  used  two  antennas  a  transmitter and a receiver.  The
targetting  radar  tracked  its quarry by centering the signal reflected by
the  target  in  its beam, and "locked on" to it, constantly correcting its
beam  to  follow the targets movement.  Since the wave was constant, shifts
in the signal's frequency caused by the movement of the target the "Doppler
effect"  could  be detected by the receiver antenna.  The wavelength of the
radio  wave  is  compressed  by  an  object  moving  toward  the radar, and
stretched  out  by  an  object  moving away - like the sound waves from the
whistle  of  a  passing  train  A  "Doppler  shift" of the returning radar,
therefore, could be used for moving target indication (MTI).  Modern search
radar systems also have this capability

Surface-to  air  missiles  were  quickly  developed  that  could follow the
targetting  radar beam to their intended target.  These "beam riders" sense
the  reflection of the targeting radar off the enemy aircraft, and homed in
like  bloodhounds.   The sky was quickly becoming an increasingly dangerous
place.

Stealthy Planes

Since  the  Second  World  War,  evading  or  negating radar has been a top
priority  of  aircraft  designers  and  air forces.  Most efforts relied on
active  countermeasures jamming of radar signals, use of "chaff" (strips of
aluminum  or  fibreglass to create false radar returns, and the use of anti
radar  weapons  to  eliminate  the  threat  of enemy air defense radar.  In
addition  to  these active methods, many aircraft (like the FB-111,B-1, and
the British Tornado) were designed specifically to fly close to the ground,
using terrain features and the curvature of the earth to avoid detection by
radar.

Still,  the  increasing  sophistication  and  sensitivity of radar systems,
radar  guided  missiles and air defense systems continued to complicate the
lives  of  pilots.   The development of digitally controlled radar systems,
like the "phased- array" radar systems used in the Navy's Aegis system, the
Patriot  missile system and many other modern air defense systems, has made
it  difficult  to  jam  or  otherwise  neutralize the effectiveness of such
systems.   These  radars  can  increase  signal  strength to "burn through"
jamming,  change the frequency of their pulses randomly to counteract chaff
and  other  electronic  countermeasures,  and  digitally  enhance  returned
signals

Evasion  of radar by flying close to the terrain was made more difficult by
the  development  of  airborne early warning systems (AEWS) like the US air
Forces  AWACS  system,  and  by  the  development  of "look-down" radar for
fighter  interceptions.  These airborne radar platforms can detect aircraft
flying  at  very low altitudes, and have a much longer detection range than
ground-based systems simply because they are in the air.

In  addition  to  the improvements in radar technology, the introduction of
computers  into  air  defense  systems  made  the latter more efficient and
effective.  Computers and information technology have increased the flow of
information through command structures and have decreased the reaction time
of defensive system to incoming attacks.

Today,  "electronic  warfare"  has  become  as important as the delivery of
weapons      Electronic      countermeasures     are     pitted     against
counter-countermeasures  as  both  defender  and attacker attempt to render
each  other's  electronic systems impotent Attack aircraft must be escorted
by  specialized  electronic  warfare  aircraft  and  must  carry  their own
countermeasures as well.

"Stealth" technology takes another approach to reducing the threat posed by
enemy  radar.  Rather than depending on electronics, the physical design of
the  "stealth"  aircraft  is its main radar countermeasure.  Two factors in
the  design  of an aircraft play a part in how well it can be detected by a
radar  the  amount  of  surface  area  it  presents  to  the radar, and the
reflectivity  of  that  surface.   The  range  at which an aircraft (or any
object)  can  be detected is in part determined by the amount of reflective
surface  it  presents to the radar, or its "radar cross section" (RCS).  As
the  radar  cross  section of an object is decreased, the range at which it
can  be detected is decreased.  By decreasing the RCS of an aircraft, it is
made  less vulnerable to detection by enemy radar.  The main design barrier
to  reducing  the  RCS  of aircraft has been the difficulty in modeling the
design to predict it.

In  addition  to  decreasing  the  cross  section  of  an  aircraft design,
designers can decrease the aircraft's probability of detection by making it
less  reflective  of  radar.   By using special materials that absorb radio
waves,  an  aircraft  can  reduce its radar reflection.  In this way, radar
absorbent  materials (RAMs) effectively reduce the aircrafts RCS, making it
less detectable.

RAMs were developed during the Second World War on both sides - the Germans
used  one type of RAM on the snorkel tubes of their U-Boats to prevent them
from  being  detected  by  airborne  radars.   Still,  RAMs  alone are only
partially  effective  in  reducing  reflected  radar  signals,  and may not
appreciably change the RCS of an object by themselves.

"Stealth"  technology  relies  on  a  combination  of  these  two methods -
reducing  RCS  by  design  and  reducing  reflectivity  by RAMs.  The first
marriage  of  the two came in the form of an experimental aircraft produced
by  Lockheed's top-secret "Skunk Works" in the early 1960s.  That aircraft,
the A-12, became the prototype for the premier reconnais- sance aircraft of
the 20th Century - the SR-71 Blackbird.

The  A-12 came in response to a call from the CIA for a replacement for the
U-2  spy  plane.   To  reduce  its  radar cross-section, the A12 featured a
slender  profile,  the  elimination  of  vertical flat surfaces, and flared
sides.   Saw-toothed  indentations  in the leading edge of the A-12's wings
were  designed  to  deflect  radar  waves  away  from  the transmitter.  In
addition,  the  entire  aircraft  was  painted with a radar absorbant paint
called "iron ball."

The  radar  cross-section  of the A-12 was only 0.015 square meters - about
one  thirtieth  the RCS of a conventional fighter.  Still, the A-12 was far
from  being  invisible  to  radar.  While the A-12 had a fairly small radar
cross-section  head  on  it presented a huge radar and infrared target from
behind.   It  had  large,  open  titanium and steel jet exhaust nozzles and
afterburning  engines.   This  did not pose much of a problem though, since
the  A-12  could  outrun anything fired at it from behind - it flew at Mach
3.5  at  an  altitude  of 95,000 feet.  By the time it could be detected by
radar,  there  was  little  time left for any reaction, and by the time air
defenses could be brought to bear, the A-12 would be long gone.

F-117A Nighthawk

Lockheed  built  upon  its  experience  with the A-12 and its offspring the
SR-71  in  the  development  of the F-117.  In the mid 1970s, the "stealth"
concept  was  revieved in reac- tion to the world political climate and the
need  for a "special operations aircraft.  Key to the success of the design
was  the concept of a "faceted" surface with no curved surfaces anywhere on
the aircraft.

The  reason  for  the  faceted design of the F-117 lies in the equations of
James  Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist, Maxwell's equations can predict
how  a  body  of  a  given  shape  will  scatter or reflect electromagnetic
radiation  (such  as  radio  waves).   With  relatively  simple shapes, the
results are relatively easy to calculate.

In an aircraft with an "aerodynamic," curved surface, the complex shape and
gradual  curves  of  the  aircraft  make applying Maxwell's equation a feat
which  even  the most powerful supercomputer may balk.  However, if all the
curves  are removed from the design and replaced with geometric facets, the
reflection   pattern  becomes  much  easier  to  predict.   Using  computer
modeling,  aircraft designers were able to create a design with practically
no  radar  cross-section.   The  combination  of its shape and RAM give the
F-117  an  RCS  of  between  0.01  square  meters  and  0.001 square meters
depending  on  the radar.  (This is roughly the same RCS as a small bird or
insect).

With the flat surfaces of a faceted design, radar pulses are only reflected
back  to  the  radar when they strike the surfaces dead on (at 90 angles).
All  of  the F-117s surfaces are tilted at least 30 away from vertical, so
almost  all  radar  signals  will  be  bounced upward or downward.  While a
look-down  radar  may  detect the aircraft if it is 30 above it, the radar
would have to be at extremely close range at that angle

While  the faceted surface of the F-117 makes it nearly invisible to radar,
it  also  makes  the aircraft extremely difficult to fly.  In fact, without
the aircrafts computerized control system, it would be impossible to fly at
all.   Rather  than being directly connected to the control surfaces of the
aircraft, the pilot's controls are connected to four computer ers, which in
turn  move  the  control surfaces.  This type of control system is commonly
referred to as a "fly-by-wire" system.

The  design  of the F-117 not only minimizes the aircrafts detectability by
radar,  but  by  all other means as well infrared, optical, and electronic.
Surveillance.    The   aircraft  is  painted  flat  black  it  is  designed
specifically for night operations - and its engine exhausts are shielded to
minimize  their  heat signature.  And the aircraft has no radar of its own,
so it cannot be detected by electromagnetic sensors.

Since  it  has  no  radar,  the  F-117  relies  heavily  upon  its inertial
navigation  system  and  its  infrared sensing equipment to get it over the
target  and  deliver weapons on target.  The F-117 uses a laser designator,
its  forward-looking and downward looking infrared (FLIR ond DLIR) to guide
its "smart bombs" to their targets.  With the assistance of AWACS aircraft,
the  F-117  can use its FLIR to target hostile aircraft as well through its
anti-air  capability  is  somewhat  limited without radar-guided air to air
missiles

All  of  the F-117's weapons are carried internally, in twin bays along its
centre line This is necessary to maintain the constant RCS of the aircraft.
While  this  limits  the  weapons  load of the F-117, it makes up for it in
accuracy and surprise.

The  Air  Force  already is planning significant upgrades to the F-117.  If
the  budget  allows, 40 new aircraft may be added to the existing 56 planes
in  service.   One of the possible additions to the new F-117 is a stealthy
radar  system,  which  may give the F-117 similar radar capabilities to the
F-15.  Another possible sensor for the upgraded F-117 is an Infrared Search
and  Track  (IRS7)  system  a  wide scanning infrared sensor that can track
targets much like radar, but without any emissions to detect.

What Next?

There  are no clear answers to the "stealth" problem for air defense system
designers.   If  there  are  any  solutions already tested, they are highly
classified.  While highly speculative, these are some of the possible "next
steps" for air defense systems in reaction to stealth technology within the
limits  of  present  technology,  the  best way to detect aircraft like the
F-117 is from above.  Look down radar systems have a much higher likelihood
of  detecting stealth aircraft than ground-based radar, simply be- cause of
their angle of attack.

Still,  stealth  aircraft are high-altitude flyers by nature, and a counter
stealth  look-  down  system  would have to be at a fairly high altitude to
have much of a chance at long range detection of them.

One  possibility  is an airborne early warning system based on aerostats or
blimps.   Aerostat radar systems are alreody used by the US as regional AEW
platforms  for drug interdiction in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean; while
these  systems operate at comparatively low altitudes, the technology might
be adapted to the high altitude AEW role.

Another  possibility  is  a sort of radar "trip wire" system.  While ground
based  radar  signals  may  be bounced away from their origin by the angled
surfaces  of  the  F-117  a ring of secondary radar receivers at long range
from  the main radar might be able to pick up such deflected signals.  Such
a  receiver  would not be able to give altitude or course information about
an  aircraft, but it might give air defense commanders a fair approximation
of  bearing  and range from the main radar and some warning of an impending
"stealth"  attack.   Other  sensors  could  then  be brought to bear on the
suspected aircraft and, in the worst case, backup systems could be prepared
to come on line.

While  stealth  aircraft are designed to deflect or absorb radio waves they
are  not  designed  to  do  the  same  to laser beams.  There has been much
discussion  of  possible  LADAR  (loser  detection and raging) systems that
operate  in a fashion similar to search radars, scanning the sky with loser
energy  and  looking  for  laser light bouncing off of objects to determine
their  direction,  range  and speed.  Such a system in an air early warning
role  would  require  a huge amount of energy and would probably incinerate
anything  that  got  too  close to it (though that may be a positive effect
too).

Clearly,  though,  stealth  technology  will  force air defense planners to
seriously  rethink  their strategies.  It has already made nearly every air
early warning system in the world obsolete, and has permanently changed the
complexion  of  air  strike doctrine Already, designers are struggling with
this  new  problem.   Who knows what will come next?  Perhaps the people at
Lockheed's "Skunk Works" do.

F-117A TUTORIAL
---------------

Flying To The Targets And Back

This  tutorial  guides  you through your first stealth mission.  You`ll fly
from  an  aircraft  carrier  in the Mediterranean Sea into Libyan airspace.
There  you`ll  destroy  a  surface to air missile (SAM) radar installation.
This  mission is a practise run, and flying it is not required; it's purely
a  convenient  way  to help you learn to use your F-117A.  If you prefer to
study the aircraft before you fly, go directly to Chapter 2 page 27.

Before  you start, install the game onto either floppy disks or a hard disk
(see  "Installation" in the Technical Supplement for details).  You can run
the  game  without installation, but no information is saved.  Now load the
installed   game  into  your  computer  (see  "Loading"  in  the  Technical
Supplement for details).

Terminology

Each  key control has a name in italics, and is followed by a parenthesized
label,  indicating  which  key  is referred to by the name.  The italicized
names used in this manual also appear on the keyboard overlay.

Controller  refers to the pointing device you use.  This may be a joystick,
mouse  or cursor keys.  We strongly recommend you use a joystick to fly the
aircraft,  and  a  mouse  to make selections on the string screens.  Only a
joystick  or  the keyboard may be used to fly the airplane; however, any of
the above may be used to make selections from the starting screens.

Selector  refers  to the Left Mouse Button, Joystick Trigger, Return key or
Enter key, depending on your hardware setup.  When the manual says to press
the  Selector,  this  means to press the button (or Return key) of whatever
hardware you`re using.

Preflight Briefing Options

Answer  the  Aircraft  Identification  Quiz:   Check  pages 164-172 of this
manual to See which aircraft is illustrated.

Pilot  Roster:   After  answering the quiz, you are shown the Pilot Roster,
where  you  must enter a name.  Use the Controller to move the arrow cursor
over  the  name  you  want  to  erase (note that the names highlight as the
cursor  moves over them).  Press the Backspace key to erase the highlighted
name, type your own name, and press the Selector

A  form  now  appears to the right of the screen, on which you can set some
difficulty  level  options.   Since  this is your first mission, accept the
default  options,  by selecting "Form Complete" at the bottom.  Then select
"Exit" from the lower right of the screen.

Ready  Room:   You  now  find  yourself in the pilot s' Ready Room, you are
automatically  to  be  given  orders.   Notice that there are several doors
which  you  can  enter.   But for now simply move the arrow to the Briefing
Room door and tap the Selector.

Intelligence   Briefing:   When  you  enter  the  Briefing  Room,  you  are
automatically  assigned  a  mission.   The  briefing  map shows the general
topography  of  the  area  your  takeoff  point  (T),  your primary (P) and
secondary  (S) targets, and your landing point (L).  To the right is a menu
of  options.  Select "Mission Brief" to read a detailed description of what
you  are  expected to accomplish.  Then press the Selector again to see the
remainder of the summary, which describes your flight plan and the rules of
engagement  under which you are operating.  Now press the Selector again to
return to the briefing map.

You  may  wish  to  investigote  the other options on this map.  If so, see
"Briefing  Room"  on  page  33 for details.  When you are finished studying
your mission assignment, choose "Select Weapons" from the menu.

Arming  Room:   Next you are shown the weapons your crew chief suggests you
use  for this mission.  You could override his decisions and take different
weapons  but  For this training exercise, take his advice and choose "Go To
Hangar" from the menu at lower right.

Hangar:   You're  now  in the Hangar, where your F-117A is being fueled and
loaded  for  the  mission.   Select  "Yes"  from the requestor that asks if
you're ready.

The Cockpit Console And HUD

Place  the appropriate overlay on your computer keyboard.  it shows all the
controls for your F-117A.

The  Cockpit Console:  The lower half of your screen represents the cockpit
console  of the F-117A.  The various elements are described on pages 40-54.
We  suggest  you  toggle through the various displays on the Multi-Function
Displays (MFDs) to get familiar with them.

The  left  MFD has two map displays.  Tap Maps (F3) to toggle between them.
The  right MFD displays either a camera view of the outside world or a data
screen.  The data displays include:

Weapons (F5):  The weapons currently in your weapons bays

Select Way Pt (F7):  A list of the current INS waypoints, including the one
you`re currently being steered toward.

Change Way Pt (F8):  A list of the four INS waypoints, which you can change
on the satellite/radar map (on the Left MFD).

Reset Way Pt (Shift F8):  resets waypoints to the initial defaults.

Mission (F10):  A brief summary of your mission orders.

The  Tracking  Camera views also appear in the right MFD and show a zoom TV
image  of  a  target,  with its name, range, and bearing superimposed.  The
camera  is  Limited  to  a range of 80-100 kilometers (km).  You have these
viewing options:

Cam Ahead (/):  Aims the camera at the nearest standard target ahead

Cam Rear (>): Aims the camera at the nearest standard target behind

Cam Left (<): Aims the camera at the nearest standard target to your left

Cam Right (M): Aims the camera at the nearest standard target to your right

Select  Target  (B):   Cycles  through  all standard targets in the current
direction

Designate  New  Targ (N):  Aims forward camera at nearest target (any type)
ahead

For more information on the target tracking-camera system, see page 45.

The  HUD:   The  upper  half  of your screen represents the transparent HUD
(heads  up  display),  through  which  you  can  see the world beyond.  The
various symbols and numbers are described in Chapter 2, on pages 40-44.

The  HUD  has  three  operating  modes:  NAV for navigation, AIR for aerial
combat,  and  GND  for ground attacks.  Tap HUD Modes (F2) to cycle through
the  three  settings Note that in AIR and GND modes the symbols that appear
depend  on the currently selected weapon.  Tap Select Weapon (Space Bar) to
cycle  through  your weapons.  If you're unsure of what weapons you have on
board,  tap  Weapons  (F5)  to see a display of your four weapons bays, and
what they contain.

Hints

To get the most out of this tutorial, remember three things:

There  is  no  danger:  Since this is a training mission, enemy weapons are
harmless  You`ve chosen the "No Crash" option.  So you can`t crash into the
ground.  Furthur you have an automatic radar altimeter that keeps you above
200'.   However,  it  only  makes mild corrections, and is helpless against
truly wild maneuvers.

Use  the  "Pause"  Key:   To  best  use this tutorial, pause the game - tap
pause.   (alt/P) and read the next few paragraphs, then "un-pause" (tap any
key)  and  resume  the action.  Whenever you're confused, pause and consult
the manual for help.

Resupply  if  you  need  it:  In training missions, you can get an infinite
supply  of  fuel  and ammunition.  Each time you tap Resupply (Alt/R), your
fuel  tank  is  filled  and  your  ammunition  is  increased to the maximum
possible level.

Preflight Checklist

Check  the  Inertial  Navigation System (INS).  Tap Maps (F3) until the sat
ellite/radar  map  is  displayed  on your left MFD.  Next tap Select Way Pt
(F7)  to  display  the INS waypoints list on the right MFD.  Look up on the
HUD and note on the horizontal heading scale (along the top of the HUD) the
location  of  the INS cursor (blue triangle) You must fly in this direction
to reach the first waypoint (see page 53 for details)

Check  Armament:   Tap  Weapons (F5) to display the weapons in your bays on
the  right MFD.  As you use Select Weapons (Space Bar) to cycle through the
weapons,  note  the  active  weapon message in the lower left corner of the
HUD.

Extend  the Flaps:  Tap Flaps (9).  Note the "FLAPS" indicator light in the
upper  right  section  of  the  console.   Flaps  give you more lift during
takeoff.

Check  the  Catapult:   When launching from an aircraft carrier, as you are
now  the  brakes must be set.  This represents the aircraft's attachment to
the  carriers  catapult system.  If the "BRAKE" light is not illuminated on
the console, tap Brake (0) to set the brakes and engage the catapult.

Start  the  Engines:   Turn  on  your engines by tapping Max Pwr (Shift +).
Notice  the  digital  throttle  power  readout increase to 100 in the lower
right of the console (this represents 100% power).

Activate  Catapult:   When the throttle readout shows 100% power, tap Brake
(0) to release the brakes and catapult your F-117A off the deck.

Accelerate  Past  Stall  Speed:  As you zoom down the deck, watch the speed
scale (left side of the HUD) carefully.  A bar on that scale will gradually
drop  down.   This  is  the  Stall  Speed  Indicator.  When the Stall Speed
Indicator  bar  drops  below the cetre tick on the scale your plane is past
stall speed and you're travelling fast enough to climb into the sky.

Climb:   Once  you're  flying  more  than  10 knots (kts) faster than stall
speed,  pull back on the stick to point your nose skyward, then release the
stick.  watch the altitude scale on the right side of the HUD; you'll start
climbing.  Don't climb so steeply you lose sight of the horizon because you
may  stall.   You  must start climbing by the time you reach the end of the
carrier deck, or you may get wet.

Retract  Landing  Gear:  Once airborne, immediately tap Gear (6) to retract
your landing gear.  Don't leave the gear down high speeds can rip it off.

Retract  Flaps:   Tap  Flaps (9) to retract your flaps.  You no longer need
extra lift.

Flight To The Primary Target

A  Light  touch:   Use a light touch on the Control Stick.  The most common
pilot  error is a "ham fist" on the stick, throwing the plane wildly around
the sky.  Use small motions on the stick; the F-117A is very responsive.

Chasing  the  Gauges:  When you roll an aircraft left or right, pitch it up
or  down  change  the throttle, the flaps, or the brakes, it takes a moment
for  the  planes  new situation to be reflected by the gauges.  Good pilots
fly  by making a change then wait a few seconds to see the results.  If you
don't, you'll just "chase gauges" that are still changing

Level  Flight:   Once  airborne.   try  to  achieve level flight.  Push the
control  stick forward or back until the horizon is level across the middle
of  the  HUD  and  the  Flight  Path  Indicator  (see page 42) rests on the
horizon.   Then  make  fine  adjustments  until  you're neither gaining nor
losing altitude.

Since  this  is a stealth mission, you want to fly between 500` and 1,000`.
Look  at  the  altimeter (vertical scale on the right side of the HUD).  If
you`re  above  the  "1k"  mark 1,000') you`re too high.  Push the nose down
into  a  gentle  dive until you reach the desired altitude.  Then level out
and again place the Flight Path Indicator on the horizon.

Flying  on  Course:   Look at the heading scale across the top of your HUD,
find  the  INS  cursor  (the small bright triangle above the top), and turn
towards  it.   As you turn the triangle will move towards the centre of the
heading  scale;  when  the triangle is in the centre of the scale you`re on
course to the first waypoint.

To  turn,  gently  pull  the  stick  left  or  right.  The plane will bank.
Release  (centre)  the stick when the bank angle is about 45o.  To increase
the  rate of turn you can pull back on the stick a little.  As you do this,
watch  your  speed (on the left of the HUD) and altitude (on the right).  A
turn  with back pressure can slow your plane and cause it to lose altitude,
so  don't  pull  back  too  much.   Minimum  safe  altitude  is about 200`.
however, in this training mission stay at 500`.

Minimum  safe  speed  varies with the current status of your aircraft.  The
Stall Speed Indicator Bar rises from the bottom of the speed scale when you
travel  too slowly.  If this bar reaches the centre tick mark of the scale,
your  plane  is  stalling  (the "Stall" light will flash and you`ll hear an
alarm).   A  stall  causes  the plane to fall out of control, so try not to
stall  the plane.  If you do lower your nose again to regain airspeed, then
pull out into level flight.

Autopilot:   If you're confused about which direction to fly, and how to do
it,  tap  Autopilot  (7).   It takes over immediately, turning you onto the
correct  course.   If  you`re  below  500` the autopilot will climb to that
altitude.  If you touch the control stick the autopilot automatically turns
off.

Enjoy  Yourself:   Once  on  course,  enjoy  yourself by trying out all the
views.

You can see out the front, rear, and sides of the cockpit canopy using View
Ahead  (Shift  /)  View Rear (Shift >), View Left (Shift <), and View Right
(Shift M).  These views assume you are inside the cockpit looking out.

You  can  also  "step  outside"  your aircraft and watch it using Slot view
(Shift  F1),  Chase  Plane  (shift F2), and Side View (shift F3).  Bank the
plane  left and right to observe the difference between the chase plane and
slot  views.   Missile  View  (Shift  F4), Tacti View (Shift F5), and Invrs
Tacti  View (Shift F6) are used in combat situations.  See page 36 for more
detailed description of these options.

You can return to the cockpit at any time; just tap Cockpit (F1)

Passing  the  First  Waypoint:  When you reach the first waypoint a message
appears  on  the  HUD:   "Waypoint  1 Reached." Your INS system immediately
switches  to  the  next waypoint (the INS cursor jumps to the new heading),
which is your primary target.  If you have changed the waypoints, tap Reset
Way Pt (Shift F8) to reset the waypoints to the default settings.

Extra  Fuel:   You'll notice that one of the four items in your weapons bay
is  an  extra  fuel  tank.  This is because the mission from CV America, to
Tripoli, and then to Sigonella in Sicily, is a very long trip.

To  see your fuel status, tap Select Way Pt (F7).  The bar gauge across the
bottom  shows  the  fuel  on hand.  The black area at right represents fuel
already  consumed.   the four color-coded bands in the middle represent the
amount of fuel needed to reach each of the four waypoints (fuel calculation
is  based  on your current altitude and speed).  The final band to the left
represents the amount of reserve fuel available.

Your  engines cannot draw fuel directly from the extra tank in your bay, so
you  must  pump  it  from the extra tank into the main tank.  To accomplish
this,  tap  Select  Weapons  (Space  Bar)  until  extra fuel is the current
"weapon"  ("EXTRA  FUEL" appears in the lower left corner of the HUD).  Now
tap  Fire  Weapons  (Return key) to "fire" the fuel from the spare into the
main tank.  If you tap Select Way Pt (F7) again, you`ll see the fuel status
has changed.

Accelerated  time:  You can speed the passing of time by tapping Accel Time
(Shift  Z).   This  doubles  the  rate  at which time passes.  To return to
normal  time,  tap  Norm Time (Shift X).  If you forget to return to normal
time,  don't  worry;  combat  activity or lowering your gear returns you to
normal time automatically.

Attacking The Target

Once  you're  well past the first waypoint and the coast of Libya is on the
horizon, it`s time to start thinking about hitting your primary target.

Check the tactical Situation:  Switch your left MFD to the gridded tactical
map by tapping Maps (F3).  Your target is a radar site, so look for a radar
symbol on this map.

Acquire  the  target:   Switch your HUD to GND (Air-Ground) mode by tapping
HUD  Modes (F2) until the GND light below the HUD illuminates, then tap Cam
Ahead  (/).   If  your target does not appear in the right MFD.  tap Select
Target  (B)  until  it does.  If you cycle through all possible targets and
still  don't  see  the  primary target, you`re either too far away for your
targeting  system  to  see  it,  or  you're  somehow  flying  in  the wrong
direction.

Select  your  Weapon:   Tap Select Weapons (Space Bar) until the message "2
Maverick" appears in the lower left of the HUD.

Wait  for  Missile Lock:  When you've acquired the target, you`ll see a box
on the HUD.  This is the "Tracking Box;" the radar site that appears on the
right MFD is in the center of this box.

Missile  Lock:  When you get within missile launch range, this box, changes
to  an  oval;  in  addition,  the  red  "LOCK" light on your console begins
flashing,  and  a  box  (the "Lock Box") appears in the middle of the right
MFD.

Optimal  Missile Lock:  If you wait longer, the Tracking Oval turns red and
the  "LOCK"  light  ceases  flashing and becomes solid; the Lock Box in the
right  MFD will begin to collapse repeatedly.  These indicators signal that
"Optimal  Launch  Range"  has  been  reached and that the missile should be
launched immediately.

Launch  Altitude:   If you launch a weapon while flying too low, you may be
caught  in the blast area, or a missile may hit the ground before its motor
can  power  it  up  and  away.   A  simple  rule to get you started is that
missiles  and  retarded bombs require at least 500` altitude, free fall and
laser bombs 3,000`.

Launch:   When  you  reach "Optimal Launch Range".  open the weapons bay by
tapping  BayDoors  (8),  then  launch  the  missile  by tapping Fire Weapon
(Return),  After  lauching  turn  away  slightly,  since  flying through an
exploding target could damage your aircraft.

Shortly  thereafter  the  missile  should hit the target.  A successful hit
causes a fire and sends a cloud of smoke up into the sky.  You get a report
on your HUD (sent from an observing AWACS) about the success of the attack.

The Secondary target:  You can now fly to the secondary target (use the INS
cursor  as a guide) and attack it as well, using the same procedure.  Or if
you wish, call it quits and head for home.

The return Trip

Setting  the  INS  to  the  Landing  Point:  Tap Reset Way Pt (Shift F8) to
insure  the  default  waypoints are loaded in your INS (inertial navigation
system)  then tap Select Way Pt (F7).  Now examine the list of waypoints on
the  right MFD.  There are four waypoints listed.  If the fourth one is not
highlighted, tap Next Point (Keypad Shift 3) until it is highlighted.  This
switches  the  INS  to  that  point.  The last point on the default list is
always your return base.

Flying  Home:   You  can either use the autopilot or manually fly home.  As
before  guide  yourself using the INS cursor.  When the INS cursor is lined
up on the centre of the leading scale, you're on course.

If  you  look at the map (Tap Maps (F3)) until the Satellite map appears on
the  left  MFD), you'll notice there`s a small island (Malta) just south of
Sicily.   You  should steer just east (to the right) of Malta.  As you near
Malta, tap HUD Mode (F2) to change your HUD to NAV mode, then tap Cam Ahead
(/).   If  the  Sigonella airbase, comes up on the right MFD, fine; this is
your  destination!  However, it's likely that Halfar airfield on Malta will
appear  instead  (it's  closer).   Tap  Select  Target  (B) until Sigonella
appears.

Landing At Sigonella Airbase

Level  Flight:   About  50  km from Sigonella, start lining up your landing
approach by achieving level flight at 500` to 1,000` altitude.

ILS:   Turn  on the Instrument Landing System (ILS) by tapping ILS (F9).  a
horizontal  and vertical bar appear on your HUD, representing your position
relative  to  the  "glide  slope.   "The  glide  slope is an imaginary line
extending  out  and  up from the runway.  First you'll line up beneath this
glide  slope  then  follow it down onto the airbase.  For more details, see
page 54.

Line  Up  Your Approach:  If the vertical bar is left or right of your Nose
indicator.   turn  in that direction until the bar starts moving toward the
center.   You  want  to  get  back  onto  a heading of 000 just as the bar
centers  on  the  Nose  Indicator.   Don`t worry if the bar is a little off
center;  as long as Sigonella is dead ahead the vertical bar will gradually
creep toward the center.  If the bar moves away from centre, however you`re
travelling  away  from  the  glide slope turn the other way to correct your
course.

Reduce  Speed:  Now cut your throttle back to about 50% by tapping Decr Pwr
(-)  a  few  times.   To  maintain level flight while your speed decreases,
pitch  your  nose  up slightly but watch the altimeter on the right side of
the HUD, you don't want to gain altitude).

Extend  Flaps:  When your speed reaches about 300 kts, extend your flaps by
tapping Flaps (9).  This slows you further by giving you more lift.  You`ll
have to readjust the nose a little to maintain level flight.

Lower  Gear & Reduce Speed Again:  Tap Gear (8) to lower your landing gear,
and cut the throttle to about 40% power.  As your speed gradually decreases
you`ll  have  to raise the nose to maintain level flight.  By this time you
should  be  close  to  the glide slope, and travelling about 200 to 250 kts
with your speed still decreasing.

If  you're  moving too fast, tap Brakes (0) to extend your airbrakes then a
few  seconds later, tap it again to close them.  Do not leave the airbrakes
open, as this may cause you to stall and crash.

Intercept  the  Glide  Slope:  As you get near the airfield, the horizontal
ILS  bar  on  the HUD begins to move downward.  When the bar approaches the
Nose  Indicator,  pitch  your  nose down a little.  Your objective is to go
into  a gradual descent that keeps the bar aligned with the Nose indicator.
Watch the Angle of Attack Approach Indicator to determine how much to raise
or  lower your nose:  if the up-arrow is illuminated, pitch up a little; if
the  down-arrow  is lit pitch down (the goal is to have the green circle in
the  center  lit).  To avoid gaining speed in the descent, tap Decr Pwr (-)
again to reduce your power.

If  your speed is too slow, look at the Stall Speed indicator (the coloured
bar  rising  from  the  bottom of the airspeed scale).  If the stall bar is
close to the middle of the scale you're getting into trouble.  Tap Incr Pwr
(+) key once or twice.

As  the  airstrip  comes  up,  check  your speed.  You should be travelling
between  150  and  200 kts.  or decreasing from 250 kts toward 200 kts.  If
your speed is above 250 kts, you're coming in too fast.  Tap Max Pwr (Shift
+),  raise  your  landing  gear,  and retract flaps; you try again.  Fly to
Malta, turn around, and start over.

Touchdown:   If  your  speed  is  correct (150-200 kts), start watching the
altimeter.   It  should  be  at  100'  to  300' and decreasing.  Make small
adjustments with the control stick to keep the descent rate steady, but not
too  fast.  The runway is at 0` altitude.  When you hear the squeal of your
wheels on the pavement, tap Brakes (0) instantly, then shut off the engines
by tapping No pwr (Shift -).  You've made a safe landing.

YOUR SECOND MISSION

Dealing With The Enemy

On  your  second  practice mission you'll learn about enemy radar, aircraft
and  missiles.   When you get back to the ready room, go straight back into
the briefing room.

You'll  be  assigned  the identical strike against a Tripoli radar station,
but this time you're going to worry about the enemy too.

Mission  Planning:   Before takeoff, check out the intelligence briefing in
more  detail.   Highlight the Radar Sites option on the menu and select it.
Now  use  your  controller  to move the arrow around the map.  As it passes
over  radar  site  icons,  information  about  missile defenses at the site
appears.  If you select one of the icons, the effective range of the search
radar  at  that site appears as a circle.  you can select any or all of the
sites  at  will  and  turn  the range of each site on and off individually.
Each solid circle is a Doppler radar, each dotted circle a pulse radar.

This  screen  helps  you  plan  a  route to Tripoli and back.  Remember the
waypoints  set  in your F-117A's INS outline the default route shown on the
map.   You may wish to fly a better route, to evade enemy detection as much
as possible

Basically,  you  avoid  detection by Doppler radars if you arc around them,
keeping a constant range to the radar.  You avoid detection by pulse radars
if  you  fly directly toward or away from them.  For more information about
radar, see page 74.

When  you're finished, you should have a mental "map" of where enemy radars
are,  how  you'll  fly  through  them  to avoid detection, and what weapons
you`ll use to achieve your objectives.

Adjusting  Waypoints:   When  you are on the carrier deck awaiting takeoff,
you  may  wish  to  adjust the waypoints to fit your own mission plan.  The
first  waypoint  by default, is half-way between your takeoff point and the
primary target.  Most pilots adjust this point.

To  make  adjustments, tap Maps (F2) until the satellite map appears on the
left MFD.  Then tap Change Way Pt (F8) to display the waypoints list on the
right  MFD  and  the  plotted  flight plan on the left MFD.  Use the Adjust
Waypoints  keys  (Keypad  Shift 2,4,6, and 8) to move Waypoint 1 around the
satellite  map.   Notice the course line automatically cally "snaps" to the
new waypoint as you move it.  If you don't like your adjustments, tap Reset
Way Pt (Shift F8) to reset all the waypoints to the initial default.

Flying  to  the target:  After takeoff, as you fly to the target, watch the
radar patterns on the left MFD satellite map.

Enemy  radar  signals  are  displayed  as  arcs  on  this map.  Dotted arcs
represent pulse radar; solid arcs, Doppler.  Ground search and AWACS radars
are expanding circles, while all aircraft radars and ground tracking radars
are short arcs.

Missiles  and  aircraft appear on the Left MFD satellite map as color coded
dots;  red  dots  represent  aircraft,  black  dots are ground radar sites,
yellow dots are enemy missiles.

You'll  notice  that  enemy  aircraft  with their forward facing radars may
complicate  your  original plan for penetrating enemy air defenses.  You'll
have to sneak behind or beneath them.

Flying  Stealthy:   Now  that  you  understand  the  situation,  watch  the
electromag  netic  Visibility  (EMV)  scale  (below  the  Left  MFD).   The
"visibility"  of  your  plane  to  enemy  radar appears as a thick, red bar
extending  from  the  right  of  the scale.  Your visibility increases with
altitude,  higher  speed, open bay doors.  lower gear, or use of jammers To
keep  your  EMV  small, you should fly low (about 200'), keep your gear up,
bays  closed and jammers off; you should also fly toward or away from pulse
radars, and at a constant distance (arcing around) from Doppler radars.

The  thinner  bars  extending from the left of the scale represent incoming
enemy  radar signals.  Enemy ground-based radar (EGR) signals appear on the
top,  enemy aircraft radars (EAR) on the bottom.  The color of a particular
bar   signifies  whether  that  radar  signal  has  detected  you  or  not.
Basically,  yellow,  pink, or white bars indicate you've been detected (see
page  48,  for a complete explanation).  Bar colours match radar arc colors
on  the  satellite map.  In addition, whenever you're detected by a signal,
the EMV light illuminates briefly, and you hear a warning beep.

Warnings

Eventually,  you'll make a mistake.  or a previously silent enemy radar may
suddenly  turn  on, and you'll be detected.  Even if you are never detected
by  radar  on  your approach to a target, when you destroy the target.  the
enemy will certainly be alerted

Search Warning:  Enemy search radar detects your plane when the enemy radar
strength  bar  overlaps  your  EMV  bar.  Search detection means that enemy
fighters  may  be  vectored  toward  your location, and that surface to-air
missile (SAM) batteries in the area may start tracking you.

Tracking  Warning:   Long  and  medium-range  SAMs must track a target with
radar  before firing.  Tracking radar appears as a short, narrow arc on the
Left  MFD Satellite map When the enemy tracks you, the "TRAK" warning light
on your console begins flashing.

Missile  Warning Lights:  if a radar-homing missile is launched toward you,
the "RAD" missile warning light flashes; if an IR (infrared) homing missile
is launched, the "IR" missile warning light flashes.

The  warning  light  continues  flashing  as  long  as  any  missile of the
appropriate  type  homes  on  your  plane.  Missile warning lights are very
important  because  they`re  the only indication of what kind of missile is
attacking, and therefore, of what defensive measures should be taken.

Missile  Proximity  Klaxon:  When a missile approaches within a few seconds
of  your  plane,  the  Missile  Proximity  Klaxon  sounds.  This very loud,
repeating  tone  means  you  must  do  something  immediately,  or  be hit.
Typically  you`ll drop a chaff or flare cartridge, depending on the type of
threat  (chaff  for  radar missiles, flares for IR missiles).  However, you
can also attempt some last-second maneuvering.

Missile Defenses

When  the  "TRAK" or a missile light begins flashing, get ready to use your
defenses an attack is coming.

Understand  the Attack:The first step is to check out the attack.  Tap maps
(F3)  to  switch  the  left  MFD to the tactical display.  Use Zoom (Z) and
Unzoom  (X) to find a useful scale.  Missiles are small color coded lines -
IR missiles are red and radar missiles are yellow.

Disappearing:   if  you're attacked by a radar missile (the "TRAK" or "RAD"
light  or both is flashing), you can evade the attack by reducing your EMV.
if the enemy radar loses sight of you, the missile loses guidance and flies
on blindly.

Jammers:   You can use the ECM jammer against radar missiles (missiles that
light the "RAD" warning).  Tap ECM (4) to toggle the ECM jammer on and off.
Use  the  IR  jammer against IR-guided missiles (those which light the "IR"
warning).  Tap IR Jammer (3) to toggle it on and off.

After  you turn on the jammer, change course and get away from the missile.
If  you  don't,  when  you turn off the jammer (or when an advanced missile
gets  close  enough).   the  missile  starts homing on you again!  Advanced
missiles  that  "burn  through" jamming include semi-active radar missiles,
command guidance radar missiles, and second generation iR missiles.

Don't  leave  your jammers running.  The ECM jammer increases your EMV; the
IR jammer reduces your speed and can overheat (see page 80 for details).

Chaff  and  Flares:  A chaff or flare cartridge lures a missiles for two or
more  seconds,  causing  it  to fly toward the chaff (radar missile) or the
flare (IR missile)

Fire  a  chaff cartridge, tap Chaff (2), when a radar missile ("RAD" light)
causes the klaxon to sound.  Fire a chaff cartridge, tap Flare (1), when an
infrared missile ("IR light") sets off the klaxon.

Decoys:   Your  F-117A  carries  three decoys that will lure everything for
several seconds.  To launch a decoy, tap Decoy (5).  The Decoy light in the
cockpit  turns  on, and remains lit while the decoy is running (see page 80
for more).

Maneuvering:  Missiles have only a 45o forward "view." If you`re outside of
this  arc.   the  missile  cannot track you.  Therefore, if you "blind" the
missile  with  a  decoy, jammer, chaff, or flare, then fly outside its arc,
the  missile may lose you and fly away Missiles also have very wide turning
circles.  You can out turn a missile (see page 83 for more details).

Ending The Second Mission

Use  the  instructions  in  the first mission to aid you in destroying your
targets  and  returning  to base.  But this time practice evading radar and
missiles.   You may want to fly this same mission a few more times for more
practice before trying a "real" mission.

Good luck!

OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------

Preflight Briefing

F-117A  Stealth  Fighter  2.0 has many options.  To make a choice, move the
Controller  joystick,  mouse, or keyboard to position the arrow cursor over
the  option you want, then press the Selector (Button 1, Left Mouse Button,
or  Return/Enter).  Note that pressing Button 2, the Right Mouse Button, or
the Escape key, always returns you to the ready Room (see page 30).

Hardware Options

You may be asked questions about your equipment.  See the technical Supple-
ment for details, including advantageous trade-offs.

Aircraft Identification

To  be  allowed  to  choose your own mission assignment, you must correctly
identify  an aircraft.  Flip to the Warplanes section of this manual (pages
164-172)  and  find  the  drawing  which  matches  the screen illustration.
Observe  carefully  the  shape of the wings, fuselage, nose and cockpit for
accurate identification.  Then select the correct name.

If  your  identification  is  wrong,  you  are  automatically  assigned  to
training.   if  the  identification  is  correct,  you  have your choice of
assignments.

Pilot Roster

Here  you can start a new career or continue an existing one.  Note that if
you  erase  a  pilot's  name  here the results are permanent.  Do not erase
pilot names unless you're sure!  You will not be able to save pilot records
unless you are playing from a copy of the game.

Selecting An Existing Pilot

You  can highlight any one of the various names on the roster by moving the
arrow  cursor  (with  your  Controller) over the name you want.  Select the
name by tapping Selector.

Creating A New Pilot

To  create  a  new  pilot,  you  must highlight an existing one and tap the
Backspace  or  Delete  key.  You may then type in a new name for the pilot.
When you`ve completed the new name tap the return key to enter the new name
into  the  roster.  You may then select that pilot as usual by highlighting
his name then pressing the selector.

When you've selected a pilot from the Roster a form appears that allows you
to indicate some levels of skill for that pilot.

Opponent Quality

The  quality  of  your opponents controls the difficulty of the simulation.
the  better  your  opponents,  the more difficult your job, but the greater
your  rewards.   Your  score  is  significantly  affected  by  this option.
Selecting  regnlar or green opponents reduces your score, making promotions
slower and putting the highest medals out of your reach.  Selecting veteran
or  elite opponents increases your score, speeding up promotions and making
medals easier to obtain.

Green  Opponents:   Here  the enemy has older aircraft and SAMs.  His radar
sets  are  poorly  maintained and frequently out of order.  Radar operators
only  understand  the  rudiments, and therefore are very bad at reading the
sometimes-strange  signals  given  off  by  your  plane.  Enemy pilots have
virtually no skill in aerobatics and dogfighting.

Regular Opponents:  Here the enemy has aircraft and SAMs appropriate to the
region:   older  equipment  for  Third  World and client states more modern
equipment when you face a superpower directly.  Radar operators are trained
and  drilled,  but  lack  experience.   Enemy  pilots  have  practiced mock
dogfights  and  areobatics,  but  lack the quyick perception and aggressive
maneuvering of a combat veteran.

Veteran opponents:  Here the enemy has aircraft and SAMs appropriate to the
region,  like  regulars,  but  tend  to  use  only the better equippment in
combat.   Radar  operators are experience and have good sense of judgement.
enemy  pilots  have dogfighting experience and perhaps a few kills to their
credit.

Elite  Opponents:  Here you face the enemy`s best.  Elite troops always get
the  best available equipment.  Radar operators know their equipment inside
and  out  and  can  interpret  your faint, confusing returns only too well.
Enemy  pilots  are  often  aces who know every trick in the book and aren`t
above inventing new ones.

Landing Skills

This  option  determines  how  difficult  and  dangerous  it is to fly your
F-117A.   Your  choice  here  also  affects scoring; the more difficult the
flight,  the higher your scores will be and the easier to obtain medals and
promotions.

No  Crashes:   This  is  the ideal choice when learning to fly.  In a crash
situation  your F-117A rights itself and keeps going.  When landing you can
safely  hit  the  ground as hard as you like.  Unless you have your landing
gear  down,  an automatic barometric altimeter keeps your plane above 200',
simplifying  low level flying.  However, enemy weapons are not affected and
are  still  deadly.  Your score is significantly reduced if you select this
option, making promotions and medals hard to get.

Easy  Landings:   This choice is preferred by casual, weekend flyers.  safe
landing  parameters  are  relaxed  considerably,  which  makes  one  of the
toughest  jobs  much  easier.   To  avoid  a crash you must touch down on a
runway, aircraft carrier, or prepared landing strip.  Hitting the ground or
water  anywhere  else destroys the plane.  As in "no Crashes," an automatic
barometric  altimeter  keeps your plane above 200` unless your landing gear
is  down.   Your  score  is only slightly reduced if you select this option
Promotions  are  not  materially  affected, and you qualify for all but the
highest medals.

Realistic  Landings:   You  must be skilled to be successful with realistic
land-  ings.   Coming  down too fast can mean instant death.  Your score is
full  value  if  you  select  this  option.  If all other selections are of
similar  difficulty,  you  can  be promoted quickly and have a fair shot at
every medal.

F-117A Realism

This  determines  whether  you'll be flying a "real" Lockheed F-117A or the
Micro-  Prose  enhanced version.  The Lockheed F-117A is more restricted in
what it can do than the MicroProse F-117A.

Lockheed  F-117A:   if you choose the Lockheed F-117A you`ll have 2 weapons
bays  instead  of 4, not be able to carry air-to-air weapons (including the
cannon)  nor  fly  air-to-air  missions,  you will fly only at night, never
launch from carriers, and you'll bo much less visible to enemy radar.

MicroProse  F-117A:   The  MicroProse  F-117A  sacrifices  a  little of the
stealthi-  ness  of the Lockheed model for more weapons, more mission types
and  day  and night- time flying (though day missions are still very rare).
It's your choice!

Form  Complete:  When you're finished making selections on the form, select
form  complete.   If you're finished with the Roster.  select Exit from the
lower right corner.

Ready Room

This  is the pilot's Ready Room, where pilots await orders.  From this room
you  can go to any other room to choose various game options.  You can also
see  a  summary  of  all options currently selected, or return to the Pilot
Roster.

To  enter  another  room, move the arrow cursor to the door of the room you
want to enter and press the Selector.

To return to the Pilot Roster, select the bulletin board on the far wall of
the Ready Room.

Commanding Officers Office

You go into the CO's office to request transfer to a different theater or a
different  duty  assignment.   Here  you select the region of the world for
your  new  assignment,  the level of political and military tension in that
region, and the types of missions you`ll be flying there.

Regions Of The World

There  are nine different areas of the world in which to operate.  Each one
takes  you to a different time period of contemporary history, and each has
its  own  set  of unique challenges and missions.  Some areas are much more
dangerous  than  others and you are rewarded more lavishly for operating in
these areas.

Persian  Gulf, 1984:  This is a complex and moderately dangerous situation.
Iran is a radical, revolutionary state involved in a long war with Iraq, as
well as numerous shooting incidents with the US Navy.

North Cape, 1985:  You face the full strength and power of the Soviet Union
during  the  height  of the Cold War.  This region contains many large USSR
military complexes and navel bases.  This is dangerous area.

Libya,  1986:  A client state of the Soviet Union Libya is one of the prime
supporters of international terrorism, and on the recieving end of American
air and naval air attacks.  this a relatively easy situation.

Training  missions in Libya are fixed.  Strike training is always a mission
from  the  USS  America  to  Tripoli;  air  to  air  training  is always an
interception of fighters patrolling the skies over Benghazi.

Central  Europe, 1986:  As in the North Cape, you face first line forces of
the   Soviet   Union   and  the  Warsaw  Pact.   Numerically  inferior  but
qualitatively  superior  NATO  forces  (including  meet  this huge military
power.  Should super power skirmishing or a full-blown World War III occur,
victory  and  defeat  would hinge on events in this region.  This is one of
the most dangerous areas

Middle East, 1989:  The Middle East is a complex web of confusing alliances
and  rivalries.   You'll  face both Soviet and Western equipment as you fly
missions  against  Syria, Iraq, and other terrorist-support states.  This a
dangerous area.

Desert  Storm  -  Iraq,  1991:   The  vast  military might of the US, Great
Britian  France,  and their Arab allies oppose the Baathist dictatorship of
Saddam  Hussain and the Iraqi military, in the Kuwait and iraqi Theaters of
Operations.  This is a moderately challenging situation.

Vietnam, 1994:  The US military has sent air units back into southeast Asia
to  oppose  Vietnamese  expansionism and to settle an old score.  This is a
very dangerous arena.

Cuba,  1995:   Cuba  is  determined to expand the communist revolution into
Central  America and the eastern Caribbean.  Washington has decided to stop
it before it spreads.  This is a dangerous situation.

Korea,  1997:   The Chinese and North koreans have finally had enough of US
dominated  democracy  in  Asia.   They  are  planning  to carry out attacks
against  US  and  South  korean installations.  Washington, of course, will
defend  its  foothold  in  the Far East.  This is one of the most dangerous
situations.

Level Of Conflict

The  level  of conflict in the region has a dramatic effect on how you must
fly  your  missions.   Each  type  of  conflict has its own challenges.  No
choice is easier than another in general, the hotter the war situation, the
more  violent  and  dangerous  the  mission, while Cold War demands careful
planning and good judgement - different skills, but no less important ones!

Cold War means clandestine missions.  Flying without being detected is key.
Fortunately,  enemy  radars  and SAMs aren't expecting trouble.  They often
confirm  a  contact  many times before attacking.  If you are detected, you
must  destroy  the plane or radar which saw you.  However, the more you use
weapons, especially against any other targets, the greater the scandal, and
the  less  successful your mission.  In fact, many missions in the Cold War
involve  photo  reconnaissance,  flying secret materials in or out of enemy
territory, or surgically "removing" a single, specific target.

Limited  War  missions  are also clandestine.  It is still important to fly
without being seen, but since warfare is ongoing, military targets are fair
game  now.   However  be  careful  to  avoid hitting civilians.  Attack and
strike missions are common, but so are photo reconnaissance and clandestine
spy  missions.   In  limited war enemy radar operators expect some trouble.
Their reactions are slightly faster.

Conventional  War  is all-out conflict.  Inflicting the maximum destruction
upon  the  enemy  is  the  main  objective here.  Avoiding detection has no
political importance but is useful if you want to survive the mission!  Any
target  in  enemy  territory  is fair game, military or civilian.  However,
enemy  air  defense  operators  rarely  confirm  their  targets  in wartime
everybody shoots first and asks questions afterward!

Mission Type

You  may  select  from  two  types  of  "real"  missions  and  two types of
"training" missions.  Training missions represent flying a flight simulator
instead of flying a real aircraft

Air-to-Air  Missions  have an enemy aircraft as your primary objective.  If
you`re  a  hotshot  with air to air missiles (AAMs) and dogfighting,this is
your  cup  of  tea.   However,  the  secondary  objective is often a ground
target.

Strike Missions assign ground targets as both objectives

Training   Missions  generate  normal  air-to-air  or  strike  missions  as
appropriate ate.  with three exceptions:  you cannot be hurt by enemy fire;
you  are  not  scored  for  the  mission  you  receive no rating points, no
decorations,  no  promotions  (after  all,  the  mission wasn't real!); you
receive fixed mission orders.  For example if you selected Libya (as in the
tutorial),  strike  missions are always against a ground target in Tripoli,
air  to  air missions are always against fighters over Benghazi.  If you`re
just  learning  to fly and fight the F-117A, this feature allows you to try
the  same  mission  over  and  over,  until  you  understand  fully  what's
happening.

Briefing Room

This  screen  shows a detailed map of the regions of the world you chose in
the  COs  Office.  On this map is the flight plan of your proposed mission.
Your  takeoff  point  (T)  primary  target  (P),  secondary target (S), and
landing  point  (L)  are  always  visible on the briefing map, as reference
points.

Also  shown on this map are important sites such as airfields and radar and
SAM sites.  You can learn important information about these sites by moving
the  cursor  over them and reading the text that appears.  In addition, you
can  see the range of various enemy radars and missiles.  This screen, with
its  great  variety  of  information,  is  the  perfect  place to plan your
mission.   You may wish to take notes about particularly dangerous enemies,
or the route you have in mind.

Mission Brief

This  presents  a  detailed  description  of  your operational orders, with
specific  information  about  the  primary and secondary objectives.  After
you`ve read this, and you tap the Return key, you'll read about your flight
plan,  describing your take-off and landing sites, estimated fuel required,
and a summary of the Rules of Engage- ment (ROE).

Radar And Missile Ranges

If  you  move  the  arrow around the briefing map, information boxes appear
that  tell  you important facts about the various sites on the map.  If you
select  one  of  the site icons, a circle appears that indicates either the
radar range of that site or the missile range.  depending upon which of the
menu  items is seleced.  You can select any or all of the sites at will and
turn the range of each site on and off individually.  if you choose "Select
All"  from  the  menu,  all ranges are shown, if you select "Clear All" all
ranges currently shown are erased.

Radar  Ranges:   if you select Radar Ranges from the menu at right, you are
shown  radar ranges when you select a site.  The initial range shown is the
site's  effective  radar  range; if you then tap the Space Bar, the display
switches to maximum radar ranges.

Missile  Ranges:   If you select Missile Ranges from the menu at right, you
are shown missile ranges when you select a site.  The range shown is always
the SAM's maximum range.

Enemy Troops

Selecting  this  option  shows you the location of known enemy ground force
concentrations.   These  locations  are boxed on the map and indicate areas
where there are likely to be large numbers of shoulder-launched SAMs.

Decline Mission

If  you  select  this  option, the current mission is cancelled and you are
given a new one immediately.  This may be handy if you want to be selective
in the missions you fly.

Select Weapons

This  option  places  you in the Maintenance Room where you can examine the
weapons  your  crew  chief has deemed appropriate for your assigned mission
and change them if you desire.

Maintenance Room

Here you select the weaponary and equipment you desire for your mission.

To  place  a weapon into a bay, use the controller to move the arrow to the
bay  you  want  to affect, then select the bay using the Selector.  Now use
the  Controller to highlight the weapon you wish to place into the selected
bay and then the selector to place it there.

Note  that  your estimated fuel required, and current fuel carried, appear;
make sure you have enough fuel to complete the mission!

Default  Armaments:   The  initial weapons loaded in Bays 1 and 2 represent
your  crew  chiefs  choice of weapons for the mission.  The weapon in bay 1
(upper  left)  is for the primary target, the weapon in bay 2 (upper right)
is  for  the  secondary.   If  extra  fuel  appears in one of the bays it`s
because the crew chief has determined you`ll need it.

Choosing  Armaments:  See pages 139-141 for details about each weapon.  The
"weapon  effectiveness"  chart,  page 139, rates all weapons against common
targets.   Its  wise  to  carry  at  least  one 7 or 6 rated weapon for the
primary and secondary objectives.

The Hangar

Here  you  see your F-117A being topped off with fuel for the mission.  you
are given the choice to go ahead and fly the mission or return to the ready
room.   Of curse if you go ahead and fly theres no turning back; but if you
return  to  the ready room, you can go to any of the above rooms and change
your assignments at will.

Simulation Controls

Viewing Controls

The  following views are from inside the cockpit of the F-117A.  They allow
you  to  look  in four different directions and change the cone of view out
the front of the cockpit

From-the-Cockpit Views

Cockpit:   Tap  Cockpit  (F1)  for  the  standard view, looking out of your
cockpit through the HUD.

Wide Angle View:  The Wide Angle key (C) toggles between a standard viewing
arc  (about  6O)  and  a  wide-angle  viewing arc (about 12O).  This view
places  your point of view farther back in the cockpit, showing more of the
cockpit  structure  and  a  wider angle view of the world outside.  This is
excellent for spotting and tracking enemies in a fast-moving dogfight.

Forward:   Tap  View  Ahead (Shift /) to turn off the HUD and look over the
cockpit control panel, giving you maximum visibility forward.

Rear:  Tap View Rear (Shift >) to look through the back of your cockpit.

View  Right:   Tap  View Right (Shift <) to look out the right side of your
aircraft

View  Left:   Tap  View  Left  (Shift  M) to look out the left side of your
aircraft

Out-of-Plane Views

As  an  aid  to  learning flight maneuvers and providing some very dramatic
cinema-  tography, a variety of out-of-plane views are available.  In these
views you`re outside of your aircraft, looking at it and/or the enemy.

In  all  but  the Chase Plane view, Zoom and UnZoom (Z and X) are operable,
moving your viewpoint closer to or farther away from the F-117A.

Slot  View:   Press  Slot  View  (Shift  Fl).  This view is named after the
famous  "in  the  slot"  position  used  by aerial acrobatic teams.  You're
positioned directly behind the

F-117A.   The  viewpoint remains level with the ground, to clearly show the
degree  of  pitch and roll of the F-1 17A as you maneuver it.  This view is
excellent for learning efficient flight.

Chase  Plane  View:   Press  Chase  Plane  (Shift  F2).  You're in a "chase
aircraft"  following  a  short  distance  behind the F-117A.  As the F-117A
accelerates,  it will tend to "run away" from you, while when it slows down
it  tends  to  "fall  back" toward you.  Zoom and UnZoom does not work with
this view

Side  View:   Press  Side View (Shift F3).  You`re to the right side of the
F-117A.   This  view  can  provide  a useful reference point.  It`s also an
excellent  way  to  check the state of your landing gear.  missile launches
are most dramatic when seen from this viewpoint.

Missile  View:   (Shift  F4).   Here  you`re positioned directly behind the
F-117As  active weapon.  If ordnance is in flight, you`re positioned behind
the  weapon  launched  most  recently.  If no ordnance is in flight, you're
positioned  behind  the plane,and will follow the first item launched, this
view  lets you follow the weapon switching to this view after launch may be
educational.

Tactical  View:   Press  Tacti View (Shift F5).  You're directly behind the
F-117A, looking past it at whatever target you're currently tracking.  This
view  automatically rotates and pans to keep both the F-117A and its target
in  view.   This  view  is  invaluable  in  combat situations; it helps you
outmaneuver  and line up onan opponent or return for second or third attack
run on a ground target.

Inverse  Tactical  Vigw:   Press  Invis  Tacti (Shift F6).  You're directly
behind  the  F-117A's  current  target.  looking past it toward the F-117A.
You  see the target in the foreground, and the F-117A often is no more than
a dot in the sky) far away.  The very dramatic view when making attack runs
on ground targets.

The  Movie  Director:   An experienced pilot.  flying in training mode, can
use  these  views  to  good  effect.   By switching between the cockpit and
various  views,  you  can  llustrate  what's  happening  and impress casual
bystanders.

For  example,  you can use the Chase Plane view and autopilot to watch your
plane  launching  from the carrier and turning onto course.  Then switch to
Slot  View  and  show  off loops.  rolls.  split-S turns and immelmans (see
pages  89-92).   Fird an enemy aircraft and use the Tacti View to show your
plane  maneuvering  against  his.   Then switch to Invrs Tacti to watch his
responses.   Before  launching  a missile go to the Side View, to watch the
weapon  dropping away.  Then jump to the Missile View to follow it into the
target.  The possibilities are as endless as your imagination

Other Controls

Pause  (Alt/P)  immediately  freezes  the action.  To resume, press any key
Some  computers have a special key labeled "pause" or "hold".  Depending on
the internal design of your machine.  This key may also work.  Pause may be
very useful when you are first learning to fly.

Accelarated Time

Accel  Time  (Shift Z) doubles the rate at which time passes, and is useful
when  flying long distances without encountering significant threats.  When
in accelerated time node, "ACCEL" appears on the HUD.

Norm  Time  (Shift  X)  returns  the  simulation to normal time.  Since its
almost  impossible  to control and fight your craft in accelerated time, in
combat and landing situations you're automatically returned to normal time.
Accelerated  time  automatically  cally  stops  if you're detected by enemy
radar, you open the weapons bay, or lower the landing gear.

Detail Adjust

Detail  Adjust  (Alt/D) allows you to change the amount and depth of ground
detail  invisible  through  the  cockpit,  speeding computer execution; the
slower your computer the lower the level of detail you should use.

Volume Adjust

Volume  Adjust  (Alt/V) allows you to change the type and variety of sounds
used  in  the  simulation.   When  you press the key, the new sound setting
appears briefly on the HUD

Training

Training  (Alt/T)  allows  you switch into training mode at any time during
play.   This  may be useful if things get particularly confusing, or if you
decide  to  just  go  sightseeing Remember though you don't get rewards for
training missions.

Resupply

Resupply  (Alt/R)  is  available  only  in training missions.  It fills the
planes  fuel  tanks  and  gives it extra weapons.  Resupply is designed for
sightseeing  and  target practise Needless to say, those who prefer realism
in simulations should never touch this option.

Hide Game

"Boss"  Hide  Game (Alt/B) immediately pauses the simulation and clears the
screen,  effectively  making the computer appear to be idle.  To resume the
simulation  you  press "Boss" Hide Game again.  This key is not only useful
at  the office, but also to forestall irate parents, children, spouses, and
relatives who complain about the time you spend at the computer!

Quit

Quit  (Alt/Q)  immediately  ends the simulation and returns the computer to
DOS.   It  does  not save information to disk, so any accomplishments since
the last pilot roster will be lost.

Save

There  is  no  "save"  key  in  F-117A  Stealth  Fighter  2.0.  Instead the
simulation  auto- matically saves your pilot record whenever your leave the
pilot roster during the preflight briefing.

This  "automatic  save"  feature  requires  you  to  be using a copy of the
program  (a copy on either a floppy or hard disk), rather than the original
MicroProse  disk  from  the  box.   If  you're using the original disk, you
cannot save data, although you can otherwise run the simulation normally.

Displays And Aircraft Controls
------------------------------

Terminology

Each  control has a name in italics, which is used on the keyboard overlay;
in  addition,  the actual key used in the IBM version of the game appear in
parentheses.   A  master  list  of  all  names and keys also appears im the
Appendix

Controller  refers  to the pointing device used by your computer.  This may
be a mouse, joystick.  or cursor keys, depending on your hardware.  See the
Technical Supplement for details.

Heads Up Display (HUD)

The  HUD  is  designed  to  provide  all  the  crucial  flying  and  Weapon
information  in  a graphic format.  HUD data is projected onto a wide angle
clear  pane in the front of the cockpit.  You look "through" the HUD to the
situation  outside.  As a result, valuable information is right in front of
your eyes, where it is most useful.

Because  the F-117A is a night fighter.  the text displayed on your HUD can
be  switched from white to green for ease of reading.  At night it is green
automatically; if you are assigned a rare daytime mission, the text appears
white  on  your  HUD.  If for some reason you are forced to stay in the air
past  daylight.   you  may  wish  to  switch the text color back to daytime
colors.  To do so tap day/Night HUD (F4)

In addition, you can customize your HUD to some extent using the De-clutter
key  (V).   These  modes condense some of the information to single digital
readouts; experi- ment to find the setting you like best.

HUD Modes

Your  HUD  has  three  modes Navigation (NAV), Air to Air (AIR), and Air to
Ground (GND).  You switch between modes using HUD Modes (F2).  The HUD Mode
Indicator Lights.  directly below the HUD, indicate the HUD's current mode.
Each  mode  has specific uses and affects not only the types of information
displayed  on  the  HUD but also what types of information are available on
your right-side Multi-Function Display (MFD)

NAV  mode  helps you navigate between airbases by restricting your tracking
system to friendly and neutral airbases and aircraft carriers.  AIR mode is
for  attacking  aircraft,  so  your tracking system is restricted to flying
targets.   GND  mode is for attacking ground targets.  Your tracking system
is restricted to these targets.

Universal HUD Information and Symbology

Some  HUD  information  is universal across all modes.  This information is
displayed or available, regardless of your HUD's current mode.

Airspeed:   Your  airspeed (in knots) is indicated on the left side of your
HUD  on  a  vertical scale; a digital readout of your current speed appears
beside the centre tick mark.

Stall  Speed  Indicator:   The Stall Speed indicator is a colored bar which
rises  from  the  bottom  of  the airspeed scale.  If it extends beyond the
centre  tick mark, your plane has stalled, and falls out of control briefly
until  the  automated recovery system takes over.  A low-altitude stall can
be fatal.

Altitude:   Your altitude (in feet) is indicated on the right-side vertical
scale;  a  digital  readout  of  your  current altitude appears next to the
scale`s  centre  tick  mark.   At 1,000` the scale changes to thousand-foot
increments (2K is 2,000`, etc).

Vertical Velocity Indicator (VVI):  The small, colored bar extending upward
or  downward from the altitude scale's center tick mark is the VVI.  If the
bar  extends  upward,  you're  gaining altitude; If it extends down, you're
losing  altitude.   Each  tick  mark represents 100 feet per minute, so the
longer the bar, the faster you`re gaining or losing altitude.

Landing Speed Indicator:  This colored arrow appears only when your landing
gear  is  down  and  marks  the  safe  maximum VVI for landing.  If the VVI
extends below this mark, landing is unsafe.

Angle  of  Attack (AOA) Approach Indexer:  The AOA Approach Indexer becomes
operational  when  your  landing gear is down.  It assists you in obtaining
optimal  pitch of the plane's nose as you approach a landing.  If the green
circle  in the center of the display is lit, your angle of attack is 0K; if
the yellow up arrow is lit, you need to pitch your nose up; if the red down
arrow is lit pitch your nose down slightly.

Heading:   The  horizontal scale across the top is your heading scale shows
is 000, East is 090, South is 180, and West is 270

INS  (Waypoint) Cursor:  The colored triangle above the heading scale shows
the direction to the currently selected INS "waypoint".  To get "On course"
turn until the marker is above the middle tick-mark on the heading scale.

Nose Indicator:  Fixed in the middle of the HUD.  this cross hair indicates
the direction your plane`s nose is currently pointing.

Flight  Path  Indicator:  This indicator shows the direction you are flying
(which  may be different from the Nose Indicator).  It is available only in
NAV and GND modes.

The  plane  is geometrically level when the nose and Flight Path Indicators
overlap  (rare  in an aircraft).  Further, level flight (constant altitude)
often  requires  the nose to be pitched slightly above the flight path (see
Techniques and Tactics, 59)

G-Indicator:   This  readout  in the upper left corner of the HUD indicates
the  current  G-forces  on  your plane`s airframe.  The plane can withstand
more G stress than the pilot, whose limits are between 3 and +9.  depending
on training and experience

Pitch  Lines:   These  lines  appear  on  the  HUD if you`re in NAV mode or
pitched  so  far  up  or  down  that  the  horizon is invisible.  Each line
represents  10o of pitch up or down If you`re perfectly level, pitch is 0;
when climbing straight up or diving straight down, pitch is 90.

Current  Armament:   In  the  lower  left the HUD indicates which weapon is
currently  selected,  and  the  number  currently  available,  such  as  "3
Sidewinders" or "2 Slicks," etc

On  the  lower  right  is  the  word "Gun" followed by the number of rounds
currently  available.   This  refers  to your 20mm cannon and its remaining
ammunition

Radio Messages:  You are Sent coded burst transmissions periodically, which
are  decoded by your onboard computers and displayed as text across the top
of the HUD.

Tracking  Box:   the tracking Box appears on your HUD whenever your F-117As
tracking  system  is locked onto a target and the target is visible through
the  HUD;  the  Tracking  Box  frames the target.  In addition.  the target
appears  in your right hand side MFD.  The current HUD mode determines what
targets can be tracked.

The Cam Ahead (/), Cam Rear (>), Cam Left (<)and Cam Right (M) keys set the
tracking  camera  to "look" in the direction indicated.  Once locked onto a
target,  it follows that target, even if the target moves from one quadrant
to another.

Missile  Tracking  Boxes:  A Missile tracking Box appears on your HUD when-
ever  a  missile  is  visible  through  your HUD.  If the box is green, the
missile  it  frames is one that you launched.  If it is yellow, the missile
is  an  enemy missile.  There may be several Missile tracking Boxes visible
in your HUD simultaneously.

Air-To-Air Indicators

To set the HUD to AIR mode, tap HUD Modes (F2).

Gunsight:  The Gunsight circle replaces the Flight Path Indicator and shows
where your shells would hit if you'd fired six seconds earlier (the time it
takes  them to travel the 6 kilometer maximum range).  If you're tracking a
target, it shows where the shells would land if you'd fired the proper time
in the past for them to travel that range See page 68, for details.

Missile  Targeting  Envelope:  This large, faint circle represents the area
in which an air to air missile can be aimed and "locked onto" a target.

Tracking  Box  and Oval:  the tracking Box appears on your HUD whenever our
F-117As  optical tracking/targeting system is locked onto a target which is
in  front  of  the  plane  and  visible through the HUD; the Tracking Boxes
visible in your HUD simultaneously.

Air-To-Ground Mode Indicators

To set the HUD to GND mode,tap HUD.Modes (F2).

Tracking  Box and Oval:  the tracking Box appears on your HUD whenever your
F-117A's  optical tracking system is locked onto a target which is in front
of  the plane; the Tracking Box frames the target.  In addition, the target
appears  in  your  right  side MFD.  In GND mode, the tracking system locks
onto airbourne targets only.

The tracking Box is color coded to inform you if your curently armed weapon
is  appropriate for use against the current target.  If the tracking Box is
white,  the  weapon is appropriate for the current target.  The size of the
Tracking  Box  indicates  how  effective  the current weapon is against the
current  target  the  larger  the  box  the more effective the weapon.  Tap
Select Weapon (space bar), to arm a different weapon.

When  using self-guided weapons, the box turns into an Oval when the target
is  within  firing  range and the missile is "locked on." When the tracking
oval  turns  red  the  shot  is  a  "sure  thing," with nearly no chance of
missing.

Bombsights:   When free-fall and/or retarded bombs are armed, a special set
of  bombsight  aids  appears on the HUD.  If your current course, speed and
altitude  will  place  you within a bomb blast, the HUD bombsight symbology
(descibed below) flashes.  You can still drop a bomb in this situation, but
you should take appropriate action to escape the resulting blast.

Bombsight  Flightpath  Guide:   This  indicates  the  "path in the sky" you
should  fly  for a perfect bombing run.  Keeping your Flight Path Indicator
centered within this symbol means you`re "on course."

Bombsight  Ranging  Bar:   this indicates when to release a bomb based upon
range  to  the  target.   As  you  get  closer  to  the drop point, the bar
compresses.  When it becomes a single vertical line (or dot) drop the bomb.

Bombsight Fall-line and Bullseye:  This appears only if free fall bombs are
armed.   A  line  extends from your flight path towards the ground.  At the
end of this line is a circle (bullseye).  Your bomb will land in the middle
of this circle.

Camera  Sight  Lens:   If  your current armament is the 135mm/IR camera the
camera  lens  sight  (a  small  +)  appears  on  the HUD.  It indicates the
direction your camera lens aims.

Multi-Function Displays (MFDS)

This MFD appears on the left side of the cockpit and displays two different
types  of  map; the Satellite/Radar Map tactical Display Map.  The Maps Key
(F3) toggles between them.  Either map may be expanded or contracted, using
the Zoom and UnZoom keys (Z and X).

Left Side Multi Function Display (MFD)

The  Satellite/Radar  Map:   this map displays the geographical features of
the region, and is oriented so north is toward the top.  When the Satellite
map is on the display, the "MAP" light is illuminated.

Enemy radar signals are displayed on this map; dotted lines represent pulse
radar;  solid  line  are  Doppler  radar.  Ground search and airborne early
warning  and  control  (AEW&C)  radars  are displayed as expanding circles,
while ground fire control and aircraft radars appear as short arcs.

Missiles, aircraft, and important ground targets also appear on this map as
colour  coded  dots.   Your  aircraft is white, other aircraft are red, and
missiles  are  yellow.   Your mission targets, flash and glow; ground radar
installations are black.

The  Tactical Display Map:  This map portrays the local tactical situation.
It  is  oriented  so the top corresponds to your current heading.  When the
Tactical Map is on the display, the "TAC" light is illuminated.

The  map  graphically  depicts  aircraft,  missiles,  ground radar sources,
airfields,  and  incidental  ground  targets.   A  16  km  square  grid  is
superimposed for range referencing

Color-coding:  Aircraft and missiles are colorcoded; dark red planes are at
a  lower  altitude  than you are, light red ones are at about the same, and
yellow  planes  are above you; red missiles are IR seekers, and yellow ones
are radar homers or visually guided.

Right Side Multi Function Display (MFD)

This  MFD  appears  on  the  right  side  of the cockpit and has four basic
functions:   to  display  images  from  your  tracking  system,  provide an
interface with your inertial navigation system INS, or to display sum- mary
information during flight (there are two types of summary information
 weapons  and  orders).   Tap  the  appropriate key to activate the desired
function.

Tracking  Camera:   Your  F-117A  is equipped with a TV and forward-looking
infrared  (FLIR) camera, capable of scanning 360o to a range of about 80 to
100 kilometers in daytime and slightly less at night To switch between your
TV  camera  and  FLIR  tap  FLIR  (F6).  When you are flying in deep night,
you'll probably have to use the FLIR to identify what you are seeing in the
right MFD.

On-board  computers  are programmed with target data that allows the camera
to  lock  onto targets within its current field of view, providing a Zoomed
TV/FLIR  view  of  the  target  along  with  its  name, range, and bearing.
Primary  and  sceonary targets are indicated when the system locks onto one
of  these.   For  a  more  detailed explanation of the uses of the Tracking
Camera and how it relates to the targeting system, see pages 68-73

Activating  and  Moving  the  Camera:  You can activate the camera (FLIR or
optical) or change its current field of view by tapping Cam Ahead (/).  Cam
Rear  (>),  Cam Left (<) or Cam Right(M).  Switch your tracking camera from
optical to FLIR using the FLIR key (F6)

When  your  tracking  Camera  is  active, the "TC" light is illuminated; if
you`re  using  the  FLIR,  the "FLIR" Iight is lit; the direction indicator
tells what direction the camera is currently pointing.

Selecting and Designating Targets:  the onboard computer contains a list of
important  targets in the area.  Tap Select Target (B) to move the tracking
camera  to  the next nearest target within 80-100 kilometers.  In addition,
you  can  reprogram the tracking camera to aim at any target on the ground.
Simply  aim  your nose at the target and tap Designate New Target (N):  the
camera will find the nearest new target.

Waypoints:   Displays waypoint data for each of the four INS waypoints (F7,
F8 and shift F8) (See page 53, for details).  When waypoints are displayed,
the "WAY" light is illuminated.

Weapons:   Displays  weapons  currently  on  board  your  F-117 (F5).  When
weapons are displayed, the "WPN" light is illuminated.

Mission  Orders:   Displays a summary of your current mission orders.  When
you  have  accomplished  your  primary or secondary mission, the summary is
updated  appropriately.  When your orders are displayed, the "ORD" light is
illuminated

Aircraft Controls - Control Stick

The  F-117A  has  a  standard  aircraft  control  stick.  Pushing the stick
forward  pitches the nose down, pulling it back pitches it up.  Pushing the
stick  left  rolls the plane to the left.  While pushing it right rolls the
it right.

The  more  you push the stick, the more the aircraft pitches or or rolls in
that  direction  When  you  release  the  stick  (center  it)  the aircraft
maintains its attitude

The control stick may be represented by a physical joystick, numeric cursor
keypad,  or  some other device.  See "Controls Summary" in the Appendix for
details.

Throttle And Fuel

The  throttle  controls the power output of your engines.  Maximum throttle
gives  maxi-  mum  speed  but  uses  up  fuel  faster  and  increases  your
electromagnetic visibility (EMV)

Thrust  Controls:  The Max Pwr key (Shift +) immediately opens the throttle
giving  you  maximum  thrust.  The No Pwr key (Shift -) immeddiately closes
the  throttle,  shutting  down the engines.  The increase key (=) opens the
throttle  a small amount.  The decrease key (-) closes the throttle a small
amount.

Thrust  Indicator:   In  the  lower right side of the cockpit is the Thrust
Indicator  a  digital  readout of throttle, expressed as a percent of total
potential.  "100" is maximum power; "50" is half power, and so on.

Fuel  Remaining:   When  your onboard fuel tank is full the digital readout
reads  "999"  as  you fly, the number decreases, showing the amount of fuel
you have remaining in your tank.

Fuel  Warning:   The  warning  light to the right of the fuel gauge flashes
whenever your fuel tanks are dangerously low.

Extra  Fuel:   If  you are carrying extra fuel in your weapons bay, you can
pump  that  fuel  from  the bay into the main tank by tapping Select Weapon
until  "EXTRA  FUEL"  appears  on the lower left of the HUD.  Then tap Fire
Weapon (Return) to move the fuel rom the bay into your main tanks.

Equipment Controls

Artificial Horizon:  This instrument indicates your current pitch and roll.
It  is particularly useful when flying in deepest night when the horizon is
difficult to see.

Landing Gear:  The Gear key (6) toggles your landing gear up and down.  The
"GEAR"  light  illuminates  when the gear is down; If the light flashes you
are  going  too  fast for the gear to be down, and there is danger that the
gear will be ripped off.

Autopilot:   the  Autopilot key (7) toggles the automatic pilot on and off.
Autopilot  sets  at a minimum altitude of 500 and flies you toward the next
INS  waypoint (it does not, however, avoid hills and mountains!).  When the
autopilot  is  on,  the  "AUTO"  light  is illuminated.  turn off autopilot
simply  by  touching  the  control  stick.   Note that if your avionics are
damaged (the "AV" damage light is on), the autopilot doesn`t function.

Weapons  Bay Doors:  Before using any weapon in your bays you must open the
weapons  bay  doors,  using the Bay Doors key (8).  The "BAY" light flashes
when  the  bay oors are open.  After launching the weapon you should toggle
the  doores  closed again Note that damage to you bay doors (the "BD" light
is lit) jams the doors open.

Flaps:   the  Flaps  key  (9)  toggles  the wing flaps between extended and
retracted When the flaps are extended the "FLAPS" light illuminates and the
aircraft  slows and gains lift.  High speeds (in excess of 300 kts) can rip
off the flaps.  causing serious damage

Brakes:  the Brake key (0) toggles the airbrake in and out.  When the brake
is  extended  the  "BRAKE"  light  illuminates and the aircraft slows down.
When  on  the ground.  The Brake key toggles the landing gear brakes on and
off

Ejection  Seat:   Tap  Eject  (ShiftF10) to "punchout" of your plane.  Your
F-117A  has  an  ACES  II  ejection seat, one of the safestm, most flexible
designs  available.  Your best chance of surviving a bailout exists if your
altitude  is  between  2.000`  and  14,000`  while flying level or climbing
slightly.

Evasion and Defense Systems

Electromagnetic Visibility (EMV) Scale

This gauge shows the current "stealthiness" of your aircraft.

Your  EMV:  The "visibility" of your plane to enemy radars appears as a bar
extending  from the left of this gauge.  Your EMV increases as you climb to
a higher altitude, increase speed, open your bay doors, lower your gear, or
use your jammers.

Enemy  Radars:   The  bars that extend intermittently from the right of the
scale  represent  incoming enemny radar signals.  Enemy ground based (EGRs)
appear  on  the  top, enemy aircraft radars (EARs) on the bottom.  The bars
are colour coded to give additional detection information.

Detection:   If  an  incoming signal overlaps your EMV bar, it has detected
you  (the  Detection Warning Light flashes and you hear a warning beep).  A
pink  incoming signal means that a ground radar has faintly detected you; a
yellow  bar  means  you have been fully detected.  If an incoming air radar
signal appears white on the gauge an enemy aircraft has detected you.

The  colors  of  search radar signals that appear on your Satellite map and
HUD  are  colored  identically  to those on the EMV gauge.  So that you can
easily  locate  the  radar  that  has  detected  you  (see  "Display Colors
Summary," in the Appendix).

Warning Devices

Search  Warning:   Frequently  a  single search detection does not give the
enemy sufficient data to recognize your plane, but when you have definitely
been  seen,  a message appears on your HUD to indicate the enemy has "seen"
your plane.

Radar  Tracking  Warning:   Long-range  and  medium-  range  Surface to Air
Missiles  (SAMs)  must  track you for a time before firing.  Tracking radar
appears as a short, narrow arc on the Satellite/Radar map.

When  enemy  tracking  radar  tracks you, the "TRAK" warning light flashes.
Note,  however,  that  some short-range enemy missiles (some IR-homers, see
page  82)  do  not use a radar tracking system.  Therefore, "TRAK" is not a
foolproof warning of impending attack.

Missile  Warning  Lights:   If  a  radar-guided  missile  is homing on your
aircraft  the  "RAD"  light flashes.  If an IR (infrared homing) missile is
homing on you, the "IR" light flashes.

The  appropriate  light  continues  to flash as long as any missile of that
type  is  pursuing  you.   If  jammers  or  some  other  device confuse the
missille,  the  light  goes off.  If the missile later finds you, the light
flashes again.

Missile  Proximity  Klaxon:   When  a  missile  is  within a few seconds of
hitting  your  plane, the Missile Proximity Klaxon sounds, signaling you to
react quickly or be hit!  Typically you'll drop chaff or a flare, depending
on the type of threat (chaff for radar missiles, flares for IR missiles).

Defenses

Flare:  this is a small, finely tuned heat decoy.  Tap Flare (1) to release
a flare cartridge behind your plane.  The flare light illuminates while the
flare  is  active  and  the  digital  readout indicates the number you have
remaining.   For  the  next  2-5 seconds the intense heat of the flare will
cause  all  enemy  infrared guided missiles to home on the flare instead of
your aircraft.

Chaff:   Tap Chaff (2) to release a chaff cartridge behind your plane.  The
chaff  light  illuminates while the chaff is active and the digital readout
indicates  the number you have remaining.  For the next two or more seconds
the  aluminum  sheets  of  the chaff cartridge will confuse all enemy radar
guided  missiles,  causing  them  to  home  on  the  chaff  instead of your
aircraft.

Important  Exception:  Enemy Doppler radar-guided missiles will not home on
chaff  unless your course is perpendicular to that of the missile.  As long
as  the  missile  chases you from the rear, or attacks from straight ahead,
chaff has no effect.

Decoys;  Your  F-117A  carries  three decoys.  To launch a decoy, tap Decoy
(5).   The  "decoy"  light  illuminates while the decoy is running, and the
digital readout indicates the number you have remaining.

Each  decoy  is  a  computer-controlled  radar  emitter/reflector and an IR
source.   To  enemy  radar  and  infrared  it  looks  like  your plane, but
stronger.  The decoy gradually floats down via parachute and self destructs
betore  landing.   Enemy missiles, aircraft and ground radars are fooled by
decoys,  although the amount of time depends on the experience and skill of
the opposition (typically trom 20 to 60 seconds) During this time the enemy
chases the decoy instead of you.

Infrared (IR) Jammer:  the IR hammer key (3) toggles ths device on and off.
When  the jammer is running the "IRJ" light illuminates.  This device emits
heat  pulses  to  confuse  a  missile's guidance system.  The missile stops
homing  on  your  plane  and  flies  straight  ahead.  The jammer is highly
effective against first generation IR missiles, but good only at long range
against  second  generation  missiles  (see  page 83).  Using the IR jammer
reduces your speed, and it shuts down automatically to avoid overheating.

ECM  Radar  Jammer:   The ECM key (4) toggles this device on and off.  When
the  jammer  is  running the "ECM" light illuminates.  This jammer "blinds"
radar  guided  missiles.  The jammer is particulary effective against older
"beam  rider"  missiles,  but good only at long range against "semi-active"
radar  homers  (see  page 79).  The only drawback to using ECM is that your
EMV is increased

Damage

The upper left of the cockpit has a bank of "telltale" lights that indicate
which systems (if any) are damaged.

Missile  Warnings  (MW):   When  the  "MW" damage light is illuminated, the
Missile  Warning system is inoperative.  The "RAD" and "IR" missile warning
lights no longer work.

Engine  (ENG):   When  the  "ENG"  light  is illuminated, engine damage has
reduced the maximum thrust possible.  Any additional damage further reduces
thrust

Flight  Control  (FC):   When  the "FC" damage light is illuminated, flight
control computer damage makes the F-117A more difficult to control.

Avionics  (AV):   When  the  "AV" light is illuminated, avionics damage has
disabled your Inertial Navigation System (INS) and autopilot.

Bay  Doors  (BD):   When  the  "BD" light is lit, the weapons bay doors are
damaged and jammed open, permanently increasing your EMV.

Jammers  (JAM):   When  the  "JAM"  light  is  illuminated, your ECM and IR
jammers no Ionger function.

Fuel  Tank  (Fuel):   When  the  "FUEL" light illuminates damage and stress
breakage  is  causing fuel to leak.  Once a leak starts, any furthur damage
increases the rate of fuel loss.

Fire  Control  (FIRE):  When the "FIRE" light illuminates your fire control
systems are damaged.

Random  Malfunctions:   Your  F-117A  is  an extremely complicated piece of
equippment.   Random malfunctions are possible in any of the systems at any
time.  The malfunction may include the reporting systems onboard the craft.
If  so you wont know that something has malfunctioned until you discover it
doesnt work!

Malfunctions are more likely in intense combat situations, due to the heavy
burden that places on your sophisticated electronic systems.

Weaponry

These  instructions  give  the  bare  rudiments of weapons operation.  Many
important  considerations  and tactical tricks are described in "Chapter 3,
Techniques  and  Tac-  tics."  See "Weapons Effectiveness," page 139, for a
chart showing weapon effective ness against various targets.

Selecting Weapons

The  name of the weapon currently armed and ready for use always appears in
the lower left corner of the HUD.

Weapon:   Tap  Weapon  (F5) to display the contents of your weapons bays on
the  right MFD.  The bay currently selected is highlighted, and the current
armament appears in the lower left corner of the HUD.

Tap  Select  Weapon  (Space Bar) to change the currently-selected weapon in
your fire control system.  Each key press switches to the next weapons bay,
and  the  change  is  indicated both on the HUD and in the Right MFD Weapon
display.

Cannon:   Your 20mm cannon is always available for use (Unless it is out of
ammo or damaged).

Firing Weapons

Launching  Weapons:   Tap  Fire  Weapon  (Return) to launch a weapon.  This
fires  one missile or drops one bomb.  The currently selected weapon is the
one  used.   See  pages  68-73, for more specific instructions on launching
weapons.

The Reconnaissance Camera (135mm/FlIR Camera) is "fired" like a weapon from
an open weapons bay.  Each "shot" takes one picture

Special  Equipment can be air-dropped by opening the bay doors and "firing"
it  out.   It  floats  to  the ground on a parachute.  It is also loaded or
unloaded  on  the  ground at appropriate airstrips automatically (a message
appears on your HUD when loading or unloading is complete).

Cannon:  Fire Cannon (Backspace or Button 2) tires one burst.

Navigational Systems

Concept:   The  INS has up to four programmable "waypoints" to map a flight
plan.  The default waypoint setup puts the first point halfway between your
starting  base  and  primary  target the second is the "primary target" the
third is the secondary target, and the last is your landing point.

Waypoints  Display:   The  Select  Way  Pt (F7) and Change Way Pt (F8) keys
display  list  of  INS  waypoints on the right side MFD, and your projected
flight path from waypoint to waypoint on the Satellite Map on the left.

The  waypoints list display shows the current time at top.  The ETA to each
waypoint  and  a  fuel  gauge  across  the bottom.  The fuel gauge is a bar
graph,  predicting  fuel  consumption  based  upon  your  current speed and
altitude.   The  far  right  side  of  the bar black region) indicates fuel
already consumed, the center parts (white for current waypoint and blue for
others) indicates fuel needed to reach each waypoint, and the far left side
(green region) indicates fuel reserves.

Selecting  Waypoints:   The  waypoints  list  has one point highlighted (in
white).   This  is the waypoint currently indicated by the INS cursor above
the Heading Scale on your HUD.

To  select a new waypoint, tap Select Way Pt (F7).  Then use the Last Point
(keypad 9) and Next Point (keypad 3) keys to move the highlight up and down
the   list.   As  you  move  the  highlight  the  HUD's  INS  cursor  moves
accordingly.

Changing Waypoints:  To change a waypoint to a new location, tap Change Way
pt (F8).  Then use the Last Point (keypad 9) and Next Point (keypad 3) keys
to  select  the  waypoint  you  wish  to  change.   Finally, use the keypad
waypoint  keys to actually move the waypoint.  You can watch the results in
the left MFD on Satellite Map.

Tap  Reset  Way  Pt  (Shift  F8)  to  reset  all  waypoints to the original
waypoints.

Instrument Landing System (ILS)

The  ILS key (F9) toggles the ILS display on and off.  When the ILS is on a
vertical  and  horizontal bar appear on the HUD to guide you to the nearest
friendly airbase.

Principles of Operation:  the ILS is designed to aid you on final approach,
steering  you  down  a  descending "glide slope" to the runway.  If you are
flying  a  pattern  to  land, use the ILS to guide you to the airport, then
turn  it off until you are "on final".  The ILS guides you to the runway or
carrier deck, but ends there.  Rather than produce inaccurate readings over
the runway, the ILS automatically turns off before it degrades to useless.

Vertical  "Course" Bar:  to use the ILS, fly the plane so that the vertical
bar  lines  up with with vertical ticks of your Nose Indicator.  This means
you`re on course towards the airbase.

Horizontal "Glide Slope" Bar:  The horizontal bar of the ILS represents the
"glide  slope,"  an  imaginary sloping line extending from the airbase into
the  sky.  If the bar is above the horizontal ticks of your Nose Indicator.
You are beneath the glide slope You can either fly straight ahead until you
"intercept"  it,  or climb to get to the glide slope faster.  If the bar is
beneath  your  Nose  Indicator,  you  are  above the glide slope and should
descend until the bar aligns directly with the Nose Indicator.

Postflight Debriefing

After  the mission you are debriefed.  Your commander goes over the mission
step  by step, evaluating each event as it occurs and assigning a numerical
score.   Basically  if  you  accomplish the mission and follow the Rules of
Engagement  (see  below),  you`ll  do  very  well.   The more difficult the
opposition, the more credit you`ll get.

Ending A Mission

When  you  land, stop, and turn off your engines, the mission is over.  You
cannot  refuel  or  rearm  to  continue  the mission.  Stealth missions are
carefully  planned  "one  shot" operations.  If a mission fails, higher-ups
will decide later whether to try again, and if so, when, where and how.

Crashes

If you're using Easy or Realistic landings, crashing the airccraft ends the
mission  and your career.  To remain alive, you must eject before the plane
hits the ground.  Of course, selecting "No Crash" eliminates this problem -
but greatly reduces your potential score.

Bailing out

If  you  survive  a  bailout, you now have to worry about where you did it.
Ejecting  over  the  sea, far from an enemy coastline, is ideal because the
aircraft sinks out of sight and you can be rescued.  The next best location
is  over  friendly  territory.  Again, you can be rescued, but fragments of
the  wreckage  may  be  found by the public or by enemy spies.  Bailing out
over  enemy  territory is bad:  even though your F-117A has a self destruct
mechanism.   Fragments  of  the  plane will certainly be found by the enemy
teaching  them  valuable  secrets  of  US stealth technology.  In addition,
you`ll  probably  be  captured  and  suffer  a public trial and humiliation
before the USAF manages to get you back

Scoring

Above  all  follow  the  Rules  of  Engagement  and  accomplish the primary
objective  it's  hard  to  do  badly if you achieve this.  Failing that, at
least accomplish the secondary objective.  If you fail both of these, it is
difficult to gain any credit.

Cold  War:   It's  important  that  nobody detect you.  Visual sightings by
enemy  aircraft  do the most damage Enemy radars that positively track your
plane are also bad

Needless  to  say, random destruction is also unacceptable in Cold War, and
destroying  friendly  planes and ground installations is the worst possible
event.   However,  destruction  of neutral or civilian targets is almost as
bad.   The  least  embarr- rassing events are destruction of enemy military
targets,  although  even that should be avoided.  In fact, the only time it
is  "permissible"  to  destroy target is if your mission orders require it,
the enemy has sighted or tracked you, or if the enemy fired first.

Limited  War:   It's also important to avoid detection during a Limited War
although  the  penalties  aren't  as  great.  Your commander wholeheartedly
approves  of  attacks  on  enemy  forces,  including  military aircraft and
obvious  military  installations put civilian targets (passenger airliners,
oil  wells,  refineries,  bridges, etc.) cause political problems and lower
your Score.

Conventional  War:  In this situation your commander doesnt care if you are
detected.   unless  of  course your plane is damaged by enemy fire (F-117As
are very expensive).

You  gain  credit for destroying anything in enemy territory, even civilian
targets  although  military  ones are worth more).  In fact, your commander
rather expects that you`ll do a bit more than just hit the objectives.  The
only   possible  negatives  come  from  the  destruction  of  neutrals  and
friendlies.

Reputation

If  your rating on a mission is high, your commander will recommend you for
a  Decoration.   The  five  possible  decorations,  from  easiest  to  most
difficult to achieve are;

AM:   Airman`s Medal. recognizing good performance.
DFC:  Distinguished Flying Cross. for superior performance in combat.
SS:   Silver Star for Valor. for heroism in combat.
AFC:  Air Force Cross, for extreme heroism.
CMOH: Congressional Medal of Honor. America`s highest military decoration

You  must be outstandingly successful against the toughest opposition to be
nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor

Other Decorations

The  Purple  Heart is awarded to pilots who come home wounded.  Surviving a
mission with a badly damaged aircraft frequently yields this award.

The  Combat Readiness Medal is awarded to almost everyone in a combat unit.
Beyond  this,  the  number  of  missions  you survive determines what other
ribbons you may receive:  5 missions for the Overseas Ribbon Short Tour, 15
missions  for the Overseas Ribbon Lang Tour.  30 missions for the Longevity
Service  Ribbon, and 60 missions for the Langevity Service Ribbon with Gold
Cluster

Promotions

Your  starting  rank  is 2nd lieutenant.  Promotions are based both on your
total score and on your average score per mission.  Therefore, if you "goof
up"  and  do  badly in a mission.  You may need extra high-scoring missions
before you qualify for promotion.

In addition, you can`t get promoted without sufficient experience.

Ranks available, from lowest to highest, include:

2nd Lt:   Second lieutenant
1st Lt:   First lieutenant
Capt:     Captain
Maj:      Major
Lt.Col:   Lieutenant Colonel
Col:      Colonel
B.Gen:    Brigadier General

Brigadier General is not a flying rank.  You don't have a chance of earning
that  rank  until you're retired from active duty.  No pilot is expected to
fly  more  than  99  missions  After  that  the Air Force decides:  are you
promoted  to Brigadier General, are you simply given a Washington desk job,
or  do they suggest you leave the service and seek your fortune in civilian
life?   Very  few  pilots  survive 99 missions with a record good enough to
earn their "star."

Incidentally,  don't  feel  bad  about  a middling rank.  In active fighter
squadrons  most pilots are First lieutenants and Captains.  Majors serve as
flight   leaders,  Lieutenant  Colonels  as  higher  squadron  officers  or
commanders, and full Colonels as squadron or wing commanders.  Promotion to
Major  or above is increasingly difficult.  A Lieutenant Colonel or Colonel
still flying active combat missions is rare in the USAF.

TECHNIQUES AND TACTICS
---------------------

How To Fly

This  discussion  of  lift  and  flight  is  not  rigorous  or precise in a
scientific  sense.  It only provides a rudimentary portrayal of the physics
of flight and its practical effect on aircraft handling.

Lift:   Aircraft  fly  because  of  a  pressure  difference  created by the
difference  in  the  speed  of  the air flowing over the top of the wing as
opposed  to  the bottom.  Air moves faster over the top of the wing than it
does  over  the  bottom,  creating  high  pressure beneath the wing and low
pressure  above  it.   The wing is pushed upward to compen- sate, providing
lift.   When  the pressure difference becomes great enough, the upward lift
is greater than the plane's weight and the aircraft flies

Speed  and  Lift:   The  amount  of  lift generated by the wing varies with
airspeed.   The  faster  the plane flies, the faster the air flows over the
wings,  and the greater the pressure difference.  If your plane is in level
flight  at  a  certain  speed,  reducing  the speed reduces lift, causing a
descent (without nosing down).

Angle  of  Attack  and Lift:  the amount of lift generated also varies with
the  angle  between  the  wings  and  the  airflow.   If you pitch up a few
degrees, you increase the pressure difference and, therefore, the lift.  If
you  pitch  the  nose down, the reverse occurs.  The difference between the
airflow  direction  and a horizontal line through the wing is the "angle of
attack"  (AOA).   Angle  of  attack  is  visible on your HUD in NAV and CND
modes.   Whenever  your Nose Indicator is above your Flight Path Indicator,
the difference between the two is the Angle of Attack.

Level  Flight:  To achieve "level" flight at a given power setting, a pilot
raises or lowers the nose until his vertical velocity is zero (no ascent or
descent  appears on the "VVI").  Note that a pitch of 0o may show ascent or
descent.   Nosing  up  or down to a new "angle of attack" adds or subtracts
lift as needed to achieve level flight.

To  achieve  "level"  flight  at  a  given speed, the pilot gets into level
flight, adjusts his throttle to achieve the desired speed, then adjusts his
pitch to find level flight for that airspeed.

The Effect Of Roll

The force of lift is always perpendicular to the wing.  So if the wings are
banked,  the  lift  force  is no longer straight up relative to the ground.
Instead  it has two components, one moving the aircraft sideways, the other
straight  up.   This  causes the plane to turn, and, since upward lift (the
force opposing gravity) is diminished to lose altitude.

During  a  turn  the  pilot can adjust the angle of attack by control stick
"back pressure," that is, by pulling back slightly on the stick, the amount
of  adjustment  is  very  small.   Over  correcting is a common error among
beginner pilots.

Special Situations

Stalls:   An  aerodynamic  stall  occurs  when  the  wing's angle of attack
becomes  too  large.   The  air  stops  flowing smoothly over the wing, and
instead  part  breaks  away  onto  an  independent  path.   This erases the
pressure  difference, vastly reduces lift, and generally causes the nose to
drop.   Stall  speed  varies considerably depending on many factors.  Tight
turns  increase  the  stall  speed.   Note  that  simultaneously the act of
turning  tends  to  decrease  your airspeed.  As a result, stalls are quite
common  in  tight  turns.  The F-117A has an audible stall warning horn.  A
Stall  Warning  light  in  the upper left of the console, and a colored bar
showing stall speed on the HUD`s Airspeed Indicator.

The  F-117A  includes a computerized stall recovery governor that instantly
reconfigures  the  wing  edges for automatic recovery, making your job much
easier.   To  recover  from  a stall, first level the wings, then bring the
pitch  back  to normal.  A stall invariably costs you altitude.  So a stall
at low altitude can be fatal!

Flaps:   Lowering flaps extends the wing surface and increases the pressure
Difference.   Adding  more  lift they also increase drag, which lowers your
speed.  However, flaps are only useful at low speeds (under 350 knots).

Flying The F-117A

The  F-117A  is  unflyable.   The design is one of the most surprising ever
seen  - many experts said it wouldn't fly when they first saw it.  In fact,
a  pilot would find it very Difficult maybe impossible - to fly without the
aid of sophisticated onboard flight control computers.  This aircraft, like
some others, is said to "fly by wire"

The pilot uses a normal control stick (much like your joystick) and uses it
just  like  pilot  of  a  normal  civilian  aircraft.  But the pilot is not
communicating  with  the  control  surfaces of the aircraft:  instead he is
talking  to  the computer, and it is talking to the control surfaces.  When
the  pilots  says "bank," the computer interprets his command and makes the
wings  bank,  all  the  while  correcting  this  and that to keep the plane
airborne

Remember,  when  you  are  flying this aircraft, you are interfacing with a
computer that is flying the aircraft!

Taking Off

While sitting on the runway, the following pre flight check-out:

Check Your INS.  Tap Maps (F3) until the satellite map is displayed on your
left MFD.  Now tap Select Way Pt (F7) to show the INS waypoints list on the
right MFD.  the INS cursor above the heading scale on the HUD indicates the
direction  in  which you must fly to reach the first waypoint listed on the
right MFD; by using the Next and Previous Waypoint keys (Shift/keypad 3 and
9)  you  can  cycle through all the waypoints currently assigned.  Advanced
pilots may way want to change the location of one or more waypoints at this
time.

Check  armament:   Tap Weapons (F5) to check your weapons on the right MFD.
Use  Select  Weapons  (Space  Bar)  to cycle through the weapons.  Note the
active weapon appears in the lower left corner of the HUD.

Extend  the  Flaps:   Tap  Flaps  (9).  Note the "FLAPS" light in the upper
right corner of the console.  Flaps increase lift during takeoff.

Check the Catapult System (Carriers only):  When launching from an aircraft
carrier, the brakes will be set.  The "BRAKE" light will be illuminated

Start the Engines:  Start your engines by tapping Max Pwr (Shift +)

Activate  Catapult  (Carriers  only):  Tap Brakes (0) to release the brakes
and catapult, hurling you off the deck.

Accelerate  Past Stall Speed:  As you move down the runway or carrier deck,
watch  the  speed  scale  (left  side of the HUD) carefully.  A colored bar
(stall  speed  Indicator)  will gradually go down.  When it drops below the
center tick-mark, your plane is past stall speed.

Climb into the Sky:  Pull back gently on the stick.  As you start climbing,
watch the altitude scale on the right side of the HUD.

Retract Landing Gear:  Tap Gear (6) to raise your landing gear.  Dont leave
the  gear  down  both it and your plane can be damaged if left down at high
speeds.

Retract  Flaps:   Tap Flaps (9) to retract flaps.  You no longer need extra
lift.

Turn  onto  Course:   Pull  the stick left or right until the INS cursor is
aligned  with the center tick on the heading scale.  Alternatively, you can
simply  tap  Autopilot  and  let  your  autopilot turn you onto the correct
course to the first waypoint.  Since this is a stealth mission, you'll want
to stay low.  About 200" to 500` is ideal.

Smooth Flying Techniques

A  Light  Touch:   Use a light touch on the Control Stick.  The most common
error  "ham  fist"  on the stick, throwing the plane around the sky in wild
abandon.  Unless an emergency never push the stick to the limit.

Chasing  the  Gauges:  When you change an aircraft`s operating regime (move
stick,  change  the throttle, and so on), the effects of the change takes a
second or two settle out" and show on the gauges.  For smooth flying.  make
a  change  then observe effects before making another.  Constant adjustment
and  correction  should  be  avoided,  because  all you'll do is "chase the
gauges" overcorrecting every move.

Straight  and  Level  Flight:   To be a good combat pilot.  you must master
level flight.  Do this in a training scenario, rather than real life.

Climb  to an altitude of about 2,000' and level the aircraft so the nose of
the  plane  points at the horizon.  Now reduce the throttle to about 75% to
achieve  an economical cruising speed.  Although the Nose Indicator appears
level  with the horizon, the HUDs altimeter and VVI probably show the plane
is climbing or descending.  If you`re climbing, push forward on the Control
Stick, then let go and observe the effects.  If you`re descending pull back
a bit instead.  Your objective is to keep the altimeter rock steady

You`ll notice that your Flight Path indicator aims at the horizon, but your
Nose  Indicator  may be pointed above Or below it, depending on your speed.
Generally the slower you're travelling.  The higher you must pitch the nose
to achieve level flight.

Now experiment a little Tap Brakes (0).  This slows down your plane.  Watch
the  HUD and notice how the Flight Path Indicator drops.  Meanwhile, on the
sides  of  the  HUD,  your  speed  is dropping and so is your altitude.  To
achieve level flight at this new lower speed pitch up until the Flight Path
Indicator is level with the horizon.

Turns:   As  you pull the stick right or left and your roll angle increases
beyond  45o, the stall speed rises from the normal 120 knots (kts) range to
over  200  kts (in a 90o roll) Tight turns "bleed off" airspeed, so a long,
tight  turn  may  cause  a stall.  Keeping an eye on the airspeed and stall
speed  is  particularly  important when making tight turns at low altitude,
because stalls cause you to lose altitude rather quickly.

In  extremely  tight  turns (where you roll 80o, 85o, or even 90o), you can
tighten  your turn rate by pulling back on the stick.  However, this bleeds
airspeed even faster a close eye on the Stall Speed Indicator bar.

Loops  are  easy  in the F-117A, but ballistic ("straightup") climbs can be
maintained only for short periods.

Remember  that  any  prolonged  vertical maneuver greatly reduces airspeed,
which  risks  a stall if you didn`t start the maneuver with a lot of speed.
However,  going  vertical  is very handy for changing direction.  Since you
can  roll  while  vertical,  quickly  pointing  your  nose  in  the desired
direction, then push down into level flight again.

Low  Altitude  Flying:   At  altitudes under 500', expect increased buffets
downdrafts,  and  other  irregularities  that  make flying difficult.  Also
beware  of  low  ridges and mountains.  It`s easy to fly into a mountain if
you're  not  looking.   Good  pilots  develop  a  "cross  check" routine of
scanning the entire HUD periodically, to make sure everything is okay

In  "No  Crash"  and  "Easy"  flight  modes  you  have a barometric / laser
altimeter.   If  you drop below 200'.  This device automatically but gently
pushes  your  plane back up.  Be warned, the device automatically turns off
when  the  landing  gear is down, or when the gun is firing.  The device is
not  proof  against  power  dives,  stalls, or other radical maneuvers, but
works  fine  in  normal  flight  regimes.   In  fully  realistic flight the
automatic  altimeter  is  turned off, allowing skillful pilots to cruise at
even lower altitudes.

Landing The F-117A

Airbases:   All airstrips have a north-south orientation and a centre strip
down  their middle On approach, a course of 000o (if coming from the south)
or 180o (if coming from the north) will align you with the runway.

Airbases  are  more than twice as long as your safe landing distance at 200
kts  -  a large safety margin.  Aircraft carriers have arrestor cables near
the  stern.  You must touch down before or on these cables in order to stop
before  rolling  off  the  deck.   Do  not attempt to land on the bow of an
aircraft  carrier  because there are no arrestor cables here.  Furthermore,
regular  aircraft  spotted  for  launching may be positioned there, and you
certainly don`t want to crash into them!

Aborted Landings:  If you get in trouble landing, open the throttle to full
power  and  retract the flaps and landing gear.  Climb away and come around
for  another  try Do not make sudden movements with the control stick while
landing or aborting.  Wait or your airspeed to exceed 300 kts before making
any  big  turns  or  similar maneuvers Until then, gross maneuvers with the
control stick may stall the plane, causing a fatal crash.

Using The Instrument Landing System (ILS)

To  use  the  ILS, tap HUD Modes (F2) as necessary to switch the HUD to NAV
mode,  tap  Cam Ahead (/) to activate the Tracking Camera, and tap ILS (F9)
to  activate  the  ILS.   The  ILS  and camera will automatically track the
nearest  friendly  or  neutral  landing  site.   It  will  not  track rough
airstrips behind enemy lines.

Line  Up Your Approach:  The first step is to line up on the correct course
to the airbase (or aircraft carrier).  To do this, fly at 500' to 1,000' to
a  point about 40 to 50 kilometers (km) north or south of the base and turn
until the ILS vertical bar is centred on your Nose Indicator.

Intercept  the  Glide  Slope:  Once you're on course, you want to intercept
the  glide  slope  represented  by  the  horizontal bar.  Descend until the
horizontal  bar  is  slightly  above  the  horizontal  ticks  of  your Nose
indicator.   The  horizontal  bar  gradually drops until it aligns with the
horizontal  ticks  of  the  Nose  indicator.   When  this  occurs,  you are
intercepting (flying through) the glide slope.

Descent:   Once  you've  intercepted  the  glide slope, begin your descent.
Keep  the  horizontal  bar  centered, which means making a gradual descent.
You  must manage the descent like a normal landing (see "Descend on Final."
below).

Touch  down:   The ILS will not guide you to touchdown.  It is not accurate
in  the  immediate vicinity of the base.  It turns off automatically before
you reach the runway.

ILS and Landing Patterns:  The ILS is designed to guide you to the airbase.
It does not control your plane through a landing pattern.

Straight In Landings

Line  Up  Your  Approach:   Use  the  ILS  to  line  up a correct approach.
Beginners  intercept  the  glide  slope  about  40  50  km from the runway.
Attempting  to  find  the  approach and make a landing less than 20 km from
base is not advised for the beginner.

Throttle at 7O%:  Fly your approach at 500' to 1,000'.  Reduce the throttle
to about 70%, which should reduced your speed to about 300 kts.  Eventually
you`ll need to pitch up (raise the nose) a little to maintain level flight.

Flaps  Out,  Throttle  5O%, Gear Down:  Now extend the flaps and reduce the
throttle  to  about  50%.   This  slows the plane to about 230 kts.  As you
reach  this  speed  lower  your  landing  gear.  If you`re moving too fast,
extend the brakes - tap Brake (0) for a brief period.

Descend  On  Final:   When the ILS horizontal bar reaches the middle of the
HUD Nose Indicator, you should start descending down the glide slope.

Reduce  the  throttle  slightly.   If  you  were  in level flight, you will
gradually descend with your Nose indicator above the Flight Path indicator

Use  the  ILS  horizontal  bar to control your rate of descent.  Adjust the
throttle to keep the bar in the middle of the Nose Indicator.

Finally,  keep  an  eye on your airspeed and Stall Speed Indicator.  If the
stall  bar  indicator  gets  within  25  kts of your current airspeed, your
throttle  is too low.  Conversely, if your airspeed is over 250 kts, extend
the brakes for a brief period.

Touch  Down:   Your  altimeter reads 0 on a runway, and 125' on an aircraft
carrier  These are your "touchdown" altitudes.  The safe touchdown vertical
velocity  is  shown  by  an arrow on the VVI of your altimeter.  A vertical
velocity  of 400`/minute or less (4 ticks on the scale) is always safe.  In
certain conditions a higher vertical velocity is allowable.  Once you're on
the  runway,  cut  the  power  by  tapping No Pwr (Shift -), and engage the
brakes by tapping Brakes (0).

Aircraft  Carriers:  Landing on a carrier is slightly more difficult, since
you must touch down in the arrestor cables area.  To avoid overshooting the
cables,  increase  your  descent by lowering the nose a little, then at the
last second extend the air brake by tapping Brakes (0) as you pull the nose
up.

If  you  miss  the  carriers  arrestor cables, don`t bother trying to touch
down.  Instead close the brakes tap the Max Pwr (Shift +).

Offensive Actions

This section provides a short primer on how to use your weapons.  Also, see
page  139,  for  a  chart  indicating  your  various weapon's effectiveness
against various targets

Finding And Hitting A Target

1.  Find the Target:  Your primary and secondary targets are stored in your
INS,  initially as waypoint 2 and 3.  If you've moved the waypoint, you can
reset them by pressing Reset Way Pt (Shift F8).

To  reach the target, call up the waypoints by pressing Select Way Pt (F7),
select  the  appropriate  waypoint  by tapping Next Point (Shift/keypad 3),
then steer toward it following the INS cursor above the HUD Heading Scale.

2.   Check  HUD  Mode:   Change the HUD to the correct mode.  Use HUD modes
(F2)  to  select the right mode:  AIR (for firing at aircraft), or GND (for
firing at ground targets)

3.   Use  Tracking  Camera:   Lock  your tracking/targeting system onto the
nearest  target ahead, by tapping Cam Ahead (/).  The display remains blank
if there are no targets ahead within 80 to 100 km.

To  track  other  targets,  tap  Select 7arget (B).  The tracking/targeting
system  is  limited  to  targets  stored in your onboard computer database.
This  group  of  course always includes your primary and secondary targets.
To  find  the  right  target, you may have to tap Select Target (B) several
times.   When  the  primary  or secondary target is located, your right MFD
informs you

To  track  a  target  not stored in your onboard computer tap Designate New
Target (N).  The nearest potential target ahead is temporarily added to the
computers database.  Once you've added a target to the database, it remains
in the computer and becomes part of the group that Select Target (B) cycles
through.  You can store only one new target in the database at a time.

4.   Select  Weapon:   Tap  Select  Weapon (Space Bar) to cycle through the
weapons in your bays (Your cannon is always available.)

Make sure you have the correct weapon selected.  The size and colour of the
Tracking  Box  on  the  HUD  indicates  how effective the current weapon is
against the target (see Display Colors Summary in the Appendix).

5.  Aim and Fire:  Different weapons are aimed in different ways, described
below.   Depending  on the weapon selected, make sure it is correctly aimed
at the target before you fire.

6.  Observe Results:  Friendly AWACS aircraft observing your mission report
the  results.   Sometimes  a  hit  damages  a target without destroying it,
sometimes  you  miss  entirely,  and  other times a hit may be ineffective.
Ineffective  hits  are  caused  by  using  the wrong weapon, or because the
weapon malfunctioned.

All  your missiles are self guided (fire and-forget) weapons, and there are
several  available to you.  Some are used against enemy aircraft and others
are  used  against  ground targets.  All fire-and forget missiles are aimed
and fired in a similar fashion (described below).

Missile  Targeting  Envelope:   If the HUD is in Air mode and an air to air
missile  is  your current weapon, the Missile Targeting Envelope appears on
the  HUD  outlining  the  limits of your missile's seeker head; though your
Tracking  Camera  can lock-on to a target any where, the air-to air missile
itself  can lock on to in range enemy aircraft only within this circle.  In
CND  mode,  no targeting envelope appears, but a missile cannot lock onto a
target that is not currently visible through your HUD.

Oval  Lock-on:   When  the Tracking Box turns oval (and the "LOCK" light on
the  console  begins  flashing), the missile is locked on to the target and
has  a  good  chance  of  hitting.  When the oval turns red (and the "LOCK"
light  stops  flashing)  the  missile has superior accuracy.  Additionally,
when  the  missile locks-on, a box (the "Lock Box") appears in the Tracking
Camera  display, and when you have attained superior accuracy, the Lock Box
begins repeatedly contracting.

To  fire,  open  the weapons bay by tapping Bay Doors (8) and then tap Fire
Weapon (Return/Enter).

Restrictions and Suggestions:  Missiles drop about 300-400` - with whatever
airspeed,  climb  rate,  or dive rate your plane has before their own power
carries  them  away.   As a general rule, launching below 500 or in a power
dive  is  not a good idea, and may even be dangerous.  It is also unwise to
launch  while  in  a tight turn or inverted, as the missile may tumble when
leaving  the  bay,  losing guidance or even smashing into your plane.  Once
the  missile  is  launched  you can change to new targets, new weapons, and
maneuver as you wish.

Your  cannon  has a maximum range of 6 km and an effective range of about 3
km.

Air-to-Air  Anticipation  Firing:  Your cannon's fire control system uses a
"historical  gunsight"  that  shows  where your shells would be landing, if
you`d  fired  a few seconds ago.  Unless you're tracking a target, the fire
control  system  assumes  the  range to be 6 km, and places the gunsight to
show where the shells would be had

If  you  are  tracking  a  target, the system uses the current range to the
target to calculate where to place the sight on your HUD.  The Tracking Box
shows  the  targeted  enemy airplane and the range to the target appears in
the right MFD.

To  fire, you must "anticipate" when the enemy and your gunsight will meet.
For example, if the enemy and your gunsight are converging and the range to
the  target  is  6  km.   You  should open fire about 6 seconds before they
converge.   If  you  estimated  correctly,  they will converge just as your
gunsight moves onto them.

Air-to-Ground  Walking Fire:  Attacking ground targets is much easier since
they  don`t  move.   The  easiest  way  is  by "walking" your fire over the
target.   Do  this by flying low (about 500'), opening fire about 6 km from
the target and observing where the shells hit the ground.  Guide your plane
to  "push"  the  advancing explosions onto the target.  Unfortunately, this
technique consumes ammo rapidly unless you fire short, well-spaced bursts

Bombing

Laser  guided bombs are essentially motorless missiles that glide from your
plane  to  a target "painted" by the PAVE TACK laser mounted on your plane.
Operating  these weapons is a lot like launching self guided missiles.  You
use the tracking / targeting system in exactly the same way with only a few
exceptions.

Oval  and  MFD lock-on:  The Tracking Box on the HUD frames your target and
the  Tracking  Camera is locked onto it.  When the Tracking Box turns oval,
the bomb is locked onto the reflected laser energy and has a good chance of
hitting.  When the oval turns red, the bomb has superior accuracy.

However,  because  you  must  release  the bomb so close to the target, you
often  can`t  see the Tracking Oval when it turns red; for this reason, you
must rely upon the console "LOCK" light and Lock Box in the Tracking Camera
to tell you when the optimal release time is.

The  Lock Box appears on the right MFD and the "LOCK" light begins flashing
when  the  Tracking  Box  turns  oval.   When  the  optimal release time is
reached,  the  "LOCK"  light ceases flashing, and the Lock Box on the right
MFD begins repeatedly contracting.

Toss  Bombing:  Glide bombs travel as fast as your plane, so if you release
at  low  altitude,  they  hit  the target when your plane is about directly
overhead; if you`re not careful the explosion can destroy you.

The  standard attack technique is called "toss bombing".  Approach fast and
level  at  about  500.   When 3-6 km from the target pitch up into a 30-40o
climb,  tap  Bay  Doors (8) to open the bay, and watch the right MFD.  When
optimal  release  time  is reached (the Lock Box begins contracting and the
"LOCK"  light  stops flashing), tap Fire Weapon (Return / Enter) to release
the bomb and turn away.

Level  Bombing:   You  can  also level bomb with glide bombs.  As a general
rule  though, you'll need to attack from at least 2,000 altitude.  Here you
can  lock onto the target at 4 km range.  Attack immediately and turn away.
Needless to say, however, high altitude attacks make you a sitting duck for
enemy radar and SAMs.

Restrictions and Suggestions:  You must keep the underside of your aircraft
facing  the  target until the bomb hits.  If not, the laser guidance breaks
and  the bomb will almost surely miss.  You can fly over the target instead
of  flying  past  at  an  angle,  but you must rise above 3,000` to do this
safely.   However,  the  blast  has a danger zone of roughly 3,000`, so you
must gain enough distance or altitude to avoid the blast.

Retarded Bombs

Retarded  bombs  are  unguided  but have parachutes or special fins to slow
them  down  very quickly as they fall.  As a result, you can be far away by
the time they impact, allowing safe low altitude bombing runs

Level  Bombing:  Dive bombing and toss bombing don`t produce useful results
with  retarded  bombs,  so  you  must  use  level  bombing in this standard
technique  for low altitude runs with retarded bombs, fly straight and fast
over  the  target at 600-800`, releasing the bomb(s) according to cues from
the Flightpath Guide and Ranging Bar on the HUD.

Flightpath   Guide:    When  using  retarded  bombs,  the  diamond-  shaped
Flightpath  Guide  appears  on  your  HUD.   Turn  to  align the Flightpath
indicator  to  the  Flightpath  Guide.   You  can  be  above  or  below the
Flightpath Guide without losing accuracy, but being left or right of it may
cause a miss.

Ranging  Bar:   As  you approach the target, the Ranging Bar appears on the
HUD.   As  you  near  the  target,  the  bar begins to collapse; the cue to
release is when the line becomes a single dot.  You may wish to extend your
brakes to make the bombing run more manageable

To  Release  the  Bomb, tap Bay Doors (8) to open the bay, then Fire Weapon
(Return)  to  release  the weapon if your brakes are extended, retract them
immediately after launch to escape the blast area.

Restrictions  and  Suggestions:   Retarded bombs are the easiest and safest
weapons to use, and one of the most popular among USAF pilots.  If you keep
up speed in your bombing run, you can safely release from 600`, even though
the  blast  area  is 3,000`.  The Ranging Bar and Flightpath Guide flash if
you're  too  low for safe release However, the targeting system predictions
assume  you'll  continue  to  fly  "as  is".   If  you drop the bomb.  then
immediately  turn  up  and  away,  you could drop a bomb within the "danger
area" and escape.

Free Fall Bombs

These  are traditional bombs that arc down at high speed toward the target.
In level bombing.  The techniques for using them are identical to those for
retarded  bombs  except  that you need to be considerably higher to release
them  safely.   A  safe  minimum altitude for releasing a free fall bomb in
level bombing is 3,000` as opposed to 600` for retarded bombs

Level Bombing:  You use the Flightpath Guide and Ranging Bar just as you do
or retarded bombs, but you have one additional HUD cue:  the Bombsight Fall
line and Bullseye.  In level bombing this indicator may be ignored

Bombsight  Fall-line and Bullseye:  This indicator appears on your HUD as a
line  extending from your Flightpath Indicator to the place on the ground a
bomb would hit were it released now.  At that point is a red oval bullseye.
In  level bombing the fall line indicator usually extends off the bottom of
the  HUD,  with the bullseye out of sight below.  But in dive bombing it is
indispensable.

Dive  Bombing:  To make a dive bombing at tack, start by flying low to ward
the  target.   Switch your HUD to GND mode, make sure the correct weapon is
selected (Mk82-0 Slick or Mk 122 Fireye), and put your Tracking Camera onto
the target.  Now follow these steps:

1.   Guide  on  the  Bomb sight Flight Path:  Approach the target by flying
straight  at  the diamond shaped bombing flight path indi cator.  It`s okay
if  the  indica  tor is above or below your flight path, but make sure it`s
not to the left or right.

2.Climb  to Attack Point:  When the target is about 6 km away (you can tell
by  looking  at  the right MFD), zoom up into a 55o climb to an altitude of
8.000'  opening  your  bay  doors  as  you climb (tap Bay Doors (8)).  Your
objective is to reach 8,000` about 1.5-2 km from the target.

3.Dive  on to the Target:  Level out, flick open the brakes (tapBrakes (0).
At  just  under  1 km away, push down into a steep (80o) dive and align the
Bomb  Bullseye  with  the target box.  Keep an eye on your altitude because
you  must release the bomb before reaching 3.000.  If you can`t line up the
Bullseye and Tracking Box before reaching 3,000` pull out and try again.

4.   Release Bomb and Turn Away:  If you manage to keep the bullseye steady
within  the  target  box before reaching 3,000`, release a bomb immediately
(tap  Fire  Weapon  (Return)), then another if possible.  After the release
pull up sharply and roll away in a 90o turn.  Close the brake (0) as you do
this.   To  maintain maximum speed into the turn.  Then close the bay doors
(8)

Suggestions:   The  zoom  climb to 8,000` is the most critical phase of the
attack.   If  performed  flawlessly, a 55o climb will cover 4 km of ground,
assuming  you  start  at  maximum level speed at 200` and wish to arrive at
8,000`.   Some  pilots  prefer to use a slightly shallower zoom climb up to
10,000`, but this exposes you longer to enemy detection

Climbing to a dive bombing position usually broadcasts your presence to the
opposition.   Therefore, once you`re turning away from the target after the
bombing run look over and check the missile warning lights for an attack

The  most common mistake when dive bombing is forgetting to open the brakes
at  the  top of the climb.  With the brakes closed you plummet so fast it`s
almost  impossible  to  line  up  the  target  and  release the bomb before
reaching 3,000`.

Restrictions:   The  HUD  bombing  symbols flash if you're within the blast
area  of the bomb (within 3,000` of the predicted drop point).  Do not drop
the bomb unless you`re confident you can escape the blast

Photos And Special Equipment

The  135mm/IR  Camera  is a reconnaissance camera mounted in a weapons bay.
It  is  fixed forward (unlike your target Tracking Camera, which moves) and
looks down.

Camera Operation:  To configure your HUD and cockpit for camera operations:

1 Switch the HUD to GND mode by tapping HUD mode (F2)

2.   Select  the bay containing the camera by tapping Select Weapons (Space
Bar).

3.   Aim  the  Tracking  Camera at the target by tapping Cam Ahead (/); tap
Select Target (B) if necessary.

4.  Tap Bay Doors (8) to open the bay doors.

Taking  Pictures:  When you open the bay, you see the ground below and just
ahead of your plane in the right MFD, which is now viewing through the lens
of  the  camera.  Fly so that the cross symbol ("+") in the lower center of
the  HUD passes through the center of the Tracking Box.  When this happens,
you`ll  see the target pass through the lens on the right MFD.  As it does,
hit  Fire  Weapon  (Return) one or more times to take the pictures.  You'll
see  a  message  on  the HUD indicating a good picture (when and if you get
one).

Special Equipment

Delivering or Picking up Equipment:  As a stealth pilot, you`ll be required
to make deliveries of highly classified materials; you may also be asked to
pick  up top secret items.  Finding a secret airbase and landing there is a
major  challenge.   They have no ILS system just a few flares at either end
of  the  runway!  Furthurmore, the runway is very short; it's only half the
length of a runway at a major airbase

To  pick  up or deliver equipment at a secret airbase, you must safely land
at  the  airbase.   Equipment  is  unloaded  or  materials delivered to you
automatically.   A mes sage in the HUD indicates when this has occurred and
you can take off again.

Dropping  Equipment:   To  drop  equipment,  tap Select Weapons (Space Bar)
until "EQUIP" appears in the lower left corner of the HUD Tap Bay Doors (8)
to  open  the  bay,  then,  as  you  pass over the radio beacon, launch the
equipment by tapping Fire Weapons (Return/Enter).

The minimum safe altitude to drop equipment is 500`.  Try to avoid dropping
it  from altitudes above 1,000`, since the bigher you are the less accurate
the drop.

Defensive Actions

Radar And Stealth Tactics

Radar  sends high frequency electromagnetic waves through the atmosphere at
virtually  light speed.  These waves are reflected from solid object - some
return  to  the  radar  set,  which  includes a receiver.  By measuring the
strength  and angles of returning waves, and time it took to return, radars
estimate the range, position, heading, and size of an object.

Radar  waves  bounce  best from solid, dense, flat, perpendicular surfaces.
Tradi-  tional  aircraft  shapes,  especially  aircraft  engine intakes and
vertical tail fins make excellent radar reflectors.

Radar  Effectiveness:   The  effectiveness  of  radar  varies with terrain,
range, and ype (pulse or Doppler).  Radar is most effective over open water
or  flat  countryside.   In wooded and rolling hills radar effectiveness is
less,  while  in  mountainous country it is greatly reduced.  The lower the
radar  effectiveness,  the  weaker  the  signal on your EMV scale; the bars
representing enemy radar signals become shorter.

Radar  Range:   Radar  effectiveness is dramatically affected by range; the
closer  you  are  to  a  radar, the stronger its signal Maximum range for a
radar varies dramati- cally with the set.  As enemy radars emit signals you
can graphically see their ranges on the Satellite/Radar map on the left MFD
(Maps, F3)

Pulse  Radar:   Pulse radar is represented by dotted arcs on your satellite
map.   It  is least effective when your nose or tail is pointing toward it,
and  most effective when you fly at right angles to it.  Therefore a common
tactic  is  to  fly  directly  at a pulse radar, then just after it emits a
signal make a tight turn and fly away from it again.

Doppler  Radar:   Doppler  radar  is  represented  by  solid  arcs  on your
satellite  map; it is generally more powerful than pulse.  Doppler radar is
most  effective  when  you`re  flying  toward  or  away  from it, and least
effective when you fly at right angles to it.  Therefore a common tactic is
to fly toward a Doppler until just before it detects you, then turn and fly
in an arc around it, keeping a constant distance.

Stealth Technology

The  radar  reflections  of  an  object  are  greatly  reduced if its shape
minimizes  the  returning  waves.  This does not make the object invisible,
but  does  make it very hard to "see." For example, if a normal airplane is
visible  to radar at 200 km, a carefully shaped airplane might be invisible
be-  yond  50  km!   Creating this shape in a form that is also aerodynamic
requires  ex  tremely  complex computer modeling.  As the world's leader in
computer  applica tions, it's inevitable that the US would be first in this
field.   The  SR-71  spyplane  is an early example of such shapes in aerody
namics;  the  redesign of the B-1 bomber fuselage is another example.  Both
these  aircraft,  though,  have curved fuselages that tend to scatter radar
energy   equally   in  all  directions,  and  therefore  aren't  en  tirely
successful.

In  addition  to shape, certain rubber and ceramic compounds "absorb" radar
waves,  making  the  return  signal  weaker.   Known  generically  as Radar
Absorbent Material (RAM), it can be incorporated into paints, or planted in
"wedges" along the surface of a wing or fuselage.

Finally,  an airplane's heat signature is an important consideration.  Many
air-  plane  killing  missiles  (IR  guided ones) home on heat sources like
friction  heated  parts  of  the craft, such as leading edges of the wings,
tail,  and  air  intakes.  The main defense against heat seekers is heat-re
sistant materials, and masking and dis persal of hot engine exhaust.

The  F-117A  is  a  combination  of  all  these  design considerations.  It
sacrifices  speed,  maneuverability,  and payload for maximum stealth.  The
fuselage  is made up entirely of flat "facets" that scatter radar energy in
a  controlled.   predictable  pattern, which, under most circumstances will
not  reflect radar transmissions back to the transmitter Even if the energy
does  strike  one  of  the  plane's flat surfaces, the effect is transitory
because  the  angle  of  incidence is constantly changing due to the planes
motion  relative  to the transmitter.  The tail is twinned, does not extend
vertically,  and  is  swept  back  like  the wings themselves so that radar
energy  is  reflected  45o  left and right into the sky behind the aircraft
(there  is  no  other  reason  for  the  subsonic F-117A to have near delta
wings).   All  vertical  surfaces  on the F-117A are angled at least 30o so
that, in level flight, no truly vertical surfaces are present.

The  air  intakes  of  the engines are masked upper and lower hull and wing
surfaces  are  covered with RAM.  All weapons are carried internally, since
external  pylons and armaments are excellent radar reflectors.  All leading
edges incorporate heat resistant surfaces and are as sharp as possible both
to  reduce  air  friction  and  to  reflect  radar  energy  away  from  the
transmitter.

Stealth  also demands a new approach to combat operations.  For decades jet
aircraft  have  carried  radars  of  increasing  power,  using  them to aim
weapons,  check  altitude,  and  fly  low  at  high speeds.  All this radar
broadcasting  reveals  a  plane  long  before  enemy radars discover it.  A
stealth  aircraft must fly without active radar emissions.  The F-117A uses
visual, thermal, and laser systems instead of radars.  In addition.  It has
a  radio  burst  decoder  that  is  compatible with other USAF transmission
equipment.   On an active mission the F-117A constantly receices data burst
from friendly AWACS planes and ground radars.

Overall,  the  F-117A  is  most  difficult to detect at very low altitudes.
Even  at  higher  altitudes  (over 10,000`) it is far less visible on radar
than  a  normal aircraft.  This not only allows the F-117A to "sneak up" on
the enemy.  It also reduces the range and accuracy of enemy weapons

Stealth Tactics

EMV:   The  F-117A`s  stealth  configuration  is most effective when flying
level  at  low  altitudes (at 500` or less and preferably about 200').  The
EMV  is  further  reduced if the engines are throttled back to cruise speed
(70%  power).   Level flight, which presents a horizontal profile, is best.
The steeper the turn, the more topside or underside surface is presented as
a radar reflector, and thus your EMV rises.

With  respect  to Doppler radar, your flight path is of crucial importance.
Changing  distance  relative  to  a  Dop  pler  radar increases the risk of
detection  many  fold.  If you remain at a constant distance, arcing around
the radar, Doppler detection ability drops dramatically.

Opening  the  bay doors, firing a weapon, or using the ECM jammer all raise
your  EMV, making the plane more visible.  On the plus side, if you want to
deliberately  lure the enemy to a certain location without wasting a decoy,
then  turning  on your jammer, opening the bay, and spi ralling upward in a
tight  turn  often raises the EMV enough to make you visible.  You can then
close up, dive down to 200` again, and zoom away while they chase phantoms.

Threading the Needle:  As a stealth pilot, you must plan carefully, seeking
the best route through en emy radar defenses.  You must find a route in and
out  that  either  makes  you  invisible,  or visible for the shortest time
possible.

Penetrating  enemy  radar  umbrellas  is  tricky.   Re member to arc around
Doppler  radars,  but fly directly toward (or away from) pulse radars.  The
plotting  of  paths  through radar areas is sometimes termed "threading the
needle."

Pulse  radars  are  shorter  ranged and less efficient so Dopplers are your
biggest  problem.   If you must fly into a pulse radar's effective range to
avoid  a  Doppler,  you can arc around just inside and hope your EMV is low
enough, and their crews sleepy enough that they don`t see you.

Even  the  best  of  plans must be modified once the mission starts.  Enemy
fighters  patrols  and  IL-76  Mainstays can force you to change your plan,
while  the  periodic  shut  downs  of  enemy  radars  can suddenly open new
opportunities.  You must be flexible

Low  Altitude Tactics:  On long missions with flight legs outside effective
enemy  radar  range  it's perfectly safe to use the autopilot and cruise at
500`.   When  within enemy radar range, get as low as you can.  Fly through
valleys - between hills and mountains if possible.  Although coming up over
ridge  lines  is  fun,  every  time  you crest a ridge you take a chance of
detection.

One  especially  sneaky  tactic  is to fly extremely low (200` or less) and
throttle  back  your  engine to about 30%.  You'll need to extend flaps and
pitch up to stay airbourne, but your EMV gets extremely low.

Decoys:In  Cold or Limited War, you must avoid leaving a positive radar ID.
If your flight path takes you too close to enemy radar, you can try leaving
one  or  two  decoys behind.  This can prevent them from getting a positive
radar ID on you.

Dash:   Many  radars  turn  off  periodically if you see a critical Doppler
radar  station stop broadcasting.  That may give you just the time you need
to  get past without being seen.  Dashing through a radar`s area while he`s
off  the  air  is  always risky; you never know if he`ll "wake up" and find
you, but sometimes there's no other way.

Blast:  If you can't think of any better way to get through the enemy radar
screen  a  final  device  is  to open a gap in the radar defenses.  Using a
Maverick  or  HARM  missile  to destroy a radar at some critical sites.  Of
course.   you`ve  got  to dash through the gap and get away quickly.  Since
enemy  aircraft are drawn like flies to the site of an attack.  Other radar
stations  will  "wake  up" and stay on the air after an attack.  One way to
"set  up  "a  blast attack is show yourself briefly in one location drawing
enemy fighters away from the area you plan to fly through and/or attack

Disappearing:   If  you  are detected and attacked by radar guided missiles
(either  the  "TRAK" light is on, or the "RAD" missile warning is lighted),
you  can  evade  the attack by reducing your EMV.  If the enemy radar loses
sight  of  you  the  missile  loses  guidance  and  flies  blindly ahead it
continues  until  either  the  enemy finds you again and steers the missile
back on course, or the missile runs out of fuel.

Dealing With Surface To Air Missiles (SAMs)

To  cope  with  enemy  SAMs,  you should understand the principles of their
opera tion.  Then you can intelligently apply ap propriate defenses.

Radar-Controlled SAMs

Concept:   Medium-  and  long  ranged SAMs are controlled by radar.  Radar-
guided missiles appear as yellow lines on your Tactical Display (left MFD).
There  are three types of radar guided SAMs:  beam riders, semi active, and
command guid- ance.  All use the same three-step process to engage targets:

1  Radar  search:   Search  radar  scans  the sky for alien planes.  Search
radars  scan an entire 360 area periodically (watch your EMV and satellite
map for this).

2  Radar  tracking:   When a search ra dar finds your plane, it "hands off"
the prospective target to a narrow beam fire control radar, usually running
on  a  differ  ent frequency, which locks onto your craft (the "TRAK" light
illuminates).

3.   Radar  control:   When  the  operators  are  sure the beam is tracking
correctly they launch a missile (The "RAD" light illuminates).

The narrow beam radar continues tracking your plane so the missile's course
can  be updated and corrected.  There are two common methods of doing this.
The  older  "beam rider" (or "command guid- ance") technique, and the newer
"semi active homing" technique.

Beam  Rider  SAMs:  While the narrow beam radar continues tracking you, the
SAM  guides  along  the beam.  As long as the tracking beam remains on your
plane, the SAM will hit.

Semi-Active  SAMs:   Semi active SAMs have radar receivers and computers on
board.   The  tracking radar on the ground "paints" the target with a radar
beam and the missiles nose receiver "catches" the reflections.  The missile
homes on these reflections until it hits you.

Command  Guidance  SAMs:   These modern missiles use semi active guid ance,
but  the firer has a command link to the missile, as well, which he can use
to override the semi active guidance.  This means that if the missile loses
guidance  or  is  otherwise  confused,  the  ground controller can turn the
missile around and try again.

Evading Radar-Guided SAMs

Reduce  EMV:  The basic way to evade radar-guided SAMs is to disappear from
their  radar.   If  their signals are just barely overlapping your EMV, you
should find a way to simply "disappear." Obviously the further you are from
the  enemy  radar, the weaker the signal.  Therefore you may wish to simply
turn  and run until the signal is too weak to "see" you.  If the enemy is a
Doppler  radar,  at  various  points you should turn parallel to the radar.
When you do his signal weakens.  Also reducing your altitude, lowering your
engine  power, and levelling out your flight will help.  Make sure your bay
is closed, your gear up, and the ECM jammer is off.

Decoys:   A  decoy  will fool enemy radar for 20 to 60 seconds depending on
the  skill  of  the  enemy.   During this time missiles (and aircraft) will
pursue  the  decoy instead of you.  This gives you a perfect opportunity to
outmaneuver the missile by escaping its 45o field of view

ECM:   Your  ECM (electronic counter measures) radar jammer is an excellent
defense  against  beam  riders.   As  long  as it's running they are flying
blind,  and  therefore  unable  to hit you.  ECM jammers are useful only at
long  range against semi active SAMs.  Remember that if you continue flying
toward  a jammed semi active missile, eventually it will "burn through" and
start homing on you.

Caution:   ECM jamming makes a lot of noise.  Therefore, don`t use a jammer
against semi active SAMs unless you're going to turn away.

Chaff:   Each  chaff cartridge deploys a cloud of tiny tin-foil strips that
reflect  enemy radar.  For two or more seconds the strips form a huge radar
reflector, effectively blinding the missile, like a smoke screen Therefore,
the  classic  chaff technique is to wait until the missile is just a couple
seconds away (i.e., when the Missile Proximity Klaxon sounds).

At  that  instant,  tap  Chaff (1) to fire a chaff cartridge and turn away.
The  blinded missile will fly straight into the chaff.  Warning:  Chaff may
not  fool a Doppler guided missile such as SA-10, SA-12, SA-N-6, or AA-10).
In   this   case   you   must   turn  perpendicular  to  the  missile  (see
"Outmaneuvering Missiles" below).

Warnings  and Responses:  Your F-117A gives you four separate warnings that
you are under missile attack:

1.   Your first warning of a radar SAM attack appears on your EMV scale and
your HUD when enemy search radar finds you:  you'll notice the search radar
signal  overlap your EMV, the EMV light illuminates briefly, a warning beep
sounds, and a message appears on the HUD.

2.   Your  second warning is when the narrow beam tracking radar locks onto
your  plane,  setting  off the "TRAK" light on your console, and initiating
another  warning  tone.   During these stages reducing the EMV is your best
response

3.   Your  third  and  most important warning comes when a missile has been
launched  and  is  tracking  you:   the  "RAD" missile warning light begins
flashing  and  another message stating the type of missile launched appears
on  your HUD.  Reducing your EMV at this point may derail the enemy attack,
but  if you.re too close to the radar you must use other defenses.  Against
a  beam-rider  turn  on  the  ECM  jammer  (tap ECM (4)) and change course.
Against  a  semi-active  missile  either jam with ECM or drop a decoy, then
change  course  (some  pilots  use  both - decoy first, then the jammer for
insurance).  However, this technique only makes sense if you can escape the
missiles 45o field of view before the decoy and/or ECM effects end.

4.   Your final warning is the Missile Proximity Klaxon.  which sounds when
the  missile is just a few of seconds away.  Check the console if the "RAD"
light  is  flashing  then  a  radar missile is inbound.  Immediately drop a
chaff cartridge and turn away.

Infrared (IR) Homing SAMs

Concept:   Short range SAMs are usually IR homing IR missiles appear as red
lines  on  your  Tactical  Display  (left MFD).  Like radar guided SAMs the
largest and most powerful use a three step process to find and engage you:

1.  Radar search:  A search radar finds your aircraft (watch the EMV scale)

2.   Radar  tracking:   A  tracking radar follows your aircraft (the "TRAK"
light)

3 Missile launch:  The IR homing missile is launched (the "IR" light)

For  the  remainder  of  the  flight  to  the  target,  tracking  radar  is
unnecessary, because the missile guides itself.

Some shorter ranged IR SAMs use a much simpler method:

1  Search:   The  enemy  detects  you  either  with  search radar or simple
eyesight.

2 Missile lock on:  The missile "locks on" to hot surfaces of your plane

3 Missile launch:  The missile is launched and guides itself to the target.

Shoulder-Launched  IR  SAMs:   The  existence of man portable IR SAMs makes
your life difficult.  The enemy frequently waits until point blank range to
launch  these missiles, the preferred technique being to launch them during
your attack run.

Carried  by  infantrymen, in trucks and jeeps, or stacked inside a building
door,  they  are  virtually undetectable until fired.  Wherever significant
enemy military ground forces are deployed you can expect to encounter these
weapons.   This  includes  rear  area  headquarters  and  depots as well as
front-line  troops (you`ll know where these concentrations are expectted to
be from your intelligence briefing).

First-generation  IR Homers:  Early IR homing systems required a large heat
signature  to  "lock-on"  to.   The  only  area of a jet hot enough was the
engine  exhaust,  so the missile wouldn't "lock on" until aimed at the rear
of  the  plane.  Furthur, the homing head wasn`t sophisticated or sensitive
enough to distinguish between the jet exhaust and the sun or even hot rocks
on the ground

Your  IR jammer is almost guaranteed to confuse first generation IR homers.
As  long  as  you leave the jammer on, the missile will be unable to follow
your plane Remember, though, that the jammer slows you down, and eventually
overheats, which shuts it off automatically

You  can  even  outmaneuver first-generation IR missiles by turning tightly
toward  them  This "rotates" your hot exhaust away from the missile's view.
The  missile  may  try  to  turn  and follow but a tight enough turn always
outmaneuvers it (see "Outmaneu-

Second-generation  IR  Homers:   Modern  IR  homing  systems  are  far more
effective.   They  are  fine  tuned  to  "recognize" temperature variations
typical  of  aircraft,  including  not  only  the exhaust, but all surfaces
heated  by  air  friction.  This heating typically occurs at the nose, wing
roots,  and  across  the  upper  surfaces  of the plane.  Your IR jammer is
effective only at long ranges against second generation IR homers.

Evading IR SAMs

Reduce  EMV:   Unfortunately,  reducing your EMV has no effect upon IR SAMs
already  launched,  but  if  you  become  invisible to search radar, it can
prevent  the  enemy  from  launching others.  EMV reduction methods are the
same as described above.

Decoys:  A decoy will fool enemy IR missiles for 15 to 6O seconds.  Tactics
are  therefore  like  those  for  decoys  against radar guided missiles get
outside the missiles view before the decoy expires.

IR  Jammers:   This device is a heat strobe that sends out heat pulses that
confuse  a missile's guidance system.  Unfortunately this equipment employs
a  generator  to provide power.  reducing your airspeed by roughly 15%.  In
addition, it shuts down before it overheats and melts and will not function
again until sufficiently cooled.

First generation IR missiles are easily confused at almost any range by the
IR  jammer, but second generation IR missiles are more "intelligent".  They
are  "fooled" by IR jammers only at long ranges (in fact, at closer ranges,
some  second  generation  IR  seekers actually lock onto the jammer) It is,
therefore,  unwise - and sometimes dangerous to leave a jammer running when
second generation IR missiles are close

Flares:   Although  called  "flares,"  these  are  small, finely tuned heat
decoys.   A  flare  lures  IR  missiles  toward  it, but only during the 25
seconds  it  burns.   After  that  the  flare  dies and the missile resumes
seeking.   Therefore,  wait for the Missile Proximity Klaxon, drop a flare.
then turn away.

Warnings  and Responses:  Your first warning of an IR missile attack may be
identical  to  that  of  a  radar  guided  one:  your EMV light illuminates
briefly,  you  hear  a  warning beep, and a message appears on the HUD.  At
that  point  its  immpossible to tell whether the detecting radar site will
launch  an  IR or radar guided SAM.  However, when the missile is launched,
the "IR" missile warning light begins flashing and you receive a message on
the HUD announcing the type of missile launched.

In  many  cases,  however,  your  first warning of an IR attack is the "IR"
missile  warning  light,  because  many IR SAMs don`t use search radar just
eyesight searching

If  you  know  the missile is a first generation, (which you will if you`ve
studied up on enemy SAMs), you can turn on the IR jammer and change course.
Otherwise you`ll have to wait for the Missile Proximity Klaxon which may be
a  very  short  time  because  many  IR  missiles are fired from very short
ranges.   Often, the flashing, "IR" light is followed almost immediately by
the klaxon.  When you hear the klaxon and see the "IR" light flashing, your
first act must be to drop a flare and dodge!

Alternatively,  of course, you can outmaneuver the missile if you`re really
good.

Outmaneuvering Missiles

It`s  important  to  remember  that  defense  devices aren't perfect.  Some
missiles  can  "burn through" ECM, all continue seeking after your decoy or
chaff  expires,  and  Doppler  missiles  will ignore chaff if you're on the
wrong  course.   Therefore  it`s important to maneuver out of the missile's
field  of  view when the defense expires.  if you don't, the missile may re
acquire  you  and resume tracking!  (A truly skillful pilot may outmaneuver
an  enemy  missile  without  any mechanical aid.  Smart pilots normally use
both their equipment and their skills.)

Techniques   for   outmaneuvering   IR  missiles  and  radar  missiles  are
essentially  the  same.   But since IR missiles tend to be smaller and more
maneuverable - second generation IRs are often the most maneuverable you`re
best off relying on decoys, jammers and/or flares against them.

Evading  the  Missile's  View:   SAMs can only "home" on targets within the
acquisition  arc of their seeker.  This arc is a bare 45o directly in front
of  the  missile.   If  decoys,  jammers, or whatever temporarily confuse a
missile.  You can evade attack by moving outside this 45o arc.  Usually the
quickest escape course is one perpendicular to the missile's heading.

Turning inside a Missile:  When a missile is close, you still have a chance
to  outmaneuver  it, because you can turn faster than it can.  If a missile
is  trying  to fly up your tail, roll over onto a wingtip for a tight turn,
then pull straight back on the control stick.  Keep an eye on your airspeed
because  the plane will soon the plane will stall in this attitude, but the
missile makes a wider turn, causing it to zoom past harmlessly

Turning toward a Missile:  If a SAM approaches you from the side, gradually
turn toward it.  Increasing the tightness of your turn as it comes closer

The   objective   is   to   keep  the  missile's  course  at  right  angles
(perpendicular) to your own.  This tactic works because the missile can not
turn with you.  Instead it gradually falls behind zooming past your tail.

Evading  Frontal  Attacks:   If  a  SAM approaches you from the front, wait
until  its  between  8 and 12 km away (about two thirds of a grid square on
the  tactical display).  Then make a quick 90o turn.  This puts the missile
facing your side.  Now roll over 180o and turn toward the missile.

Doppler  Missiles:   Enemy  missiles  with  Doppler  guidance systems are a
special  danger.   These missiles will not home on chaff unless your course
is  perpendicular  (at right angles to) the missile.  If the missile chases
you  from  the  rear  or  attacks from straight ahead, chaff has no effect.
Only  three  SAMs  currently  have  Doppler guidance:  the SA-10 SA-12, and
SA-N-6.  Only one air to air missile has Doppler guidance the AA-10.

AIR-TO-AIR DUELS

Using Air To Air Missiles (AAMs)

The  MicroProse  F-117A  (with  "enhanced capability") carries two types of
AAMs;  the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the AIM-9M "Sidewinder." (The Lockheed F-117A
carries  no  to-air weapons at all; it's never expected to be seen by enemy
fighters,  much  less  go out looking for a fight with them.) Like all your
missiles,  these  AAMs  are self guided, "fire and-forget" weapons that are
easy  to  use  and possibly the world`s best.  The techniques for targeting
and  firing  these  weapons  are  identical  to those for other self guided
missiles (see page 68)

AIM-120  AMRAAMS:   Your  AIM  120  AMRAAM  missile  is  one  of  the  best
medium-range  weapons in the world.  It is the only "fire and forget" radar
guided  missile  in US inventory.  It has sufficient circuitry to penetrate
most  defenses,  and  maneuver-  ability  enough  to  chase down most enemy
fighters,  not  to mention bombers and transports.  Because the AIM-120 has
roughly  twice  the  range of the Sidewinder pilots typically open with the
AIM-120,  then  switch to Sidewinders if any enemy aircraft survive to that
range.

AIM-9M Sidewinders:  The short range AIM-9M Sidewinder is probably the best
dogfighting missile in the world.  It is more maneuverable than the AMRAAM,
giving  it  a  better chance of "hanging on" to a twisting, turning target.
Since  it  is  IR  guided.  The best place to fire the Sidewinder is up the
enemy's tailpipes.  Next is from above, diving down onto the top (hot side)
of  the  enemy plane.  The third best position is directly into the enemy's
nose.   Shots  against  an enemy plane as it crosses in front of you, or at
its underside (the cold side) have very little chance of hitting.  The main
weakness of the Sidewinder is its limited range

Missile  Ranges:   The  maximum  range of a missile depends not only on its
motor,  but  your  plane's  speed  at  launch  and  the  direction of enemy
movement.  The initial "lock on" range corresponds to missile maximum range
if  you're  at  maximum  speed.  However, if you're moving more slowly, the
missile may not get the extra boost needed to reach the target.

A much more important consideration is the enemy's heading relative to you.
If  he`s flying toward you.  Even a maximum range launch is likely to reach
him.   However,  if  the  target is flying away the missile may have a long
"stern  chase"  ahead  of it.  You should probably wait for optimal lock on
before launching.

Technique:   When  firing  a missile, always remember to open the bay doors
and  wait  for the lock-on.  If you don't wait for the target box to become
oval shaped, you`re firing without lock-on, and will almost certainly miss.
Then  look at your airspeed.  If you're moving fast (around 500 kts) or the
target  is  closing,  a  maximum  range  lock  on  shot  will probably hit.
However, if, your speed is low or the target is flying away from you should
wait until the range closes, ideally until the oval turns red.

Missile  accuracy  doesn't  take  into account enemy defensive equipment or
evasive  naneuvering.  First-line and elite fighter aircraft may prove more
difficult to hit.  although the "Mainstay" AEW&C craft maneuvers poorly, it
haa  superior  defensive  equipment.   You may find that guns are necessary
against Mainstays flown by a capable crew.

Firing  Attitude:   Also  remember that AAMs, like other missiles will fall
300-400`  before  their  motor can guide them away.  Until then the missile
has your speed and VVI if you're diving at the ground, the missile may slam
into  the  ground before it can fly away.  Firing in a tight turn, or while
inverted,  can  cause  the  missile to tumble as it leaves the weapons bay.
The wisest method is to fire only when you`re level and above 500 feet.

Target  Discrimination:   Sidewinders  and  AMRAAMs always home on the most
prominent  target,  which  is usually the nearest.  They will do so even if
you  were  tracking  someone else.  In Cold and Limited War, beware of this
limited  "brain  power" in your missiles.  You may be tracking a primary or
secondary  target,  fire  a  missile,  and  discover it goes for one of the
closer fighter escorts!

Notes:   Your  F-117A  uses  a  Tracking  Camera instead of weapon guidance
radars This system "downloads" appropriate launch parameters to the AIM-120
AMRAAM.   Although the AIM 120 itself uses radar, it is not activated until
the  missile  is  launched As a result, missile targeting does not increase
your  EMV.   Of  course  opening  the  bay  doors to fire does.  A skillful
stealth  pilot  opens  the  bay  doors  just  before  a launch, or during a
dogfight.

Using The 20mm Vulcan

The  Lockheed  F-117A  does  not have a cannon of any sort because it`s not
expected to need one; so if you prefer flying the Lockheed version, you can
ignore the following.  The MicroProse F-117A will definitely need a cannon,
and does, of course, carry a good one

Jet  aircraft  travel  so  fast  that  conventional machine guns and cannon
cannot  guarantee  a  hit:  a plane could literally fly between the shells.
Therefore,  modern  aircraft cannon are either a group of guns (such as the
twin 23mm cannons in many Russian MIGs) or a multi barrel Gatling gun (such
as  the six barrel 20mm M61A1 on most American jets).  Aircraft cannon have
an  effective  range of about 0.5-3 km and a maximum range of 6 km.  Inside
0.5 km there is a significant danger of "collateral damage."

More  About  the Historical Gunsight :  Your F-117A has the most modern and
advanced  gunsight available:  a "historical" gunsight with automatic laser
range  finding.   If  you're not tracking a target, this gunsight "assumes"
you  are  firing  at  maximum  range  (6  km).  If you're tracking a closer
target, the shorter range is used for gunsight calculations

The  gunsight  computer  constantly  calculates  range,  flight  path,  and
ballistics and displays where your shells would be if they were hitting the
target  now.   The  gunsight  continually  calculates  firing,  delays  the
appropriate   time  and  displays  potential  hits  as  they  would  occur.
Therefore,  the  sight  is  "assuming" you fired at the correct time in the
past.

The  gunsight  on  your  F-117A  uses  a  laser  range-finder sleved to the
Tracking Camera, rather than the traditional ranging radar.  This means you
can  use  your  gun  without  increasing  your EMV; however, when you begin
firing, of course, you create heat and this makes you more detectable.

Anticipation  Firing in Air-to-Air Engagements:  It takes about six seconds
for  M61A1 20mm shells to travel the maximum 6 kilometer range.  Therefore,
to hit a target you must judge the speed at which the target and your sight
coverage.   You  should  fire  about  six seconds before they meet.  If the
range  is  less  than  6 km, wait a little less.  For example, at 3 km wait
until target and sight are three seconds apart; at 1.5 km wait until target
and sight are one second apart, and so on.

You  can  use  this  sight like an old fashioned predicting sight.  That is
wait  until  the  sight  is  on  the target, then shoot.  But at 6 km range
you'll  have to hope the target stays on the same course for six seconds to
insure a hit.

In  short,  the  key to using a historical gunsight is anticipation.  Don`t
wait  for  the sight to reach the target.  Instead, learn to anticipate the
meeting of sight and target then shoot

Dealing With The Enemy

The best way to meet the enemy is to surprise him by sliding up behind him.
Enemy aircraft have only forward facing radars (except the IL-76 "Mainstay"
AEW&C  craft)  and will probably be unaware of your approach it you come up
from behind.

Traditionally  fighter pilots prefer to attack from above.  This gives them
an energy advantage in any dogfight, but missile tactics and the importance
of secrecy make height less valuable for a stealth pilot.  Gaining altitude
makes  you  visible  to  enemy  radar, which in turn may warn your targets.
Therefore,  approaching  low  and from behind is often wiser.  Only if your
missile  attacks  fail and the enemy discovers you should you begin to seek
an altitude advantage.

If  you're  surprised or "bounced" (attacked from above) by enemy fighters,
immedi  ately  look  for  incoming  missiles and take appropriate defensive
action.   Missiles  arrive  faster  than  aircraft,  and  therefore must be
avoided first.  Only then can you begin dogfighting or attempt to escape.

Missile Exchange

Often  an  air  to-air battle begins soon after you've de stroyed a target,
and  enemy fighters are vectored to intercept The result, quite frequently,
is a head-to-head face-off

In  this  Old West-style showdown each side starts with an exchange of long
to  medium  ranged  radar  guided missiles.  Be prepared to decoy, jam, and
possibly  chaff the "incoming." Once your radar missile is away switch to a
Sidewinder.   You  may  get a second close range missile shot if the AMRAAM
fails.

The  Early turn:  One of the most difficult, but useful maneuvers in a head
to  head  match is the early turn.  Against inexperienced pilots it's easy,
since  green horns usually keep boring in, hoping for a cannon shot Against
experienced  opponents an early turn requires fine timing; if you turn more
than  a  second  or  two  ahead  of  the  enemy  you're  telegraphing  your
intentions.  If you wait too long, you get no advantage.

Dealing with Enemy AAMs

Radar-Homing  AAMs:  The Russian AA-10 Alamo is a "fire and forget" missile
just  like your AIM-120 AMRAAM.  All other Russian radar-guided weapons are
semi active homers, which means that the firer must continue to "paint" you
with radar, because the missile homes on the reflected radar energy

You avoid radar-homing AAMs just like SAMs (see "Evading Radar Guided SAMs"
page  80).   That  is,  use reduced EMV, ECM jamming, and ultimately chaff.
Decoys  can  be  very  effective.   Note  that  the MiG-25 and MiG-31 carry
extremely  long  ranged  radar  AAMs.   Low  EMV, ECM and decoy tactics are
especially effective against these weapons.

IR-Homing  AAMs:   All  IR  homing  AAMs are self guided, "fire and forget"
weapons  Of  these  the  AA-8  is  the most dangerous because of its second
generation  IR seeker and great maneuverability.  If enemy MiGs and Sukhois
close to AA-8 range (8 km) you're often in big trouble.

Techniques to evade IR AAMs are the same as those used against IR SAMs (see
"Evading  IR  Guided  SAMs"  page  82).  That is, use the IR jammer at long
range, flares at short range; decoys also work.

In  practice,  many  IR homers are fired at short ranges during a dogfight.
This  means  you've  got  to  leap onto the IR jammer when you get a launch
warning, then dodge out of the missile`s 45 field of view immediately.  At
dogfighting  ranges missile flight times are very short you don't have time
to  fool  around!   If  this  fails,  or  you  delay  too long, the Missile
Proximity  Klaxon will go off.  Now you've got bare seconds to react:  dump
a flare immediately and dodge.

The  older  AA-2.  AA-6.  and AA-7 use first generation seekers.  The enemy
must  get  on  your  tail before these missiles lock on.  Keep him off your
tail and you avoid this entire class of weaponry.

Dogfighting Maneuvers

The  essential  rule  in dogfighting is to get on the enemy's tail.  On all
fighter  aircraft  guns and missile guidance systems only face forward.  If
you're  on  the enemies tail you can shoot and he cannot.  If you can't get
on  his  tail,  at  least try to place his aircraft ahead of you as much as
possible.    So  you  have  the  maximum  number  of  firing  opportunities
Maintaining  higher  speed  or altitude is valuable in a dogfight.  A plane
slower  and  lower  can  only  dodge attacks.  A plane faster or higher can
attack  or retreat as desired.  Having a higher speed or altitude is termed
the "energy advantage".

If  the  enemy  is  behind you, there are various classic escape maneuvers:
Turning  Inside,  the Scissors, the Immelmann, the Split-S.  and the Yo Yo.
Not only should you master them, but also learn to recognize them.

Turning  inside:   The simplest solution to an enemy plane coming up behind
you is turn toward him.  If you're turning faster than he, you'll gradually
circle  around  and  get  on  his  tail.   This  kind  of a "turn match" is
frequently seen when greenhorns dogfight Of course, if the enemy is turning
faster  than  you,  he  will  eventually  come  around behind you.  If this
happens  try  something else immediately.  The longer you wait the worse it
gets, until he lines up a shot and toasts you.

Scissors:  A more complex way to out turn an enemy aircraft is the scissors
maneuver.   Begin  a  turn toward him, but once he begins to turn with you,
quickly roll over to turn in the other direction.  This opens the scissors.
As  the  enemy  realizes you've turned away and turns toward you again, you
reverse  the  procedure and roll back toward him again.  If your turns were
quicker  and  tighter  than  his,  and  / or you're a slower plane, he will
eventually pass in front of you.  This allows you to get onto his tail.

Novice  pilots  trying  to  turn with you can be lured into a scissors with
ease.   Even  if  their  planes  turn  better, their slow reactions to each
scissor  opening  and  closing  will  quickly  give  you  the  edge.   More
experienced  enemies  may  avoid this tactic by anticipating your next turn
and blasting you (if they`re less maneuver- able),or by pulling up and over
in a Yo-Yo (if they're faster).

Immelmann  Turn:   This  maneuver  is an excellent way to reverse direction
quickly.  First you perform a half loop up wards to reverse direction, then
a half roll to right your aircraft.  If an enemy aircraft is behind you, an
Immelmann  can  bring  you  nose  to-nose with him.  Note that an Immelmann
gives  you  to  an  altitude gain but costs speed, since a half-loop upward
slows you down significantly.

Split-S  turn:   This maneuver complements the Immelmann.  Begin by rolling
inverted,  then  pull  the  stick  back to half loop downward.  Many pilots
begin  the  loop  before  the  roll  is completed, roll ing the plane while
looping.   The  Split-S  causes  you  to lose considerable altitude so it's
often  wise to reduce throttle and/or use speed brakes to minimize altitude
loss.

The  Split-S  complements  the  Immel  mann because you gain speed and lose
altitude.   Unwary  fighter  pilots have sometimes tried to Split-S into or
away  from the enemy without remembering their altitude.  The result can be
a Split-S right into the ground!

Yo-Yo  turn:   This  maneuver  is  used mainly by higher speed jets against
slower opponents.  Therefore the relatively slow F-117A has little occasion
to  use  it.   However,  you may see enemy MiGs at tempting it against you!
This turn also re quires excellent cockpit visibility, something the F-117A
definitely lacks.

In  a Yo Yo turn you climb and roll toward the enemy until he`s visible out
the  top  of  your canopy.  Then pull over into a dive while still turning.
During  the  dive you roll the plane to help line up your shot.  Very often
you'll take that shot while inverted

Because  a  Yo Yo requires good spatial perception, first practise it using
the  Slot View (if alone) or Tacti View.  In combat conditions switching to
a  wide  angle view is extremely helpful in pulling the HUD around onto the
enemy after you come over the top.  Then you can switch back to normal view
again.

In effect a Yo Yo is a very big turn in three dimensions.  Most of the turn
radius  is "consumed" with the climbing and diving, allowing a faster plane
to  travel  farther  and  turn wider, yet still come out on the tail of the
more  maneuverable  plane.  American F- 4 Phantom pilots used this maneuver
with  great success against slower but more maneuverable MiG 21s over North
Vietnam during the Vietnam war.

Note  that  the best defense against a Yo-Yo is to reverse your turn or use
the third dimension yourself (usually by going into a split-S).

Enemy Guns

The  enemy  has cannon equivalent to yours in range and power.  However the
enemy  still uses old "predicting" gunsights.  This means they are required
to get behind you before they can make a decent shot.  In addition, all but
the  most  elite  pilots  will  be  slow to fire, since they must place the
gunsight on the target and keep it there to score a hit.

If  you  sense  the enemy is behind you and ready to fire cannons "jinking"
(small violent moves in random directions) can throw off his aim.

MISSION BRIEFING

Mission Types

Rules  of  Engagement (ROE) set forth guidelines restricting what targets a
pilot can and cannot attack and to what extent you may expose your fighter.
In Cold and Limited War situations it is imperative that the enemy not know
exactly  who  or what performed the attack.  This allows the politicians to
say whatever they want

In  Cold  War  situations  the State Department must have "deniability" for
every  mission.   If  the  mission  is successful and the political climate
good,  the  US  may  claim  credit  for the deed.  In other cases, however,
America may not wish to attach its name to the action

You  may  attack  and  destroy specified targets only.  Engagement of other
targets  is  prohibited  unless  if  they  fire first, or have spotted your
plane.   You must avoid visual detection by the enemy.  Enemy air or ground
forces  that  do  detect  you  should be destroyed, to prevent embarrassing
disclosures.  Neutrals are considered friendly at all times, and you should
avoid detection by them at all costs.

You are warned when enemy radar returns are good enough to spot your craft,
or  when  enemy aircraft come close enough to visually identify you.  These
enemies  should  be destroyed, although the effort can be counterproductive
if the attack generates lots of additional sightings!

The  State  Department  may  require deniability, since American aid to the
combatants  may  need  to  be  secret.   However, since there is a war, and
military  targets  are being destroyed, you will be rewarded for destroying
enemy military targets.

Conventional War

You  may  attack  and  destroy  specified targets only.  Other targets with
active  weaponry  (i.e..   which  could attack your craft) may be attacked.
You  may  attack  these military targets even if they haven't seen you yet.
You  must  never  attack  non-military  targets  unless required by orders.
Neutrals  are  considered  friendly  at  all  times,  and  you should avoid
detection by them.

In  a Conventional War you are allowed unrestricted conventional attacks on
enemy  territory.   This  includes  civilian  targets  formerly  forbidden.
However,  targets  that  represent  an  immediate  military threat are most
important.   Therefore  destroying  enemy aircraft, airbases, SAMs, radars,
depots, HQs, etc, gives more reward than bridges, oil refineries, oil wells
and platforms, etc.  Even conventional wars are fought for short term goals
(such  as  the  Grenada invasion in 1983, the Falklands Islands campaign of
1984, and Desert Storm of 1991).

You  must  attack  and  destroy  all  targets specifically required by your
orders.   In  addition,  any  other  targets  in  enemy  territory  may  be
destroyed,  including  civilian  targets.   If  able  to  select additional
targets,  select  those with immediate military capability first.  Neutrals
are  considered  friendly  at  all times, and you should avoid detection by
them.

Air-To-Air Missions

Here  an  important  personage  is travelling by planes your job is to make
sure  he  doesn't  arrive!  The plane takes off about the same time as your
own.   Remember  that his plane, your objective, is the flashing dot on the
satellite map (left MFD)

Although  it`s  possible  to  just  fly to his destination and wait, roving
fighter  patrols  or  local  air  defenses  will  eventually  spot you.  In
general,  the  wiser  approach  is  to find the best way to "sneak through"
enemy patrols and SAM radars to intercept him en-route

In Limited or Conventional War you can take down his plane and escourt with
AMRAAMs.   In  a  Cold  War  situation  you'll  need  to  close for a clean
Sidewinder  or gun shot.  Remember, though, that if the fighter escorts get
a visual ID on your plane you must "zap" them too.  If your attack location
is  well  away  from any ground radars or Mainstay AEW & C planes.  You can
attack from above, hit your man, drop a decoy to confuse them and zoom away
with maximum speed at low altitude (say 200').

Intercepting Terrorists or Commandos

In  this mission you know a transport plane.  accompanied by fighters, will
head  for  friendly  territory.  Your objective is to eliminate them before
they arrive.  The problem is you don't know their destination

As  you take off, watch the enemy aircraft carefully.  Circle around a bit,
observing  their course until you can guess their objective.  Once you know
their goal, it`s easy pick a nice quiet spot to ambush them.  Often you can
stay in friendly territory all the way!

Eliminating a Fighter Patrol

Enemy fighter groups usually patrol near their own air defense systems, and
are  supported  by  Mainstay AEW&C planes, so going in after them can cause
quite  a  battle One trick to avoid this mess is to publicize your presence
in  a  nearby  area  with  little  or  no  SAM coverage, and with no nearby
airbases.   If you can lure the fighter patrol to this spot, the battle may
be much easier.

Once  you've "dangled the lure," take a low profile.  so you can ambush the
enemy fighters as they arrive.  As in many other aspects of modern warfare,
getting the first shot is a big advantage.

Destroying a Recon Bomber

In  most  cases  you  must chase an enemy plane on its way home.  Catch and
attack  him  as  quickly  as possible.  The longer you delay, the closer he
gets to SAM cover and fighter aid.  This is one mission where climbing to a
higher  altitude  can  be  rewarding  you travel faster and farther at high
altitude.

Attacking a Cruise Missile Bomber

These  aircraft  cruise  deep  behind  their own lines, guarded by SAMs and
closely  escorted  by fighters.  Given the defenses, attacking these planes
is  like  hitting  a  ground  target.   You need to sneak or punch your way
through  defenses,  elude counterattacks and blast the primary, just like a
strike mission.

Taking Down The Mainstay

The  IL-76  "Mainstay"  AEW&C  plane is the most difficult aircraft target.
Sooner  or  later  its  radar  will  see  you, forcing you to fight through
fighters and SAMs to reach it.  Make your approach as stealthy as possible.
Destroying  one or two crucial SAM radar sites on your way in can be useful
it opens a radar free corridor to the target, and at the same time may draw
off enemy interceptors, perhaps even some of the Mainstays fighter escort

Strike Missions

Dropping  off  or picking up items deep behind enemy territory seems rather
straightforward.  After all, you don't have to fly into SAM batteries or go
head to head with fighter patrols.

Secret Airstrips

Instead, a secret airstrip challenges your flying skill.  You must manage a
landing  without  an  ILS  to guide you.  Worse, the strip is only half the
length of a normal runway You must land gently at low speed (under 160 kts,
preferably),and  touch  down near the start.  Otherwise you`ll roll off the
other  end  and  crash!  To make matters worse, the strip's lights are only
for  a  limited  time.   Make  a  note  of the time the lights go off, then
periodically  check  the  Waypoints screen on the right MFD to see how much
time you`ve got.  Once the lights are out landing is virtually impossible.

Airdrops

In  these  missions  your  job is to avoid action and just fly over a radio
beacon that`s quite clear on your HUD.  The only real worry is reaching the
beacon  before  it  is  turned  off.   Make note of the "turn off" time and
periodically check the Waypoints screen.  Once the beacon turns off there`s
no way to find the drop site

Photo Recon Runs

Photo  runs over enemy troop concentrations and/or near SAMs are especially
nerve-wracking.   You may need to take out a SAM before making the run.  If
shoulder  fired  SAMs  infest  the  area, your only hope is to dump a decoy
before  you  start,  run  your  IR  jammer  as  long  as  you  can,  and/or
periodically dump flares.

Striking SAMs

Destroying  a  SAM battery requires that you "sneak up" on it , as best you
can, then nail the radar first with a Maverick or HARM.  With the radar out
of  action,  the missiles are helpless.  Unless there are other SAMs nearby
you can have a strafing "picnic" until a fighter patrol shows up.

Remember  that  the safest place around a SAM battery is directly above it.
The  radar cannot look straight up, and the longer-ranged missiles (such as
the SA-2, -5, -10 and 12) have a minimum range of 4 to 5 km.

Hitting the Sub Pens at Severomorsk

The  Severomorsk  submarine pens in the North Cape are a unique and special
target.   These  must  be  attacked by toss bombing from the north you must
place  an  FAE  through  the  sea doors.  This means flying straight at the
mountain and pulling up at the last second.

Beware of the Krivak class frigates patrolling to seaward of this base

Sinking Ships

Don't underestimate enemy warships, especially those of the Soviet Northern
Fleet.   The  larger  ships have exceptionally good radar and very powerful
SAMs.   Patrol  ships  can be knocked out with a single missile, but a task
force  has  so  many  ships that any close approach means you'll be dodging
missiles left and right.

When  fighting  a  Conventional  War with Libya, or in the Persian Gulf, be
careful  about  attacking  merchant ships.  Avoid those on the high seas or
near  friendly  coast  lines:   only  attack  ships cfose to enemy ports or
shore.  Otherwise you could end up hitting a neutral ship by accident.

AREAS OF CONFLICT

The Persian Gulf:  1984

Since  the  overthrow  of  the  pro US Shah in 1979, Iran has been ruled by
Shi`ite  radicals.   In  September,  1980,  Iraq attacked Iran, beginning a
costly  war.   Both combat ants are viewed with distrust by the Arah states
along  the Persian Gulf.  Irans use of international terrorism as a tool of
foreign policy has not improved the nations image

Level of Conflict

Cold  War:   Iran's  use  of  terrorism  has  been  very effective to date.
Americas confused response to the hostage crisis in the early 1980s created
a dangerous rift between the two nations.

Limited  War:   Iran  and Iraq have been fighting a limited war since 1980.
US  forces may eventually become involved in assuring the continued flow of
oil through the Straits of Hormuz.

Conventional  War:   The  Soviets could invade Iran as part of a wider NATO
Warsaw  Pact  conflict,  or as a counter to the Shi'ite radicals, who would
like to spread their revolution to the USSR's Moslem population.

Iranian Military Forces

Under  the  Shah,  Iran's  oil  rich  finances were invested in US military
equipment  Since  the  revolution many of these complex weapons have failed
for  lack  of spare parts and maintenance, while many of the rest have been
damaged or destroyed in the Iraq war

Air  Defenses:   MIM  23B  "Hawk"  batteries are Iran's longest ranged SAMs
Rapier  batteries.   Sold by Britain to Iran, are fast, but shorter ranged,
and  hindered  by  a  fire  control  system  that is primarily visual.  The
Tigercat,  an  antiquated  British  design appears in less important areas.
Many  Tigercat sites have little or no radar, since the missile is designed
for visual control.  The Seacat is a naval version of the Tigercat found on
Iranian Vosper Mark 5 type frigates.

Air  Force:   This  service  arm is composed primarily of US built aircraft
acquired  during the Shah's rule.  Before the outbreak of the Iran Iraq war
the Air Force had a nominal strength of 75 F-14 Tomcats, about 200 F-4D and
F-4E  Phantom  IIs,  and 140 F-5E Tiger IIs.  Iranian fighters are equipped
with AIM 9H Sidewinders, one of the best first generation IR AAMs.  The F 4
Phantoms  are  designed to carry the AIM-7F Sparrow long-range radar homing
missile.

Iran  has  few  naval  reconnaissance  bombers,  and most of those are P-3C
Orions  with inoperative electronic gear.  However, it's possible that long
range  Soviet  Tu-95  "Bear"  bombers  may  make an appearance, flying from
Afghanistan or Yemen.  

Iran has a variety of small, medium and large air transports, including the
American C-130 Hercules and Boeing 707 and 747 transports.  The exact types
available  vary  greatly,  depending  on  the supply of spare parts and the
presence  of  knowledge  able  mechanics  Given Iran's dislike of the West.
Some  consider  it  likely  that  she  will  shop  in  Russia  for the next
transports bought.  Perhaps the new and very flexible An-72 "Coaler".

Naval  Forces:  The Iranian Navy has suffered greatly in the Iran-Iraq war,
since  most  resources  go  into  the  army and air force.  Many ships were
damaged  in the fighting and remain in disrepair:  others have deteriorated
badly for lack of maintainence

It  is  believed  that  one  or more of the four Vosper Mark 5 frigates are
still functional These 1,100-ton ships include a surface-to surface missile
(SSM),  Seacat  SAMs and a 4.5" gun turret.  Occasional patrols by these or
smaller  ships  can  be  expected  in  the region of Kharg Island or in the
Straits of Hormuz

Iran's  Shi`ite "Guards" also man a large number of fast motor boats called
"Mosqui-  toes."  The  crews  carry  rocket-propelled  grenades  to  attack
shipping  and  shoulder launched IR SAMs to protect themselves from air and
helicopter  attack.   These  boats  are  based all along the Iranian coast,
especially at Bandar 'Abbas, and at a variety of offshore oil platforms.

Iranian Cities and Targets

Upper  Khuzestan  Triangle  - Dezful, Masjed Soleyman, Ahvaz:  These cities
are  the  main  "rear areas" behind the Iraq-Iran battlefront.  They have a
variety  of  SAMs.   Although  all originally had airbase facilities, it is
believed that only Masjed Soleyman`s is still intact.

Abadan:   This  city  is  located  at  the final junction of the Tigris and
Euphrates  Rivers.  Numerous battles in and around this area have destroyed
a  large part of the city The surrounding countryside is now reverting to a
poisonous  marshland in the aftermath of heavy fighting, which included the
use of chemical weapons.

Bandar  Khomenyi:   This  is  the  main  Iranian  military  base behind the
southern  part  of  the Iran Iraq front.  A major staging base for military
supplies  and munitions of all sorts.  It has a large airbase, powerful SAM
batteries, and a major military HQ.

Kharg  lsland:   This  oil  rich island is covered with refineries, storage
tanks,  and  port  facilities.  Until the Iran-Iraq war it was the greatest
oil  terminal  in  the  world.   Repeated  attacks  have ruined many of the
facilities.  Now protected by SAM batteries and missile boats.  It is still
Iran`s  main outlet for oil.  Beware that some offshore plat- forms in this
vicinity are now used by Shi`ite "Guards" as military bases.

Bushehr:   This important coastal city was once a major oil port but is now
completely  overshadowed  by neighboring Kharg Island.  The military forces
on its airbase and SAM batteries are not always first rate.  But it is home
port for frigates and missile boats

Shiraz:   This  inland  city  is  one  of  the  largest Iranian cities:  It
contains  the  nerve center for Iran's southern military command.  There is
an  exceptionally large airbase here, and it is protected by a powerful SAM
battery.

Esfahan:  Nestled in a a large pass of the Zagros Mountains, Esfahan is the
"gateway" to north western Iran.  As a transportation and population centre
it naturally boasts an airfield, and SAM sites protecting it.

Bandar-e  Lengeh:   This  western city on the Straits of Hormuz has a minor
military base, including an airfield and SAM battery.  However, its primary
function is civilian, serving the large oil fields in this area.

Bandar  'Abbas:   This city is Iran's major military base on the Straits of
Hormuz  Major  Iranian  Navy elements are based here, as well as the latest
SAMs and a large, well-equipped airbase.

Friendly Bases

CVN  at Sea:  This huge 80,000 ton nuclear carrier is the class ship of the
latest  and  most powerful program of aircraft carriers.  Normally assigned
to the Pacific Fleet, it is prepared to visit the Indian Ocean at any time.

Ras  as  Saffaniyah:  This is Saudi Arabia's northern most oil terminal and
port  along  the  Gulf.   Its  airfield  is in a useful strategic location.
Basing privileges for a secret stealth mission can be arranged with the pro
American Saudi monarchy

Dhahran  and  Al  Hufuf:   Dhahran  is  Saudi  Arabia`s largest city on the
Persian  Gulf,  making  its  airfield an unwise choice for stealth aircraft
operations.    However,   the  Al  Hufuf  airfield  slightly  inland  is  a
strategically useful and less public position for basing missions

As  Salamiyah:   This small airbase outside of the capital Riyadh is a nice
quiet location where clandestine missions can be organized easily.

Bahrain:   This  small  island  nation  is strongly pro American, providing
large naval and airbase facilities for US military forces.

Neutral Bases

Kuwait  City:   Iranian  threats  and attacks have caused Kuwait to seek US
military  support.   The  Kuwait City airport can be used to stage missions
that  demonstrate  US  support  of  Kuwait, or for emergency landings, but,
fearful  of  increased  Iranian  hostility  Kuwait will not grant US basing
rights.

Qatar:   This  small  independent nation works hard at neutrality, probably
because  it  has  strong  pro US and strong pro Iranian factions.  Although
missions  are`nt  regularly  staged  from  here,  it  is possible to launch
specific clandestine missions or carry out emergency landings

Ruweiss  and  Tarif  in the United Arab Emirates:  These small oil ports of
the  UAE are not especially friendly to the American cause.  But the UAE is
a decentral ized government, and US pressure in the right places can permit
clandestine missions or emergency landings.

Abu  Dhabi  and  Khafi  in the UAE:  Abu Dhabi is the major city of the UAE
where neutrality is most important.  Staging missions or emergency landings
from  here  s  very  difficult,  but not impossible.  The large airfield at
Khafi  is  the  most  strategically  useful  of all UAe airfields it is the
closest base to south-central Iran.  But political problems make the use of
this base difficult to impossible.

Muscat  in  Oman:  Oman is careful to remain neutral in all affairs, but it
is  strongly  pro  Western.   For  example, much of its army is trained and
officered by "retired" British military personnel.  The military portion of
the  Muscat  airfield  is  available  for  missions and emergency landings,
provided everything remains secret and politically "deniable"

Europes North Cape:  1985

The North Cape area is shared by four nations:  Norway, Sweden, Finland and
the  Soviet  Union.  their political orientations parallel their geographic
locations:   Norway  belongs  to  NATO,  Sweden  is  a pro-Western neutral,
Finland is a pro-Eastern neutral and the USSR, of course, leads the eastern
Bloc.

Cold  War:   Because  of  the  threat  to  the Atlantic posed by the Soviet
Northern  Fleet  NATO  and  Soviet forces are constantly sparring with each
other,  testing  the  others  responses  and  jockeying for position should
hostilities  erupt.   Officially  at  peace  the  two  sides  wage a covert
conflict  of  intelligence gathering and military that could turn deadly in
an instant.

Level of Conflict

Limited  War:   If  US-Soviet  foreign  policy  were conducted with greater
hostility the North Cape would be ideal for raids or retaliations.

Conventional  War:  If the balloon goes up, the Soviet Northern Fleet would
make  sorties  into  the  Atlantic:  Soviet troops would cross into Norway;
Mainstays  and  MiGs  would  cloud the skies.  Getting in and out with your
skin intact would be very very tricky!

Regional Military Forces

In  terms  of  global politics, the North Cape is the single most important
military  region in the Soviet Union.  Murmansk is its only year round open
sea  access to the Atlantic Ocean.  Soviet SSBNs (ballistic missile nuclear
submarines),  the  heart  of  nuclear  deterrence,  sail from here into the
Atlantic  and  Arctic  Oceans.   The  Soviet  Northern Fleet protects these
invaluable  weapons,  as  well  as  maintaining a credible threat to NATO`s
Atlantic lifelines

Norway fields a large, well equipped force tailored for a dogged defense of
its  cold  mountainous  homeland.   The  northern  bases  have  only  token
Norwegian  garrisons  but  NATO  plans  to  strongly  reinforce the lightly
defended  northern  areas  with  air,  naval  and  marine forces should the
shooting start.

Sweden's armed forces are designed to make the USSR (or anyone) think twice
about  violating its neutrality.  Swedish forces are well equipped and well
trained,  and  boast a nationwide reserve system that makes a large part of
the citizenry part time soldiers.

Finland  fields  a  much  smaller  and  less  sophisticated  force than its
neighbors Although fiercely independent, Finland has learned to accommodate
the  desires  of  its  powerful  neighbor,  the  Soviet Union.  The Soviets
maintain  this  "friendly" attitude by garrisoning powerful military forces
near  the  Finnish  border,  and  strongly encoraging Finland to buy Soviet
military equipment.

Soviet Air Defenses

The Kola peninsula is vital to the USSR because it provides access to NATOs
lines  of  communications.  However, its close proximity to Russia makes it
particularly  vulnerable  to  NATO  counterstrokes.  Consequently, the Kola
peninsula  is  likely  to  prove  one of the most challenging anti aircraft
environments in the world

Long-rangeSAMs:   the  older SA-2s and SA-5s have been undergoing continual
upgrade  to  SA-10 and SA-12 quality.  The entire system is enhanced by the
LPAR early warning radar system at Kirovsk.

Light SAMs:  Soviet ground forces in this area are outfitted with the usual
battlefield  SAMs, including the older SA-9 and SA- 13 IR missiles, as well
as  the  newer  SA-8 and SA-11 radar guided ones.  Mobile infantry carrying
SA-7  and SA-14 shoulder launched IR SAMs are a significant threat as well.
Check out your Intelligence Briefing for "enemy troops."

The PVO and Naval Aviation

Fighters:   This  region  is  defended partly by PVO (National Air Defense)
units  with  MiG-25  and  MiG-31 interceptors using long-range radar homing
AAMs.   Naval  aviation  fighters  operating  from  carriers or land strips
include  the  Yak  38  V/STOL  jet and the new Su-27 multi purpose fighter.
During  wartime  shorter-ranged units may arrive including MiG 29 and Su-27
dogfighters  with  short-range  IR  missiles  as  well  as long range radar
weapons.

Reconnaissance  Bombers:   Many long range Tu-95D "Bears" are based in this
area.   To  keep  tabs  on  NATO  naval  activity in the North Atlantic.  A
nuisance  in  peacetime,  these  planes  pose  a more serious threat in war
eliminating  them - and thus blinding the Soviet high command - is always a
high priority in NATO war plans.

Transports:   The  Soviet  Union  possesses numerous air transports for its
huge  force  of  airborne  units.   The  most  modern  of  these is the jet
propelled  An-72  "Coaler"  which  is  particularly  suited  to  fast, high
priority  missions  like  inserting commando teams or transporting critical
command personnel.

AEW&C  Aircraft:  The Soviets routinely deploy IL-76 "Mainstay" aircraft in
the  region.   The  300+  mile  radars  on  these  planes  may be your most
formidable enemy.

The Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet

The  USSR's  Northern  Fleet offers both tempting targets and a significant
threat.   Its  modern  Sovremennyy-class  destroyers carry SA-N-7 missiles.
While  Krivak  class  fig  ates  sport  the  SA N 4.  the larger Kiev class
carrier  has  the  powerful  SA-N-6,  a  sea going equivalent of the SA-10.
These  warships  are  more than capable of defending themselves.  Stationed
off the northern coast, they significantly extend the Soviet anti- aircraft
umbrella.

In addition to these ships' SAMs, Kiev-class carriers mount a complement of
Yak-38 "jump jet" fighters.  While less capable than ground based fighters,
the British Harriers in the Falklands taught the world not to underestimate
the capabilities of such planes.

An  upcoming  addition  to  the  Northern Fleet is a class of huge aircraft
carriers  fitting out in the Crimea.  Tentatively titled the Kremlin-class,
these ships are expected to join the fleet soon

Soviet Cities and Targets

Murmansk:   This  major  city is the Soviet Union`s only ice free port with
access  to the Atlantic Ocean.  Its great piers and depots support not only
a  steady stream of merchant shipping, but the powerful Red Banner Northern
Fleet.  Murmansk is literally 'at the end of the line." In this case a long
railway line that runs southward 700 miles to Leningrad.

Murmansk  is  the nerve center of the USSR's powerful air forces, including
both  air  defense  planes  and  naval  aviation  of  the  Northern  Fleet.
Satellite airfields surround the city, including large bases at Kildenstroy
and Kilpyaur.  The great Severomorsk submarine pens are also near Murmansk.
This  underground base is the home port for the new Typhoon class ballistic
missile submarine.

The  Northern Fleet includes, roughly, one aircraft carrier, 75 other major
surface  warships,  one  marine  brigade,  133  submarines,  and  446 naval
aircraft.   The  protection of its bases is the duty of 12 divisions of the
Red  Army (about 300,000 men) and 150 planes of Frontal Aviation (air force
planes  supporting  the  army) and the PVO (air force interceptors guarding
the border).

Pechenga:   This  town  is the USSR's forward most military base in the far
north  and  the  inevitable  staging  point  for  any  invasion  into  NATO
territory.   Although  it  has  an  airbase  and  strong SAM defenses.  The
Polyarnyy airbase complex to the east is somewhat larger

Monchegorsk and Olenegorsk:  Near the base of the Kola peninsula, these two
towns  are major airbases for long-range naval aviation bombers, as well as
providing  fighter  and SAM cover to the railroad link between Murmansk and
the south.

Kandalaksha:   This  small  port  city is the main population centre at the
base  of the Kola peninsula.  South of the city lies the Loukhi air defense
complex,  including  a  large  SAM  battery that covers this section of the
Murmansk-Leningrad rail line

Arkhangel'sk:   Although closed by ice during the winter, Arkhangel`sk (the
USSR's   largest   city  on  the  Atlantic)  has  excellent  transportation
connections  to  the interior of Russia, and is almost totally invulnerable
to  enemy  attack.   In  addition  to  large  port  facilities, the city is
surrounded  by  military  defenses, the most notable being the complexes at
Severodvinsk  and Kushkushara, and units of the Northern Fleet which patrol
offshore in the White Sea.

Friendly Bases

Kautokeino:   Located  in  the  barren  tundra  of  the  Finnmarksvidda the
Kautokeino airfield is well suited for operations across the top of Finland
to  Murmansk.   The  population  is  very  small  and  the entire area well
defended  by  tundra  swamps  and  bogs in summer, or sub zero blizzards in
winter.

Lakselv:   Located  at  the  base  of  the  Porsangen Fjord, Lakselv has an
airfield  ideally  suited to operations into Russia.  It is far enough from
the  border to survive the first few days of fighting, but close enough for
easy access.

CV  Kennedy  at  Sea:   Just  recently,  the Navy Secretary announced a new
wartime policy of sending aircraft carriers deep into the Norwegian Sea, to
challenge  the  USSRs fleet near its home.  Although considered suicidal by
some, this policy is certainly useful for launching stealth missions.  Here
CV67,  one of the conventional carriers with the US Atlantic Fleet, makes a
quick dash to the North Cape to launch your mission

Neutral Bases

Available neutral bases in this region are all Swedish.  Sweden is strictly
neutral  in  international  politics,  but economically closely tied to the
Western  Bloc.   Given  recent events and aggressive Soviet moves, it's not
unlikely  that  a  few clandestine stealth missions, or emergency landings,
would be allowed at northern Swedish airbases

Kiruna:   the  northernmost airfield in Sweden, this base is located in the
nearly unpopulated foothills of the Esrange Mountains.

Gallivare:   Although  this airfield is also far north in Sweden, Gallivare
is  a  junction  of  rails and roads.  In the summer months it is a popular
tourist  area,  with  the  Muddus  National  Park  a few miles to the west.
Stealth missions operating from this base must be very discreet.

Lulea:   This fairly populous city is the main Swedish military base in the
Northern  Region.   It  is also a port on the Culf of Bothnia, the northern
most arm of the Baltic Sea.

Libya: 1986

Libya  is  ruled  by  Col.  Mu'ammar al-Qadhaffi, leader of the secret army
organiza  tion  that  deposed the former king in 1969.  The capital city is
Tripoli  and  the  nations  chief  source  of wealth is oil sold to western
nations

Level of Conflict

Cold  War:   At  times  Libya  has  enthusiastically  backed  international
terrorism  The  US  has  already  attacked  tactical  military  targets  in
retaliation   for  Libyas  role  in  numerous  incidents  of  international
terrorism in Europe and the Mediterranean

Limited War:  The Libyan army has fought minor border clashes against Egypt
a  US  ally,  that so far has proved considerably superior.  Future limited
wars between Libya and any of her neighbors are possible.

Conventional  War:   In  the  event  of  NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict Libya is
expected to provide bases for Soviet aircraft and warships operating in the
Mediterranean.   These  bases  could  become  the  western most outposts of
Soviet forces in the Mediterranean

Libyan Military Forces

The  Libyan  Army  has approximately 60,000 men.  The Navy has 53 ships and
6,500  men, while the Air Force has about 530 planes, 30 combat helicopters
and  8,500  men.   A paramilitary "Pan-African Legion" of about 10,000 also
exists.   In  addition  Libya has built and supported a variety of training
camps for terrorist groups.

Libya  buys  most  of its armaments from the Soviet Union with money earned
from  selling  its vast oil reserves to the West.  Personnel are trained by
Soviet Military advisors, but national pride has prohibited any significant
Soviet presence

Air  Defenses:   Libyan  air  defenses  use  Soviet  built equipment.  SA-2
"Guideline"  and  SA-5  "Gammon"  SAMs have been the backbone of Libyan air
defenses,  but  are being replaced by SA-10 "Grumble" and SA-12 "Gladiator"
systems.

Local  ground forces use the SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder fired missiles.  These
are  also popular terrorist weapons, and can be expected in the vicinity of
terrorist  camps.   Libyan  army  units also use various medium-range SAMs,
including the SA-8, -9, -11 and -13.

Air  Forces:  The Libyan Air Force is composed of 140 MiG-23MF "Floggers" a
small  number  of  MiG  25 "Foxbats" and old MiG-21s, and various Mirage 5D
fighter  bombers.  Your primary opponents will be MiG 23s and 25s, although
in  Conventional  War,  or against higher quality pilots, you may encounter
MiG-29 "Fulcrums" flown by Soviet pilots.

Libya's  antiquated  C-130H  and C-47 air transports (built in the US) will
probably be replaced by the new Soviet An-72 "Coaler" jet transport.

Naval  Forces:   The Libyan Navy is primarily composed of missile corvettes
and  patrol  boats.   The  largest  of  these are the 770 ton Russian built
Nanuchka  II  class  armed  with  Styx  surface-to  surface missiles, SA-N4
surface  to-air  missiles,  and  a  twin  57mm gun turret.  The other boats
include  the  Soviet  Osa-class,  Italian  built  Wadi M`ragh class and the
French  built La Combattante II types:  these have poorer missiles and SA N
5 SAMs, or no SAMs at all.

Libyan Cities and Targets

Tripoli:   the  capital city of Libya has a large military civilian airbase
at  Idris,  and  is  well protected by SAM batteries.  Until recently these
were  long  range  SA-5  "Gammons,"  but  there are indications that Soviet
military  advisors  have  replaced  them with SA-12 Gladiators.  Tripoli is
also  the  site  of  a  major army HQ, various military depots, oil storage
areas,  and  terrorist  training camps.  Missile boats often cruise off the
coast.

Sabha:   This  southern  town  is  the main military base supporting Libyas
southerly border expansion.  The most important military installations here
are the large airbase and the SAM battery protecting it.

Misratah  and  Sirt:  These two coastal towns harbor low level military HQs
and oil storage tanks for refueling ships.  Sirt is a secondary naval base,
supporting  missile  boats  that  cruise  the  western side of the "Line of
Death."

Ras  Lanuf  and  Port  Brega:   Ras Lanuf is Libya's largest and newest oil
facility  Port  Brega is an older facility.  still in operation despite the
completion  of Ras Lanuf.  A number of SAM batteries support the Port Brega
airfield, west of the town

Benghazi:  This is the site of Libya's second largest military base and the
Benina airfield.  It boasts a military HQ and small oil storage facilities.
Terrorists train in the western hills.

Al  Badya:   This sleepy coastal town in the mountainous Jabal al Akbar has
major  military  significance.   It overlooks the narrow lonian Sea between
Libya  and Greece making it an ideal site for anti ship missiles.  There is
a small airstrip and SAM site as well

Oil  Fields:   The  great  oil  fields  of Libya are in the southeast where
thousands  of  wells  pump  crude to Ras Lanuf and Port Brega.  Most of the
great  fields  have  a  few  storage  tanks  on  site,  to  hold  crude oil
temporarily.

Friendly Bases

Sigonella  on  Sicily:   The  US maintains a military base at Trapani.  The
Sigonella  military  field in southeastern Sicily is the main staging point
for air attacks against the North African coast

Neutral Bases

CV  America  at  Sea:   this  60,000-ton  "Kitty  Hawk"  class conventional
aircraft  carrier, designated CV66, often serves with the US Sixth Fleet in
the Med.  A participant in recent raids against Tripoli and Benghazi, it is
ideally  positioned  for  strikes  against  Benghazi, the Gulf of Sirte, or
targets deep in the Libyan desert.

These  airbases  are  in neutral territory.  You should not use these bases
unless specifically so ordered, or if you must make an emergency landing.

Suda  Bay  on  Crete:   This airfield, near the city of Khania, is not a US
base although it has been a major NATO air and naval base.

Halfar  on Malta:  On the island of Malta, and once a critical position for
the  British Commonwealth in the Mediterranean.  This base is now a neutral
port and sometime tourist haven.

Central Europe:  1986

Since  World War II Europe has been divided into two hostile blocs.  On one
side are the communist East European nations, created in the wake of Soviet
armies  at  the  end of WWII.  On the other side are the democratic Western
European  nations.   Since  1949 the West has been linked by NATO:  In 1955
the East formalized an equivalent organization the Warsaw Pact dominated by
the USSR.  From then to now the two geatest military organizations on earth
have eyed each other along the East-West German border.

Levels of Conflict

Cold  War:   This  is  the  situation  of the last 40 years.  The two sides
maintain  a  wary  posture,  generally  trying to avoid overt provocations.
Probing  each  other  to  gain  information,  stir  discontent in the enemy
population,  and  gain psychological advan tages.  The F-117A, designed for
clandestine  penetration, is the perfect aircraft for the secret operations
common in this situation.

Limited  War:  Now the conflict is at the brink of open warfare, but armies
have not yet crossed borders.  As hostilities escalate, the opportunity for
stealth  missions  increases Conventional War:  Warsaw Pact tanks pour over
the  West  German  border  While NATO forces scramble to stem the onrushing
tide.   On  one hand lies the specter of conventional defeat.  On the other
the  disaster  of  thermonuclear  war.   Stealth aircraft airmobile raiding
groups,  and  long-range "smart" munitions make the dangerous crossing over
the  front  to  hammer  Soviet rear echelons.  If they can isolate the Pact
spearheads from their base, they may give the politicians an OPportunity to
avert disaster

Military Forces

The  Warsaw Pact can deploy almost three million men, about 80,000 armoured
fighting  vehicles, and 6,000 combat aircraft.  Against this juggernaut the
Western  powers  can  field  around two million men, 40,000 AFVs, and 4,000
combat aircraft.  The numerical imbalance is partially offset by the higher
quality  of  the  Western  troops  and equipment, presumably along with the
traditional advantages of the defense

Together,  the  two  sides  have  almost  ten  thousand battlefield nuclear
weapons in Europe.  These range from small.  sub kiloton shells designed to
wipe out troop concent trations, to multi megaton city busters.  Artillery,
planes.   and  missiles  of all types and ranges can deliver these weapons.
At  one  time  NATO  felt  it  had to use nuclear weapons to compensate for
numerical inferiority.  Today it has an alternative plan; "Air-land battle,
2000." In this NATO uses superior technology, including its stealth planes,
to  attack  deep  in  the rear of the Warsaw Pact armies.  Destroying their
logistical  support  If  this  innovative strategy works, NATO need not use
nuclear weapons to stem the Red tide.  However, failure would mean a choice
between nuclear holocaust and the loss of Europe to the Soviet Union.

Air Defenses

Equipment:  Since the "Central Front" forms the focal point of the war, the
anti  aircraft  defenses on both sides are the most intensive in the world.
The  Soviets  are  certain  to deploy large quantities of their most modern
weapons, Sa-10s and Sa-12s for area defense.  In some areas the older, less
effective SA-5 long-range systems may still be in place.

Radar  guided  SA-8s  and  SA1-11s  are  most  commonly used for more local
defenses  especially  near important military concentrations or objectives.
A  few  are  even sited near larger SAM batteries to provide local defense.
The  shorter ranged infrared SA-9s and especially SA-13s may appear instead
if  radar -guided weapons are not available At sea the Baltic missile boats
typically  have either SA N-5 or SA-N-7 systems although Krivaks and larger
ships with SA N 4s can be expected in wartime

Pact Air Forces

The  Soviet  Air  Force  is  the  largest in the world, and one of the most
modern.   It  deploys  a  wide  variety of interceptor, bomber, and support
aircraft.   The  Soviets know the value of air superiority and will give it
high priority.

Fighters:   With 6,000 combat aircraft to choose from.  You can bet the Red
Air  Force  will  find a few to spare for you.  If you're lucky, you`ll see
only  second  line MiG-23s but more likely quality dogfighters like the MiG
29  and Su 27 will be flying.  In rear areas you're more likely to see long
range interceptors like MiG-25s and MiG-31s

Bombers:  One of the most troublesome enemy bombers you`ll encounter is the
Tu-95 "Bear" modified to carry cruise missiles.  A number of these craft in
orbit  deep behind enemy lines gives them an "untouchable" airborne nuclear
force

AEW&C:   The  Soviet  IL-76  "Mainstay" AEW&C was designed for work in this
kind of environment.  Flying "racetrack" orbits deep behind friendly lines,
its  powerful  radars  can  see  NATO  air  operations  develop  and  radio
appropriate  orders  to  various  fighter squadrons.  The effort to develop
these  planes has been long and costly; the size weight, and expense of the
electronic gear is gigantic.  Each plane is precious eliminating them would
cripple Soviet air operations

Transports:   Thousands  of  air  transports will shuttle back and forth on
both  sides of the front line, carrying troops, raiding parties, munitions.
staff  officers,  etc.   The  new  Soviet workhorse that flies anywhere and
carries almost anything is the An-72 "Coaler"

Naval Forces

The  Soviet Baltic fleet, headquartered at Baltiysk outside of Kaliningrad,
controls  4  cruisers,  16  destroyers,  7  Krivak class large frigates, 22
missile boats and other light warships, 21 amphibious assault ships, and 45
submarines.  It also controls the East German and Polish navies, which have
numerous  additional frigates and missile boats.  This force has two goals:
to  cover  the  northern  flank  of the Warsaw Pact from air attack, and to
invade Denmark in the event of war.

Stealth  missions  will  generally deal with the former, your problem being
how  to  penetrate the warship screen in the Baltic.  The SA-N 5 is a first
generation  IR  homer  and  no serious threat.  The SA-N-4 uses older pulse
radar guidance, but the new SA-N- 7 is a more serious problem.  Fortunately
very few Baltic warships carry the powerful long ranged SA N-10.

Pact Cities and Targets

East  Germany:   During  a Limited or Conventional War the main strength of
the Warsaw Pact forces will travel through here, surging into West Germany.
The  greatest  natural  barrier  in East Germany is the Elbe River, running
from  the  Czechoslovakian  mountains northward to Hamburg.  Destroying its
bridges would be cut off from the pact`s forward troops from their bases.

Covering  the  Pact's forward areas are two main air defense complexes, one
in  the north near Wittstock and Wittenburg, another in the south just east
of  Leipzig  and  Magdeburg.   including  the big radars at Mittenwalde and
Grossenhaim

Poland:   In  a  NAtO-Pact conflict Poland is the "rear area" through which
Soviet  troops  and  supplies  would  flow  toward  the  front lines.  Many
important  HQs  and  depots are situated in the central and western part of
the  nation.   The  Wista-Vistula river system divides Poland in half, from
north  to south.  Destroying the road and rail bridges can seriously damage
Pact  operations.   Polish defense complexes include a powerful system west
of  Gdansk  at Stupsk, and south of Lodz at Radom.  In addition Warsaw is a
major  transportation  hub, so active SAM batteries can be expected in that
area during wartime.

Czechoslovakia:   This Pact nation.  separated from Germany by the Ore Moun
tains  and the rugged highlands of the Bohemian Forest, is likely to play a
secondary  role  in  wartime.   Czechoslovakian  defenses are also somewhat
lighter  than  East  Germany  and  Poland.   Tabor  is the most significant
installation.   Far  to  the  east,  guarding  the  entrance to Hungary and
southern Poland, is another defense complex at Konmarno.

Kaliningrad:   This  region  of  the USSR, named after the major seaport of
Kaliningrad  (renamed  from Konigsberg in 1945), is the Soviet "front-line"
on  the  Baltic.  It includes a major over-the horizon (OTH) radar station,
as well as the Klaipeda Airbase.

Friendly Bases

West  Germany,  Holland,  and Denmark are studded with airfields that could
serve  as bases for stealth raids into Eastern Europe.  They form a gentle,
north south cresent bulging west in the middle.  Which is the most suitable
starting point for a particular airstrike depends mainly on the location of
the  target.   However,  the  F-117A  unique  characteristics  will be most
effective  in the areas only thinly covered by radar to the north and south
of  the  main  arena.  Therefore, deep penetration raids will usually start
from  Denmark  or southern Germany.  Shorter tactical strikes, however must
fly directly into the mouth of the tiger.

Jutland  Peninsula  - Vandel and Leck:  These far northern bases make ideal
jump-off points for raids out across the Baltic.  Often it's easier to deal
with  missile  boats  in  the  Baltic than the heavier SAM defenses in East
Germany and Poland

Nothern  Germany  (Hanover)  - Ahlhorn and Gutersloh:  These bases directly
behind  British  Army  Of  The  Rhine  (BAOR)  face  across the flat densly
populated  North  German  plain, the most likely axis of advance should the
Warsar  Pact  attack NATO.  therefore, they represent the most direct route
to one of the greatest concentrations of hostiles in the world.

Central  Germany  (Westphalia)  - Rhein-Main and Ramstein:  These bases are
the great, famous bases of American air power in Europe.  Rhein Main is one
of  the largest military bases in the world, while Ramstein is headquarters
for the 4th Tactical Air Force, America's combat air arm in Europe.

Southern  Germany  (Bavaria) - Neuberg Leipheim and Memmingen:  These bases
are  all  Luftwaffe (air force of the Federal Republic of Germany) but like
many  German  bases,  are  entirely  willing  to  host American aircraft as
needed.   Any of these bases makes an excellent jump off point for missions
into Czechoslovakia

The Middle East: 1989

The  Middle  East  has  been  the  scene  of constant tension and recurring
warfare  since  the United Nations formed the nation of Israel in 1948.  In
the crucible of this conflict, the Israelis have forged a superior army and
air  force  that  has consistantly outmatched its opponents.  The threat to
Israel today comes from Syria and Iraq although Iraq has been significantly
worn down by eight years of warfare with Iran The Jordanians have adopted a
near-neutral policy and are not expected to take an active part in any near
future conflict.  Lebanon has been torn apart by civil war and invasions by
Israel, Syria, and Palestinian refugees

The  Syrians  and  Iraqis  are  supported  financially largely by the Saudi
Arabians  out receive their weapons and training from the USSR.  Jordan and
Saudi Arabia act independently and have relatively strong ties to the West.

Level of Conflict

Cold  War:   For many years, Syria has engaged in the trainig and supplying
of  various  terrorist organizations, including the PLO, which has proved a
never  ending  source  of  annoyance to the Israelis.  In addition, several
Western hostages are rumoured to be held somewhere in Syria.

Iraq  is  in  the  process  of  building the region's most formidable armed
force.  The Iraqi military is working furiously to develop nuclear weapons,
and  already  has  large stores of chemical and biological devices.  Saddam
Hussein,  Iraqs  leader,  ordered the use of these during the war with Iraq
and is rumored to have used them against Kurdish rebels in his own country.

Limited War:  An Iraqi-backed Syrian invasion of Israel is underway and the
Israelis have called upon the US for support.  The Jordanians, as expected,
are  staying  out  of this fight for fear of losing what little armed force
they have to defend themselves against their powerful neighbors

Conventional  War:   In  response to US air intervention in the Middle East
the  USSR  has  sent  air  forces into the region to support its Syrian and
Iraqi  allies.  No superpower can keep its hands off all the oil that comes
from  this  vast desert region.  This war could quickly flare into a global
superpower confrontation

Syrian Forces

Air  Defenses:   The  Syrians use Soviet built equipment and are trained by
Soviet advisers.  They possess over 75 batteries of surface to-air missiles
mostly  SA-2  "Guidelines"  and SA 5 "Gammons".  Ground forces are equipped
with SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder fired missiles, and these can also be expected
in the vicinity of terrorist camps in Lebanon and Syria

Air  Forces:   The  Syrian  Arab  Air  Force is composed of over 450 combat
aircraft  and  50,000  men.   The  majority  of  the  interceptor  aircraft
available  are  MiG-21s and MiG 23s, with one squadron of MiG-25s.  The MiG
25 squadron is reportedly serviced and manned by East Germans and Russians.
Intelligence  expects  that  MiG-21s  and  MiG-  23s  will  be your primary
opponents,  although  you  may  encounter  MiG-25s and possibly new MiG-29s
flown by Soviet personnel.

Syrian Cities and Targets

Damascus:   This  ancient city, the capital of Syria, is situated east of a
gap  in  the coastal mountain ranges and was founded on the east west trade
route.  Damascus is the major military base in Syria and home to a majority
of  the  Syrian  Arab  Air  force.   Sub stantial SAM batteries and a major
airbase are located west and southwest of the city.

Dayr  As  Zawr  Hims  and Palmyre:  These towns support airbases that guard
Syria's  northern  and western border with turkey.  Dayr Az Zawr is located
at  an  ancient crossing point on the Euphrates River.  Palmyre is a desert
oasis town near the centre of Syria.  Hims is northeast of Lebanon, helping
to surround that country.  All of these cities are protected by substantial
air defense facilities.

Halab:   Previously  known  as Aleppo, this city is located in the northern
hills  of  Syria  near  the  turkish border.  Aircraft based here cover the
Tuurkish border and can reach south to Israel or into the Mediterranean

Al  Ladhiqyah:   This  town  north of Lebanon on the Mediterranean coast is
near  the Turkish border and supports the airbase closest to Cyprus.  It is
not a shipping port but is a vacation spot and fishing center.

Iraqi Forces

Air  Defenses:   Iraq  is  just  beginning to invest large resources in air
defense,  but  currently  has  only  10,000  men  assigned  to this branch.
Largely  separated  from  enemies  to the west and north, and just ending a
bloody,  protracted  war with Iran, it has concentrated most of its defense
against  air  attacks  in the east.  SAM batteries deployed are either SA 2
"Guidelines" or SA-5 "Gammons"

Air  Forces:   The  Iraqi  air  force  has  modern  equipment,  but did not
demonstrate a high degree of training or skill during the war against Iran.
The  main  air defense aircraft are MiG 21s and Mirage F 1s, although a few
MiG 25s and MiG-29s are known to be in service.

Iraqi Cities and Targets

Baghdad:   The  capital  city  of  Iraq  is  located between the Tigris and
Euphrates  Rivers.   Although  low  in  strength  due  to war losses, major
elements  of  the  Iraqi  air  force are based here.  Outside the city is a
nuclear  power  plant  that many believe is producing materials for nuclear
weapons

Mosul:   The  second largest city in Iraq also has heavy air defenses and a
nuclear  facility  is  thought to be operating nearby.  Probably because of
this and the close proximity to turkey, Mosul has heavy SAM protection.

Kirkuk,  Habbabiyah,  and  H3:  At these locations the Iraqis have airbases
ringing their country.  Kirkuk faces Iran and H3 is an outpost at a pumping
station in the desert along a major oil pipeline to Syria.

Jordanian Forces

Air  Defenses:   Jordanian  air defense is obsolete, relying primarily upon
the  antiquated MIM 23B, "Hawk" missile system, a good weapon for the 1970s
but not for the late 1980s.

Air  Forces:   Jordanian  air  power, too, is limited to a couple of types.
The  main  type  of  aircraft  is  the  US-built F-5, an inexpensive strike
fighter  that  is  obsolete  by  todays standards.  The other is the French
Mirage F-1, an outdated fighter bomber

Jordanian Cities and Targets

Amman:   Amman  is the capital of Jordan and home for the major elements of
the Royal Jordanian Air Force.

Ma'  An:  Outside this city is the Prince Hassan Airbase, where half of the
air  forces  combat  planes are deployed.  Planes were placed here to reach
the  Sinai  Peninsula but now that the Israelis have made peace with Egypt,
air elements here may be moved further north to cover the West Bank areas.

Friendly Bases

Akrotiri  on  Cyprus:   Aircraft  from  this British airbase are capable of
reaching  targets  along  the  Mediterranean coast.  US or Israeli aircraft
would  not  normally  base  there,  but  would  use  the  facilities  in an
emergency.

CVN  Eisenhower at Sea:  This 80,000 ton Nimitz class nuclear carrier often
serves  with  the US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean.  Here it cruises off
the  coast of Lebanon, positioned to strike anywhere along the Mediterranen
coast.   Carrying a complement of approximately 85 aircraft, the Eisenhower
is constantly guarded by a combat air patrol of fighter planes.

Ramat  David,  Tel Nof, Lod, and Hatzerim:  These Israeli airbases are home
for  the  fighters and fighter bombers of the air force many consider to be
the  best  in  the  world.   Backed  up  against  the  sea  by  enemies  or
non-friendly  neutrals, the Israelis must be prepared to launch air defense
or  attack  missions  in any of three directions.  A long standing US ally,
Israel's bases would be shared freely with US forces during wartime

Malatya  in  Turkey:  Turkey is a NATO ally and no friend of Iraq or Syria.
This  airbase  is  home  for aircraft assigned to defend Turkey's southeast
border and from here planes can reach the capitals and other targets within
both Iraq and Syria

Tabuk in Saudi Arabia:  This minor airbase serves as a defensive post along
the  Saudi  Arabian  frontier.   In  any  armed  conflict in the region, US
aircraft  would  only  be  allowed  to  land  here  in an emergency, unless
circumstances  clearly  called for Saudi Arabian support of US interests or
vice versa

Desert Storm:  1991

The  western  end of the Persian Gulf protrudes into the center of the map,
and around it lie the region's three most powerful nations:  Iran, north of
the  Gulf;  to  the west Iraqi and Saudi Arabia to the south.  Between them
all,  sitting  astride  the  most valuable oil fields on Earth, is the tiny
Arab sheikdom of Kuwait.

Iran,  the  successor  state  to  ancient  Persia,  is  ruled  by a radical
fundamentalist Shi'ite Moslem regime, a brutal government that has actively
tried to spread revolu tionary fundamentalism to its neighbors.  Iran has a
large  population  and  oil revenues to support a powerful military (though
obtaining  modern military equipment has been difficult since 1979, when it
basically declared war on the world

Iraq  is  a  populous  Arab  country  centered  on  the  fertile Tigris and
Euphrates  river valleys.  It has a Shi'ite Moslem majority but is ruled by
Saddam Husseins Baath Party which is dominated by Sunni Moslems Wealth from
oil revenues has enabled presi dent Saddam to build a well-equipped, modern
military,  outfitted  mainly with Soviet built equipment and trained by Red
Army  advisers.   In  1980, sensing potential weakness to the east.  Saddam
ordered  an  invasion  of  Iran.   For  eight long years, the two countries
fought  a  savage and debilitating war of attrition.  When a cease fire was
finally  signed  in 1988 neither side had gained anything except the deaths
of hundreds of thousands

The  kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia is a vast, underpopulated desert ruled by a
conser  native  royal  family.   Like its neighbors, Saudi Arabia has spent
much  of  its considerable oil wealth on modern arms, purchased mainly from
the  West.   Like  other  Gulf  states  Saudi  Arabia  fears Iran's Islamic
fundamentalism  will incite rebellion among its own populace.  Accordingly,
Saudi Arabia lent monetary support to Saddams Iraq during the Iran Iraq war

Arrogant, oil rich Kuwait, with the highest per capita income in the world,
is  disliked  by  all  three  Gulf giants.  Kuwait has also spent freely on
armaments,  but  it  is  so  small  that  it cannot really rely on arms for
protection.   Instead,  it  trusts  its  staggering  wealth  to pay for its
troubles.   Despite  its  longstanding  border  disputes  with  Iraq  (over
ownership  of some of the richest oil producing terrain known), Kuwait also
supported Iraq with cash during the Iran Iraq war.

1990  found  Saddam  Hussein  in  a  bind.   He had nothing to show for his
disasterous  eight  year war with Iran except staggering foreign debt.  His
economy  was  depressed  and  his  personal  myth as a great Arab leader in
doubt.

To  Saddam,  it  was  clear that only a major move on the world stage could
recoup  his  losses  and put his regime back on the road to glory.  Kuwait,
virtually  undefended the richest piece of real estate in the world, seemed
like  an  easy mark.  Who would come to the aid of unloved Kuwait?  If Iraq
absorbed  Kuwait  in  a  lightning  invasion, Saddam was confident that the
nations of the world will bluster for a few weeks take note of his powerful
military, then accept it.

It was to be a costly mistake

Within  days  following  the  invasion,  US  air,  ground, and naval forces
gathered  in the area, and prepared to meet what was believed to be Saddams
next  move:   an  invasion of Saudi Arabia.  For several weeks the build up
continued  and  US  forces dug in to the desert in Operation Desert Shield.
Almost  unbelievably,  the  Iraqis  did  nothing  but  wait  for the forces
opposing  them  to  get  stronger.  Soon, US forces were joined by soldiers
from Great Britain, France, Egypt, Syria, and a host of others

While  the  build  up  continued  Allied leaders demanded the "complete and
unconditional   withdrawal   of  Iraqi  forces  from  Kuwait."  Saddam  was
recalcitrant.  Soon the US-led coalition had achieved an irresistible force
of men and equipment, airpower and seapower ..but Saddam refused to move

On  January  16,  1991 US air forces led by F-117A stealth fighters began a
long withering bombardment of Iraqi strategic targets .  .  .

Levels of Conflict

Cold  War:   During  the build up, the F-117A is used to fly reconnaissance
sorties  over  Iraq  and  occupied  Kuwait  to  determine  the strength and
dispositions of Iraqi forces

Limited  War:   During  the  first  few  weeks  of the aerial bombardments,
Coalition  forces  are  very  careful to restrict their sorties to surgical
strikes.   The  tense  political  environment  of  the  Gulf  makes  wanton
destruction unwise.

Conventional  War:   As  the  bombardment  continues the the target list is
expanded  until, when the ground troops finally go in, all military targets
are fair game.

Iraqi Military Forces

Iraq  has  the  world's  fourth  largest standing army, deploying around 50
divisions  with nearly a million troops under arms.  Many of these soldiers
are poorly trained poorly motivated, and poorly led, but at the core of the
Iraqi  army  are  the  eight elite divisions of the Republican Guard, whose
morale is high and whose equipment is first rate.

Air  Defenses:   Iraq  has  invested  heavily  in  surface  to air missiles
especially  SA-2 "Guidelines" SA 6 "Gainfuls" and SA9 "Gaskins" but you may
face  almost any Soviet made SAM in the catalog.  Older SAMs like the SA 2s
have  been considerably improved by Iraq's domestic missile industry, which
has  added  enhancements  like  modern  infrared terminal guidance systems.
Iraq  also  has a vast array of antiaircraft artillery ("triple-A"), but it
lacks  modern  fire  control.   It  offers  little  threat,  and  isnt even
represented in the game.

Air Forces:  The Al Quwwat al Jawwiya al lraquiya, the Iraqi Air force, has
over  500  modern  combat  planes,  including  a  number of very formidable
fighters  and interceptors.  The types you are most likely to encounter are
the MiG-29 "Fulcrum" MiG 23 "Flogger" and the Mirage F-1E The F-1E is built
by   the  French  Dassault  Aviation  company,  and  is  a  multi-role  air
superiority/ground  attack fighter with modern avion ics and the ability to
carry  Exocet  anti-ship missiles.  Normally the F-1 is configured to carry
French  Matra  550  air to air missiles, but the Iraqi planes may have been
altered to enable carriage of Soviet AAMs.

Kuwait Cities and Targets

Kuwait City:  At the head of the Gulf is Kuwait City, capital of Kuwait and
home  to  nearly all the country's population.  Occupying Iraqi troops have
made  the  city  an  armed  camp,  within  which the Baathist secret police
conduct a reign of terror

Sea  Island:   The  pumping station here gushes crude oil directly into the
Gulf, an act of Iraqi environmental terrorism.

Kuwait,Saudi  Border:   Look  closely  and  you'll  see Iraqi armored units
awaiting  the  Coalition  invasion, or orders to attack Saudi Arabia to the
South

Iraqi Cities and Targets

Basra:   Iraq`s  second-largest  city  boasts  an  oil refinery and a major
airbase.  Fixed Scud launching sites are located to the west.

Jalibah  and  Amarah:   These  are major Iraqi airbases.  Capturing Jalibah
west  of Basra, will be a goal of Coalition troops when the ground war gets
underway

Baghdad:   Iraq's  capital  and largest city, Baghdad is also the country`s
military  command  center.   Targets here include the Defense Ministry, the
Presidential Palace a nuclear weapons research plant, an oil refinery and a
major airbase

Samarra and Qaim:  Biological weapons plants are located in these towns

Salman Pak:  This is iraq's most important chemical weapons plant

Habbaniyah and Hadithah:  Iraqi Air Force bases.

Mosul:   Targets  at this important northern city include a nuclear weapons
research facility and an airbase.

Kirkuk:  Another major city, defended by an Iraqi airbase.

Samarra:  This town is the home of another major chemical weapons plant

Irbil:   The research facility here is an important part of Saddams nuclear
weapons project.

Friendly Bases

Tabuk, Ha'il, Buraydah, Shagra:  These desert airstrips have been ex panded
for the use of Coalition planes making strikes into Iraq

Riyadh:   The  capital  of Saudi Arabia, and equipped with a large airbase.
Riyadh is a frequent target of Iraqi Scud missile attacks.

Dhahran  and  Huffuf:   Dhahran is perhaps the largest, most modern airbase
serving the Coalition

CV  Constellation in the Gulf:  Of course, Air Force (Lockheed) F-117As did
not  actually  fly from Navy carriers in the Gulf War, but naval air played
such  an  important part in the air campaign that we thought they shouldn`t
be  overlooked.   (And  besides, the MicroProse F-117A is fully equipped to
launch from carriers.)

Vietnam:  1994

Now  roughly  20  years  since  the end of the Vietnam war.  The Vietnamese
military  is  expanding  its  hold  in  Southeast Asia, seeking to become a
regional  superpower.   Their first move was to officially absorb Laos into
Vietnam,  and  divide it into several provinces under direct Hanoi control.
Secondly.  they pushed back into Cambodia under the pretense of solving the
confusing political situation there, and ousting once and for all Pol Pot's
threat of resurfacing as a tyrannical leader.

In  the  Soviet  Union,  meanwhile,  the  conservatives have had, enough of
reform  and  decadence, and have reasserted their dominance over the course
of  the  nations future They are now fueling regional communist states into
expansion  and inciting revolution just like "the good old days." Now, only
pro-Western  Thailand  remains  to  stand  against Soviet-backed Vietnamese
expansion  in  Southeast  Asia  -  looks like the "domino theory" should be
dusted off again.

Level of Conflict

Cold  War:   As  soon as it is clear that Vietnam has aggressive designs on
her  neighbors,  F-117A  sorties  are initiated over the area for recon and
selective strikes

Limited  War:   With  the  annexation  of Laos and invasion of Cambodia, US
response  intensifies.   Ground  troops  are  sent  into  the  theater  and
aggresive air activity is initiated

Conventional  War:   The Vietnamese invasion of Thailand initiates outright
war  between  US  forces and the Vietnamese army.  The full power of the US
military machine is again in action in Southeast Asia.

Vietnamese Military Forces

AirDefenses:   The  North  Vietnamese  use  Soviet  built equipment and are
trained  by  Soviet  advisors.  The majority of the SAMs deployed are SA 10
"Grumble"  and  SA-11  "Gadfly"  Vietnamese ground forces are also equipped
with  good  Soviet  equipment  they  carry  SA 7B "Grail" shoulder launched
missiles, and some units are equipped with SA 9B "Gaskin."

Air  Force:   The  majority  of  the fighter aircraft in the Vietnamese Air
Force are MiG 21s and MiG 23s some what out dated but still effective.  The
soviets  have  also  sold  a  substantial  number  of  MiG 25s, a few MiG29
"Fulcrum"  and  intelligence  reports  sightings  of the Su 27 as well; the
MiG29s and Su 27s are probably being operated by Soviet personnel.

Navy:  the Vietnamese Navy consists only of a few torpedo boats transferred
to  it  from  the navies of Communist China and the Soviet Union.  From the
Soviets came 190-ton SO 1 class boats and from the Chinese came Shanghai II
class  boats.   Both  these boats are antiquated compared to a modern navy.
but their crews may carry SA 7B "Grails".

Vietnamese Cities and Targets

Hanoi:  Surrounded by numerous airbases and SAM batteries, the capital city
of  Vietnam  is  one of the most heavily defended air targets in the World.
Nearby airbases are located at Gia Lam, Phuc Yen, and Kep.

Haiphong:   this  city is a major Vietnamese port, and it is guarded by SAM
missiles and a fighter airbase nearby at Cat Bi.  Located near Haiphong are
numerous military storage dumps and tank farms.

Vinh:   This  coastal city supports an interceptor airbase that defends the
major  bridges  to the northwest.  The approaches to Vietnam from Thailand,
and the supply routes to the southwest.

Dong  Hoi:   This city supports a major Vietnamese airbase used for strikes
into  Thailand.   Although often attacked by friendly forces flying in from
the sea, it remains operational and its interceptors will attack US fighter
bombers heading west.

Da  Nang:   Formerly  a  major  US base durin g the first Vietnam War.  The
Vietnamese  have  converted  it into a major air defense center.  Like Dong
Hoi,  its  airfield  and accompanying SAM batteries and radar installations
protect  the  long Vietnamese coastline from US carrier attacks, and launch
strike bombers into Thailand

Nha Trang:  Located to the east of the central highlands, aircraft from his
base  form  another  link  in the air defense system that guards Vietnamese
coastal waters US seaborne air forces.

Ho  Chi  Minh  City:Formerly  Saigon,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City is now the chief
industrial  center  of  Vietnam.   It is a major port.  and is protected by
numerous SAM batteries and security forces

Tan  Sonh  Nhut  Airbase:  Located out side of Ho Chi Minh City this is the
largest  and busiest airport and base in Southeast Asia.  Military aircraft
based here are used primarily to support supply operations into Cambodia.

Cambodian and Laotian Cities and Targets

Phnom  Penh:   The capital city of Cambodia has fallen under the control of
the Vietnamese Enemy planes are operating from the airbase outside the city
and SAM batteries have been placed in the area.

Vientiane:   Laos  is now officially controlled by the Vietnamese and enemy
aircraft are based at Wattay, near the Laotian capital of Vientine

Friendly Bases

CVNs Constellation and Kitty Hawk at Sea:  these 80,000 ton carriers have a
complement  of  approximately  85  aircraft,  and are placed in the Gulf of
Tonkin  to  strike  targets  deep  in  Vietnam.   The  navy concentrates on
transportation routes bringing supplies south and west into Laos.

Each carrier group consists of one carrier and a ring of escort destroyers.
A combat air patrol of fighter planes is continuously overhead to intercept
any approaching Vietnamese aircraft.

Udorn:  Just over the border in thailand from the former Laotian capital of
Vientiane.   Aircraft  based  here reach out to bomb targets in Vietnam and
Laos.

Don  Muang:   Located  in  the  southeast  corner  of  Thailand, this is an
important  base  for  attacks  into  the southern areas of Vietnam, and the
coastal plains

Korat:   Located  southeast  of  Bangkok in central Thailand, aircraft from
here conducted bombing attacks on targets in Cambodia and Laos.

Takhli:   This  base  northeast  of Bangkok in Thailand was part of the air
defense of the capital and was not an important base for war missions.

Bangkok:   The  capital of Thailand, its largest city, and only substantial
port,  the  airbase  here  is used for staging attacks into Vietnamese-held
Cambodia.

Cuba:  1995

For  many  years  the  US has watched the tiny island nation of Cube became
more and more isolated from the West.  Since the communist revolution there
in 1959 the US and Cuba have lived in a constant state of mutual distrust

In  I961,  the  US sponsored an abortive coup attempt against Fidel Castros
gov ernment.  Styled "the Bay of Pigs," Cuban exiles, supported by minor US
forces  attempted  an invasion of the island.  The 1,300-man invasion force
landed  on the south coast, but was quickly overwhelmed by Cuban forces led
by Castro himself

After  discovering  Soviet  nuclear  missile sites on the island in October
1962  President  Kennedy slapped a naval blockade around Cuba.  This action
almost  led  to  a  full  blown  military  confrontation  between  the  two
superpowers but the Soviet leader.  Nikita Kruschev finally agreed to to US
demands, averting a possible nuclear exchange

Now,  encouraged by the recent re-establishment of conservative factions in
the  Soviet  Union.   Fidel Castro has decided to expand his control of the
Caribbean.

Level of Conflict

Cold   War:   Recently,  Cuban  military  exchange  with  the  Soviets  has
intensified  Rumors  are  that the Soviets have increased sales of arms and
equipment  and  are  sending  more and more advisers.  Terrorism against US
backed  governments  in  Central America has increased; the flow of illegal
drugs  into  the US through Miami (only 90 miles from Cuba) has also risen.
The  US  strongly  suspects  these  agitations are attributable to Castro's
regime.

Limited  War:   It is clear that Cuban sponsored terrorists are training on
Cuban  territory,  and  recently  Castro  initiated  a subversive policy of
aggression  toward  pro-US Honduras.  The US has determined to make limited
strikes  against  the  island to force Castro to rethink some of his recent
decisions.

Conventional  War:   thinking the new Cold War between the superpowers will
prevent  US  intervention.   Cuba  has sent forces into several surrounding
island  states.   The  Soviet  Union  has  promised  support  should the US
intervene.

Cuban Military Force

The  Cuban military has nearly 300,000 men under arms, a sizeable force for
such  a small country.  By 1990 it was spending nearly $15 billion annually
on military concerns, and by now that figure has increased significantly.

Air Defenses:  Cuba, of course, uses Soviet built equipment.  Its old SA-2s
and  SA-5s  are  believed  to  have  been  phased  out in the early 90s and
replaced  by  the  newer SA 10 and SA 12 systems.  Local ground forces have
acquired SA-14s and SA-16s

Air  Force:   Cuba's  rapidly  expanding  air force is made up primarily of
MiG-21s  MiG 23s, and a few old MiG 17s.  However, over the past five years
the  Soviet  Union has sold Cuba a large number of MiG 29 "Fulcrums" and it
is believed the Mig-21s are being replaced by these far superior fighters.

Cuba  also flies some of the best Soviet transports and helicopters for its
airbourne troops, including the An 72 "Coaler" jet transport

Navy:   Cuba  is  an island nation and boasts a substantial naval force for
its  size It has 3 Mariel class Soviet frigates, over 200 sa I and II class
missile  boats,  and a large number of smaller patrol boats.  Additionally,
it has several ex Soviet Foxtrot submarines and 15 or more minesweepers.

Cuban Cities and Targets

San  Julian:   Located at the westernmost end of Cuba, San Julian is one of
the  major  air  defense  bases on the island.  An airbase and powerful SAM
battery protect the facilities here

Havana:   The capital city of Cuba, Havana has a major port and naval base,
as  well  as  an  airbase  (San  Antonio  de los Banos) and substantial air
defense installations Much of the nations sugar exports go to sea from this
harbor.

Managua,  Guines,  and Matanzas:  Southeast of Havana, one of the country`s
major  military  base  complexes  and  an  important  base for fighters and
interceptors  is  located.   This  is  an  extremely dangerous area for air
operations  because  of  the extensive SAM sites and ground forces that are
likely to be found here.

Cienfuegos:   Due  east  of  the  infamous  Bahia de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs)
Cienfuegos is a major naval facility and airbase.

Santa  Clara,  Chambas,  and  Ciego de Avilla:  These locations are home to
airfields and SAM installations.

Camaguey:   A  major road and rail junction, Camaguey is one of the largest
cities in Cuba

Santiago  de  Cuba:  This old (1514), lovely seaport city is the capital of
Santiago  province  and  second  largest  city  in  the  country.  Scene of
Castro`s  first  abortive  rebellion (1953), this city lies close to the US
base at Guantanamo Bay.  There is a minor military airbase here and a small
SAM battery.

Antonio  Maceo:   This  is  one  of Cuba's major fighter bases, rumoured to
house  all  the  country's best fighter aircraft, most likely a squadron of
MiG-29s.

Baracoa:   A  minor  airfield  and SAM site is located at this tiny coastal
town,  more importantly, military transports are constantly loading here to
take  Cuban  forces  abroad.   It is said that this is the main embarkation
point for forces heading to neighboring war zones.

Friendly Bases

Key  West Naval Air Station:  Located less than 100 miles from Havana.  Key
West  is  a  logical  location  for  staging  stealth  sorties  against the
Caribbean.  Although a naval base, the new cooperation of the four services
guarantees free access of the Air Force units to Key West

Guantanamo  Bay  Naval  Base:  The US has maintained this base - "Gitmo" to
the  Marines and sailors based there essentially since the Spanish-American
war  It  was developed as a US base in 1902 to protect the almost completed
Panama  Canal.   Top  secret  stealth  sorties would probably be flown from
Guantanamo at least until a serious war erupted.

CV  America  in  the  Caribbean  Sea:  This 60,000-ton Kitty Hawk class con
ventional  aircraft  carrier,  designated CV66, has been transferred to the
Second Fleet and now cruises south of the Cuban archipelago.

Korea:  1997

Since  the  end of the Korean War in 1953, the US has kept a large force in
the  Republic  of  Korea  (South),  defending  its  border with North Korea
against  possible  invasion.   China,  too, has watched Korea uncomfortably
since  ending its involvement in that conflict.  It is safe to say that the
tension  between  North  and South Korea could become a flashpoint for a US
Chinese  confrontation,  rapidly  leading  to  a  superpower  conflict  and
possibly involving the USSR as well.

The  Soviet  Union  and China, both nominally committed to the concept of a
Communist  future,  have  been  wary  allies  for  many years, and tensions
between  these  two nations have been a source of uneasy comfort to the US.
Should  the  two  communist  giants  ever  reconcile  their differences (an
unlikely scenario), the West would face a monolithic superpower with forces
possibly  in  excess  of 30 million a vast nuclear arsenal, and some of the
best military equipment in the world.  This is the West`s nightmare

The  area  of  the two Koreas represents the junction of three superpowers,
the  United  States,  the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China.
North  Korea  is  an extension of Chinese communist philosophy and could be
viewed as a geographical extension as well.  The primary base of the Soviet
Pacific  Fleet  is  located nearby at Vladivostok.  The US maintains Eighth
Army  HQ  in  Seoul  with  a  large  contingent  of  ground  and air forces
immediately at hand in nearby Japan.

Level of Conflict

Cold  War:   Tensions  between  the  North  and  South  have intensified as
scattered  firing  has erupted along the border.  China is on alert status.
claiming  it  has  news  of  a major South Korean push into the North.  The
US,denying  these  claims, has maintained a policy of staunch resistance to
any  Chinese  move of aggression.  The Soviets have alerted their naval and
air  defenses  for  possible incursions into their territory, and are ready
and willing to act.  It is very dangerous to fly near Vladivostok.

Limited  War:   The  North Koreans, alleging unacceptable atrocities by the
South  has sent armored forces across the DMZ in the west toward Seoul; the
eastern  DMZ  areas  are  still  relatively quiet.  The Chinese have yet to
react, but intellligence reports indicate they will intervene quickly.  The
Soviet forces are on active alert and are waiting for the order to commence
hostilities.   Stealth  missions  will provide valuable information and may
well get a point across.

Conventional  War:   The  Chinese have begun supporting north Korean forces
with  air  power, and the US has responded with open air operations against
North  Korean and Chinese targets.  Though not officially "in the war," the
Soviets  are  shooting  at  anybody that violates their airspace and beyond
this  could quickly escalate into a major superpower confrontation possibly
WWIII

Korean Military Forces

The  North Korean People's Army (NKPA) is large compared to the size of the
country,  with more than 1,000,000 men actively under arms, another 200,000
security forces and an additional 2.3 million in the Workers.  and Peasants
Militia.   North  Korea  gets most of its military equipment from Soviet or
Chinese sources.

Air  Defenses:   The  Democratic  People`s Republic of Korea supports 4 SAM
brigades  equipped  primarily  with  SA  2 "Guidelines" and SA 5 "Gammons".
Units of these brigades are spread at various areas around the perimeter of
the  country  primarily  at  airbases  and  other important military sites.
Recently,  however,  reports  have been filed stating that SA-10 "Grumbles"
have  been  delivered.   Other  ground  forces  of the infantry and armored
divisions  use SA-2s and SA-5s as well, and some deploy with the newer SA 8
"Gecko."

Air  Force:   The  People.s  Air  Force  uses  Chinese  and Soviet aircraft
(although  Chinese  fighters  and  interceptors  are themselves essentially
clones of Soviet craft) including MiG 17s, MiG 23s, MiG 25s, and MiG29s.

Navy:   The  People's  Navy too is equipped with Soviet vessels.  Osa class
missile boats, 20 submarines (again surprising for a country of this size),
and at least 3 frigates.

Korean Cities and Targets

P'yongyang:   The capital of the People's Republic of Korea, P`yongyang has
a  population  of  over one million and is Korea's oldest city (dating from
1122  BC).   It  is the site of one of the People's Air Force's major bases
and has powerful SAM batteries protecting it.

Wonsan:   Almost  due  east  of  P'yongyang,  Wonsan is the largest city on
Koreas  east  coast  and  is  one  of  its  two major naval bases.  The SAM
batteries  protecting  it  also provide air security for the large military
airbase just outside the city.

Sinuiji:   On the banks of the Yalu River just across from the Chinese city
of Andong, Sinuiji houses another of North Korea's air force facilities and
SAM sites.

Namp'o:   Southwest of P'yongyang, Namp.o lies on Korea`s western coast and
houses a major naval and air facility.

Sunan  and Taechon:  North of P'yongyang, these two moderately sized cities
house  airfields  and  SAM  sites.   Sunan  is  part  of the complex of air
defenses  that  ring  the  capitol of P'yongyang, while Taechon is near the
border with China and is part of the general air defense of the country.

Ch'ongin,  Yong-an,  and  Hamhung:  These eastern coastal cities have bases
which  protect  the country from air attack from the sea, forming the first
line  of  defense  against  Japan  based US forces.  The SAM sites in these
areas are part of the country`s general air defense system.

Chinese Military Forces

The  People's  Liberation  Army (PLA) is perhaps the largest armed force in
the  world.   It  has  some  3,200,000 men in active armed service and some
20,000,000 security forces under arms; it also has an estimated 182,000,000
men fit for military service should mobilization ever be necessary, however
it is doubtful whether the economy could support such a force.

China  has  had nuclear arms for a number of years with a force substantial
enough  to make it a "superpower." It has a large, world class navy, though
it doesnt appear in this game because Chinese access to the Sea of Japan is
limited.   Interestingly,  China has some 35,000 marines, which, except for
the  US,  gives  it  the  the largest marine force in the world (the US has
136,000 and the USSR has around 15.000).

Most  of  its  "high-tech"  military  equipment  was cloned from antiquated
Soviet  models.   Though it is well-known that China's own arms industry is
modernizing, the pace of modernization is somewhat slow, especially in view
of  recent  Western embargos on military technology.  the sheer size of the
organization  of the PLA makes it unwieldy and inefficient.  Though, as the
US discovered in the Korean War, it can respond quickly and fight fiercely.

Air  Defenses:  Chinese SAMs are primarily fixedsite SA2s which the Chinese
call HY 2.

Air  Force:  The PLA.s primary fighters are MiG-17s and MiG-21s (J-4/5s and
J-7s)  Recon  planes  are  usually MiG-17s and they have several antiquated
Soviet bombers

Chinese Cities and Targets

Tonghua:  The major Chinese city in this part of northeast China is Tonghua
located  on a tributary of the Yalu River and a major east west crossroads,
this city is home of a major PLA airbase and air-defense station.

Hunjiang  and  Fusong:   Northeast and north of tonghua, these small cities
are important air defense centers in northeast China.

Yanji  and  Diyingou:   These  small  cities are located in the easternmost
areas  of  China  and form the first line of defense against an attack from
the Soviets at Vladivostok.

Changbai and Changchun:  These small cities sport substantial SAM batteries
and are a part of the larger air defense system.

Soviet Military Forces

The  Soviet  Pacific  Fleet  and  large  air  units are based in and around
Vladivostok All the most modern Soviet equipment is found in the region.

Long-range SAMs:  The older SA-2s and SA-5s have been upgraded to SA-10 and
SA-12  quality.   The  entire  system is enhanced by the LPAR early warning
radar system at Poltavka.

Light  SAMs:   Soviet  security forces in this area are outfitted with SA-8
and SA-11 radar guided SAMs

The PVO and Naval Aviation

Fighters:   This  region  is  defended partly by PVO units, with MiG-25 and
MiG-31  interceptors  using  long  range radar homing AAMs.  Naval aviation
fighters  operating  from carriers or land strips include the Yak 38 V/STOL
jet  and Su-27 multi-purpose fighters.  During wartime shorter ranged units
may  arrive,  including  MiG-29  and Su-27 dogfighters with short- and long
range weapons.

Reconnaissance  Bombers:   Many long-range Tu-95D "Bears" are based in this
area,  to  watch  the enlarged US presence.  A nuisance in peacetime, these
planes pose a more serious threat in war.

AEW &C Aircraft:  The Soviets routinely deploy IL-76 "Mainstay" aircraft in
the  region.   The  300+  mile  radars  on  these  planes  may be your most
formidable enemy

Navy:  The Soviet Pacific Fleet (based at Vladivostok) offers a significant
threat.   Its  modern  Sovremennyy  class destroyers carry SA-N-7 missiles,
while  Krivak  class  frigates  sport  the  SA-N-4.   The larger Kiev-class
carrier  has  the  powerful  SA-N-6,  a  sea going equivalent to the SA-10.
These  warships  are  more than capable of defending themselves.  Stationed
south  of  Vladivostok,  these units extend the Soviet air defense umbrella
far into the Sea of Japan.

In addition to these ships' SAMs, Kiev-class carriers mount a complement of
Yak  38  "jump  jet"  fighters.  and the new Kremlin class nuclear aircraft
carriers have also joined the Pacific fleet.

Soviet Cities and Targets

Wadivosto:   Founded  in  1860,  Vladivostok  is  relatively young as Asian
cities go It is the home port of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, the chief Soviet
port  in  the  Pacific, and the terminus of the Trans Siberian Railroad.  A
powerful  contingent of Soviet Naval Aviation is also based here along with
powerful elements of the PVO (National Air Defense)

Poltavka:   This  is  a  smaller city used as a support for Vladivostok.  A
long  range  Phased  Array  Radar  (LPAR)  system  that extends the defense
umbrella  far  into the sea of Japan is located here along with an airfield
and SAM battery

Nachodka:   This  small  city  is perhaps the southeastern-most city in the
Soviet  Union.   Its  airfield  and  SAM  sites  protect  the approaches to
Vladivostok

Friendly Bases

Ch'unch'on  (South  Korea):   This  is  one  of South Korea's major cities.
Located about 60 miles northeast of the capital at Seoul, it has one of the
country`s major USAF airbases in South Korea.

CVN  Nimitz  and  Constellation  at Sea:  These huge 80,000 ton nuclear car
riers  are  the  the  latest and most powerful aircraft carriers available.
They  now  cruise the Sea of Japan in case the "Korean problem" should turn
"hot.

Key to Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs)

Name: The commonly used name of the system.

Mounting: How the system appears when seen.

Fixed:   Fixed  site  missile launchers.  Positioned around a central radar
station

Mobile:  Vehicle-mounted launders and radar, usually parked in an irregular
pattern

Warship:  Ship borne system.  The radar and missile launcher are mounted on
a warship

Infantry:  Shoulder-launched SAM, carried by infantrymen.

Search Guidance:  The type and quality of search radar used by the missile

Dop:  Doppler radar.  It is most effective when you fly toward or away from
it, least effective when you arc around it at a constant distance.

Pulse:   Pulse  radar.   It  is  most effective when you fly sideways to it
least effective when you fly straight at it.

Search  Range  (km):   The theoretical maximum range (in kilometers) of the
search  radar.   However,  against your F-117, radar performance is greatly
reduced.  The quality of the radar and local conditions determine its real,
effective range.

Firing  Guidance:   The  way  the  missile  finds your aircraft.  Pulse and
Doppler  radars have varying effectiveness depending on your flight path in
relation to the missile (see search guidance, above, for details).

BR  Pulse:   Beam Rider Pulse radar.  The missile uses pulse radar guidance
with  the  radar  receiver  at the launching site; it cannot "burn through"
jamming at close range.

SA Pulse:  Semi-Active Pulse radar.  The missile uses pulse radar guidance,
with  the  receiver  in the missile; it may "burn through" jamming at close
range.

SA  Dop:   Semi  Active  Doppler  radar.   The  missile  uses Doppler radar
guidance with the receiver in the missile; it can "burn through" jamming at
close range

SA+CG  Dop:   Semi-Active Doppler radar with Command Guidance.  The missile
uses  Doppler  radar  guidance,  with  the receiver in the missile.  It can
"burn through" jamming at close range and can conduct multiple attacks.

IR  (1):   First Generation IR homing.  The missile seeks hot exhausts.  It
is very vulnerable to jamming and flares.

IR  (2):   Second Generation IR homing.  The missile seeks any hot surface,
including  nose, wing edges, tail, etc.  It has logic circuits that help it
recover from jamming or flares.

Visual:   The  missile  is  guided  by a controller on the ground, who must
watch your plane and react to your maneuvering.

Firing Range:  Maximum range (in kilometers) at which the missile is fired
 
Max  Speed:  Maximum speed in flight of the missile.  Mach 1 is about 660
kts.

Max Alt:  Maximum altitude the missile can reach.

Maneuverability:  The turning ability of the missile in flight.

F-117A Air To Ground Weapons

Guided Missiles


AGM-88A HARM
High speed Anti-Radiation Missile
Quantity per bay:         1
Optimum Targets:          Ground radar stations
Acceptable Targets:       Warship radars
Effective Range:          20 kilometers
Max Speed:                Mach 2+
Attack Technique:         Air-to ground fire and forget
Min Launch Altitude:      500'
Max Launch Altitude:      60,000'

Notes:  America's most advanced anti-radar missile, theHARM1 can lock-on to
hostile radars even if they change frequencies or switch off.  US officials
have  hinted that it can home on radar components that are still warm, even
if  the  set  is turned off!  The missile also has a "loiter" mode where it
circles,  waiting for a hostile radar to turn on.  The "loiter" attack mode
is not available to HARMs carried on the F-117A.


PENGUIN-3 ASM
Medium-altitude infrared-homing anti-ship missile.
Quantity per bay:         2
Acceptable Targets:       Ships at sea
Effective Range:          32 kilometers
Max Speed:                Mach 0.8
Attack Technique:         Air to-ground fire and-forget launch against
                          any warship
Min Launch Altitude:      500'
Max Launch Altitude:      40,000'

Notes:   Designed  in Norway.  This modestly sized and priced missile flies
to  a  designated  point, then switches on an infrared homer that seeks the
heat of a ship against the cool ocean background.


AGM-84A "HARPOON"
Sea-skimming radar- and inertial-guided anti-ship missile
Quantity per bay:         1
Optimum Targets:          Ships at sea
Effective Range:          60 kilometers
Max Speed:                Mach 0.8
Attack Technique:         Air-to-ground fire-and forget launch against
                          any warship
Min Launch Altitude:      500'
Max Launch Altitude:      40,000'

Notes:   America's  standard anti-missile, the Harpoon is more powerful and
harder  to  stop than the Penguin.  It is launched under inertial guidance,
flying at sea-skimming altitudes to avoid detection.  At a designated point
its  radar  is  activated  to find the target.  It either pops up and dives
onto the target, or flies straight in.


AGM-65D "MAVERICK"
IR-imaging air-to-ground guided missile.
Quantity per bay:         2
Acceptable Targets:       Bridges, bunkers, radar sites, oil facilities,
Poor Targets:             Hangars, ground planes, buildings, depots
                          missile sites
Effective Range:          32 kilometers
Max Speed:                Mach 1+
Attack Technique:         Air to ground fire and forget launch
Min Launch Altitude:      500'
Max Launch Altitude:      40,000'

Notes:   America's  standard air to-ground guided missile, the Maverick has
had  a wide variety of guidance systems.  Originally, a video camera in the
missile's  nose stored an image of the target in the missiles "brain." Once
in  flight  it  steered itself toward the image.  Later versions added zoom
lenses,  PAVE  TACK  lasers, and ultimately, a FLIR imaging system that can
"see" through clouds, smoke, and night.

Laser-Guided Bombs


GBU-12 PAVEWAY
Laser-guided glide bomb.
Quantity per bay:          2
Acceptable Targets:        Almost any
Poor Targets:              Ships
Effective Range:           2 kilometers per 1K` of altitude
Max Speed:                 Glide bomb
Attack Technique:          Toss bombing or level bombing
Toss Release Altitude:     500' and climb
Lavel Release Altitude:    2,000' and turn away

Notes:   The  GBU-12  is a standard in US inventory.  Large fighter bombers
like  the  F-111  favor  heavier 1,000 lb and 2,000 lb models (GBU 15s, for
example,  that  F-111s used to destroy the oil pumping manifolds during the
Iraqi  War),  but the F-117A must carry lighter munitions in its smallbays.
The  PAVETACK laser guidance system is probably the most accurate precision
bombing system in the world.


CBU-72 FAE
Laser guided triple fuel-air explosive bomb
Quantity per bay:          2
Optimum Targets:           Buildings
Acceptable Targets:        Submarine pens, hangars, bunkers, oil 
                           platforms
Poor Targets:              Ships
Effective Range:           2 kilometers per 1k of altitude
Max Speed;                 Glide Bomb
Attack Technique:          Toss bombing or level bombing
Toss Release Altitude:     500' and climb
Level Release Altitude:    2,000' and turn away

Notes:   This  weapon contains a mixture of three gases, which are released
into  the air, forming an explosive mixture.  A delayed action fuse ignites
the  mixture,  causing the contaminated air to expand and burn.  The sudden
expansion  sets off mines and flattens soft objects.  (US warplanes dropped
FAEs on Iraqi minefields during the Gulf War to render them less deadly, in
preparation for the ground attack)


Mk 20 "ROCKEYE" II
Laser-guided high-explosive cluster bomb
Quantity per bay:          2
Acceptable Targets:        Almost anything
Effective Range:           2 kilometer per 1K' of altitude
Max Speed:                 Glide bomb
Attack Technique;          Toss bombing or level bombing
Toss Release Altitude:     500' and climb
Level Release Altitude:    2,000' and turn away

Notes:   This  weapon  marries  a laser guided glide bomb system to a Mk 20
Rockeye  cluster  munition.   The laser guidance allows for earlier release
and greater bomblet release accuracy.

Retarded Bombs


Mk 20 "ROCKEYE"
Retarded fragmentation cluster bomb.
Quantity per bay:          2
Acceptable Targets:        Most anything
Poor Targets:              Ships
Effective Range:           Nil
Max Speed:                 Retarded bomb
Attack Technique:          Low altitude level bombing
Min Release Altitude:      500`

Notes:   This cluster bomb breaks open at a predesignated altitude spinning
out 247 shaped-charge bomblets that can destroy buildings armored vehicles,
and  people.   (The  U.S.   Navy  discovered  these  bombs  were enormously
effective  against  small  warships  when  a  single cluster bomb wrecked a
Libyan Nanuchka-class missile boat in 1986.)


DURANDAL BOMB
Parachute-deployed runway-penetration bomb
Quantity per bay:          2
Optimum Targets:           Runways
Poor Targets:              Bridges
Effective Range:           Nil
Max Speed:                 Retarded bomb
Attack Technique:          Low altitude level bombing
Min Release Altitude:      500'

Notes:   This  French made weapon is the standard anti-runway weapon in the
USAF  arsenal.   Durandal deploys a parachute causing it to float nose down
over  a  runway.   A  rocket  motor  suddenly  ignites blasting the warhead
straight  down  through  the  concrete  where it explodes.  The result is a
thoroughly ruined surface and tons of wreckage


ISC B-1 MINELETS
Parachute-deployed minelet dispenser.
Quantity per bay:          1
Optimum Targets:           Runways
Poor Targets:              Buildings, depots, missile sites, oil facilities
                           on land
Effective Range:           Nil
Max Speed:                 Retarded bomb
Attack Technique:          Low altitude level bombing
Min Release Altitude:      500'

Notes:    This   extremely   new   weapon  dispenses  a  variety  of  small
anti-personnel, anti vehicle, and delayed fuse mines.  Used on airfields it
prevents  flight  operations  until  cleared.  Clearing the mines is compli
cated  by  the variety of types.  as well as random delayed-fuse bombs, and
magnetic fuses that ignite when metul gets too close to them.


Mk 82-1 "SNAKEYE"
Retarded high explosive "iron" bomb
Quantity per bay:         3
Acceptable Targets:       Grounded planes, buildings, depots,
                          oil facilities on land
Poor Targets:             Radar Sites
Effective Range:          Nil
Max Speed;                Retarded Bomb
Attack Technique;         Low altitude level bombing
Min Release Altitude:     500'

Notes:   The  Snakeye  is  the standard vane-type retarder unit for many US
bombs, here attached to the Mk 82 500 lb high explosive bomb.

 
Mk 35 IN CLUSTER
Retarded incendiary cluster bomb
Quantity per bay:         2
Optimum Targets:          Grounded planes, depots, missile sites
                          oil facilities
Acceptable Targets:       Buildings
Poor Targets:             Radar sites, ships
Effective Range:          Nil
Max Speed:                Retarded bomb
Attack Technique:         Low altitude level bombing
Min Release Altitude:     500'

Notes:  Similar to the Rockeye, but filled with 57 incendiary bomblets this
cluster  bomb spreads bomblets over an area of several hundred yards.  Each
bomblet  in  turn  spreads burning liquid wherever it lands, resulting in a
wide ranging, raging fire.


Mk 82-0 "SLICK"
Free-fall high-explosive "iron" bomb.
Quantity per bay:         3
Acceptable Targets:       Buildings, depots, oil facilities on land
Poor Targets:             Almost anything else
Effective Range:          Nil
Max Speed:                Free-fall bomb
Attack Technique:         Level bombing or dive bombing
Level Release Altitude:   3,000'
Dive Release Altitude:    Dive from 8,000'. Release at 3.000'

Notes: A traditional 500 lb high explosive, virtually unchanged since WWII


Mk 122 "FIREYE"
Free-fall incendiary "fire" bomb.
Quantity per bay;          2
Acceptable Targets:        Grounded planes, buildings, depots, oil
                           facilities on land
Poor Targets:              Hangars, bunkers, missile sites, radar sites
                           oil platforms, ships
Effective Range:           Nil
Max Speed:                 Free-fall bomb
Attack Technique:          Level bombing or dive bombing
Level Release Altitude:    3,000'
Dive Release Altitude:     Dive from 8,000'. Release at 3,000'

Notes:   This  weapon  contains  incendiary liquid that spreads over a wide
area  and  can  flow  into  vents,  grates,  weapon  slits" etc." making it
effective against vehicles and fortilications as well as open air targets

Other Equipment


135MM/IR CAMERA
Visual and FLIR photographic reconnaissance camera.
Quantity per bay:          1
Targets:                   Any

Max Speed:                 Remains internal
Attack Technique:          Level low altitude photographic run
Photo Run Altitude:        200'

Notes:   This  pallet  contains  a  135mm high-resolution camera for use in
visible  light,  and a second camera for infrared (IR) thermal photography.
Both  photographs  are  taken  simultaneously,  under pilot Control and the
pilot  can view through either.  When in use the F-117As tracking camera is
"frozen"  into  a  pre-programmed  position"  allowing  it to function as a
viewer for the big 135mm lens.

Surface To Air Missile Systems

SAM Technical Specifications

Radar  Ratings:   Pulse  radar is generally less effective than Doppler and
obsolete  radar  of  either type is greatly inferior to modern radar.  As a
result  modern  Doppler  radar  is the most dangerous, while obsolete pulse
radar is the least dangerous

Ranges:   The  maximum  firing  range is often less than the maximum search
range, due to the limited fuel carried by most missiles.

Guidance  Systems:   Radar-guided missiles, with or with or without command
guidance,  are  confused  by the ECM jammer unless they are very close.  If
they  are  close,  chaff  is  needed instead.  Infrared guided missiles are
confused  by  your  IR  jammer  unless  very  close,  where flares are used
instead.  A decoy is effective against both types of missiles.

Visually  guided missiles cannot be fooled, but are slow reacting, allowing
you to outmaneuver them easily.

Maximum  speed is a useful measure of whether you can outrun a missile, and
how  much reaction time you have after one is fired.  Speeds of Mach 1 or 2
are  considered  to be slow by modern standards.  Mach 3 or faster missiles
are much more formidable opponents.

Maximum  altitude is also a useful measure, since in some cases you can fly
above the missile`s ceiling.

Maneuverability  indicates  how easy it is to outmaneuver the missile.  The
less   maneuverable   the  missile,  the  better  your  chance  of  turning
perpendicular to its course and outmaneuvering it.

WARPLANES

Key To Aircraft Data

Fighter:   A  fighter  plane  specializes  in  air to air combat, where the
objective is destroying enemy aircraft.

Interceptor:   An  interceptor  is a fighter designed to fly long distances
and attack distant enemy aircraft.  Many interceptors are poor dogfighters

Strike:   A  strike  plane  is  designed  to  hit  surface targets in enemy
territory

. Close support strikes are against enemy frontline troops

. Interdiction strikes are against military targets in rear areas

. Deep strikes attack enemy installations far behind the front line

. Attack aircraft are designed to strike warships 

Bombers:   Bombers are designed for interdiction, deep strike, and or naval
attack.  as well as carrying nuclear weapons and/or reconnaissance gear.

Transports:   Transports  carry  personnel  and  equipment.   They  are not
designed to right, and almost never carry any armament

AEW&C:   These  planes carry powerful search radars and communications gear
designed  to  watch  friendly  and  hostile  aircraft  while simultaneously
controlling friendly air operations.

Mission Weight

This  is  the  typical total weight of the plane, with fuel and weapons, at
take  off.   If  the  plane can serve in both fighter and strike roles, the
fighter  weight  is  given.   In a strike role a plane often carries 15-35%
additional weight in bombs and AGMs

Engines

The  total thrust of an engine (on afterburners if available) is important.
Airplanes  with greater thrust than weight can fly "ballistically" a useful
advantage  in  air  combat  A  high  thrust/weight  ratio is desired by all
fighter pilots

Range and Ceiling

Range  is  the  approximate combat radius of a plane when loaded for action
but  using  only  internal  tanks  (no  extra  fuel tanks).  Ceiling is the
maximum altitude of the plane, using afterburners if available.

Maximum Speed

This  is  the  plane`s  maximum  speed  at  36,000', an important benchmark
altitude  because  above  it  Mach  1 is 573 knots.  Although this speed is
important the optimum turning speed for most aircraft is Mach 0.75 to 0.90:
higher  speeds  are  good  only for chasing or escaping from opponents, and
quick dashes in enemy airspace.

Armament

Often  weapons  pylons  can be fitted to carry various bombs or lightweight
missiles.   The  number  of  pylons  need  not limit the number of ordnance
items.

Radar Quality

As  a  stealth pilot, you are naturally interested in the range and quality
of  enemy  airborne  search radar.  These refer to air to air search radars
only.

Designers Notes 

Background

F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0 is the result ot lots and lots ot people working
closely  together  over  a long period of time.  It really goes all the way
back to 1987 when the first game on the topic was done.

Project  Stealth  Fighter  (for the Commodore 64) was the first effort at a
stealth  game  and it worked remarkably well given its limited 8-bit, 1 MHz
environment  -  Arnold  Hendrick  and Jim Synoski had set the stage for the
next try at a stealth game

When  Sid  Meier and Andy Hollis teamed up to do the same game for a 16 bit
IBM  machine,  a  large  team was quickly assembled to work on what we knew
would  be  a  great game.  Four and a half man years later, when MicroProse
finally released F-19 Stealth Fighter for the IBM in the fall of 1988.  The
US Air Force finally unveiled its much rumored stealth fighter, the F-117A.

We  thought F-19 would be a winner because it was the most realistic combat
flight  game  to date for the commercial marketplace, but we had no idea of
the  magnitude  of  its  success.  It sold LOTS of copies fast and won just
about  every conceivable award in the first year it was on the shelves.  It
was  proclaimed  .....possibly  the  best computer game ever made.....  The
Software  Publisher's  Association  voted it the best game of the year, and
the  accolades  go  on and on.  Even now it continues to be one of our best
selling titles

The  Air  Force  had  managed  to  keep the look of the F-117A a secret for
nearly  10  years,  fooling everyone, including various model makers, about
the  shape  and  the name of their stealth plane.  As soon as we got a good
look  at the F-117A we knew that sooner or later, we'd update F-19 to match
the look of that aircraft.

In  the fall of 1990, MicroProse president, Bill Stealey suggested the time
had come for us to do it, and we had until the summer of 1991.

Design Team

Since  1988,  MicroProse has done four new games using state of the art 3-D
technol  ogy.  Andy Hollis came out with F-15 Strike Eagle 11, for the fall
of  1989, which used the same core system as F-19 but pushed the boundaries
farther  and  faster.   In  1990  he  used  a related 3-D system to produce
Lightspeed.   In  both  these products the 3-D was improved and modified to
render  more colorful, faster code.  Meanwhile Scott Spanburg had developed
a  different  but  related  system,  first for M1 Tank Platoon, then in the
following  year for Knights of the Sky.  So we`ve gained lots of experience
with  3-D  systems,  and  it  is fair to say that the 3-D system you see in
F-117A  is  the  product of all the 3-D work that MicroProse has done since
1988.

Lead  programmer  Joe  Hellesen  was  given the unenviable task of taking a
great  game, F 19.  and improving it.  We were able to enlist Max Remington
(3-D  artist for virtually all of MicroProse's games) to do the new objects
we  needed.   Bruce  Shelley was charged with overseeing the development of
the  new  worlds  that  would have to be constructed, and Bruce Milligan (a
recently  hired game designer) was charged with constructing them.  Veteran
computer  artists  Kim  Biscoe  and  Barbara Bents were brought on-board to
provide  art  for  opening and closing screens,  and Ed Fletcher, a new hot
shot  addition  to  MPS  Labs,  was brought on to do the front and end game
programming

From  the  outset, Joe and I agreed not to tamper with the basic gameplay -
F-19  was  a  real  winner which had enjoyed phenomenal success.  The basic
gameplay  is solid ....  "if it ain`t broke don`t fix it." We decided that,
given  time  constraints, the best course was to concentrate on graphics to
see if we could make it more realisc, fun and set a new standard for future
flight sims in terms of graphic presentation of the world in which you fly

Already,  we had a system that allowed a great deal ot detail but we wanted
to  enhance  it, make it more believable, more colorful.  The original game
had  been  done  with  16  color  3-D worlds (at that time 16-color EGA was
pushing  the  limits of the technology), so the first step was to adapt the
game to 256-color graphics.  This meant a lot of work for Max and Joe.  All
the  objects  had to be recolored, and in some cases rebuilt to accommodate
256-color graphics

To  make sure players have plenty of areas in which to fly, we included all
four  worlds  from  the  old F-19, and added five more two from F-15 II and
three new ones.

The  night  world  took  on  new significance because the real F-117A never
flies  combal  sorties during the day.  Joe and Kim came up with a striking
night  horizon.  Then we added lights to the ground objects which switch on
an  off according to where you are (enemy or friendly territory), the level
of  tension, and what time of day it is.  Next we added a sky that lightens
and  darkens dynamically according to the time of day Finally, we added the
FLIR camera view, partly because it was "cool" and partly out of necessity:
in  the deepest, darkest night, it is imperative to use the FLIR so you can
tell  what  you`re looking at.  These combine to give a very strong feeling
of realism.

To  go  with these additions we also needed a real-looking F-117A aircraft.
Max  spent  several  long weekends building the most complex object ever to
appear in a home computer game, and Joe and Andy came up with a way to make
all those surfaces and lines sort correctly

During the development period, US forces were involved in a war in Iraq and
Kuwait  which  showed  just  how  effective  precision bombing can be.  Joe
immediately  began  to work on a new view through the tracking camera.  One
that would show the "real" world outside your aircraft, like the video tape
shown  at  briefings during the war He linked this view to the nose view of
the  Maverick  missile.   Because  this weapon actually has a Camera in its
nose.   (Other weapons that have nose cameras, like the GBU-15s that F-111s
knocked out the pumping manifolds at Sea island, are not represented in the
game because they are probably too heavy for the F-117A)

The  front and end of the game were completely redesigned to make it easier
to  navigate  through  options  and to give a chance for some beautiful 256
colour  graphics to adorn your CRT.  We added a feature that allows you (if
you're  the type) to quickly generate a bunch of missions until you get one
you  really want.  Also, for those of you who want to know what it might be
like  to  fly the real F-117A, we included the "Lockheed F-117A option that
essentially cuts out some of the capabilities to make it more like the real
plane.

There  are  a  lot  of other enhancements; a more intelligent and realistic
cockpit, improved enemy AI, new targets, new missions, and so on and on.

For  those  of you that have enjoyed thew original F-19 we hope you`ll like
this one even more.  For those who are playing our Stealth Fighter game for
the  first time, hold on to your seats and get ready for an experience of a
lifetime.
