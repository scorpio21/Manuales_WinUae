                                   N O V A  9



Welcome to Amiga Nova 9. We at Dynamix have strived to take advantage
of the Amiga during production of Amiga Nova 9. We have also tried to
improve upon the game where possible. Here is a list of special
features of Amiga Nova 9. Please take the time to read this file
before playing Nova 9.


----------------------------------------------------------------
° The Amiga Control section in the manual is almost entirely wrong.
See the control card found in the game box for correct control
information.

° Additional views. The F2 through F4 keys bring up new standard views
that our users and testers have found convenient for different
segments of Nova 9. Give them a try. You can get back to the standard
"through the window" view by pressing F1.

° Full-screen rocket view. Once Sparky has supplied you with the rocket
upgrade, you can switch to firing rockets by pressing the 4 key. You can
steer the rocket as long as you hold down the space bar or the joystick
button. If you want a rocket view, hold down the shift key while firing.
If you want to always switch to a rocket view when firing rockets, turn
on Caps Lock.

° Modified steering control. When you're moving backwards, The left/right
actions of Amiga version of Nova 9 are opposite of the control method
described in the manual. Most players prefer this configuration.

° EHB suggested. Amiga Nova 9 uses many different video modes,
including EHB, HAM, and dual playfield. Nova 9 also uses sprites,
custom copper lists, and other Amiga-specific effects. Although the
game can be played with an Amiga 1000 with an older Denise chip, we
recommend an EHB-compatible Amiga.

° PAL mode support. If your Amiga uses the European PAL mode video
system, automatic analog joystick sensing will not work. To use an
analog joystick on a PAL system, press the period (.) key. Do not
press this key if you do not have an analog joystick.

° Optimized disk layout. If you play Nova 9 from floppy disk, we
suggest that you turn off story panels from the preferences menu (just
press F10 during the game to get the menu). When you're asked if you
want to play the game or play the introduction, choose Play Game and
you'll never have to swap disks.

° Amiga Nova 9 has a password feature that lets you start play on any
level. When you make it past the first level, you'll be given a
password on the high-score screen at the end of the game. To return to
that level, press P during the title screen (the one with the music).
A window will pop up onto the screen. Type the password and press
Return.

° Hard Drive Installation. To install Nova 9 on your hard drive,
insert disk 1 (Nova1) and double-click on the Install icon.

° Running Nova 9. To start Nova 9 from floppy, boot up your Amiga with
disk 1 (Nova1) in your boot drive. From hard drive, click on the Nova9
icon or type NOVA from the CLI or Shell.

° Expanded preferences menu. Press F10 during the game to select
preferences. You can choose between wireframe (for speed) or solid
polygons (for realism). You can also change the difficulty level
during the game. However, changes in difficulty level only take effect
after you warp to a new world.

Personal Log Entry: 8292-2

It has been two years since the devastation of Stellar 7.  Two years
since the disappearance of Draxon.

I thought the isolation of space would help me to forget, but it seems
some things never go away.  The pain of Sarah's death still haunts me
and I sometimes see her face when I climb alone into bed.  While the
Engram computer made in her image keeps the memory alive, it also fans
the emptiness in that dark place of my heart.  So many died during the
nightmare of Stellar 7.  I miss my wife.

As of this writing, reports have just begun to come in from the 
unexplored system of Nova 9.  They are reports that manage to chill
my numb senses.  They tell of a man/creature that has spread like a
disease across the nine planets of the system.  In a matter of days,
the first three planets have been raped and laid barren in a fashion
that defies imagination.  I pray the reports are wrong.

END

Personal Log Entry: 8392-2

Final testing on the newly completed Raven II has begun.  Utilizing
some of the larger asteroids of the Raindel Belt, I have just completed
initial testing of the craft's new shield and modular expansion units.
Due to the limited resources of the Raindel bodies, further testing of
the expansion units will need to be conducted off-base where the craft's
ability to convert raw energy can be thoroughly documented.  The Engram
computer has done a remarkable job of enhancing the technical 
specifications of the Raven's original expansion system.  Much testing
will be needed to fully determine the new design's capabilities, but I
feel confident that it will exceed all previous expectations...

Sarah always did have a flair for binary conversion.  I wish she were
here to see the results of her work.

END

Personal Log Entry: 8492-2

The secondary report from Command has just come in.  I am to proceed
with the dispatched cargo ship to the first planet of the Nova 9
system.

Final testing of the Raven II has just been completed.

Reports from deep space probes are minimal.  it doesn't matter.  I 
know what is waiting.  I know all too well.

God help up...

Gir Draxon

Gir Draxon, Arcturan Empire Supreme Overlord, commanded enemy forces
in the bloody war of Stellar 7.  Known for his insatiable thirst for
power, Draxon would not have settled for anything less than total
control of the galaxy.

Even though the war of Stellar 7 was very costly, it was imperative to
stop Draxon from completing his plans for absolute domination.

Gir Draxon demanded complete loyalty from his troops.  He ruled with an
iron fist and never tolerated failure.  To fail was to die.  He instilled
so much fear in his armies that they followed his orders mechanically
and without hesitation.

Anything or anyone in Draxon's way was systematically destroyed.  Any
resistance to his plans enraged him.  If someone dared stand up to
Draxon and his forces, he would become obsessed with destroying them
and everything they held dear.

Life held no value and Draxon was known to kill just for the pleasure
of it.  The worlds and civilizations that Draxon conquered were plundered
of their resources and left wastelands.

At this point in time, Gir Draxon has still not been brought to justice.
Neither wreckage of Draxon's ship nor Draxon's remains were ever found.
It is now assumed that both he and his ship were destroyed.

NOVA 9 SYSTEM

From: Terran Command
To: Captain John Alex

Please note that due to the unfortunate backlog in the Department of
Planet Research & Exploration, the Nova 9 system has not yet been
explored.  Only preliminary data is available.

In response to the current crisis, all level-1 personnel have been
reassigned to the Nova 9 project.  We hope to transmit any new data
as it becomes available.

General Data

Note: All data, except current position and class, is speculative and
has not been verified.  The Nova 9 System has nine recorded and 
classified planets.  Most orbits are grouped fairly close to the Nova
9 sun.

Hydros

Position: -43.37, 2.0311AU
Class: 5
Satellites: none
Composition: iron, silicates, carbon compounds
Atmosphere: hydrogen, nitrogen, argon, oxygen, water vapor
Surface features: unknown
Life forms: unknown
Research notes: Swirling cloud layers over most of planet and moderate
surface temperatures increase probability of life.

Typhieus

sun.  It is possible that Searon may be very gradually overtaking the
leading "moon".
Composition: silicates, sulfur
Atmosphere: unknown
Surface features: unknown
Life forms: unknown
Research notes: Probably the youngest planet in the system.  High
surface temperatures are likely because of its close proximity tot
the sun.

Malevolon

RAVEN II

Ship Specifications, Controls & Computer

COCKPIT CONTROLS

Power Module Bank

The Power Module Bank is designed to accommodate eight power modules.
Vacant slots appear blue.  Nonfunctional slots appear black.  Note:
The Raven II is able to pick-up and install power modules in the field
as well as intact power modules left behind from destroyed ships.

Current Weapon Display

The weapon display shows the currently selected weapon.  A number 
appearing after the weapon name indicates the amount of ammunition
left.  No number after the weapon name indicates unlimited firing
capability.

Shield Status Display

A team of four independent Protonic Shields provide protection fore,
aft, starboard and port.  The shields not only provide protection
against shells, lasers, and high-speed impact, but are also capable
of absorbing a variety of energy forms including heat, radiation and
kinetic energy.  The advantage of the four shield system is that if
one shield is damaged, it will not affect the other three.  Although
the shields are designed to withstand almost anything, each hit or
impact will diminish the energy level of the shield.  Loss of energy
will result in shield failure.

Raven II Systems Status Indicators

1. ENG - Engine Status
2. LIFE - Life Support Status
3. SHLD - Shield Status
4. Damage Alert Bar

The first three indicators show the status for specific systems.
A purple light denotes optimum system functioning.  A yellow light
denotes an impaired or damaged system.  A red light denotes system
failure.  Overall damage to the ship itself graphically represented
by the fourth indicator, the Damage Alert Bar.

Aiming Reticle

The Aiming Reticle aids in focusing the weapon on target.  The reticle
display changes when a possible target is in the field of fire.

Radar

The radar module has expanded detection capability.  The Raven II is
the radar center point.  The top of the radar display corresponds
to the direction the Raven II is facing.  For instance, blips at the
top of the display are objects behind the Raven II.  Different types
of objects (enemy ships, incoming shells & obstacles) appear as
different colored blips.  Erratic blip movement or a blank display
may indicate damage to the radar unit.

Planet Identification Screen

The name of the current planet is displayed on the Planet Identification
Screen.

Weapon Ready Indicator

A yellow light signals that the currently selected weapon is loaded and
ready to fire.  A purple light indicates the weapon is not ready.

Score 

This unit tracks, compiles and displays the combat success index.

COMPUTER SYSTEM

S.A.R.A.H.

Synergetic Advanced Resource - Aesthetic Hybrid

The new Engram super computer, with its Engram-Neuralnet logic board,
provides the computing power to keep all the base and Raven II
systems running smoothly.  The operating system for the Engram computer,
developed by innovative programmer, Sarah Alex, before her death,
simulates human thought patterns more closely than any previously
designed system.  The human-like interface, was one of the features
programmed by her husband, Captain John Alex.

New information transmitted from Terran Command and field data
collected by the Raven II are added to S.A.R.A.H.'s extensive
library files.  S.A.R.A.H. is continually processing new data as
well as searching the library files for related material, and will
provide new information as it becomes available.

Auxiliary Components

Model SP122-KE
Robotic Unit "Sparky"

The maintenance and repair droid equipped with basic Al language
and interface modules, Sparky, is programmed to make repairs and
install upgrades.

Upon returning to base, Sparky will perform as many repairs as
possible before the Raven II has to return to battle.  If Sparky 
is able to complete all the repairs, it may also have time to
install upgrades.

RAVEN II

Simulation Specifications

SIMULATION FEATURES

Cursors

In addition, to the regular cursor icon, there are seven types of
cursor icons that appear depending on the scene and position on the
simulation screen.

These different cursors indicate an action to perform or a menu
