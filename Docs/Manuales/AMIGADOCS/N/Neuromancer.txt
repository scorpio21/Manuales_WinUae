Introduction:

     He closed his eyes.
     Found the ridged face of the power stud.
     And in the bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiled in
  from the edge of space, hypnagogic images jerking past like a film compiled
  from random frames.  Symbols, figures, faces, a blurred, fragmented mandala
  of visual information.
     Please, he prayed, *now* --
     A gray disk, the color of Chiba sky.
     *Now* --
     Disk beginning to rotate, faster, becoming a sphere of paler gray.
     Expanding--
     And flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick, the unfolding of
  his distanceless home, his country, transparent 3D chessboard extending to
  infinity.  Inner eye opening to the stepped scarlet pyramid of the Eastern
  Seaboard Fission Authority burning beyond the green cubes of Mitsubishi Bank
  of America, and high and very far away he saw the spiral arms of military
  systems, forever beyond his reach.
     And somewhere he was laughing, in a white-painted loft, distant fingers
  caressing the deck, tears of release on his face.

jacks." On the Sony, a two-dimensional space war faded behind a forest of
mathematically generated ferns, demonstrating the spatial possibilities of
logarithmic spirals; cold blue military footage burned through, lab animals
wired into test systems, helmets feeding into fire control circuits of tanks
and war planes.  "Cyberspace.  A consensual hallucination experienced daily by
billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught
mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from the

                               The "Real World"

     Neuromancer is a science fiction role-playing game set in the year 2058.
Your real world location is Chiba City, by Tokyo Bay in the Kanto District of
south-central Honshu, Japan.  Chiba is a magnet for the Sprawl's techno-
criminal subcultures, notorious for its shadowland of black medicine and Body
Shops.  Criminal activity in Chiba is a constant subliminal hum, and death is
the punishment for laziness, carelessness, lack of grace, or the failure to
heed the demands of the intricate protocol.  At one end of the city is the
towering hologram logo of Fuji Electric, dominating the skyline over the high-
tech zone.  At the other end is the Chiba Spaceport, gateway to the orbital
colonies of Freeside and Zion Cluster.

     Since Neuromancer is a role-playing game, you'll start the game by
maneuvering your character through the "Real World" areas of Chiba City.
Skills, in the form of "skill chips" implanted directly into your brain jack
must be purchased and developed to ensure your continued survival in this
complex world.  Skills will be discussed later in more detail.

     In the Real World, interactions with the citizens of Chiba are important.
Through dialogue, you can make friends or enemies.  Some people can be very
helpful, going so far as to give you things you need.  Others can be downright
unfriendly, keeping vital information from you if you say the wrong thing.
Information is power -- and you don't have much when you start the game.

     Another important source of information is the PAX, Public Access booths
conveniently located around the city, providing private citizens with the
means to stay current with the rest of the world.  The PAX offers a newspaper,
the Night City News' a Public BBS (Bulletin-Board System) for personal
messages' and friendly Banking services (yes, money is important to your
survival).  The Night City News is updated daily, so it's a good idea to refer
to it at least once every 24 hours.  The PAX BBS will remind you that you're
not alone in this world -- you have friends who are happy to help when they
can.

                             Your Purpose in Life

     And what about your friends?  Curiously enough, you seem to have fewer of
them these days.  Is it because of your breath?  Maybe it's because you
haven't taken a bath recently?  Or in Chiba City, is survival more valuable
and less costly than friends?  You've heard rumors that several cyberspace
cowboys have disappeared--and not all of them were your friends.  Where have
they gone?  You suspect that the answer lies in cyberspace, but you've fallen
on hard times.  You had to pawn your deck for some cash as soon as you arrived
in Chiba City.  you've spent the last two days in a drunken stupor, wondering
what to do.  Now it's time to act.  The fate of your remaining friends, and
yourself, depends on your successful solution of this bizarre mystery.

                                      ---

                        Basic Decks and Comlink Access













   The best way to get started in your quest is to locate the basic hardware -
-your deck -- and the software needed to jack into the public computer
network.  Having already spent a short time in Chiba before the game begins,
you'll find a basic deck with Comlink software waiting for you right where you
left it, wherever that is...

     Deck hardware and software can be upgraded at several locations in the
city.  Money is the key factor.  Better equipment means better reliability and
the capability to carry and use more software -- but the price goes up
accordingly.  Most people in Chiba end up buying their equipment from the used
equipment stores, such as Crazy Edo's Used Hardware Emporium.  But Edo has a
limited stock, so serious cyberspace cowboys buy from Asano Computing, the
only local dealer who carries full-blown matrix simulators called "cyberspace
decks".

     Normal Comlink access requires the use of one of the cyberspace jacks
scattered around the city.  With a basic deck and Comlink software, you can
use these jacks to access computer systems ("bases") all over the world.  If
you know the Comlink access code for a particular base, you can reach it with
the proper level of Comlink software.  Low security bases require only Comlink
1.0 for access, but the corporate and government bases with the highest
security require Comlink 6.0 to make a connection.  Keep in mind that the
cyberspace jacks are used fro both Comlink and cyberspace access.  Comlink
software can get you there, but most bases are protected by passwords.
Certain bases will give you a visitor's password in their introductory
message, but most passwords must be located by you.  Some passwords that you
come across will be coded, requiring the use of the Cryptology skill chip to
decipher them before they can be used for entry to a base.

     As rumors have it, bases can often be penetrated at the lower levels with
a new kind of software that allows you to bypass the simpler password systems.

     Once you've been admitted to a base at a given level, you have access to
everything contained in that level of the base.  Many bases have multiple
levels of access, each level requiring a different password.  If you can log
onto a database at a higher level after finding its password, you will have
access to more of the contents of the database -- including secret
information.  Valuable software can also be downloaded from some of these
bases.

     You will be automatically charged for you Comlink access time, so use
your time wisely because it will be limited by the amount of money you have on
your credit chip.  When you are logged onto a database, time passes at the
same rate that it does in the "real world".

                                      ---

                                  Cyberspace

     Once you get a cyberspace deck, you'll want to access the "matrix"
itself, also known as cyberspace.  Hidden from the common citizen who is
limited to accessing bases through the  Comlink system, the cyberspace grid
represents information in its pure form.  All of the private, corporate,
government, and military bases can be reached in cyberspace.  Many of these












bases can be reached only from cyberspace because they are isolated computer
with the highest levels of protection.  Visually, cyberspace is a three-
dimensional representation of all the bases, which look like geometric shapes.
These bases are laid out in specific zones of the horizontal cyberspace grid.
In actuality, cyberspace is just an image generated in your brain by your
cyberspace deck.  Without the deck, cyberspace would just be a complex sea of
information that humans would never be able to understand.

     In operation, you might compare travel in cyberspace to driving around in
a city.  The streets are represented by the lines of the grid.  The buildings
are the geometric shapes of the bases.  Your car is your cyberspace deck.  As
with moving around a city, you can keep driving past the buildings or sop and
enter them (if you can get past the security guard).

                                       ---

                              ICE and ICEbreakers

     Bases are protected by ICE -- Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics --
which acts as an independent, semi-intelligent barrier, keeping cowboys like
you from getting inside the base.

     However, cowboys do manage to break in with their specialized icebreaking
softwarez.  The trick is finding the appropriate versions and types of
softwarez to break through the ICE before it can adapt its defenses to the
attack.  There are subtle, slow-acting viruses that sneak up on an ICE layer
and destroy it gradually, as well as brute force icebreakers that can crush an
ICE layer all at once.  There are many different kinds of icebreaking programs
-- some good and some bad.  You'll also notice that icebreakers vary in their
effectiveness, but you'll have to experiment on your own to learn more about
each one.

     You'll find that the low-security bases are protected by the weakest ICE.
By breaking into these, you can develop you abilities, test your softwarez,
and generally prepare for stronger and deadlier combat with medium and high
security ICE.

     And there's one more minor point you need to know.  ICE has an annoying
tendency to fight back.  In fact, it can kill you.

                                      ---

                                      AIs

     Certain bases contain a second line of defense -- an AI, which stands for
"Artificial Intelligence."  Beginning with primitive 20th century attempts to
model human intelligence in computer programs, modern day AIs have developed
into individual entities capable of being granted citizenship by certain
countries.

     Specially programmed for the military and for corporations that can
afford them, modern AIs have personalities and mental capabilities far beyond
the humans that originally created them.  Among other tasks, AIs run large
corporations and design the ICE that protects bases in cyberspace.













     Because of the potential threat of such an intellectual power, a
government agency was formed to keep the AIs under control.  The Turing
Registry has the responsibility of watching for signs that any AI might be
developing into a dangerous, ultra-intelligent program.  While this is
impossible with the limited computing facilities available to a single AI, the
Turing Registry makes certain that the AIs are unable to communicate as a
group.  As soon as an AI is created, the manufacturer is legally bound to
register its name, number, and citizenship with Turing.  Turing also keeps
track of humans suspected of illegally helping AIs.  So far, this has been
sufficient to restrain the AIs.

     AIs are fully capable of defending themselves.  Sane cowboys avoid combat
with these formidable entities, because icebreaking softwarez can't harm them.
An AI attack is a unique experience.  Cowboys refer to this type of battle,
which is aimed directly at the brain, as "flatlining."  The AI feeds a neural
shock into the victim's brain, keeping the cowboy braindead long enough for
his physical body to stop functioning.

     While it's rumored that there are skill chips available which allow
mental combat with AI's, no one has lived long enough to talk about the
details.  The late McCoy Pauley, a.k.a. "Dixie Flatline", is said to have run
into AIs in three different bases, and supposedly only survived because he
found a weakness in each AI.  His "joeboy" assistant managed to jack Pauley
out of cyberspace during three flatlining attacks before his body died.  The
fourth time, Pauley's heart just gave out, and he went to cyberheaven.  But he
was paid handsomely for his liver.

                              Cyberspace Survival

     Survival in the cyberspace environment depends on the skills, equipment,
software, and information you've acquired in the earlier phases of the game.
You may often find it necessary to return to the Real World, because you've
run out of money or need a new deck, more software, more information, or you
need to move to a new jack location to reach another area of cyberspace.

                       Limitations on Cyberspace Travel

     There are two primary factors governing the distance that can be
travelled at any one time by a cowboy in cyberspace:

Jack Range Limit: There are several cyberspace jacks available in Chiba City.
Physically connecting your deck to one of these jacks ("jacking in")
determines where you will be located when you enter cyberspace.  Most jacks
can access only a limited area of cyberspace, called a "zone".  Normally, you
can only access areas of cyberspace within the jack's zone limit.

Connect Time: Few things are free in Chiba City.  Using a cyberspace jack
costs money just like the long distance telephone charges of the 20th century.
This creates another limit on how far you can travel when you're jacked in --
if you run out of money on your credit chip, your connection is broken,
putting you back in the Real World.













                               Cyberspace Decks

     Cyberspace decks, also called cyberdecks or matrix simulators, are
illegal for private use, but certain dealers have a liberal definition of
private use, and continue to sell them to "independent agencies."  Most
cowboys define themselves as independent agencies.  If a cowboy can afford it,
there are a wide range of matrix simulators available.  So many, if fact, that
an independent reviewing service known as Consumer Review exists to help
people decide which deck to buy.

     There are a number of differences between the standard deck, which is
legally available to the average consumer, and a deck with cyberspace-
capability.

Shielding: Cyberdecks have built-in combat shielding which protects the
cyberdeck and its software from ICE attacks.

RAM Limits: The programs that drive the operating systems in both types of
decks, as well as icebreaking and other application softwarez, are enormous in
comparison to the size of programs in archaic 20th century computers.  Modern
deck RAM (Random Access Memory) is highly efficient and can handle a number of
these programs with remarkable speed.  Decks are continuously powered by an
internal power supply so that the memory is nonvolatile.  Once you've
downloaded a program, it stays in memory permanently unless the deck is
damaged or you erase the software.  Some softwarez, however, are on-shot
programs, consuming themselves after you execute them.  Each deck has its own
limit of the number of softwarez it can handle.  Top of the line decks, such
as the Ono-Sendai Cyberspace Seven, can manage up to 25 programs
simultaneously.

ROM Constructs: Highly illegal and not available to private citizens, cowboy
or otherwise, are the ROM Constructs.  Each ROM Construct is a recording of an
individual human's personality, responses, knowledge, and memories.
Constructs are occasionally used by cyberdeck operators in the government and
large corporations, which is why top of the line cyberdecks contain a slot for
a ROM Construct cartridge.

                                  Skill Chips

     Skills, in the form of "skill chips," are available for purchase in Chiba
City.  Skill chips are implanted directly in the brain jack on the side of
your skull, giving you instant access to that particular type of knowledge.
For example, the Cryptology skill chip gives you the ability to decipher
certain types of coded passwords.  Skill chips cover a wide range of
abilities, ranging from foreign languages to high-tech cyberspace skills.

     Skills can be improved through tutorials found in bases and t raining fro
knowledgeable Chiba citizens.  Some skills are improved with experience in
using that skill.  In general, skills improve your chances of success both in
the Real World and in cyberspace.  Once you learn a skill, you remember it
permanently.

     When you want to use a skill chip in a room in the "Real World," you












should always use the chip just after you enter the room, before doing
anything else --including talking with other people.

     A list of skill chips can be found in Appendix A.

                                      ---

                                   Body Shop

     The Chiba City Body Shop serves two major functions -- body part sales
and "re-animation."  If a wealthy cowboy is unfortunate enough to get killed,
and his body is found before it rots, it may be taken to the Body Shop for re-
animation.  This is an expensive process, but the dead cowboy rarely has any
say in the matter.

     By sheer coincidence, the cost of re-animation almost always equals the
amount of money the cowboy was carrying on his credit chip when he died.
That's why smart cowboys keep a little money stashed in their bank accounts.

     Body Shops are also handy places to pick up cash.  Of course, the
drawback is that you have to sell one of your body parts to get the money, but
who needs a spleen anyway?

     Important body parts, as determined by the Body Shop, will sell for more
money.  Curiously enough, you'll find that the important body parts tend to be
the same ones that most affect your Constitution level if you sell them off.

As a public service, the Body Shop replaces any part you sell them with a
cheap plastic replacement.  Replacement parts are almost as good as the real
thing, except for their short life.  Fortunately, you can buy your parts back
when you get the money together... for a higher price... if they're still
available...

                                Life and Death

     A wise philosopher once said, "Death is when your constitution hits zero.
Life is anything above that."  While walking around the Real World, there's
little chance of losing your constitution, but in cyberspace it can get
whomped on by killer ICE.  If you find yourself selling off lots of your flesh
at the Body Shop, keep in mind that cheap plastic replacement organs don't
suit your system very well, and you won't ever have as high a constitution as
you would with good, natural body parts.  You can monitor your constitution by
using the "Mode" command icon.

                           A Note About Taking Notes

     You'll discover many passwords, link codes, ID numbers, and other bits of
data throughout the game, and you'll have to thresh through the information
yourself and decide what' important enough to write down.  We've provided
pages in the back of this manual for notetaking purposes.  <Go ahead, write on
the screen!>
                                      ---

                                 Conversations













     In Talk mode, you can carry on a conversation with other characters in a
room through the use of "word balloons."  Word balloons allow you to choose
among several responses or questions that are appropriate to the situation in
that room.  In some cases, you will find an option that reads something like
this:
      "Tell me about ___________."

     If you think the character you're talking to knows something about a
particular subject, you can ask them about it by typing a word describing that
subject.  For example, if you want to ask Julius about skills or skill chips,
you could type:

      "Tell me about _SKILL_."

     Keep in mind that not everyone in Chiba City will want to or be able to
answer all of your questions.

                                Your Credit Chip

     When the game starts, your Orient Express Credit Chip will contain only
six credits.  Your credit chip acts like a wallet -- it contains the money you
want to carry around with you in the city.  Your bank account holds the
remainder of your funds, which can be downloaded to your credit chip through
any of the PAX terminals in Chiba City.  While it's tempting to download all
of your funds to your credit chip, it's not always a good idea -- see the
"Body Shop" section.

                              Using the PAX System

     PAX booths are conveniently located around the city, providing private
citizens with the means to stay current with the rest of the world.  The PAX
offers a newspaper, the Night City News; a Public BBS (Bulletin-Board System)
for personal messages; and banking services through the First Orbital Bank of
Switzerland.

     When you operate a PAX terminal, you will be given three access codes and
asked for a verification code, which is obtained from the PAX Verification
Codewheel included with the game. <Or the convenient HAX Verification Code
Tables at the end of this lovely document... - Dix>  See your reference card
for details.

                                Deck Operation

     The given examples use keyboard commands, but these steps can also be
accomplished with a joystick or mouse.

                             Basic Deck Operation

     If you're in a room with a cyberspace jack and you've learned some
database link codes, you can use your deck to "dial" into the database using
this procedure (if you have the proper level of Comlink software):

     1) Type "I" (for Inventory).  The Inventory list will be displayed.













     2) Select the "UXB" or whatever deck you have with you by typing the
        corresponding number from the list.  The Operate/Discard/Give/Erase
        menu will be displayed.

     3) Type "O" to operate the deck.  A list of software will be displayed.

     4) Select your highest level of Comlink software (Comlink 1.0, for
        example) by typing its number.  You will be asked to enter the Comlink
        code for the database you with to access.

     5) Enter the Comlink code.  A proper code (such as "CHEAPO" for the Cheap
        Hotel database) with the proper level of Comlink software will jack
        you into the database.  If you enter an incorrect code, you can keep
        trying again until you press Return to exit.  If you make a mistake
        while typing the Comlink code, just backspace and type over your
        mistake.

     6) Press the space bar to bypass the database's introductory screen, and
        then type the password for the database when requested to do so.

                                      ---

                           Cyberspace Deck Operation

     If you have a cyberspace-capable deck, you can either use it to log onto
a database in the usual way, or you can enter cyberspace.  You need Comlink
6.0 to access cyberspace.  Follow this procedure for cyberspace access:

     1) Type "I" (for Inventory).  The Inventory list will be displayed.

     2) Select your cyberspace deck by typing the corresponding number from
        the list.  The Operate/Discard/Give/Erase menu will be displayed.

     3) Type "O" to operate the deck.  A list of software will be displayed.

     4) Select your Comlink 6.0 software.

     5) Comlink 6.0 will give you the option of either entering a link code or
        entering cyberspace.  Select the Enter Cyberspace option.  Your screen
        display will be altered to show cyberspace and your cyberspace deck
        controls.

     Your initial location in cyberspace is determined by your cyberspace jack
location.  If you're using the cyberspace jack at Cheap Hotel, you will enter
cyerspace beside the geometric form t hat represents the Cheap Hotel base.

                                      ---

                                Action Examples

     Note: The given examples use keyboard commands, but these steps can also
be accomplished with a joystick or mouse by pointing to the desired option and
pressing the joystick/mouse button.













To Give Someone an Item:

     1) Display the Inventory list by typing "I".

     2) Type a number on the keyboard to select the item you want to give.
        You may give anything away, including credits.

     3) The Operate/Discard/Give menu will be displayed.  Type "G" for Give.

     4) If you selected "credits" to give away, the amount of credits you have
        on your credit chip will be displayed, followed by "Give how much?".
        Type in the amount you wish to give (46, for example), followed by a
        Return.  The amount will be deducted from your credit chip.

     5) The item or number of credits you specified will be given to the other
        person in the room.

                                      ---

To Install a Skill Chip:

     When you acquire a skill chip, you carry it in your Inventory until you
implant it in your skull using this procedure:

     1) Type "I" to display the Inventory list.

     2) Select the skill chip you wish to implant by typing the corresponding
        number from the list.  The Operate/Discard/Give menu will be
        displayed.

     3) Type "O" to operate the skill chip.  The skill chip will disappear
        from your Inventory list since it has been implanted in your skull and
        is now available for your use.  You may now select the Skills icon to
        use the skill.

To Use an Implanted Skill:

     You can only use a skill after is has been implanted in your skull.

     1) Type "S" for Skill.  Your implanted skills and skill levels will be
        displayed.

     2) Select the skill you wish to use by typing the corresponding number
        from the list.  For this example, we'll select "Cryptology."  The
        Cryptology window will appear, asking for a word to be decoded.

     3) Type the word to be decoded and press Return.  The answer will be
        displayed.

     4) The Cryptology skill can be used repeatedly, so it will ask for
        another word to be decoded.  Just hit Return to exit.

Downloading Software to Your Deck:













     When you're in the software library of a database, viewing a list of
programs, you may wish to download (transmit) some software to your deck.
This is accomplished by selecting the software you desire, by its
corresponding number.  You will receive a "download complete" message when the
transmission is finished.  The software is now available to you when you
operate your deck.

                                      ---
Using Software in Cyberspace:

     1) Type "I" (for Inventory).  The list of your softwarez will be
        displayed.
     2) Select the software you wish to use by its corresponding number.

Using a ROM Construct:

     1) Type "R" (for ROM Construct).  The ROM Construct options will be
        displayed:

                        Exit ROM Construct
                     1) Software Debug
                     2) Software Analysis
                     3) Monitor Mode

     When you select the Software Debug or Software Analysis options, you are
making use of the ROM Construct's skills in those areas.  Once selected, they
each display your software list.  Select the software you want to debug or
analyze and the ROM Construct will go to work.

     The Monitor option must be activated if you want the ROM Construct to be
aware of your current activities.  This is useful when things are happening so
quickly that you may not be aware of certain things... such as your impending
death.  In monitor mode, if the Construct realizes you're about to die, it
won't hesitate to let you know about it.


Erasing Softwarez From Your Deck When In The Real World:

     1) Type "I" (for Inventory).  Your list of items will be displayed.

     2) Select your deck by pressing its number.

     3) The Operate/Discard/Give/Erase menu will appear.  Type "E".

     4) A list of software in your deck will appear.  Type the number of the
        piece of software you want to erase.  It will be erased, permanently.
        The only way to get it back is to download it again from the place you
        got it.

     5) You can keep erasing softwarez one at a time.  Type "X" (for Exit)
        when you're finished.

                                       ---













                        Appendix A: List of Skill Chips

    (See the "Skill Chips" section for a general discussion of this subject.)

     COPTALK: Used in the Real World to disguise yourself by talking like a
     cop with an Irish accent.  This can be useful for interrogating the right
     people.

     BARGAINING: Used before purchasing things in the Real World, this skill
     can bring the price down.  Most people already know this trick or they
     have a Bargaining skill chip of their own. so it won't always work.

     CRYPTOLOGY: Used in the Real World to analyze passwords and decode them.
     You may occasionally come across a password that can't even be decoded by
     the highest level of this skill chip, in which case you'll have to figure
     out where to go to decode it yourself.

     MUSICIANSHIP: Used in the Real World to play various styles of music for
     amusement.

     SOFTWARE ANALYSIS: Finds out and tells you the function of your software.

     DEBUG: Repairs damaged software in your deck.

     HARDWARE REPAIR: Locates and repairs problems with your deck.

     ICE BREAKING: Used at the beginning of an ICE combat session in
     cyberspace, this skill applies your previous experience with ICE breaking
     to locate weaker points in the ICE protection, making it easier to get
     in.

     EVASION: Gives you a chance to retreat from combat with an AI when you
     realize you're not prepared yet for this particularly horrible form of
     mental suicide.

     ZEN: Calms your mind after mental shocks.  It's said Dixie Flatline was a
     Zen master.

     You'll find other skill chips throughout the course of the game, but
you'll have to find out about those yourself.  Try as many as you want -- if
you can afford them.

                             ***END OF DOCUMENT***




































                           Neuromancer "Code Wheel"
                       brought to you by Dixie Flatline

                             Instructions for use:

     When using the PAX system, you will be presented with three words or
phrases and asked for the access code.  To find the code, look up the first
word or phrase across the top of the first or second table below.  Look down
the left side of the table for the second word or phrase, and note the letter
where the row and column intersect.  Now find the third word or phrase given
by the PAX system on the third or fourth table below.  Locate the letter you
found in the previous step, on the left side of the same table.  The number
given at the point where the row and column intersect is the "access code" for
the PAX.  I hope you appreciate this mess, because I typed my fingers to the
bone!  Oh well; all in the name of anarchy and good clean fun, I suppose.

P.S. - Some of the names have been truncated to conserve space so the whole
thing can be printed out on an 80 column printer in non-compressed mode, but I
think you'll get the idea...
