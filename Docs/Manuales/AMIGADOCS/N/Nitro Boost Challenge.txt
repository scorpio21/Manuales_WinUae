The aim of the game:

Jump into your sportscar or speedboat and furiously race through 7 torturous stages. Rally
through forests, race in the city and slalom through lakes and white water rapids. You must drive
as fast as you can through each level to beat the strict time limit and qualify for the next round.

Collect Nitrous Oxide canisters which are scattered around the course, then go into Turbo
mode for full power action. Shoot down airships, hang-glides and helicopters which drop bombs
in your way. Destroy other vehicles who are intent on ramming you off the road! Watch out for
mines, earthquakes and pools of acid. These will blow you into the air. Mind you don't fall into
the canyon!
