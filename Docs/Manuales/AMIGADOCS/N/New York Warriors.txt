NY WARRIORS

Welcome to New York City fifteen years from now.  Thinking about
strolling through Central Park before taking in a play on Broadway?
Forget about it!  Terrorists have planted a nuclear device in the
World Trade Center and have taken New York hostage.  Salvaging 
what's left of civilization rests on your shoulders.

Is the terrorist's request for Manhattan, Greenwich Village and the
southeastern part of Schenectady unreasonable?  Of course it is!
Today it's Manhattan, tomorrow world domination.

Stay sane and ready for action.  Not only do you have to contend with
terrorists, but you'll have to make your way past the bloodthirsty
dregs of society, run-away trains and assorted surprise attackers in
order to find the lunatics that have laid seige to the city.

As an arms expert and self-appointed vigilante, you must battle your
way through gang-infested city streets, subways, and parks to reach
the World Trade Center.  Once there, you must descend the building 
using rickety elevators to locate and detonate the device.

If you can make it here, you'll make it anywhere.  If not, the Big
Apple bites the dust.

        you may utilize at this level is a flame thrower.  But, don't
        worry - this particular flame thrower has unlimited fire

CHARACTERS

GANGS

JET PACKERS:    Too cool to walk.  If you don't move fast enough, this
                gang of urban hoodlums will waste you.
                WEAPONS: Bombs

RAMBOIDS:       Very sly.  WEAPONS: AK-47.

ASSASINS:       Mutant Ninjas who've never heard the word "mercy."
                WEAPONS: Stars

SLUGGERS:       No runs, plenty of hits.  WEAPONS: Ak-M

KILLER KLOWNS:  No laughing matter, these jokers are wild.
                WEAPONS: Acid Bolts

RASTAS:         No fear of death.  High, but not on life.

Beware of non-human threats like THE TRAIN OF DEATH as well as an
assortment of not-so-innocent bystanders.

WEAPONS

The rifle's a given, but you'll want to amass as many of the special
weaponry listed below as possible.

Depending on which computer version you own, you may have access to some 
or all of the weapons below.

FLAME THROWERS:         For roasting enemies.  Best to use sparingly to
                        conserve ammunition.

CLUSTER GRENADES:       Good to use against large objects like tanks or
                        trains.

HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES:  Seeks out and annihilates the closest adversary.
                        Don't sweat it - even if you wanted to, you
                        couldn't accidentally hit your partner.

FAN SHOTS:              Looks like a regular missile but does four times
                        the damage.

FAN MISSILES:           Missiles that shoot out in a fan-like formation.

Pick up weapon:  Walk over to weapon - its icon will appear in the upper
right hand corner indicating how many shots you have in that particular
weapon.

STOCKPILING: If you already have a weapon, aside from your rifle,
and have not depleted your ammunition from originally retrieved weapon,
you may pick up a third weapon to use which will put the originally
retrieved weapon on hold.  When you have depleted the ammunition of
the third weapon you will automatically have access to second (or 
originally retrieved) weapon.

GAMEPLAY

As you wind your way through the hazardous streets toward the World
Trade Center, avoid human and non-human threats to your life by
staying in motion and by stopping only long enough to grab whatever
weapons are in your path.

Since there's trouble coming at you from all sides, keep your weapon
poised for action or firing at all times.

Stay alert and keep your eyes open for seemingly harmless urban dwellers.

Pay attention to helpful hints on the intermission screen, or pay
the consequences.

You start the game with five lives.  You may continue to play until
you have been hit five times.  Then, depending on which level of game
difficulty you select, you have an option of continuing play up to 
three times, after which you must start a new game.

EXTRA LIVES

At 50,000, 150,000, 250,000 etc. (anytime your score ends in 50,000)
you receive an extra life.

GAME POINTS BONUS

If you complete the game, you receive a bonus of 100,00 points.

There are eight levels to the game.  In between levels, an
intermission screen indicates where you've been in green, where you
are is flashing, and where you have yet to journey to is in yellow.
Each level is achieved by accomplishing directives set at the 
intermission screen.

The fate of New York City is in your hands.  What are you waiting for?!?
