NARCO POLICE

In 2003, when over one fifth of the world population to narcotics, the
power of drug dealers has grown beyond limit.  Because of this all the
nations have handed over their two best policemen to form an antidrug
elite corps: the NARCO POLICE (NP).

5 years of training and preparation is about to reach its culmination.
The target is the neuralgic operations centre of the drug dealers, a
place where the major part of the world's drug supply is processed.  
Special agents of the NP have obtained priceless information about
this place, known as the "Narco Processing Center" (NPC), located on
an island near the coast of Columbia.  One last fact: the drug dealers
have invested 500 million dollars in their security.

THE MISSION.

1. BEGIN MISSION

Key name: AMBAR.

Objective: The Central Processing Laboratory (C.P.L.).

The island where the laboratory is located has been transformed into a
fortress by the organization of drug dealers.  It is made up of an 
intricate network of tunnels that communicate with the Central 
Processing Laboratory, the true nucleus of the complex.  According to
the demolition experts, that is where the explosive charges should be
placed in order to destroy such a huge structure (see Annex 1).
Surveilance rests on numerous and precise security systems, with armed
patrols and electronic vigilance systems that will obstruct any
intervention (see Annex 2).

OPTIONS.

1. SELECTION OF WEAPONS.

To change the preselected weapons all you have to do is, indicate with the
icon, the group you want to supply weapons to and then start adding and
removing as many weapons as you wish, provided that the final weight 
does not exceed the maximum allowance per group (500 lb).

The equipment available for the mission is the following:

1. 12 Caliber Magnum Cartridges, 35 g. Subammunition (4 units).
Chosen as standard ammunition for its power and reliability, during the
mission they will be one of your main fighting elements;

2. 12 Caliber AA-1 Explosive Cartridges.  Similar to the former but
with a very high destructive power;

3. T-71 50 mm Mini Missiles with Standard Expansive Warheads.
This is a medium power missile.  You will need three of them to destroy
the reinforced doors;

4. T-72 50 mm Laser Guided Mini Missiles with Perforating Warheads.
Their guidance system by laser added to its greater penetration
potential make it the most destructive of your missiles;

5. T-73 50 mm Fragmentation Warhead Mini Missiles.  The numerous
minuscule fragments that form the warhead make this the best weapon
for combat in really "hot" zones;

6. Thor M2 Demolition Equipment with C-4a Advanced Plastic Explosives.
The explosive charges you carry are essential to destroy the C.P.L.
You should avoid wasting them, using them only when it's absolutely
vital;

7. MP 607m consisting of: "Little Pig" Multifunction Gun, 12 Caliber
Semiautomatic Shotgun, 50 mm Class T Mini Missile Launcher.  You can
depend completely on this multiple weapon.  Its reduced weight and
reliability are amazing.

8. Medical Kit.  A semiautomatic device for the reestablishment of
vital functions.  Should the NP you are commanding need it, activate
this medical system to replenish them;

9. Multi-Purpose Exchange System Unit (Teleport).  This is very 
important, an absolute must for the reception of outside help;
don't forget to activate it if you wish to receive support troops.
Although this is a very heavy element, without it you would be
totally isolated.

10. Bullet Proof Vest.  Made of kevlar and carbon fiber, resistant to
high impact projectiles.  It will protect you from falling under the
enemy fire.

3. SELECTION OF TUNNEL.

You are on the helicopter right before disembarking.  Choose the entry
tunnel with the helicopter icon.  There are preselected entrances: if
you want to change them use the icon to indicate the group and leave
it at whichever entrance you wish.

THE GAME.

The procedure will be a multiple attack, forming three squadrons of
five men each, leaving behind supplementary support troops - you can
get information about them by using the CHOPPER command (see P.I.U.
commands).

1. P.I.U.

Communications take place using the Personal Intercom Unit (P.I.U.),
that will allow you to receive and send messages with the regulatory
mini-keyboard.

List of preestablished commands to communicate using the P.I.U.:

LOGIN        LI       TO CONNECT WITH A TERMINAL (see Terminal Systems).
GOAHEAD      GO       TO PROCEED ON TO SECOND PHASE.

When the mission is unfolding you will receive plenty of information on
the screen of you P.I.U., so you can keep tabs on the fighting conditions,
enemies in the zone, distress signals from other groups and many other
communiques.

Once the final door has been destroyed you should advance through the
tunnel until you reach the first function, and from that point the
computer will allow you access with the GOAHEAD command.

If a group has reached the door at the end of the phase, you can proceed
by using the GOAHEAD command or change groups making sure the other
groups reach their corresponding end of phase doors, and that way they
all can start the second phase together.

If a group types in the GOAHEAD command, the others, if able to proceed,
will go onto the next phase at the same time; if not the group will
advance alone while the rest of the groups remain in the earlier 
phase and out of the mission.

2. TERMINAL SYSTEMS.

You will find several terminals inside the tunnels.  Their purpose,
according to confidential reports, is the D.C.D. (Defensive Crusade
Deactivation), making it possible to deactivate for a terminal the
defensive systems located in other tunnels.

APPENDIX 1.

The network of tunnels consists of five independent structures that
lead to the central complex, the main objective of the raid.

We are informed that there are reinforced doors in the tunnels making
up the defensive crusade system.  This data should be sufficient to
deactivate the doors of the tunnel with terminals on the other side.

The map shown with this commentary was stolen from the headquarters
of the drug dealers in the Middle East, where they were planning to
construct an exact replica of the "Ambar" base.  Unfortunately the
central part of the map was destroyed.

The complex is divided into two parts with specific features in their
construction.  To construct the first level natural tunnels were
followed.  The second section was built from scratch, with huge beams
and several types of metallic reinforcements.

ANNEX 2.

1. FIRST PHASE: the troops in charge of security within the complex 
follow regular patrol patterns.  Study their movements carefully
and you will be able to resolve their attacks in the best possible
way.

At the end of the first phase you will encounter an armoured tank
equipped with two powerful rocket launchers.  It will spill its
entire load of rockets so save your weapons and men for the
occasion.

2. SECOND PHASE: the enemies you have to face in this phase are the
special guards protecting the laboratory, most of whom are ex-
soldiers, mercenaries and first rate bodyguards.  Armed with
automatic weapons of amazing firing potential, they will be a hard 
trial for your reflexes.

You will also fight against guards with portable rocket-launchers
and high caliber sawn-off rifles.  After this you will meet the
biggest challenge of the entire mission.
