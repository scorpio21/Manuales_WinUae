           THE DOX TO [-NAM 1965-1975-] WERE TYPED IN BY SCOOTER
           -----------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION TO PLAYING THE GAME
--------------------------------
THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO PREVENT SOUTH VIETNAM FALLING TO COMMUNIST
POWERS.THEY STRIVE TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY BOTH BY MILITARY MEANS,USING NORTH
VIETNAMESE REGULAR TROOPS,AND VIET GONG GUERILLAS,AND BY SOCIO-POLITICAL
MEANS,BY WINNING OVER THE POPULATION WJILE WORKING TO TOPPLE THE SOUTH
VIETNAMESE GOVERMENT.
THESE 2 AIMS WORK HAND IN HAND,AND PART OF THE COMMUNIST PHILOSOPHY INVOLVED
THE IDEA OF POPULAR REVOLUTION,TO WHICH END MUCH FIGHTING WAS AIMED.

AS PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF,YOU OPPOSE THIS CHALLENGE TO THE GOVERMENT
OF SOUTH VIETNAM,AND THE VESTED INTERESTS OF THE U.S IN IT,THROUGH THE USE OF
MILITARY POWER AND ECONOMIC SUPPORT.
IN THIS GAME YOU CAN CONTROL THE LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO SOUTH VIETNAM,AND HOW
THE COMMITMENT IS USED ON THE GROUND.YOU ARE NOT A FREE AGENT,BECAUSE YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE TO THE U.S.A FOR YOUR DECISIONS,AND THE WAR CAN BECOME ENORMOUSLY
UNPOPULAR.
OVERCOMMIT OR FARE BADLY AND YOU WILL LOSE THE NEXT ELCTION.BEHAVE
IRRESPONSIBLY AND YOU MAY FACE WORSE THINGS THAN ELECTION DEFEAT.

                -----------------------------------------------------

ARE BUTTONS.
THIS SCREEN LETS YOU READ THE VARIOUS NEWS REPORTS THAT YOUR PRESS OFFICE SENDS
UP TO YOU.IT IS USEFUL TO FIND OUT HOW YOUR POPULARITY STANDS AND HOW THE
PUBLIC PERCIEVE THE WAR.REMEMBER,THAT THE PAPERS OFTEN PORTRAY A VIEW THAT IS
SOMEWHAT AT ODDS WITH REALITY,SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE PAPERS
RECORD WHAT THE PUBLIC THINK OF THE WAR. FOR AN `OFFICIAL` VIEW YOU HAVE
GOVERMENT REPORTS WHICH YOU WILL LOOK AT A LITTLE LATER.

TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT NEWS ITEMS,PRESS THE `NEXT ITEM`AND `PREVIOUS ITEM`
BUTTONS.IF YOU REACH THE LAST ITEM AND PRESS `NEXT ITEM` THE FIRST ITEM ON THE
LIST WILL BE SHOWN,THE SAME IS TRUE IF YOU GO FROM THE 1ST ITEM BACK TO THE
LAST.THE FOLDER OF NEWS CLIPPINGS ONLY HOLDS 25 ITEMS,BUT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU

THE MAP BUTTON TAKES YOU TO THE MAP INDEX.`SHOW SUMMARY SCREEN`WHICH IS NEAR
THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST,SHOWS YOU SOME BASIC INFO ABOUT THE STATE OF AMERICAS
INVOLVEMENT IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA.
THE NEXT 2 ALLOW YOU TO COMMIT OR WITHDRAW TROOPS.
THE REST ALLOW YOU TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT EFFECT THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR IN
VIETNAM.THEY CAUSE DECISIONS AND COMMITMENTS TO BE MADE THAT ACTUALLY COME INTO
EFFECT AT THE END OF THE YEAR.THINK OF ALL BUT THESE 2 DECISIONS AS BUDGET
PROPOSALS RATHER THAN IMMEDIATE DECISIONS.WORKING FOM THE BOTTOM UP:

PRESIDENTIAL DECSIONS
---------------------
PRESS THE `SHOW SUMMARY REPORT BUTTON`THIS TAKES YOU TO A SCREEN WITH 2 GRAPHS
ON IT.
IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER IS THE USUAL `RETURN TO INDEX BUTTON`.IN THE
BOTTOM LEFT HAND CORNER IS THE CURRENT DATE(REMEMBER THAT ALL YOUR DECISIONS
MUST BE MADE BY DECEMBER,SO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS).YOU CAN PRESS THE `ADVICE`
BUTTON TO GET SOME USEFUL,AND SOMETIMES CONTENTIOUS ADVICE. THE PACIFICATION %
SHOWS YOU WHAT % OF SOUTH VIETNAMS POPULATION IS THOUGH TO BE SYMPATHETIC TO
THE AMERICAN SPONSORED GOVERMENT OF SOUTH VIETNAM(GVN).
THE TOP GRAPH SHOWS(RETROSPECTIVELY)THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AMERICAN
COMMITMENT TO THE WAR IN VIETNAM(IN TERMS OF TROOPS AND EXPENDITURE)AND YOUR
OWN POPULARITY.YOU WILL COME TO NOTE THAT AS YOUR COMMITMENT RISES,SO WILL YOUR
POPULARITY DECREASE,UNLESS YOU REDEEM YOURSELF THROUGH MILITARY OR POLITICAL
SUCCESS.
THIS GRAPH IS ONLY UPDATED AT THE END OF EVERY YEAR TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE NEW
YEARS COMMITMENT,AND PUBLIC REACTION TO IT.THE 2ND GRAPH SHOWS,ON THE SAME
SCALE,US AND ALLIED LOSSES VS COMMUNISTS LOSSES.THIS IS PERHAPS THE
ULTIMATE,AND MOST GRUESOME MEASURE OF THE INFAMOUS `KILL RATIO` IT IS THE
THERMOMETER OF YOUR MILITARY SUCCESS IN SOUTH VIETNAM,AND IS CONTINUOSLY
UPDATED.IT ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO SEE HOW THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARES IN LOSSES AND
VICTORIES TO PREVIOUS YEARS,YOUR POPULARITY AND COMMITMENT(AS SHOWN ON THE
GRAPH ABOVE ON THE SAME HORIZONTAL SCALE).COME BACK TO THIS SCREEN WHEN YOU
HAVE COMPLETED THIS TUTORIAL,AS IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE POLITICAL
SCREENS,FOR NOW RETURN TO THE INDEX SCREEN.

NEXT WE SHALL USE VARIOUS SCREENS TO LOOK AT NEXT YEARS PROJECTED COMMITMENT TO
SOUTH VIETNAM,AND TO CHANGE SOME OF THE FIGURES.PRESSTHE `COMMIT
AIRPOWER`BUTTON,THIS WILL BRING UP A SCREEN WHICH CONTAINS THE BUDGET PROPOSALS
FOR AIR POWER COMMITMENT TO SOUTH VIETNAM,INCLUDING MONEY FOR
AIRMOBILISATION,AND THE PROPOSED USE OF THAT AIRPOWER IN SUPPORT OF GROUND
FORCES OR IN STRATEGIC BOMBING.

CLICK IN THE TEXT FIELD TO THE RIGHT OF WHERE IT SAYS `AIR SUPPORT THIS
YEAR($MILLION)`WHICH HAS 0 IN IT.
YOU CAN USE THE CURSOR KEYS AND EDITING KEYS TO EDIT THE TEXT.SO,DELETE
THE0,AND TYPE 250.THIS INDICATES THAT YOU WANT TO ALLOCATE 250 MILLION DOLLARS
NEXT YEAR TO AIR WAR IN VIETNAM.
REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND ANY TIME UP TILL THE END OF THE PRESENT
YEAR.THE 3 TEXT FEILDS BELOW THE 1 YOU JUST TYPED IN ONTAIN 3 PERCENTAGE
FIGURES WHICH INDICATE WHAT PROPORATION OF AIRPOWER EXPENDITURE YOU WANT ON
DEFOLIATION AND RECONNAISSANCE,ON STRATEGIC BOMBING,AND ON CLOSE AIR SUPPORT
AND INTERDICTION OF SUPPLIES IN THE COMBAT ZONE.CLOSE AIR SUPPORT AND
INTERDICTION INDIRECTLY HELPS YOUR GROUND TROOPS IN COMBAT.
STRATEGIC BOMBING REDUCES THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF TROOPS AND EQUIPMENT FROM
NORTH VIETNAM.DEFOLIATION AND RECCE INCREASES YOUR CHANCES OF SPOTTING ENEMY
UNITS WHILE THEY ARE ON THE MOVE.
THE LAST FIGURE INDICATES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS SPENT ON HELICOPTER
SUPPORT.1 MILLION DOLLARS WILL AIRMOBILISE 100 MEN PERMANTLY,SO YOU WILL NEE 30
MILLION TO AIRMOBILISE A BRIGADE-SIZE UNIT.
YOU CAN AIRMOBILISE GROUND TROOPS ON THE TROOP COMMITMENT WINDOW WHEN YOU COME
TO IT,BUT REMEMBER THAT IT WILL TAKE UNTIL DECEMBER OF THE CURRENT YEAR FOR THE
NEW COMMITTMENT TO BE APPROVED AND TO BE AVAILABLE FOR AIRMOBILISING UNITS.
WHEN YOU START A GAME YOU HAVE ENOUGH AIRMOBILE POINTS TO AIRMOBILISE A SMALL
UNIT.
[NOTE] THAT THE 1ST AIR CAVALRY ARE ALREADY AIRMOBILE WHEN THE GAME STARTS.NOW
PRESS THE `COMMIT THIS SUPPORT`BUTTON WHICH WILL STORE YOUR PROPOSED FIGURES
READY FOR THE NEXT BUDGET AND RETURN YOU TO THE INDEX SCREEN.ONCE THERE,PRESS
THE `SUPPORT SOUTH VIETNAM BUTTON`.

                -------------------------------------------------

SUPPORT GVN
-----------
THIS TAKES YOU TO THE SCREEN WHERE YOU CAN COMMIT ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID TO
THE GOVERMENT OF SOUTH VIETNAM.AGAIN THIS IS IN THE FORM OF BUDGET
PROPOSAL.ECONOMIC AID HELPS THE GVN PACIFY THE COUNTRY AND INVEST IN SOCIAL
INFRASTRUCTURE.
REMEMBER THAT COMMITING LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY WHILE SOUTH VIETNAM IS VERY
UNSTABLE WILL GUARANTEE THAT MOST OF THE INVESTMENT IS WASTED IN INEFFECIENCY
AND CORRUPTION,ALTHOUGH IT CAN SOMETIMES REDUCE SUCH INSTABILITY IN A PROCESS
OF BUYING  TIME FOR REAL REFORM.MILITARY COMMITMENT ALLOWS IMPROVEMENTS TO
BE MADE IN THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE SOUTH VIETNAM`S ARMIES.YOU WILL 
NEED TO FEED IN CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF MILITARY AID IF YOU WISH TO COMMIT
LARGE NUMBERS OF SOUTH VIETNAMESE UNITS TO WAR.
THE DEFAULT FIGURES ARE REASONABLE AMOUNTS FOR COMMITING ABOUT 1/3 OF THE
UNITS,GIVEN 50% STABILITY AND POPULATION CONTROL.YOU CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE
THESE VALUES MORE OR LESS IN PROPORTION TO YOUR DESIRED COMMITMENT AND SUCCESS
IN THE WAR.

NOW RETURN TO THE MAIN INDEX SCREEN BY PRESSING THE `COMMIT THIS SUPPORT`
BUTTON,AND CLICK ON THE `COMMIT RESERVES`BUTTON.THIS SCREEN HAS A SINGLE FIELD
WHICH LETS YOU COMMIT TROOPS THAT WILL REPLACE BATTLE CASUALTIES DURING THE
NEXT YEAR.YOU START THE GAME WITH 5000 RESERVES,AND YOU WILL NEED TO JUDGE HOW
MANY RESERVES TO COMMIT BY MONITORING YOUR LOSSES DURING THE YEAR,SO LEAVE THIS
SCREEN FOR THE MOMENT(BUT REMEMBER TO COME BACK AND REQUEST RESERVES BEFORE THE
END OF THE YEAR)

NOW YOU CAN GET DOWN TO BUSINESS BY COMMITTING TROOPS TO SOUTH VIETNAM AND
BEGINNING THE CAMPAIGN THERE.WHEN YOU COMMIT TROOPS TO THE WAR(OR WITHDRAW THEM
FROM IT) YOU ACT IN YOUR CAPACITY AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AN SO YOUR ORDERS ARE
CARRIED OUT MORE OR LESS IMMEDIATELY.
CLICK ON THE `TROOP COMMITMENT BUTTON`
                -------------------------------------------------

COMMIT GROUND FORCES
--------------------
THIS WILL TAKE YOU TO A SCREEN WITH A SCROLLING LIST,AND SEVERAL BUTTONS ON
IT.IN THE SCROLLING LIST ARE ALL THE AMERICAN UNITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR
COMMITMENT TO SOUTH VIETNAM,AND A LIST OF ALL ALLIED AND SOUTH VIETNAMESE UNITS
AVAILABLE.
YOU DO NOT NEED TO COMMIT ALL THE UNITS PRESENT(INDEED THIS COULD BE POLITICAL
SUICIDE). INSTEAD YOU WILL PROBABLY WANT TO MATCH THE COMMUNIST PRESENCE.AT
FIRST,2 OR 3 AMERICAN UNITS PER CORPS AREA,AND ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF ARVN
UNITS SHOULD SUFFICE.

IF YOU CLICK IN THE SCROLLING LIST ON A UNIT NAME,ITS NATIONALITY,STRENGTH,AND
CURRENT DESTINATION CORPS WILL BE SHOWN.
[NOTE] THAT THE CORPS AREA`S WERE ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS OF SOUTH VIETNAM,AND
ARE USE IN THE GAME.

YOU CAN CHANGE THE DEFAULT DESTINATION OF A UNIT BY TYPING IN A NEW CORPS
NUMBER IN THE CORPS FIELD OF THE UNIT COMMITMENT SCREEN.ONCE YOU HAVE TYPED IN
THE NEW NUMBER YOU CAN EITHER COMMIT THE ORIGINAL DEFAULT,OR SELECT ANOTHER
UNIT IN WHICH CASE THE DESTINATION WILL REVERT TO THE ORIGINAL DEFAULT.
COMMITTING A UNIT TO INVALID CORPS(ie NOT 1,2,3 OR 4)WILL RESULT IN THE UNIT
NOT BEING COMMITTED AND A WARNING BEEP SOUNDING.
[NOTE] THAT YOU CAN NOT AIRMOBILISE AND ALREADY AIR-MOBILISED UNIT!!!

IF YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT AIRMOBILE COMMITMENT YOU CAN AIRMOBILSE A FOOT UNIT BY
PRESSING THE AIRMOBILISE BUTTON.IF YOU AIRMOBILISE A NON-FOOT UNIT,IT WILL
FIRST CONVERT TO INFANTRY AND THEN BECOME AIRMOBILISED.IF YOU DO NOT HAVE
ENOUGH POITS YOU WILL AGAIN HERE A WARNING BEEP AND NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.
IF YOU CAN AIRMOBILISE THE UNIT.IT WILL HAVE AN ASTERIX PLACED AFTER THE NAME
TO INDICATE THAT IT IS NOT AIRMOBILE.

ONCE YOU HAVE DECIDED TO AIRMOBILISE OR CHANGE THE DESTINATION OF A UNIT(OR
EVEN IF YOU DO NOT)YOU CAN COMMIT THE UNIT TO SOUTH VIETNAM BY PRESSING THE
`COMMIT UNIT`BUTTON.PRESS THIS A FEW TIMES TO SEND A FEW UNITS TO SOUTH
VIETNAM.THEN PRESS THE `EXIT` BUTTON TO RETURN TO THE INDEX SCREEN.

YOU CAN WITHDRAW UNITS FROM VIETNAM USING THE `WITHDRAW UNITS`SCREEN,IT WORKS
LIKE THE `COMMIT UNITS` SCREEN,BUT IN REVERSE,AND IS USED TO TO BRING TROOPS
BACK FROM VIETNAM TO AMERICA WHEN YOU ARE WINNING THE WAR,OR IF THE DECLINE IN
YOUR POPULARITY REQUIRES IT.

                -------------------------------------------------

MAPS SCREEN
-----------
NOW PRESS THE `MAPS BUTTON`,YOU WILL SEE A MAP OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA.IF YOU CLICK
ON THE `RETURN TO MAIN SCREEN`BUTTON IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER IT WILL
TAKE YOU BACK TO THE INDEX.DO NOT DO THAT YET.EACH OF THE 4 CORPS AREAS HAS ITS
OWN DETAILED MAP.THIS MAP IS A KIND OF INDEX TO THOSE MAPS.CLICK THE MOUSE
WITHIN THE REGION THAT IS MARKED AS `1 CORPS` (THAT IS THE NORTHERN MOST OF
ALL 4).YOU WILL THEN MOVE INTO 1 CORPS MAP.
MAPS OF  ALL CORPS AREAS ARE GIVEN AT THE END OF THE MANUAL.YOU WILL SEE A
COUPLE OF UNITS PRESENT(THESE ARE THE LITTLE SQUARES WITH CROSSES IN THEM)
THESE ARE THE UNITS YOU COMMITTED EARLIER.COMMUNIST UNITS REMAIN INVISIBLE
UNTIL THEY FALL INTO THE SPHERE OF OPERATIONS OF ONE OF YOUR UNITS,OR A
TOWN.SOMETIMES,THEY WILL APPEAR BRIEFLY WHICH INDICATES A SIGHTING FROM AIR,OR
INFO FROM VARIOS INTELLIGENSE SOURCES.

                -------------------------------------------------

SPHERES OF INFLUENCE AND COMBAT
-------------------------------
[NOTE] THAT THE RECTANGLE OF A UNIT INDICATES APPROXIMATELY ITS SPHERE(OR
RECTANGLE)OF INFLUENCE. THIS IS THE AREA IT IS PATROLLING AND INVESTIGATING.THE
UNIT`S COMMANDERS WILL SHIFT FORCES AROUND WITHIN THAT AREA ACCORDING TO HIS
BEST JUDGEMENT.THIS PROGRAM CONCENTRATES ON STRATEGIC
ASPECTS-LOCATION-CONTROL-AND PACIFICATION RATHER THAN THE TACTICAL ASPECTS OF
COMBAT.
AS UNITS LOOSE TROOPS THROUGH COMBAT,AND IF THESE TROOPS ARE NOT REPLACED FROM
THE RESERVE POOL.THEN THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE SHRINKS ACCORDINGLY. THIS AREA IS
NOT ABSOLUTE;SOMETIMES ADVANCE PARTIES FROM 2 MOVING UNITS WILL CLASH BEFORE
THEIR SPHERES OF INFLUENCE INTERSECT.
FOR THE MOST PART THOUGH,COMBAT TAKES PLACE WHEN 2 UNITS OVERLAP.WHEN MORE THAN
1 UNIT OF EITHER SIDE IS INVOLVED IN COMBAT,THEN IT IS RESOLVED BY A NUMBER OF
INDIVIDUAL FIGHTS.
WHILE THE ULTIMATE WINNER WILL BE THE ONE THAT HAS THE MOST TROOPS ENGAGED IN A
GIVEN AREA,EACH UNIT WILL TAKE CASUALTIES,AS IF IT WERE BEING ATTACKED BY ALL
THOSE ENEMY UNITS THAT IT IS ENGAGED WITH(AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT) 

                -------------------------------------------------

TROOP ORDERS
------------
YOU CAN GET INFO ON A UNIT BY CLICKING WITHIN ITS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE(ie,ON THE
UNITS SYMBOL).THIS BRINGS UP A UNIT INFO PANEL.INIT IS THE
-NAME-NATIONALITY-STRENGTH-EFFECIENCY AND MORALE OF THE UNIT.
EFFECIENCY AND MORALE ARE EXPRESSED AS PERCENTAGES.MORALE IS AFFECTED BY
COMBAT-SUCCESS AND REST,EFFECIENCY IS FIXED FOR AMERICAN UNITS,BUT VARIABLE FOR
ARVN UNITS.
IT DETERMINES THE LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP AND EQUIPMENT IN THE UNIT.THE ARVN`S
EFFECIENCY VARIES BECAUSE OF THE STABILITY OF THE GOVERMENT OF SOUTH
VIETNAM.PRESSING THE `OK` BUTTON WILL GET RID OF THE PANEL.PRESSING THE `SPACE
BAR`WILL SELECT THE NEXT UNIT IN THE CORPS.PRESSING THE `TAB BUTTON`WILL MOVE
THE PANEL TO AND FRO SO THAT YOU CAN SEE UNDER IF IT IS NECESSARY.
[NOTE] THAT THE SELECTED UNIT IS ALWAYS SHOWN TOPMOST,AND WITH A BLACK SQUARE
AROUND THE OUTSIDE.

YOU CAN ORDER A UNIT`S COMMANDER TO MOVE HIS UNIT BY SELECTING THE UNIT,AND
THEN CLICKING ON THE MAP TO GIVE THE UNIT 1 OR A SERIES OF DESTINATIONS.SELECT
A UNIT,AND WHEN THE INFO PANEL APPEARS CLICK DOWN ON THE MAP ABOUT 3 INCHES(ON
THE SCREEN)TO THE LEFT OF THE UNIT.A BLACK LINE WILL CONNECT THE UNIT AND YOUR
SELECTED DESTINATION.CLICK AGAIN A LITTLE TO THE NORTH.AGAIN A LINE WILL
APPEAR.IF YOU PRESS THE `CLEAR ORDERS` BUTTON ON THE INFO PANEL THIS `ORDER
PATH` WILL BE CLEARED AND YOU CAN SET A NEW ONE.PRESS THE `OK` BUTTON AND THOSE
ORDERS WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE UNIT(IT WILL NOT START MOVING UNTIL YOU SET
THE GAME SPEED TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN PAUSE,WHICH YOU WILL DO SHORTLY)

YOU WILL WANT TO MOVE YOUR UNITS TO CONTROL AN AREA OF LAND,OCCUPY A CITY OR TO
ATTACK AN ENEMY UNIT.IT IS QUITE A USEFUL TACTIC TO KEEP SOME AIRMOBILE UNITS
INRESERVE,WHICH YOU CAN RAPIDLY MOVE IN TO SUPPORT AN INFANTRY UNIT THAT HAS
COME UNDER ATTACK.

YOU CAN MOVE UP AND DOWN THE MAP OF VIETNAM BY CLICKING ON,ABOVE AND BELOW THE
CORPS MAP YOU ARE LOOKING BY CLICKING ON THE NAME OF THE CORPS MAP YOU WISH TO
GO TO.FOR EXAMPLE,IN 1 CORPS CLICK ON THE WORDS `II CORPS`AND THAT MAP WILL
APPEAR.
ALTERNATIVELY YOU CAN CLICK ON THE `RETURN TO MAIN MAP`BUTTON AND SELECT A NEW
CORPS MAP FROM THAT.
[NOTE] THAT YOU CAN MOVE UNITS BETWEEN CORPS BY ORDERING THEM ONTO THE SAME
PLACE THAT YOU CLICK TO MOVE BETWEEN MAPS.THEY WILL MOVE ONTO THE AREA OF THE
NEW CORPS,AND THEN DISAPPEAR FROM THE CORPS MAP YOU ARE LOOKING AT ONLY TO
RE-APPEAR IN THE NEW CORPS MAP,WHICH YOU CAN THEN MOVE TO IF YOU WISH.
                -------------------------------------------------

CONTROLLING GAME SPEED
-----------------------
WHEN YOU HAVE GIVEN ALL YOUR UNITS,ALL THE ORDERS YOU WANT,YOU CAN MAKE
EVERYTHING HAPPEN BY USING THE `GAME` MENU AND SELECTING A SPEED.YOU CAN ALSO
`PAUSE` THE GAME` BY PRESSING `0` AND THE KEYS 1-4 SET THE SPEED WHERE 1 IS THE
FASTEST.
                -------------------------------------------------

THINGS TO REMEMBER
------------------
1....YOU CAN TURN OFF ALL SOUNDS USING THE GAME CONTROL MENU
2....PAUSING THE GAME TO GIVE ORDERS WILL MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO GIVE
     ORDERS,AND IS RECOMEMNDED.
3....EVERY COMMITMENT TO VIETNAM HAS A PRICE BOTH ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL.IF YOU
     OVERCOMMIT YOU RUN THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC DECLINE IN POPULARITY.
     [NOTE] THAT WITHDRAWING UNITS CAN RETRIEVE SOME OF YOUR LOST POPULARITY.
     YOU ARE ALWAYS BALANCING COMMITMENT AGAINST POPULARITY.
                -------------------------------------------------

REFERENCE SECTION
-----------------
THIS SECTION IS ENTERED AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY YEAR.A SERIES OF OF FORMULAE
WORK OUT AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR THE WAR,AND FROM THAT HOW MUCH SUPPORT AMERICA
CAN COMMIT TO THE WAR.YOU THEN USE THIS AVAILABLE COMMITMENT TO SEND NEW UNITS
TO VIETNAM,OR DO OTHER THINGS LIKE BOMBING CAMPAIGNS OR DEFOLIATION.

COMMITMENT POINTS
-----------------
EVERYTHING YOU DO HAS A COST IN COMMITMENT POINTS.THE COST VARIES FROM TIME TO
TIME,BUT THE PROPORTIONS STAY SIMILAR TO THE TABLE BELOW.

OBJECT				COST
------				----

RESERVES (PER THOUSAND)         1
NEW UNITS(PER THOUSAND)         3
AIRPOWER(1 MILLION DOLLARS)     2
AIRMOBILITY(FOR 100 TROOPS)     2
MILITARY AID(1 MILLION DOLLARS) 2
ECONOMIC AID(1 MILLION DOLLARS) 1

THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE COMMITMENTS,EXCEPT THAT
THEIR POINTS ARE DERIVED FROM PONTS GIVEN BY THE AMERICANS.

POLITICAL OPTIONS
-----------------
`COMMIT UNIT` THIS OPTION ALLOWS THE USER TO SEE ALL THE UNITS,REPRSENTED BY
THIER ICONS AND A SHORT DESCRIPTION IN A SMALL AREA WITH ITS OWN SCROLL
BAR,THAT CAN BE COMMITED TO THE WAR.THE PLAYER CAN SELECT THE UNITS BY DRAGGING
THEMM INTO A DIFFERENT BOX IN THE `DIALOG` BOX.AN `ADVISER` WILL GIVE ADVICE AS
TO HOW THE SELECTION WILL GO DOWN WITH THE PUBLIC,BUT THIS WILL BE THE ONLY
GAUGE OF THE COST IN COMMITMENT POINTS.
[NOTE] in general withdrawls are popular and commitment unpopular..also
bombing,defoliation and invasion also carry penalties.

WITHDRAW UNIT...THIS ALLOWS A UNIT TO BE WITHDRAWN,WITH THE CONCOMITANT
                DECREASE  IN COMMITMENT POITS.
RESERVES........THIS OPENS A DIALOG BOX INTO WHICH YOU CAN TYPE THE NUMBER OF
                RESERVE TROOPS YOU WANT TO HAVE IN THE COMING YEAR
COMMIT ARVN.....THIS DEALS WITH ALL COMMITMENTS TO THE GOVERMENT OF SOUTH
                VIETNAM,INCLUDING THE EXPENDITURE ON THE ARVN,AND ECONOMIC
                AID,EXPRESSED IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,AND AGAIN THIS IS SUBJECT
                TO ADVICE. $1000,000 EQUALS 1 ECONOMIC POINT AND 12 ARVN
                COMMITMENT POINTS(ENOUGH FOR A DIVISION).$1000,000 OF ECONOMIC
                AID COSTS 3 COMMITMENT POINTS AND MILITARY AID COSTS 5
COMMIT AIRPOWER.ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO COMMIT AIRPOINTS,AND AIRMOBILE POINTS,WITH
                APPROPRIATE COST IN COMMITMENT POINTS AND WITH THE RELEVANT
                ADVICE,AIRPOINTS ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN BOMBING NORTH VIETNAM
                BOMBING THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL,AND CLOSE AIR SUPPORT FOR COMBAT
                TROOPS BY PERCENTAGE.
                -------------------------------------------------

MILITARY SECTON
---------------
ORDER OF PLAY.
THE COMMUNIST FORCES WILL CONSTANTLY FIND THEIR TARGETS AND CARRY OUT THEIR
PLANS EVEN IF YOU DO NOTHING,BUT ALWAYS RESPOND TO ANY CHANGES IN THE
SITUATION,UNLESS YOU SELECT PAUSE,THE GAME PROCEEDS AT THE RATE 1 DAY EVERY FEW
SECONDS(DEPNDING ON THE SPEED YOU SELECT)UNITS MOVE EVERY DAY,IF THEY HAVE
ORDERS TO,AND COMBAT MAY TAKE PLACE.EVERY YEAR OF GAME TIME YOUR POLITICAL
DECISIONS TAKE EFFECT.YOU CAN CHANGE THESE AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE
YEAR.THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU ORDER $100 MILLION TO BE SPENT ON AIR SUPPORT THIS
GETS CARRIED OUT ONLY AT THE END OF THE YEAR,JUST AS IF YOU HAD ENTERED IT INTO
A PROPOSED BUDGET,AND CONGRESS HAD ACCEPTED IT.YOU MAY AT ANY TIME GO TO THE
MAP SCREENS AND GIVE UNITS ORDERS,AND YOU MAY AT ANY TIME COMMIT NEW TROOPS OR
WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM SOUTH VIETNAM AT THE USUAL COST IN COMMITMENT POINTS.

MOVEMENT
--------
A UNIT IS EITHER AIRMOBILE,FOOT OR MECHANISED.DIFFERENT UNITS OF THE SAME TYPE
MOVE AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS,ACCORDING TO THEIR EFFECIENCY RATING AND THEIR
QUIPMENT LEVELS.AIRMOBILE UNITS MOVE AT A CONSTANT RATE,OOT TROOPS MOVE FASTER
THAN MECHANISED IN MOUNTAINS,JUNGLES AND PADDIES.EVERYWHERE ELSEMMECHANISED
TROOPS MOVE FASTER.

UNDERSTANDING UNIT INFO
-----------------------
THE UNIT ICON THAT IS DISPLAYED INDICATES THE TYPE OF UNIT;PLEASE NOTE THAT
UNITS ON COLOUR MACHNES MAY VARY SLIGHTLY.
[NOTEABLE EXAMPLES] AIRMOBILE UNITS WHICH RESEMBLE AIRBORNE UNITS UPSIDE
DOWN(THE SYMBOL SUGGESTS ROTOR BLADES) AND RANGERS APPEAR TO HAVE CROSSED
ARROWS INSTEAD OF THE STANDARD INFANTRY ICON.

COMMUNIST UNITS DO NOT BECOME VISIBLE UNLESS THEY ARE IN CONTACT WITH FWA
UNITS,OR THEY MOVE IN OR NEAR A MAJOR TOWN OR CITY.VC UNITS OFTEN APPEAR FROM
NOWHERE WITHIN VIETNAM,AS BEFITS A GUERILLA ORGANISATION. THE NVA MOVE DOWN THE
HO CHI MINH TRAIL FROM THE NORTH AND USUALLY MOVE INTO COUNTRY FROM THE
EAST.AMERICAN UNITS WHEN COMMITTED APPEAR IN THE SELECTED CORPS,AT A PROVINCE
CAPITAL OR PORT,AS LOGISTICS ALLOW.

THE UNIT INFO WINDOW CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING INFO;

NAME
----
THIS IS THE NAME OF THE UNIT THAT IS SELECTED.UNITS ARE DISPLAYED IN
ABBREVIATED MILITARY NOTATION.1/1/1 IS READ FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AS -1ST
BATTALION OF THE 1T BRIGADE OF 1ST DIVISION. A BATTALION IS ABOUT 500-1000
MEN,A BRIGADE IS 3 TIMES THE SIZE OF A BATTALION,AND A DIVISION IS TYPICALLY
MADE OF 3 BRIGADES.IN THIS GAME THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF BATTALION SIZED
UNITS,THE MAJORITY BEING BRIGADE SIZED UNITS,ANY SINGLE NUMBER IN THIS INSTANCE
REPRESENTS AN INDEPENDANT UNIT(EG;THE 173RD OR THE 11TH) NOT A DIVISION.

STRENGTH
--------
THIS IS THE RATION OF STRENGTH OF THE UNIT

MORALE AND EFFECIENCY
---------------------
THESE ARE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE HOW WELL A UNIT FIGHTS(APART FROM
STRENGTH)-MORALE IS AFFECTED BY (FOR INSTANCE)LOOSES AND VICTORIES,EFFECIENCY
BY CONSTANT MOVEMENT AND REST.GENERALLY,LETTING A UNIT REST IS A GOOD WAY OF
RECOVERING LOST POINTS.

TYPE
----
THIS SHOWS WHAT TYPE THE UNIT IS-ARTILLERY-INFANTRY-MARINES-AIRBORNE..ECTTHIS
SHOULD BE SHOWN AS AN ICON

COMBAT
------
COMBAT OCCURS WHEN THE AREAS OF OPERATION OF TWO OPPOSING UNITS OVERLAP.THE
UNIT ICON GIVES A GOOD IDEA OF THIS AREA OF OPERATIONS,BUT A UNIT MAY HAVE
ADVANCE PARTIES OUT IN FRONT WHILE MOVING,WHICH RESULTS IN A COMBAT OCCURING 
WHEN A UNIT IS MOVING TOWARDS ANOTHER.
[NOTE] HOW A UNIT ICONS SHRINK FROM LOSSES TO INDICATE A REDUCING STRENGTH,BUT
THE SIZE OF THE UNIT PRESENT COMPARED TO ESTABLISHMENT SIZE.2 UNITS WITH THE
SAME SIZED ICON ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME STRENGTH.

often merican units on patrol would pass right through communist units,if they
did not want to be seen,and so combat usually occured when the communists were
ready for it.

COMBAT DOES NOT USUALLY RSULT IN VICTORY-BUT SIMPLY LOSSES TO BOTH
SIDES.SOMETIMES THE COMMUNISTS WILL WITHDRAW,OTHER TIMES NOT.THE WINNER THEN IS
THE SIDE THAT LOSES THE LEAST MEN.THE NUMBER OF MEN LOST DEPENDS ON THE COMPLEX
FORMULAE THAT INCLDES-STRENGTH-MORALE-EQUIPMENT AND MISSIONS OF BOTH SIDES.
ON THE WHOLE,GREATER NUMBERS,EFFECIENCY AND FIREPOWER RESULT IN GREATER LOSSES
INFLICTED UPON THE ENEMY,BUT CANNOT PREVENT CASUALTIES WITHIN YOUR FORCES.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
------------------
PUT SIMPLY THE COMMUNISTS WILL WIN IF THEY HOLD SAIGON FOR 3 MONTHS,OR IF THEY
CAPTURE A LARGE ENOUGH PROPORTION OF SOUTH VIETNAM(ABOUT 2/3RDS).THE AMERICANS
WIN BY STOPPING THEM DOING SO FOR 10 YEARS,OR BY CAPTURING THE SAME AMOUNT OF
POPULATION.THE AMERICANS CAN ALSO WIN BY COMLETELY SMASHING COMMUNIST
RESISTANCE(VERY DIFFICULT)

it has been said that `all communists had to do was lose,the americans could
not however win` while this is not entirely true it does give some idea of the
problems the americans faced.


SCENARIOS
---------
PURPOSE OF SCENARIOS...SCENARIOS ARE INCLUDED IN THE GAME TO PROVIDE OPTION OF
PLAYING A SHORTER GAME THAN THE COMPLETE CAMPAIGN VERSION.IT IS ALSO A USEFUL
WAY OF GETTING USED TO THE MILITARY SIDE OF THINGS.FINALLY IT PROVIDES A `GET
OUT` OPTION FOR THOSE NOT INTERESTED IN THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE GAME.
THE SCEANRIOS SIMULATE 3 MAJOR BATTLES OR CAMPAIGNS OF THE WAR:-TETKHE SANH-AND
THE 1975 OFFENSIVE.THE DESCRIPTIONS BELOW GIVE AN IDEA OF THE MAIN POITS OF THE
SCENARIO.

TET
---
THIS WAS A MAJOR OFFENSIVE BY THE NLF IN 1968.IT INVOLVES A LARGE NUMBER OF US
AND SOUTH VITNAMESE UNITS,SEVERAL FREE WORLD ALLIES,LARGE NUMBERS OF VC AND
SOME NVA REGULARS. IN THE REAL CAMPAIGN,THE COMMUNISTS AIMED TO INCITE A
NATIONWIDE REVOLUTION BY INVADING AND HOLDING AS MANY TOWNS AND CITIES IN THE
SOUTH AS POSSIBLE.THEY FAILED MILITARY,BUT THE SIGHT OF COMMUNIST FORCES
HOLDING SO MANY TOWNS ALBIET TEMPORARILY,WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE THE WAR SEEM
UNWINNABLE TO MANY PEOPLE.
IT WAS THE TURNING POINT IN THE WAR,THE COMMUNISTS IN THE GAME WILL TRY TO DO
THE SAME THING,AND THE PLAYER MUST RESIST BY DEFENDING TOWNS AND ALSO BY
DESTROYING COMMUNIST FORCES.

KHE SANH
--------
THIS BATTLE TAKES PLACE IN 1 CORPS ONLY.IT INV9OLVES SEVERAL NVN DIVISIONS AND
A VARIETY OF MARINE,ARMY AND SOUTH VIETNAMESE UNITS.AIR SUPPORT IS MASSIVE,BUT
AIRMOBILITY IS LIMITED.THE MATINES ARE HEAVILY FORTIFIED ON THE KHE SANH
PLATEAU.VICTORY IS WON FOR THE NLF BY OCCUPYING KHE SANH,AND FOR THE US
DECIMATING THEN ENEMY UNITS.

1975 OFFENSIVE
--------------
THIS SCENARIO IS JUST LIKE THE 1973 SPRING OFFENSIVE,EXCEPT THAT US AIR
STRENGTH IS NOT PRESENT AND ARVN RESERVES ARE MINIMAL.VICTORY CONDITIONS FOR
THE NVN ARE FAIRLY HIGH.BUT THE EASE WITH WHICH THE NORTH CAN ROLL OVER TOWNS
IN THE SOUTH MEANS THAT MIT WILL BE EASY TO CLOCK UP THE POINTS REQUIRED.



YOU STRATEGY BUFFS SHOULD GUESS THE ABBREVIATIONS..BUT HERE GOES SOME

INF..........INFANTRY
BDE..........BRIGADE
BAT..........BATTALION(ALSO AS BN)
REG..........REGIMENT

UNIT INFORMATION
----------------
THIS IS A LIST OF THE DIVISION SIZED UNITS THAT WERE AVAILABLE FOR COMMITMENT
TO SOUTH VIETNAM. THERE ARE SOME MORE REPRESENTED IN THE PROGRAM,AND SOME
FICTIONAL ONES ADDED IN ORDER TO SIMULATE THE POSSIBLE RAISING OF NEW
UNITS.THIS INFORMATION IS INCLUDED TO GIVE YOU A BETTER IDEA OF THE STRUCTURE
HISTORIES OF SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT UNITS IN SOUTH-VIETNAM.
                ----------------------------------------
1ST AIR CAVALRY DIVISION
------------------------
ARRIVED  VIETNAM: 11 SEPTEMBER 1965
DEPARTED VIETNAM: 29 APRIL 1971

THIS UNIT IS THE DESCENDANT BOTH OF THE 1ST CAVALRY DIVISION,FIRST RAISE IN
1921 AND THE 11TH AIR ASSAULT DIVISION(TEST)WHICH WAS RAISED IN 1963.IT WAS
THE FIRST SPECIFICALLY HELI-BOURNE DIVISION IN THE AMERICAN ARMY AND HAS A
DISTINGUISHED CAREER IN VIETNAM FIGHTING IN 11 CORPS UNTIL 1968 WHEN IT WAS
