GAMEPLAY

You, the spirit of the white wolf "TSUKIKAGE", have taken the form of
a Ninja to battle the evil one.

Fight Ninja swordsmen, samurais, giant Ninjas, mystical kitemen,
wolves and musketeers, before the final confrontation with the evil
warlock.

Travel across perilous boardwarks, marshes and ropebridges, and climb
the sheer rock face, avoiding poisonous gas.  Make your way through
treacherous caverns, but watch out for the lowering ceiling and
boulders which pin you to the walls.

Kill the special Ninjas who leave a spirit ball in their place.
Collect these to get extra spirits, who follow your every move and
attack, extra power for your weapons, and extra weapons such as the
deadly "Fire-Rope".
