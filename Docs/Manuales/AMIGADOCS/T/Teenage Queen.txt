 RULES :

First of all, before any cards are dealt, a preliminary bet of 5 chips is
compulsory. The program takes care of this for you.

5 cards are dealt to each player, who start to play in turn.

The player whose turn it is can open the betting (BET) or not (STAY). The
player who opens can bet from 5 to 25 chips.

The opponent can fold immediately (DROP)
Or can raise the betting (RAISE)
Or can match the current betting, in order to change some cards (CALL)

The change of cards gives a clue to your opponent's hand. If she changes 2 
cards, it could mean she has three of a kind. It could also be a bluff!

Betting starts again. you can leave the initiave to your opponent (STAY) or
raise the betting yourself (BET)

Three situations can then develop for all the players:
-You abandon the game (DROP) if you think the stakes are to high for your
 hand;
-You see the opponent's hand (CALL) by matching her bet. The hands are
 compared to find the winner;
-You increase the betting (RAISE) to up the stakes and put pressure on your
 opponent. Bluffing comes into its own at this stage. To bluff means to
 intimidate the opponent into folding by giving the impression that your
 hand is much stronger than it really is.

 SPECIAL CASES :

-If both players STAY 
 following the first deal, the game is cancelled and the preliminary 5
 chips stay in pot.

-If both players STAY
 following the second deal, the hand are compared to find the winner.

 STRIP POKER :

Each time you win, your opponent will have to get her chips back from you.
You'll be charmed by the way she does it. Jocelyn Valais has made some
