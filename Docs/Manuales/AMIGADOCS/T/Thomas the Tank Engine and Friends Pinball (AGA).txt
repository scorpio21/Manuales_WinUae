THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE AND FRIENDS PINBALL AGA.
-----------------------------------------------

THE MAIN MENU.
==============

Use this to access any of the four pinball tables available. You can also
access the Hi-Score tabke from here by pressing F6 - to return to the main
menu, press F6 again. If no key presses detected within a short time, the
main menu will swap back and forth with the hi-score table automatically
until a key is pressed.

To load a pinball table, you can use the F keys as follows.

F1 Thomas
F2 James
F3 Percy
F4 Toby
F5 Options screen
F6 High Scores
F7 HELP

Once you have selected the table, the screen will clear and you will be
shown the table layout, all the tables features will be explained to you at
this stage (just watch).
You can decide whether or not to play this table by pressing F1 - F8 for
the number of players, or ESCAPE to go back to the main menu (press ESCAPE
again and you will return to DOS).

CONTROLS AND PLAYING THE GAME.
==============================

When you have loaded a Pinball table, it will wait in an "attract mode".
This is where the table is scrolling up and down the screen waiting for you
to begin playing. The table will always go into this mode if it is loaded
but you are not playing it.
To start playing, you need to define how many players are going to play. Up
to 8 players can play the game at any one time. After pressing P for pause,
hit any key to continue playing.
To select the numnner of players you use the Function keys as follows:

F1 - 1 Player,  F2 - 2 Players,  F3 - 3 Players, etc.

After you've selected the number of players, the table will scroll up the
screen ready for play and a ball will be loaded into the chute.
Use the keys to play THOMAS THE TNK ENGINE AND FRIENDS PINBALL.

Key(s)          Action.

Cursor down     Pull back the spring (release key to shoot ball)
Left  shift     Flip the left  Flipper
Right Shift     Flip the right Flipper
SPACE bar       Tilt The table


Each Player has 3 balls or more per game. If you are playing with more than
1 player, gameplay procedes as follows:
Player 1 goes first and plays his first ball. When he loses it, gameplay
reverts to player 2 who plays his first ball, and so on. When the last
player has lost his first ball, the gameplay reverts back to player 1 who
then plays his second ball. The gameplay follows this pattern until all
players have played all their 3 balls. Apart from the standard controls,
the game has some special features.

1) Tilting the table (Key - Space bar)

Sometimes it can be useful to "push" or "shove" the table to move the ball
when it is not near the flippers. To do this in the game press the space
bar. Remember not to use this feature too many times as you will end up
"tilting" the table, the flippers will lock, and you will lose your ball!

2) Cycling light sets (Key - Left and Right Shifts)

Imagine the situation where you have lit three lights of a four light set.
You are trying to light the remaining light but misjudge your aim and the
ball heads for an already lit light. All is not lost! Each time you press
the left or right Shift keys you will "cycle" all the lights in the set in
a clockwise direction so that each light moves one position to the left,
which means that if you are quick enough you can move the unlit light to
the psition where the ball is heading, light it, complete the full light
set and gain a bonus score! 
Only a few select light sets on each table are controllable in this
fashion. Referto each tables guidelines to familiarise yourself with their
cycleable light sets.

3) Pausing the game (Key - P)

If you need to halt the game but do not want to quit it, a simple tap on
the P key will do the trick. To restart the game, press any key.

4) Restarting the game (Key - ESCAPE)

If you are having a bad game and want to start again, do the following:
Press ESCAPE. The table will go into attract mode. To start another game
use the function keys as before.

5) Quitting the game (KEYs - P, ESCAPE, Y and N)

If you are playing a table but wish to play one of the others, follow this
sequence:
Pause the game with P. Now Press ESC. You will be asked whether you really
want to quit or not, if you do, press Y. If you change your mind press N.
If you press Y the table will fade out and the main menu will be loaded and
displayed. Use the Function keys as before to load a new table. If you
press N the game will go back to being paused. Press any key to return to
the gameplay.

6) "Loaded the Wrong table ?" (Keys - ESC, Y and N)

If you find that you have loaded the wrong table by mistake, Press ESC. You
will be asked if you really want to quit or not. Press Y or N. Pressing Y
loads the main menu. Pressing N puts the table back into attract mode where
you can use the function keys as before to start playing it if you change
your mind.
Here is a summary of the controls.

Key(s)          Action.

Cursor down     Pull back the spring (release key to shoot ball)
Left  shift     Flip the left  Flipper
Right Shift     Flip the right Flipper
SPACE bar       Tilt The table
P               Pause the game (Press any key to restart)
ESC             Quit a Table (If in-game, and after pausing) Quit a game
                (When the ball is in the chute)

HIGHSCORE
=========

When you have played a game and have scored a high score you will be asked
to enter your name for the high score table. There is a high score table
for each Pinball table.
You are allowed to enter three letters for your "name". To do this use the
left and right SHIFT keys to cycle through the alphanumeric characters and
the SPCAE bar to set or fix a character. The table will automatically go
into attract mode after you have entered your name. High Scores are saved
each time a Pinball table is Quit and the main menu is reloaded. Please
note that this is the only time high scores are saved.

General Information.
====================

The JACKPOT is a Collective Score Bonus which is built up by all players
during a game. It is reset to zero each time it is awarded to a player.

FLASHING  LIGHTS AND BONUSES.
=============================

Flashing Lights are a hint as to where you can pick up big scores and
bonuses.
Most Bonuses are not immediately added to your score. When you loses a
ball, they are added up and your score is updated. Whilst this is happening
you will see "x2 x3 " etc appearing at the bottom of the screen; indicating
bonuses you have obtained.
We will be using the following terms when describing each Pinball tables'
features.

                                ROLL-OVERS
                                ----------

  These are small switches which poke through the surface of the pinball
 table. They are shown as vertical metal-coloured lines and usually have a
 light above or below them. You enable their lights and pick up points or
                bonuses whenever the ball rolls over them.

                       DROP-TARGET OR TOUCH TARGETS
                       ----------------------------
   These are simple switches which poke through the surface of a pinball
 table. They are shown as vertical metal-coloured lines and usually have a
 light above or below them. You enable their lights and pick up points or
                bonuses whenever the ball rolls over them.


                            PASSAGES AND LANES
                            ------------------

These are channels that the ball can roll through to get from one place to
                                 another.

                                 BALLTRAPS
                                 ---------

These are short dead-end passages. When the ball enters a ball trap it will
be held there for a short time while you collect a bonus score. Ball-traps
  can be covered (where you cannot see the ball) as well as being in the
                                   open.

                                  LETTERS
                                  -------

These are actually lights in the shape of letters. They make up words on a
Pinball table, and once you have lit up the whole word you collect a score
                                  bonus.

                              RAMPS AND LOOPS
                              ---------------

 These are like raised passages. They carry a ball form one position in a
 table to another. They are usually shown with solid grey enterences ramps
change into wire-frame guides around halfway along the ramp, although they
maybe shown in different colours. You can also shoot the ball under ramps.

                                  TUNNELS
                                  -------

A tunnel is a passage that goes underneath a ramp or another raised section
                            of a pinball table.

                                 MUSHROOMS
                                 ---------

 These are circular bumpers which award points each time the ball touches
  them. Once the ball is hit a mushroom it will be repelled away at high
                             speed so beware!

                                  KICKERS
                                  -------

    These are triangular bumpers which are usually found just above the
    flippers. They will award points each time the ball hits them. Like
mushrooms, Kickers have a habit of deflecting the ball away at high speeds.

                               MULTI-BONUSES
                               -------------

  A multi-bonus is a special feature which when collected multiplies your
         base score. You collect multi-bonuses ox x2, x3, x4 etc.
