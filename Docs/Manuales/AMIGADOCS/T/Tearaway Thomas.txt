TEARAWAY THOMAS DOCS
====================

EVER WONDERED WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CHALLENGE THE MIND OF A
TINY LITTLE CREATURE. CALLED A TEARAWAY!

A CREATURE NOT INDIGENOUS TO THIS PLANET OR ANY OTHER PLANET WHICH THE
SO-CALLED EXPERTS HAVE DISCOVERED. THE TEARAWAY SPECIES RESIDES ON THE
PLANET `CINOS EHT GOHEGDEH` (SCOOTER NOTE: THATS SONIC THE HEDGEHOG
BACKWARDS...THOUGHT YOU`D WANT TRIVIAL BIT OF INFO) A PLANET SITUATED 16
BITS AWAY FROM THE BLACK HOLE CALLED `AGES` AND JUST A LITTLE LEFT OF THE
STAR SYSTEM MAGADRIVER BUT STILL REMAINING NORTH OF THE DENSELY POPULATED
ANAGRAM.

THERE ARE 1000`S OF THEM AROUND YOUR HEELS RIGHT NOW AND IF YOUR QUICK.VERY
VERY QUICK YOU MAY JUST BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF ONE AS IT
TEARS AROUND. THEY ARE SO FAST THAT EXPERTS ON THE TEARAWY SPECIES ESTIMATE
THAT IN ORDER TO SEE ONE IN FULL YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE TRAVELLING ONE INCH
OFF THE FLOOR AT SUPERSONIC SPEED...[SCOOTER NOTE: SOUNDS LIKE A LOAD OF
PARC TO ME-ERM THATS AN ANAGRAM TO YOU]..I WONDER IF THE CONCORDE COULD FLY
THAT LOW...

THE TEARAWAY SPECIES DO HOWEVER HAVE THEIR OWN SHARE OF PROBLEMS THEY ARE
NOT EXACTLY SURE WHO THEY ARE AND WHERE THEY BELONG.

MANY LIGHT YEARS HAVE PASSED IN THE HISTORY OF THE TEARAWAY IN FACT IT HAS
BEEN AGES SINCE THEIR PLIGHT BEGAN TO BANISH THE EVIL DR OIRAM FROM THEIR
PRICKLY SOUNDING PLANET.

JEALOUS OF THEIR SPEED AND THEIR CUTENESS THE EVIL DR OIRAM PLACED A SEED
OF DOUBT IN THE MIND OF EACH AND EVERY TEARAWAY EVER DEVELOPED. ABOUT JUST
WHO OR WHAT IT WAS AND WHERE IT BELONGS. CAN YOU HELP A TEARAWAY CALLED
THOMAS SEARCH FOR HIS TRUE IDENITY.

IT LIES IN THE FUTURE WORLD BUT HE CANNOT GET THERE WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

TAKE HIM THROUGH WOODED LANDS THE LIKE OF WHICH THE HUMAN EYE HAS NEVER
BEFORE SEEN. TAKE HIM ACROSS THE POLAR ICE CAP AND LIVE WITH HIM THROUGH
YOU`R WORST KNIGHTMARE DEFENDING YOU`R TEARAWAY FROM BOTH FRANKENSTIENS AND
OUT OF CONTROL TOYS.GUIDE HIM THE BEST WAY YOU CAN TO THE FUTURE SO THAT HE
MAY ONCE AGAIN LIVE THE LIFE OF A TEARAWAY AND RETURN TO DESTROY THE EVIL
DR OIRAM ON HIS PRICKLY SOUNDING PLANET.
