Time Runners 2 'The Space Stone' Quick Docs

Time Runners 2 takes place in the prehistoric era.  You've just been
captured for trying to steal 'The Space Stone'.  The reason for stealing
the stone was to allow you to travel through time and save the love of
your life. [All this over a girl? :)]  As fate would have it, you were
going after a fake stone and were captured.  So, you start the game in
a holding cell on a space vessel in prehistoric times.  [Don't ask me how
a space ship got into the past!]  Your mission now is to get out of jail
and recover the stone so you can save your girl.

All the commands necessary to play the game can be found in the online
help.  There is a section called VIDEO MANUAL where it explains the game
and all the commands.  Also, if you hit 'h' anytime in the game, it will
give you a list of all the commands.  Here are most of them:

SPACE   Select an arm
P       Pause game
ENTER   Help for the situation you're in
U       Show all exits and actions
M       Map
I       Status and Inventory
H       Help

The movement keys are pretty straight forward.  Just use the arrow
keys and SHIFT to fire.  Again, press 'h' for a complete list of movement
keys.

That's about all you need to play this game.  It's a pretty straight
forward game and doesn't require much explanation.
