                           TUNNELS OF ARMAGEDDON
                              REFERENCE CARD

- Getting Started

Tunnels of Armageddon is not physically copy protected.  You should make
a copy of the game disk before beginning to play, set the original aside,
and play off the copy.  Leave the copy unprotected, as the game will
occasionally write to the disk.  You can also copy the game to your
hard disk and play from there.

- Booting the Game

Turn on your computer and monitor (load Kickstart if required).  Insert
your Tunnels of Armageddon disk in drive df0: at the Workbench prompt.
The game will load automatically.

- Protection Check

Before the game starts, you will be asked to input a color from the
Protection Wheel.  Click on any color... Cracked by PARANOIMIA!

- Main Menu

You can make a selection on the Main Menu by using the mouse to move
the cursor over the desired item and click to confirm your choice.

The following options are available:

- Start a New Game allows you to begin play.

- Recall Saved Game allows you to recall the saved game on the disk.

- View High Scores allows you to see the listing of high scores on the
  disk.

- Quit exits the game and returns you to the operating system.

- Randomize Tunnels will appear after you have successfully completed
  the game.  This feature will randomize the configuration of the
  tunnels so that the complex will be different for the next game.

- HERMES Movement

You control the movement of the HERMES by dragging the mouse in the
following manner.
_____________________________________________________________________

- Types of Tunnels

The easiest but longest tunnels are gray, the moderate tunnels are green,
and the hardest but shortest tunnels are red.

- Transitions

Between every stage you will enter a transition.  A score screen will
appear, and in some transitions you will be able to save the game.
Once the stage number has changed, you can continue by pressing any key.

- Scoring

In every transition you will see a score screen which lists your current
score, how long it took you to get through the last stage (in seconds),
and the best time recorded for the last stage.  The more objects you
shoot and the faster your speed, the higher your score will be.  If you
shoot an object that you are already carrying the maximum amount of
(a bomb, for instance), you will still get points for the object
allthough you will not be able to acquire it for use.  If you successfully
complete the whole game, you will get additional points.  The score
screen will remain up until you press the mouse button.

The high score list will appear if your score is in the top 9.  If so,
you will be able to enter your name.  If you don't want to save the score,
press the ESC key.

- Saving the Game

You can save the game (called "sending information") at the end of every
zone (every 4th stage).  The SEND window will be highlighted when this
option is available.  There can be only 1 saved game on a disk.  You can
recall a saved game from the Main Menu.

- Active Keys

Generally, you can play the game by controlling the mouse with your
right hand and by placing your left hand on the keyboard.  Please
see the manual for a description of the items that the various keys
control.  Note that some keys are not active until you acquire the
object which they control.
