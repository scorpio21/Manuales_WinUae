PREPARE TO SHELL OUT SOME PUNISHMENT
------------------------------------
Only hours ago, April O'Neil, was kidnapped from her mobile news van by 
the vile, ruthless, terrorist bully SHREDDER! He's a Slice-O-Matic crum, 
a villain more vicious than an army of mind-altered Bruce Lees.
The fearless foursome must concoct a way to rescue April before Shredder 
brainwashes her into joining his Ninjitsu Foot Clan. They'll combine
this treacherous task with the mission they've been on since their 
mutated beginnings - to thrash Shredder and capture his Life Transformer 
Gun, the lone piece of technology that can turn their rat friend, 
Splinter, back into the man he used to be.

HOW TO PLAY
-----------
Your initial goal is to rescue the fair maiden, April, but your ultimate
objective is to battle through the streets and sewers of New York until
you score a victory at the TECHNODROME, home of the evil Shredder and
his Life Transformer Gun.
Once a turtle is captured, he is out of action until you find and rescue 
him. (Prisoners could be anywhere. To release them, simply touch their
hand.)
At the end of each level (except Level 2) you'll unfortunately find a 
Karate Boss who is anxiously waiting to turn you into turtle soup.
A FINAL SLICE OF ADVICE : Keep an eye out for weapons, ropes and 
life-sustaining pizza pies as you go.

stars of stage, screen and comic books, are pumped full of pizza power.
Each has a different skill and a unique personality. You must decide
when is the best time to control each turtle.
Return to the Info Screen to switch turtles from situation to situation.
Remember: these Samurali sidekicks are only as gifted in the ancient art
of warfare as you.

LEONARDO
--------
Leonardo's primary weapon is the hairsplitting Katana Blade. He's most
effective when attacking sewer enemies, especially ones that lurk.

RAPHAEL
-------
The needle-tipped Sai is Raphael's preferred attack tool. The speed
and grace of his strikes are what he prides himself on.

MICHAELANGELO
-------------
Compared to his comrades, Michaelangelo's power is only average. 
However, enemies around his feet usually fall prey to his Nunchukus
onslaught. His courage will aslo amaze you.

DONATELLO
---------
The dreaded Bo (not to be confused with everyone's favourite Halfback/
Left Fielder) is Donatello's form of amusement. Don't be fooled by the 
fact that it looks like a simple stick, because this baby can take out
enemies from both above and below.
