			   Tom & Jerry

		      Hunting High and Low

                       PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS

America's favorite cat and mouse team is at it again, ripping and racing
through every room in the house.  You control Jerry, that pint sized little
cheese pirate, gobbling up every piece you can find.  But watch out for
Tom, because that wily cat is waiting at every turn@  His "meow" may be
worse than his bite, but he'll still keep you away from that scrumptious
Swiss.

Scramble across shelves, bounce off cushions and leap onto chairs - you'll
do anything to stay away from that darn cat.  Drop a can of oil in Tom's
path or distract him by turning on his favorite television show - just keep
him away until you can collect the cheese in all five rooms.  That's what
it takes to win!

When you've cleaned out the cheese in the living room, zip through a
mousehole and into the garage.  But don't forget to dodge the surprises
that Tom throws your way - they can blow up and cost you time.  The only
way to get your time back is by picking up all the cheese you see!  The
rooms are connected and each has two mouseholes.  One leads to the previous
room, the other to the next.  Use the mouseholes wisely - they can save the
day!

Good luck!

                            QUICKSTART

Amiga:

1) Insert the Tom & Jerry disk (label side up) in your disk drive and turn
   on your computer.

2) After the title screens are displayed, the game begins with only Jerry
   shown.  A timer at the bottom of the screen shows 600 seconds.  That's
   how long you have to eat all the cheese.  You will lose thirty seconds
   every time Tom catches you.

3) Experiment with the joystick controls for a few seconds, and try to 
   move Jerry high up on the shelves, out of Tom's reach.  Don't take too
   long though, because Tom will soon discover your location.

Commodore 64/128

1) Turn off your computer and disk drive.  Insert your Tom & Jerry disk,
   label side up, and turn on your computer and disk drive.

2) Type: Load"*",8,1 and press Return/Enter.

3) The Tom and Jerry title screen will appear.  Press the joystick button
   to begin the game.

                       STRATEGY & TACTICS

Obstructions

* Some items will block Jerry's path, but are easily negotiated by Tom.
  Be careful that you don't get stuck next to a large piece of furniture,
  with only one avenue of escape.

* As you move around the five rooms you will find many items (bowling
  balls, hammers, vases, toys, etc.) that can slow Tom down if you drop
  them in his path.  The banana peel actually sends Tom sliding off the
  screen.

Distractions:

* If you can find the right object, you might be able to distract Tom
  while you run around and collect all the cheese.  The television, 
  refrigerator and Jack-in-the-Box are three such items, but there are
  plenty more if you keep your eyes open.

* You have to initiate a distractions (see Joystick Instructions), but
  once activated, Tom will just sit there completely oblivious to Jerry.

Mouseholes:

* Mouseholes are your path to new rooms.  Once you've eaten all the
  cheese in a room, or if Tom is getting too close, you can escape into 
  a mousehole.  It's a good idea to gobble all the cheese that you find.
  That way, you don't have to return.

* Avoid the bombs, because they cost you time.  The cheese wins playing
  time.

                       JOYSTICK INSTRUCTIONS

Jumping Up & Down

You won't get far in Tom & Jerry until you learn how high and far you can
jump.  Press the joystick button to jump.

Some objects in the house provide a "trampoline" effect and allow you to
jump very high. Try bouncing repeatedly, on sofas, chairs and tires to test
your limits.  You should find objects in every room that will help you jump
to the highest shelves and picture frames.

Simply jumping up and down isn't enough to keep Tom away.  You'll have to
jump in a direction to keep that fast cat at bay.

Jumping Left & Right

Jumping left and right is one of the keys to success in Tom & Jerry.  Move
the joystick left or right during a jump to send Jerry in the selected
direction - you can even change direction in mid-flight.  If you're
running, just press the button and he will jump in the same direction.

If you press the fire button just before he lands, and at the same time
move the joystick left or right, Jerry will make an additional jump in the
required direction.

Dropping Objects

When Tom's getting close and you need to slow him down, you might be able
to drop something in his path.  Look for bowling balls, plates, vases, oil
cans, and hammers.  To drop an object, pull the joystick toward you while
standing on the object.  It will fall to the ground.

Timing is important when dropping objects.  While liquids on the floor can
make Tom slip, the best place for a bowling ball is on his head. Keep your
eyes open, and try to drop everything you find in high places.  You never
know when it might be just what you need.

Slippin' & Slidin'

You can get a break from the chase and spend more time eating cheese if you
can find the banana.  To drop a banana, pull the joystick toward you while
standing on the banana.

When Tom steps on the banana, the fun really begins.  He'll skitter and
slide right off the screen, leaving you free for more important matters.

Distracting the Cat

Tom's curiosity isn't an advantage in this game.  He'll just sit if you
can activate the objects that really grab his attention (refrigerators,
televisions, statues to name just a few).  To distract Tom, pull the
joystick toward you while standing on the correct item.  He won't bother you
for a while.

Every level contains at least one item that will distract the cat.  On some
items, you must stand in a specific location to activate them.  For
example, you must stand above the control switch to activate the
television.  Take advantage of these objects and you will be able to spend
less time running away and more time eating.

Radio Waves

You can change the music to keep Tom and Jerry happy.  Pull the joystick
toward you while standing on top of a radio to hear a new song.

				7

Mouse Passages

The action is fast and furious when you race through the passages between
rooms.  Tom is throwing little bombs and other objects into the hole and
you have to jump over them or you lose valuable time.  Press the fire
button to jump over items in a passageway.

You'll find cheese scattered throughout the passageways, and each piece you
eat gives you more time to complete your gourmet mission.  Move the
joystick left or right to change direction in a passageway.

Mouseholes

You can enter a mousehole is you're standing right in front of it.  Push
the joystick forward to enter a mousehole.

The mouseholes are arranged to circle through the rooms in the house.  Each
room has two mouseholes, one leading to the next room, the other leading to
the previous room.
