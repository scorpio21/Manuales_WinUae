SUMMARY
++++++++

24  December  2022, "Operation Blind" a scientific experiment of remarkable
daring takes place

THE DEFINITION
--------------

The "Blind" team, led by the renowned Professor John Merrick, aim to save a
world  ravaged by the Greenhouse effect by exploding thermo nuclear devices
simultaneously  at  each  pole This will cool the savage rays of the sun by
throwing quantities of dust and steam high into the atmosphere.

The  scientists  miscalculate.   The  experiment works all too well and the
world  is  pitched  into  an intense Nuclear Winter.  Civilisation perishes
under a blanket of snow and ice.

Centuries  later the survivors eke out a miserable existence living most of
their  lives  on  huge  trains,  the  only  source of transport, travelling
constantly between those towns that still exist:  pathetic shadows of their
former  selves,  used  now only as meeting and trading points for the giant
trains.

Controlling  the  trains  and the rail network is the sinister and powerful
Viking  Union.  They will tolerate no threats to their profitable monopoly.
An ice locked world suits them just fine.  You play an idealist, Captain of
the  Transarctica.   Inspired  by  ancient writings you set out to discover
more  about  the  now  mythical  sun.   On  your  travels  you  learn about
"Operation  Blind",  and  also  of  "Operation Sun".  At last!  A chance to
fulfil your dream!

Transarctica  combines adventure and strategy:  to restore the sun you must
successfully  manage  and  build up your train:  to do this you must become
adept  at using maps, avoiding obstacles controlling steam engines, mining,
spying, trading and fighting the battle trains of the Viking Union.

A pen and paper for making notes will come in very useful.

Morning and every evening, I would read you this passage aloud:

"Sun  a  common noun 1.  The Sun:  a heavenly body which produces the light
of  day.   Example:   The  distance from the Sun to the Earth By extension:
One  sun:   one  heavenly  body  radiating its own light at the centre of a
system.   2.  The luminous disc of the Sun, the appearance of this heavenly
body  for  an earthbound observer.  Example:  The sun rises in the East and
sets  in the West.  3 Radiation, light and heat of the sun.  Example, it is
sunny,  sunny.  Protect yourself from the sun.  Expose yourself to the sun.
Sunburn:  burning caused by the rays of the sun.

I  closed  the  old  encyclopaedia,  I  got  up,  opened  the window of the
compartment  and  stayed  there  for  a  long time, lying down with my eyes
closed,  my  face lashed by the icy squalls.  I remembered the first time I
read  this text in the abandoned library of Alexandria.  What a revelation!
Ever since, I searched for other writings on this myth.  This had caused me
a  lot  of  problems  with  the Administrators, and the railway agents were
supervising me constantly.

Everything rocked when I discovered an article dating from the twenty first
century  in  the "Blind" project, which referred to the "ultimate solution"
to save the planet from perishing.  I then became an "Amnbivalent", and the
Administrators of the Viking Union had put a price on my head

YOUR WORLD
++++++++++

THE PLANET EARTH:

This  is  a  constantly  frozen  planet,  surrounded  by an opaque layer of
clouds.   The  sun can no longer be seen, it has become a mystical heavenly
body, certain allusions to which can be fouud in ancient writings.

Apart  from  the  mammoth,  the only means of transport is the steam train.
Coal  is  the main source of energy, making it possible to warm oneself and
fuel trains.

There are two types of coal:  lignite and anthracite.

Lignite  is  used  like  currency:   it governs all transactions.  The most
currently  used unit is the "Bak" (100 kg of lignite).  Lignite can also be
used as fuel.  Lignite is referred to as "Lignite-money".

Anthracite  is  richer  than  lignite, and is exclusively used for fuelling
steam trains.


THE VIKING UNION:

This  is  the only train company which manages the immense railway network,
linking  the  various  cities.   It is directed by the "Administrators" and
employs a colossal army.

It  is not a totalitarian power it does not deal with the administration of
towns  - but its monopoly of all means of transport gives it unquestionable
authority.  Also, to preserve its ice locked monopoly, it is making efforts
to  seek out and destroy every thing which has anything to do with the Sun.
It regards you as an "Ambivalent" as an enemy to be destroyed.


THE PLAYER

You  are  the chief of the "Ambivalents", those curious beings who seek out
the  old  myths about the sun.  You have made numerous converts, but only a
few  have  followed  you  in your armed struggle.  Your greatest victory to
date  is  the  theft  of  one  of  the Viking Union"s greatest trains:  the
Transarctica


THE QUEST:

This is the first day of the new year 2714 (Viking calendar) At the head of
the  Transarctica and a small group of men, you are travelling the world to
find  information  on  the  mysterious  Project  Blind, you have a dream to
restore the sun to the world.


THE GAME: 

To  progress  successfully  in  the  game  you  must  build up the size and
strength  of  the  Transarctica.   Additional wagons etc can be bought with
Lignite-  money  from various industrial towns.  Extra Lignite money can be
gained  by trading at commercial towns, with wandering nomads or by mining.
You  must  also  avoid  the  battle  trains  of the Viking Union, and other
hazards such as wolves:  intelligence gathering by your spies is vital.
 

THE RISKS: 

The  Viking  Union  will  do  anything  to destroy the Transarctica.  Train
combats always end in the death of one train or the other.

Other  dangers  threaten  you:   mole  men,  the "Hordas" and other hostile
animals.   Moreover,  a train stopped on the ice condemns its travellers to
certain  death.   Boiler  explosions,  running out of coal, minefields, are
thus to be avoided....  In the end, suicide may be a fairly sweet solution.


CONTROLS
++++++++

The game works entirely with the MOUSE.

On  the  keyboard,  the  numeric  pad  (figures  from  1 to 9) emulates the
movements  of  the  mouse.  You can move around block by block by using the
CONTROL key with these figures.  The RETURN key or the SHIFT key (for doing
capital  letters) replace the left button of the mouse:  the ALT key is the
right  button).   On the joystick movements are made naturally in all eight
directions.   The firing button corresponds to the left button of the mouse
and the ALT key on the keyboard, the right button

PAUSE KEY:              Press key <P>.
TO LEAVE THE GAME:      Type <CONTROL> X


RECEPTION PAGE
++++++++++++++

This is the page which appears after the presentation.

It presents the following options:

To start a new Game you can select the difficulty level.

To  play  a  saved  game,  Messages will tell you of the disc changes to be
made.

To  cancel  the  train  combats phase from the game (see the chapter "Train
Combat").   The  result  of  the  battle  will  then  be  calculated by the
computer.

To  switch  in-game  music  on or off, as far as your machines capabilities
allow.

CONTROL PANEL
+++++++++++++

During almost all the game, the control panel will be present at the bottom
of the screen.

DESCRIPTION


        -------------------------------------------------
       |  2                   1                        2 |
       |          A        B                        6    |

       |          C        D                        8    |
        -------------------------------------------------

1.   This  bar  represents  the  TRAIN  with  all its wagons in order.  For
complete information on a wagon, Click on it and keep the button down.  The
text  will  disappear  as  soon  as  you  release  the button.  The crosses
inscribed on a wagon indicate its rate of destruction.  At the end of three
crosses, the wagon is destroyed, and only the axles are left.

2.   These  ARROWS  make it possible to scroll the bar of the train towards
the  right or left, if it goes off the frame.  The Transarctica can in fact
have up to 100 wagons!

3.   Since  the  game carries on in pseudo-real time, this clock states the
EFFECTIVE  TIME.   The number of days elapsed appears in a small frame.  By
clicking  on  the  clock,  we  go on to the "time acceleration" phase:  the
needles  turn  more quickly, events occur more quickly, train movements and
other  characters  in  the  game  are quicker.  Click on the clock again to
restore effective time.

4.  Selecting these icons give direct access to the wagon shown.

The  "A" icon represents the engine; "B" the private wagon, "C" the general
quarters and "D" the missile launcher.

The icons "A", "B", and "C" are always accessible, the "D" icon is only you
own the missile launching wagon, which must be bought during the game.

5.  These action icons change according to the phase of the game.  Once you
are  in  the engine, the general quarter or the private wagon, the map icon
is  the  only one which can be selected, and it will lead you directly onto
the  enlarged  map centred on the train.  For other phases of the game, the
icons are explained later, in each of the corresponding chapters.

6.   This  number represents the amount of "LIGNITE" coal you possess.  The
unit  used  is  the "Bak" which corresponds to around 100 kg.  This term is
derived  from "baquet" ("tub"), a currently used receptacle, which contains
10 kg of coal.  The "Bak" which appeared later is equivalent to 10 baquets.

The  number decreases as coal is loaded into the boiler.  Also as this fuel
is used as currency, the number is modified with each transaction.

7.   This  number  states  the  quantity of ANTHRACITE possessed (in baks).
Anthracite,  which is less volatile than lignite and much more combustible,
cannot be used as currency.

8.  States the SPEED of the train in km/hr.


THE ENGINE
+++++++++++
 
Its function is faithful to that of traditional steam machines.

PRELIMINARY EXPLANATIONS;

The  firebox,  supplied  with  coal,  heats  the  water  in the boiler.  On
reaching  100oC,  the water boils and the pressure starts to rise.  To make
the train go forward, a minimum pressure is required.

The speed of the train is fixed by the player, according to the position of
the regulator

Energy  consumption  will  be  according to the speed and mass of the train
(kinetic  energy  formula).   The faster and heavier it is the more energy,
that is coal, will be consumed.

By  going forward more slowly (fairly low adjustment of the regulator), you
can  make  appreciable  savings....  But all this is a question of strategy
and choice.

      ----------------------------------------


1.  The RECEPTACLE or "STOUP" collects the messages from the radio operator
in the general quarters, who communicates with the various spies spread all
over  the  world.   If a message is present in this receptacle, click over:
the  information will appear in a frame at the bottom of the screen.  Click
again to make the frame disappear.  A bell will ring as each new message is
received.

2.  The Firebox is only lit up if coal is burning inside it.

3.   By clicking once on this character, he starts to load the LIGNITE into
the  firebox  a  second click accelerates the loading and a third stops the
operation.

WARNlNG:  It is not necessary to put coal permanently into the firebox.  On
the  contrary, a few pellets may suffice to make the train move forward for
quite a long time.  Also, you risk making the boiler explode.

4.   Same  principle  as  above,  except that ANTHRACITE is loaded into the
machine.

5.   By  selecting  this  wheel,  the  driver reverses the direction of the
train.  The train will stop briefly.

6.   By  clicking  on  the  BRAKE, you will stop the train.  This in no way
changes the position of the regulator, or any coal loading operations under
way.  In order to start up again, re select the brake.

7.  The traditional lever of the WHISTLE.
 
8.  The ALARM starts up if the observation car (see Chapter "The Detailed
Map") has seen something

9.  Access to the engine controls

A.   This  pressure  gauge  measures  the intrinsic pressure to the BOILER.
Beyond the hyphen, you risk causing an explosion.
 
B.  Indicates the SPEED of the train in km/hr.

C.   These  figures  indicate  pressure  in  PISTONS (effective transmitted
energy).  This pressure has a ceiling of around 300.

D.  Thermometer indicates the TEMPERATURE inside the boiler.

E.   This  REGULATOR  is  the  only  adjustable  element  on the panel.  By
clicking  somewhere on the gauge you set the position of the regulator knob
which  effectively  controls  the  speed of the train.  Minimum, full left,
maximum full right.  (Maximum 300 km/hr).

F.  Exit back to engine


THE PRIVATE WAGON OR "BOUDOIR"
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As  in  the  engine  and  general  quarters, this wagon has a "Stoup" and a
luminous alarm signal.

Three other possibilities are offered:

THE INVENTORY:
 
If  you click on the character sitting at the desk - his name is Kolotov,
your  special  secretary - a complete inventory of the Transarctica will be
presented to you.

THE BACKUP:

By  selecting  the  book on the table, you can save game whenever you like,
and  for  as  many times as you like the programme will ask you to insert a
previously formatted disc.

On Amiga, you have to wait a few seconds after the insertion of a diskette,
for the drive to read it.

On hard disk, you backup directly in the game sub directory.

SUICIDE

By  selecting  the  revolver on the table, you can, by pressing the trigger
(button on the mouse) "commit suicide" and thus return to the options page.

THE GENERAL QUARTERS
++++++++++++++++++++

Four choices are proposed to you on the page shown on the screen

THE STOUP (Bottom Left):

As  for  the  engine, you can obtain different information by selecting the
current message

THE MAP:
++++++++

By  clicking  on the mock up, an overall map of the whole game area appears
on the image.  You can then select any place in the world (see chapter "The
Map").

SPYING AND SABOTAGE:

You will find further information on spies in the chapter "Locations" ("The
barracks").   This  menu can be aceessed by selecting the radio operator on
the left.  It includes two options:

TOP:  SENDING A SPY (available only if you have one).  The overall map will
then  be  displayed.   Select  the area where you want to send a spy.  Once
this area is displayed, the mouse will turn into a little symbol.  Place it
in the exact place which the spy is to observe, that is on the track (don`t
forget  that distances are very important!), then click on the button.  The
spy will then leave Transarctica to travel to his point of destination.  As
he moves like a rocket, his travelling time will be fairly short.

Having arrived, he will start to observe, and will inform you of everything
he  sees.   In  order  to  recover  him, you have to go and look for him by
train.   You  can  also, send spies into the cities, who will inform you of
their  "trading level." Apart from exceptional cases, it is useless to send
spies anywhere other than on the tracks.  They also have available a charge
of dynamite to blow up tracks or bridges.

MIDDLE:   DYNAMITE  (available only if at least one spy is operative).  The
map,  centred  on the spy, will be displayed with a selection icon in order
to  carry  out the sabotage.  Click above and the spy will start to use the
dynamite on the track or bridge on which he is currently posted.

A  destroyed  track stops enemy trains for the time, it takes to repair it.
If a bridge is demolished, the enemy is forced to retreat.

These  acts  of  sabotage can be very useful when you are pursued by a more
powerful  enemy  train.   Try, then, to pass close to one of your spies and
make the track behind you blow up.  You will then have the time to escape.

WARNINGS

This can sometimes go against you if you want to use bridges which you have
already destroyed!
 
Spies can carry out one dynamite operation, and one alone, but if a train
passes close to them, you can re supply them with dynamite.

Only tracks and bridges can be blown up.  It is useless to try it in cities
or in enemy hideouts.  Also, ends of tracks cannot be demolished.

LINE INSPECTION CARS:

These are little steam machines which are very fast, and can be sent to the
front  or  back  of the train, this menu can be accessed by clicking on the
character to the right of the general quarters screen.

This  menu  proposes  two  choices  to  you:   the sending of a simple line
inspection  car  and  the  sending of a line inspection car with a missile.
(These  are the same missiles as those used by the missile launcher wagon).
Obviously, you have to possess a line inspection car, and a missile for the
second choice, which may be purchased in certain trading towns.

Having  made  your  choice,  you  have  to decide the direction of the line
inspection  car:   either  in front of the train or at the back of it.  The
line inspection car will then leave the screen, and you can follow its path
until it explodes.

If it stops gradually before exploding, this means it has met nothing along
the track, unless it has gone over a minefield or crashed into an obstacle,
that is an enemy train, or a barrage held up by underground barbaric people
(See  chapter  "The  Events").  The sending of the line inspection car thus
makes  it  possible to "test" the tracks, to see whether an enemy is there,
cause  him  significant  damage  and delay his progress.  Take care a "bomb
line  inspection  car"  `returning`  to  the  Transarctica  would  make  it
literally explode.


MAPS
++++

There are two maps:  the overall map and the detailed map

THE OVERALL MAP:

This can be accessed in the general quarters, by clicking on the mock up.

This  map  is an official plan taken from the Viking Union.  However, it is
possible that the railway network is not fully transcribed.

If  you  move the mouse above the control panel, it turns into a lens.  You
may then select any part of the land on the game.  The X and Y co-ordinates
of the centre of the lens are indicated respectively below and to the right
of it.

On the control panel, four action icons are available:

* Detailed map icon.

* An "EXIT" icon which will bring you back to the wagon previously left.

*  The  wheel which makes it possible to change the direction of the train,
without having to pass by the engine.

* The brake.

DESCRIPTION:

The little blue frames represent towns.

The skulls symbolise the enemey stores from where the V.U.  trains depart.

The  little  circuits  with  two  arrows  represent  workshops (See chapter
"Locations").

The  stippled traces are underground tracks.  These tracks have been traced
in  a  straight line and there are very few.  They make it possible for the
trains  to  go  much  faster, sometimes doubling their speed.  But they are
inhabited  by  the  "Mole Men" who often attack the trains (See the chapter
"Events")

The red dots indicate mines.  If they flash, the mines are open:  otherwise
they are exhausted.

The  Transarctica  is symbolised on the map as a small train.  If moving, a
flashing arrow indicates its direction:  otherwise, it is shown as a cross.


THE DETAILED MAP

Accessible  directly  from  the  "map"  icon  in any wagon, it shows a more
detailed  section  of  land,  centred  on the Transarctica.  Apart from the
second icon, which makes it possible to return to the overall map, the four
action  icons  are  identical  to  those  of the overall map (centered map,
inverter of direction and brake).

In  order  to  scroll  the  map,  position the mouse completely to the top,
bottom, left or right of the screen.

You  can  also  decide the route of your train.  Here:  simply click at the
point  where  two  different  train  lines meet to open or close junctions.
Remember  trains  cannot  manage  acute  turns,  so most junctions are only
accessible  from  one direction.  A closed junction is indicated by a block
of  colour just above that junction.  By cross referencing with the overall
map  it  is  easy  to  plan  a  route  for  your train, opening and closing
junctions well ahead of its arrival.  If you use this method in conjunction
with  speeded  up  time  (click  on clock, see control panel), you can move
around the world quite quickly.

Information on cities and mines is available on the detailed map.  Click on
the  various elements, keep the button pressed and a text will be displayed
at the bottom of the image and disappear when you release the button.

Act  in  the same way if you want to get to know a co-ordinate at any place
on the map (1 unit = 70 Km).

If  mobile  elements  (enemy  trains, wolves, mammoths, nomads) are visible
from  the  observation  car, they are indicated on the map and the alert is
given  in  the  Transarctica.   There are several types of "observation box
wagon".   which  make it possible to see more or less far.  At the start of
the  game,  you  don`t have any of these in your possession:  your field of
vision  is thus fairly limited.  If the elements leave the field of vision,
they disappear from the map.

Finally, a destroyed track is symbolised by a large black hole.

MISSILE LAUNCHERS
+++++++++++++++++

This  wagon is not available at the start of the game.  You have to possess
at  least one missile to use it.  The train will stop if a missile is to be
fired.   Its  functioning is fairly simple:  all the selections are made on
the small control panel

FIRING ADJUSTMENTS

Two  firing  adjustments  are to be carried out:  orientation and distance.
Orientation  is  indicated on the left bar ("N" corresponds to 90o, "NE" to
45o,  etc).   You  position it by means of the small buttons alongside this
bar.  You select distance on the meter by clicking on the figures directly.

With  its  very  powerful  infra-red  pick  up, the missile is attracted by
sources  of  heat.   You  thus  don`t  have  to be precise down to the last
Kilometre, but a minimum distance is imposed.


FIRING:

Firing  is carried out in two phases:  you arm by selecting the left valve,
then you fire with the one on the right.

At  any  time,  you  can  leave  this  phase of the game by clicking on the
."EXIT" icon of the control panel.

Having launched the missile, its course if followed on the map.

WARNING:   Missiles  should  be  fired only to destroy enemy trains.  It is
useless  to send it anywhere else.  Of course, its target has to be decided
before  hand.   This  is  where  spies  are  useful.   By  knowing your own
co-ordinates  and  those  of  the  target  train, and knowing that one unit
corresponds to 70 Km, you can accurately calculate the optimal values for a
successful missile launch.

As  the  number  of  enemy  trains  in the game is limited, a missile which
reaches its target will free you from potential aggressors.


EVENTS
++++++

Various meeting occur during your journey.  Certain things can be seen from
the  observation  box;  the  alert  is  then  given and the "intruders" are
displayed on the detailed map.

NOMADS:   These are travelling merchants who transport very rare and sought
after products; the furnishings of Long Ago

MAMMOTH  HERDS:   It is fairly common to meet them.  The result of the hunt
will be decided by the number of beaters you have available, that is slaves
and  soldiers.   You do, of course, have to have cattle wagons to transport
them.

THE  "HORDAS":   These  are gigantic packs of starving wolves.  They attack
trains  and  cause  a  great  deal  of  damage to cattle wagons, slaves and
soldiers.
 
You need a strong army to defeat them.

THE   UNDERGROUND   PEOPLE  OR  "MOLE  MEN":   Their  ancestors  built  the
underground railways.  In time, they grew to prefer the relative warmth and
shelter  of  the  tunnels  to  the  world above.  They are cannibals.  They
attack  trains  for food and carry off women to breed with.  They are badly
organised but very strong and numerous and not afraid to die.

A "bomb-line inspection car" will discourage their attacks.

DESTROYED  TRACKS:  They will stop the train.  In order to repair them, you
will  need  rails.   Repair time will depend on your construction capacity,
that  is  the  number  of  slaves;  mammoths  and  cranes  you have in your
possession.

BRIDGES:   The construction of a bridge requires more means than the repair
of a track, but the principle is the same.

SCENARIO  POINTS:   These can lead you to discover a particular place, meet
such and such a "chatracter" etc.


LOCATIONS
+++++++++

The  Transarctica  may  visit  many  destinations.   Each  of  them  has  a
particular purpose.

COMMERCIAL TOWNS:

There are towns where mass trading is carried out between trains.

First select the type of transaction:  purchase or sale of merchandise, all
the  products  will  then  be displayed on the screen with their prices (of
purchase  or  sale  according  to  the  previously selected icon) and their
quantities.   To  gain  more  information  on a product, click and keep the
button  pressed.  Then use the "PLUS" or "MINUS" icons to fix the amount of
the  transaction;  quantity and price are displayed at the same time by two
meters.   To  complete the operation, click "OK".  The currency used is, of
course, the Bak.

WARNINGS:

To  purchase a product, you must have sufficient space to store it (that is
a  goods wagon or tanker, according to the product, and it should be empty,
or holding the same type of goods).

There  are 15 different products to trade.  They vary with local conditions
and supply and demand.  For these reasons you can gain many baks of lignite
by  clever  trading:  always note what a town is selling, at what price and
what  it  has not got - in fact, a notepad and pen will be handy throughout
the game.

Once  you  have  bought  a  certain product in one town, the town will take
quite a time to resupply itself with the same product.


INDUSTRIAL TOWNS

These  towns  specialize  in the manufacture of wagons.  The functioning of
the  menu  is  identical  to  that  in the commercial towns except that you
cannot resell a wagon.

There  are  about twenty different wagons (observation cars, cranes, goods,
cattle,  tenders  etc.) each with a specific function.  If you click on one
of them it is a general plan and descriptive text is displayed.

MAMMOTH FAIRS:

Mammoths  are very highly valued:  they can transport heavy loads and cover
hundreds  of  kilometres  at speed.  They are used for bridge construction,
mine-laying and war (See chapter "Train Combats").

Mammoth  fairs  are  few  and  far  between.   You can buy or sell numerous
mammals at them.  Use "PURCHASE", "SALE", "PLUS" "MINUS" and "OK" for this

Take care!  You must have cattle wagons to transport them.


SLAVE MARKETS:

Slaves  are  usually  captured  molemen.  Physically very strong; they take
part in all heavy work:  track repair, bridge construction, coal mining.

The  same  procedure  applies as to the mammoth fairs.  "Prison Wagons" are
essential for transporting slaves.

GARRISON TOWNS:

This  is  where  soldiers  are  enrolled:  "barracks wagons" are needed for
accommodation

The  soldiers  are  used  for  war and hunting.  They are normally hired by
slave merchants or by the local authorities for neighbourhood warfare.

Sometimes,  the  menu proposes a choice between soldier and spy.  The spies
cost  nothing;  they are mercenaries who, by philosophy, content themselves
with living in luxury wagons:  so you have to have these wagons in order to
be able to enrol spies.

On  the  other hand, they are prepared to carry out perilous missions.  The
luxury wagons are equipped with jet wagons.  These are used by the spies to
move  quickly  to  their  observation  points  the  cockpit of the jets are
equipped  with  ejector  seats.   Once  in  place,  the  spies can then set
dynamite on bridges or trucks.  (See the chapter "General Quarters").

WORKSHOPS:

These are a kind of garage for trains.  Three actions are possible.

-  By  selecting  the  engine shed on the left, you can change the order of
your  wagons.   The  order  of  the wagons is a determining factor in train
combat (see chapter; "Train Combat").

- The centre scene allows you to repair wagons as needed.  This costs a few
baks of coal.

-  By clicking on the wagon "cemetery" to the right, you can send wagons to
the  scrap yard.  This may be useful if you wish to lighten the load of the
Transarctica

MINES:

Mines are either lignite or anthracite.  The mines become exhausted after a
period of time, as they attract numerous prospectors.  The sooner you reach
a mine, the more coal you can recover.

The  result  of  your  prospecting  also  depends  on  the  means  you  can
commission:  slaves, mammoths, cranes.


TRAIN COMBAT
++++++++++++

The  battle trains of the Viking Union are constantly seeking you out, with
the  aim  of  ending your quest by destroying your train.  When you meet an
enemy the game passes automatically to the train combat sequence.

If  you  have  de-selected this sequence on the options menu, the result of
the battle will be calculated by the computer.

Train  combat  is a real "War game" between you and the enemy train managed
by the computer.  The winner is the one who destroys the military potential
of the other train (soldiers, cannon, machine guns).

ENVIRONMENT:

The enemy train is at the top of the screen:  yours is at the bottom.

The  combat  takes place in real time.  You can scroll the image by placing
the mouse to the right or left of the screen (as for map scrolling).

The  same  bar  on  the  control  panel, representing all the wagons of the
train,  is  available.  Scroll it by clicking on the right and left arrows.
Crosses  inscribed on the wagons show their destruction rate.  (After three
crosses,  the  wagon  is  destroyed).   If  the  wagon is attacked by enemy
soldiers,  a triangle, the symbol of the Viking Union, will be displayed on
the wagon.  If you select a wagon, the image will be centred above.

Under the bar of the train, there are three icons:

The  brake,  which  makes  it  possible  to stop or restart the train.  The
trains forward and backward movements are limited.

The direction inverter.

Return to the latest active position

DEPLOYMENT OF SOLDIERS

One  soldier  on  the  screen  represents a group of several soldiers.  The
soldiers,  on  departing  are  in  "barracks-wagons".  A control panel then
appears.   It  includes  an  ARROW,  "PLUS"  and "MINUS" icons and a NUMBER
corresponding  to  the  number  of  soldiers  present in the wagon.  If you
select the ARROW, all the soldiers will leave the wagon.

If  you  wish  to  leave  soldiers in the wagon, use the "PLUS" and "MINUS"
terminals to set the number of soldiers to be left.  The others will remain
in place, and the group will be divided in two.

Your  soldier  is  now walking on the screen.  If you select him, a control
panel  more complete than the one before will appear.  It includes the same
"PLUS" and "MINUS" icons, the NUMBER of soldiers and DIRECTIONS, and a STOP
position.  If you click on the latter (centre box) the group will stop.  If
you  choose a direction the group will go towards it.  The direction of the
group is lit up on the control panel.  As seen before, you can separate the
group  by using the "PLUS" and "MINUS ", then selecting the direction.  The
new  group  will  appear  on  the  screen, other soldiers of the group will
remain in place.

In order to cancel a control panel, click anywhere on the screen.

BLOCKING, COMBAT, REGROUPING, ASSAULTS:

A  group  of soldiers will advance until it meets an obstacle.  If it is an
enemy  group,  combat will automatically ensue:  The result will be decided
by the group`s relative strengths.

If  it is another group of allied soldiers, the two groups may join forces.
For  this, click on one of the groups and set direction that will lead to a
meeting.  The two groups then join.

A  soldier stops when in front of the enemy train.  Select him and move him
on  the wagon:  the soldier will then go onto the rooves of the wagon, even
if  the  train is moving.  He can then move onto the rooves and blow up the
wagon  by  setting  dynamite for this, click on the soldier and his control
panel  will  propose,  instead  of upwards movement the setting of dynamite
towards the right or left of the soldier.

The dynamite will only explode after a certain time, and the countdown will
be displayed by flashing.  During this period, the "defenders of the train"
may be moved up to the dynamite in order to put it out:  on the other hand,
the  "attackers" cannot cross it, as the dynamite will block their passage.
Various  strategies  can  be  foreseen to "protect" the bomb which has been
placed.  Dynamite, when it explodes, completely destroys the wagon on which
it has been placed and causes the death of all the characters present on or
in  the wagon.  By staying at the end of a wagon, one can place dynamite on
the  wagon  alongside  and  avoid  exploding  with it.  It is not useful to
destroy  all  the wagons; on the contrary, you risk losing some of your war
booty.

The  enemy  will act in the same way as yourself, in order to fend him off,
you in turn have to send soldiers onto the rooves of your own train.

MAMMOTHS:

Mammoths  do not move in groups during battle.  They move independently and
are  used  to  transport  soldiers.  They are held in the cattle wagons and
have  to be led out one by one.  Separation and regrouping functions as for
soldiers.   Mammoths  move faster than soldiers and can absorb much machine
gun fire.

COMBAT WAGONS:  CANNON AND MACHINE GUN:

To use:  simply click on the appropriate wagons.

The  cannon  fires  on the wagon facing it.  Between each firing, a certain
amount  of  time is needed to reload and prepare to fire again.  The firing
icon will indicate whether the cannon is operational or not.

Several  shells  may  be  necessary  to  destroy a wagon.  The boudoir, the
general  quarters and the engine are strongly armoured.  If you lose one of
them,  you  have  lost  the  battle...   and  the game!  If you destroy the
adversary engine, the enemy train can no longer move.

The  machine  gun  fires  straight  ahead.   If the train is moving, it can
"sweep" the battle field.  Take care not to fire on your own soldiers.

The other wagons have no offensive role in the battle.

BOOTY:

Booty  captured  depends on the original market value of the train, and the
number  of wagons left intact.  The more quickly and "cleanly" you win, the
more you gain.

Most of the time, you recover coal and slaves.
