1   Somehere in a valley, a valley fertile enough to shelter
2   human beings, a village lies.  The men who built it, gave it
3   the sweet name of Edengarfin, and for generations now, joy
4   and prosperity have been taken for granted.

5   In this village one day, a man called Tharn married a
6   woman named Fabella.
    
7   This man, due to his charisma and cleverness was the chief
8   of the tribe.  They gave birth to a boy they named Targhan
9   following the advice of the old wizard Athna-An.  In the
10  language of the valley.  Targhan means "the one who will
11  come back".

12  Then, Tharn died.  The little boy grew up, and became a
13  chief in his turn.  He inherited  the qualities of his parents.
14  His apprenticeship and his mastership of sword gave him
15  the warriors indispensable qualities.  He never learnt that
16  he would become the "Chosen" for the ultimate quest.
        
17  When he was a child, he liked to listen to the legends that
18  the wizard Athna-An was singing to him.  One of them,
19  less far fetched than the others, as it seemed to him,
20  has remained etched in his memory and unceasingly
21  tormented his thoughts.


                                  PAGE 6
   
1   He still remembered these verses:

2  "Far from Edengarfin is the castle of the Evil
3   One, far from your village, a lord keeps the
4   secret, such a powerful lord that he cannnot be
5   human, a creature floating in a world that dies
6   and grows again".


                                  PAGE 7

1   From now on, he knew that he would do anything to
2   complete the legend and he was ready to leave his wife
3   and tribe to live the greatest adventure ever lived before.
4   And this challenge, he said to himself, he would accept
5   alone, because he was the one who had been chosen.

6   The formerly respected and listened Athna-An had died
7   long time before Targhan became a grown up man. And
8   yet, sitting on his couch in the big hut of the village, he
9   saw him standing there in front of him, as before.


                                  PAGE 8

1   The words continued to flow away with a
2   supernatural harmony:

3   "And now, as others went before you, as others will go
4   after if you die, you must learn that this is your turn to
5   face the Evil, and now it's up to you, are you
6   coming back?"

                                  PAGE 10

1   As Targhan stood up, Athna-An disappeared.  Had he really
2   existed?  He, in any case, was sure of it.  He would train for the
3   last time, then he would choose a reliable man capable of
4   assuming the responsibilites of a chief during his absence.
5   Finally, he would get ready to depart, and would promise his
6   friends and his wife that he would return within a season.

7   Then he left.  Athna-An appeared to him a last time:

8   "Go to the East.  After the dense forest of Luneclare, you will
9   have to go over the mountains of Clorg.  One talks about a
10  temple which would be guarded by evil sentries.

11  Finally, if at any time you see me again, make sure that it is me
12  and kneel to me.

13  If you ever succed, come back quickly among yours with
14  the gift.

2   and get prepared for the
3   bad encounters.  I have
4   faith in you, do not
5   disappoint me".
