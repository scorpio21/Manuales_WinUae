        After inserting the program disk, you have two posibilities: press the
left mouse button get a quickly access to the game without using the supple-
mentary memory or, if you don't pree the left button of the mouse, the progra-
mm occupies the supplementary memory with a RAM disk and loads the important 
data. The second choice allows the game to flow more smoothly because the data
disk does not have to be conatantly reloaded.

        Tom is the real hero of our story. He is 7 years old with lots of ene
rgy.His father died in a car accident three years ago. His mother, Ellen, did
everything she could do to control the child, but without the 'firm' hand of
his father, this was difficult task.

        In order yo break the routine of everyday life, Ellen to make a trip in
Europe with her son. The first country they visited was Scotland, beginning 
with the great cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh and several other curiosities 
of the land. After a week had passed, our two tourists took a guided tour of a
castle in the Highlands. They went pass the old, high walls and were amused by 
the way of life in the Middle ages.

        That day, Tom, tired of the long bus trip, trailed a little behind the
tour group. Once Ellen realized that her son was no longer beside her, she re-
traced her step to look for him. While traversing a poorly-lit corrido, about
wich the eldery guide had told a terrific story,Ellen saw a gloomy form block-
ing her path. Against the dim light, she could just make the out the the silhou
ette of a man. She was about to ask him about letting her pass when a bolt of
lightning struck. She was paralysed with fear and incapable of defending her-
self yet the form moved still closer. Everything went dark...

        At this time, Tom went out runnig coz he wanted to find the group. Ima-
gine his fright when he saw his mother being kidnaped by a ghost! He ran down 
the corridor and was ready to pounce when the figure disappeared. So Tom wande-
red around tha castle, desesperatly searching for his mother.

        It had been quite a while he had been sitting in the dark corridor ho-
ping that Ellen would reappear when help unexpectedly arrived. His first fought
was that the disformed for has returned. He thought: 'He's coming to me too!'
and wanted to run when a friendly yet firm voice called him. 'Stop, young man:
Don't run away. I want to help you.' Tom turned around and looke at the form 
more closely. The man said: 'My name is Sir Arrow and i have lived for 500 
years in this fortress.' He carried a sword and his armoury was like in the 
Knight's room in the castle. 'Are you a real ghost?' asked Tom timidly. In the
spite of the terrific situation, Tom immediatly trusted Sir Arrow. What other 
choice did have? The police would not help him and no one else would believe
his story. Thus he accepted Sir Arrow's help.

        'Gosh! I cannot tell this kid that his mother's life is in danger. The
wicked sorcerer will probably sacrifice her to seal his pact with the devil. We
have only until dawn before all is lost, thought Sir Arrow. To title Tommy, he
said: 'Don't worry. Together, we will find your mother. If you do exactly as I
tell you, in a few hours you will be with her again.'

         Sir Arrow hid the gravity of the situation from the child. He was well
aware that if would not be easy to lead an adventure as dangerous as this with
a boy of Tom's age...

         Your task is to reunite Tom safe and sound with his mother.

Good luck!

				   SIR ARROW.
                                   ----------


	You are Sir Arrow and you must be triumphant in the game by using its
capacities to the fullest. You have three lives at the beginning. It is certainly po-
sible to win extra lives during the lives the game, thereby augmenting your 
chances to succeed.
Sir Arrows dies when he has no more energy. This happens when an enemy hits the
knight too often, or when Sir Arrow beats up a harmless opponent. The energy 
lost depends on the opponent.


                                     TOM.
                                     ----


-Tom's character.
 Tom has a complex character, wich he expresses in different ways but you can
influence him. Here is a description of a few typical situations:

 Tom can think that you should keep on seqrching for his mother and not occupy 
doing other things.
 If Tom got a good lunch, his enemies won't have any chances.
 The situation becomes critical. If you don't give him anything to eat or drink
in the following minute, the game will stop. Not only will the child die of
hunger, but his attitude for you will deteriorate very fast.
 Don't let Tom be insolent or he will profit from thee occasion to bother you
and even balance an empty goblet on Sir Arrow's head. 
 If he totally forget that he is in search of his mother, bring him back to his
main quest!

-How to control Tom:
 You cannot move Tom with the joystick, but he won't cause you too many pro-
blems and will follow you if you educate him and give him the necessary care.
Tom MUST stay in good condition, his physical and mental state MUST be cons-
tantly controlled and eventually improved. 
 So... Don't forget to give sum Hamburgers and sum milkshakes to eat and give
his bear to calm him after ny problems...

-What Tom hates:
 Don't give Tom too much to eat. Excitement makes him have a weak stomach, and
you will see will see the result on floor if you fill him up with Hamburgers 
and Milkshakes. Balanced meals are very important at his age.
 Tom is terrified of ghosts. If  he is not confident of himself, he will run 
and hide behind a door. Make sure that his mental state doesn't worsen to the
point where he is paralysed from fear.

Never leave Tom alone for very long. As soon as he can't see you anymore, his 
attitude changes. If ever his physical or mental states are worsened, you will
lose the game.



                                 EQUIPMENT.
                                 ----------

The Arsenal.
1) The knife is a part of the standard equipment. It is difficult to carry in
 the beggining, but has the power to fight weak enemies.
 
2) The sword is more efficient. It is not difficult to carry and has a medium 
 fighting level.
3) The war axe is very powerful, but it is useless against sum enemies.
4) Tht sledgehammer has the same inconvenience. Easy to carry with excellent 
power, but it has only a medium level of precision.
5) The crossbow is used to battle from a distance, therfore not obliging you to
approach the opponent.
6) The bow is also a weapon of distance. Its speed and force are less powerful.
7) The tears gas only works with the flying eyes.
8) The wooden stake is deadly for the vampires.
9) The green potion has magic powers, but its effects are unknown.
10) The halbers is too heavy to manage to fight but it is an important weapon.

The other objects.
To reach the end of the game there are a great number of objects wich you must
find along the way.
1) Even spirits have to drink time to time (10% of energy).
2) The red potion will give you 10% of energy.
3) By mixing those two liquids, you get an extra life.
4) The roast duck give ya 10% energy to the knight.
5) We don't know the effect of the magic harp.
6) The yellow, green, and red keys open the heavy door to the cellar.
7) The blue potion allows the knight to jump over high walls.
8) Certain places in the castle are very dark. It's smart to have a lighter.
9) Each time that you find this disk, you can save the game.
10) The whistle is easy to find. One blow, and Tom will come running.
11) Carry the ruby to the right place and the last obstacle will have been 
    overcome.
12) The key to the dungeon will allow you to escape.


				  SOME ADVICE.
				  ------------


        After helping you to get started, we will give you the first steps
towards finding the solution to the game.
        At the beginning of the game, you find Tom sitting on the ground, not
knowing what to do. Around him, scattered a few objects. Gather the food: the
milkshake and hamburger, as well as the whistle and the halbred. The moment 
that you have the whistle, pree twice on the fire button to activate the state 
line. Move the golden square to the lower, left-hand corner, on the whistle.
If you press now on the fire button, you will hear a whistle and Tom will run 
to you. If it doesn't work the first time, try again! Now give him something
to eat. To do this, go back to the state line and and place the square on an 
Hamburger or a Milkshake and press the fire button. After you have given Tom 
something to eat, the indicator of his physical condition instantly augments.
To improve his mental state, you can do the same thing with food.
        Behind the huge doors, you can find bonus objects, and clues wich will 
help to solve the riddles of the castle. Unfortunatly, an opponent is sometimes
hiden behind the doors. To open a door, place yourself infront of the lock 
and press the fire button. The first door on the level hides the loading 
option for the gathered objects. Know that sometimes, when Tom is afraid, he 
hides behind nearby doors.
        The black knight is an unpleasant creature and, who made a pact with 
the evil wizard. To beat him, you must prepare to a savage sword battle. Avoid
all of his hits and strike at the good moment. You will be able to battle 
'Blacky' at a certain area of the castle. Don't neglect this chance coz yer 
opponent is merciless.
        The fire dragon guards the magic harp wich is necessary to solve the 
the riddle of the game. His weak point is his head because it's there that you
find the petrolium glands. Before you battle him, take Tom to a safe place,
because the sight of the dragon would scare him to death. 
        Never forget that you can also combine the objects. Try all the combi-
nations that you think sensible. You can, for example, try to combine the 
lighter with the bow and arrow.
        Use the save feature during the game. If your vitale energy has run,
you can restart the game at the place where you made your last save.
