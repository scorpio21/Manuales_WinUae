Twilight’s Ransom 
Brought to you by Belgarath

BACKGROUND 

In Twilight's Ransom, you  assume  the role of Ron Mulligan, 
a hard working, honest but   unextraordinary  young graphic artist, 
employed by a” advertising agency in the fictional metropolis of 
Liberty City. Your girlfriend of several months is Maria Chavez,  a 
pretty  Salvadoran immigrant who waits tables at  Corazon’s, a 
prominent hispanic restaurant in the city. 

Recently you‘ve realized your feelings for Maria are quite 
strong. You’ve “ever been one to believe in love at first sight, but
you can’t deny you’ve been attracted to Maria from the moment 
you met her. Although you live “ear one another, you haven’t see” 
Maria in over a week. Between the both of  you  working and her 
attending evening courses at the community college, finding time 
available for dating is difficult. Thus on this particular Saturday
in September, you are especially looking forward to a night out
with Maria. 

But you arrive at Maria’s apartment   only  to find it ransacked 
and Maria kidnapped. Your job is to find Maria and  rescue  her 
from her captors. But first you must discover who has kidnapped 
her and why. You trusted Maria completely, but apparently she
was keeping secrets from you. What would a young Salvadoran 
waitress have that somebody would want badly enough to kidnap 
her? You  must  piece together subtle clues to track down the an- 
swers to this question. Once you learn who kidnapped Maria and
why, you must discover where she is being held and devise a   res- 
cue plan. 

Complicating these formidable challenges are the dangers 
lurking on the shadowy streets of Liberty City. According to 
Liberty Mayor Joseph K.  Delvane, the city is undergoing a” un- 
precedented economic and social renaissance. He may be right 
during the day, when the city, with its well groomed parks, clean 
streets and friendly people is a pleasant place to live. But when 
the sun sets, the shadows release a collection of freaks, oddballs 
and outcasts that would make a circus side show jealous. Walking 
the streets of Liberty alone at night causes eve” the most fearless 
man to look over his shoulder.  Twilight’s Ransom  occurs in  Mid- 
Town Liberty City, where all the varied neighborhoods and dis- 
tricts meet in the immediate radius of the Tempest River. 

Can you save the life of the woman you love? You have 12 
hours to find out. 


MOVEMENT AND MAPPING

To  move  through Liberty City, you must type the directions you 
wish to   move in: NORTH, NORTHWEST, NORTHEAST, 
SOUTH, SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, EAST, WEST, UP and 
DOWN. You can abbreviate directions to N, NW, NE,   S, SW, SE, 
E, W, U, D. If something in the game blocks your progress in a 
given direction, Twilight’s Ransom will explain the obstacle and 
ask you to enter a different command. 

Twilight’s Ransom requires a level of mapping in excess of the 
average adventure game, due to the size of the “playing area” and
the number of locations.
You will need to map both the city blocks, noting street names
and landmarks,  as well as the interiors of buildings. As you walk 
the streets of the city,   Twilight's   Ransom selects from the sprawl- 
ing city landscape those locations which may be helpful in solving
the mystery. A sample of movement and mapping as it could oc- 
cur in Twilight’s   Ransom appears below. 

> YOU ARE ON THE CORNER OF MAIN STREET 
WHICH EXTENDS EAST AND WEST AND GARRET
STREET RUNNING NORTH AND SOUTH. 

>E 

YOU ARE ON MAIN STREET WHICH EXTENDS EAST
AND WEST. TO THE NORTH IS FRANKY’S TAVERN, A
MODEST SALOON OCCUPYING THE GROUND
FLOOR OF AN AGING STONE FRONTED BUILDING.
FRANKY’S HAS NO WINDOWS, EXCEPT FOR TWO
SMALL TINTED WINDOWS IN THE FRONT DOOR.
THE IMPOSING FACADE OF THE SECOND NA-
TIONAL BANK OCCUPIES THE SOUTH. 

To enter  a location from the street simply type the direction the 
location occupies relative to your position. To enter the bank you 
would type: 

>S 

> THE MONOLITHIC GRAY FACADE OF THE   2ND 
NATIONAL BANK BROODS LIKE A MONSTROUS
TOMB. THROUGH A WINDOW YOU SEE THE DARK-
ENED BANK OFFICES, CLOSED FOR THE EVENING. 

>S 

THE BANK IS CLOSED. 

>N 

YOU ARE ON MAIN STREET. 

>N 

YOU ARE IN FRANKY’S TAVERN, A SMALL SMOKE
FILLED ROOM, WITH ALUMINUM FRAMED TABLES
AND CHAIRS ARRANGED OPPOSITE A BAR EXTEND-
ING ALONG THE EAST WALL. A GROUP OF MIDDLE
AGED MEN SIT AT THE BAR, MANY WEARING  BALL- 
CAPS AND JACKETS EMBLAZONED WITH THE 
LOGOS OF THE LIBERTY CITY COMPANIES THEY
WORK FOR. A DOOR TO THE SOUTH LEADS TO 
MAIN STREET. 

If the bar had been closed, the response would have read: 

YOU ARE IN FRONT OF FRANKY’S TAVERN. THE BAR 
IS CLOSED FOR THE EVENING. MAIN STREET LIES
TO THE SOUTH. 

COMMANDS 

The following points will be helpful in entering commands in 
Twilight’s  Ransom. 

- Twilight's  Ransom recognizes the   first  six letters of every word. 
  Thus words whose first six characters are identical will be inter-
  preted the same. 

- You can use  the articles THE, A, AN. 

- You must strike the ENTER or RETURN key for  Twilight’s 
  Ransom    act on your   command. 

- A verb can have   more  than one object. Example: 

  > TAKE THE WATCH AND THE KEYS 
  
  > DROP THE SCARF AND GLOVES 

- You can enter   more  than one sentence per command, provided 
  you separate the sentences with a period or the word THEN. 

  > BREAK THE WINDOW WITH THE BRICK. TAKE THE 
  WATCH, THEN CLIMB UP THE FIRE ESCAPE. 

- Twilight’s  Ransom   interprets both upper and lower case letters 
  in the   same  fashion. 

- If Twilight’s Ransom  can’t understand your command  or you 
  aren’t specific enough, it will ask you for   more  information. 

- For convenience and increased playability, Twilight’s  Ransom 
  allows you to edit a typed line before you press  the ENTER or 
  RETURN button. If you type > DRAT THE KEYS IN THE 
  HALLWAY, you can correct the line to read DROP THE KEYS 
  IN THE HALLWAY before pressing the ENTER or RETURN
  key. (This feature may vary, depending on the version of 
  Twilight’s  Ransom you own. Consult your user’s card for  ver- 
  sion specific information.) 

- The word “all” refers to  every  visible object. Typing  > TAKE 
  ALL would result in your taking   every  visible object from your 
  present location. 

- Twilight’s Ransom   will recognize the pronoun “it.” Example: 

  > TAKE THE ROCK THEN THROW IT THROUGH THE 
    WINDOW.

scription of the location upon your first entering the area and will 
subsequently only name the location. Enter the LOOK command 
if you require a full description. Twilight’s Ransom  operates in

you at the beginning of a new game.

allows a turn to pass without your taking any action.

you may encounter with the game, please include the version
number. If for some reason you cannot run the program, you can

HELPFUL TIPS

1) Make a map. Mapping is critically important in Twilight’s
Ransom because as the game progresses you will need to be
aware of your relative position in the city. You should sketch
both the city blocks and location interiors.

2) Examine all objects and locations carefully.

3) Read the descriptions carefully, since they contain clues necessary
for solving the mystery.

4) Save the game frequently. If you get “killed” during the game
you can return to the identical location rather than start from
the beginning.
