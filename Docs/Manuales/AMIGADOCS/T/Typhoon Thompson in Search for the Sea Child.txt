It was a warm day in February 2124 when the small intergalactic passenger transport known as Flight 396 was lost. Its last known position: the uncharted ocean planet of Aguar in Omega sector. When last heard from it was plunging headlong into the sparkling tropical seas of the remote and hostile planet. Survivors? Highly unlikely.

And yet...a faint signal persists.

But that was already two months ago. Since then, three search parties from Earth have met their doom at the hands of the Sea Sprites that live in Aguar's island clusters. But as long as we receive that feeble signal we suspect that one human child has survived, doubtless adopted by the wily Sprites.

Now, the job is yours, Typhoon Thompson. You must outwit the swarms of cunning Sea Sprites. Outfight the bizarre Flyer-Machine technology they use. And outlast their tenacious love for the tiny child they have hidden away.

Spirit Guardians from the planet Aguar's long-dead civilization will help you. But you must expertly pilot your Jet-Sled rescue craft and defeat the ingenious Sea Sprite defenses to prove yourself worthy. You must bring the Spirit Guardians the tools you will need to rescue the baby from the impenetrable observatory dome where the Sprites have hidden it. Only then can you rescue the baby and return to Earth with this sole survivor of an ill-fated voyage.

You insisted you wanted another chance to prove your mettle. You've got it friend. Don't blow it. The life of a tiny child is at stake. Not to mention your own.

CONTROLS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maneuvering:

The mouse controls your Jet-Sled's movements and shoots the weapons given to you by the Spirit Guardians. The high-powered craft responds very quickly to the slightest movements of the mouse. Try it out, without using the button controls, to get the feel of it. The Jet-Sled will lean and move with a very fluid motion in whatever direction you move the mouse.

The right mouse button controls the Jet-Sled's thrusters. The thrusters are used to increase your speed or make the Jet-Sled dive into the sea. Using the thruster while the Jet-Sled is leaning to one side will cause it to turn around in a circle in the direction of the lean.

To dive, move the mouse forward as you press the thruster. You can move around under water the same way you can above. To resurface, pull back on the mouse with the thruster jets on, or just press the left-hand button to pop up.

Shooting:

You have unlimited ammunition, but use it carefully: stray shots may draw the attention of additional Flyers. The range of the shots can be controlled by tilting the sled with a forward or backward movement of the mouse. You will always have a Laser Cannon available to you as well as one additional weapon granted on each mission. Weapons fire as follows:

Weapon:               How To Fire:                What It Does:

Laser Cannon          Press left button.          Destroys Flyers and dumps                                                   Sprites into water.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROL PANEL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


At the bottom of the screen you will see the Jet-Sled's control panel. From left to right the indicators are:

Life Meter      indicates how many extra lives you have. (Maximum of 5.)

Sled Meter      indicates how any Jet-Sleds remain for your use. No sled, no                 mission. (You get 4 to start.)

Finder          helps you find the correct heading for your Jet-Sled. When                 you see the white cross at the center, your objective, either                 the Sprite Island or the Spirit Guardians, lies straight                 ahead. The Spirit Guardians set the Jet-Sled's directional                 heading before each part of your mission. The Finder arrows                 tell you in which direction to turn if you have drifted off                 course.

Objective       shows the current mission objective- the artifact you're                 seeking or, in the final stage, the baby itself.

Islands         indicates the number of islands from which you have captured Won             all of the resident Sea Sprites. The light that glimmers over                 each island (within the current island village) will be                 extinguished whenever the island is vacant.

Sprites         tallies the number of Sprites captured from the current Captured        island village.

Clock           shows elapsed time in your adventure.

THE GAME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting Your Adventure:

You start the game at the Home Islands where the Spirit Guardians dwell. From the Spirits you receive one extra life, three extra Jet-Sleds (from the previous rescue teams), and the instructions to retrieve a magical artifact- one of four you will need to complete your mission. Each of these items is held within a white Treasury Dome located at the center of the island village somewhere across the dancing seas. Follow your finder and be ready for action!

Fighting the Flyers for the Dagger:

You must defeat all the Flyers the Sea Sprites use to defend the white Treasury Dome and then capture all the Sprites before you can retrieve the item you seek. Force the flyers from their island hiding places with a shot from your Laser Cannon or a bump from your Jet-Sled. To eliminate the Flyers, destroy them with your laser cannon.

When the stunned Sprite drops into the water, swoop by to scoop him up in your sack (a close  swoop will do the trick). If you wait too long, the Sprite will revive, swim back to his island and come after you with another Flyer. But before he gets there, as he dives dolphin-like through the waves, you can have a second chance to capture him. Just stun him again with your Laser-Cannon, speed by, and scoop him up. When you've collected the Sprites from all seven islands within a village, maneuver your craft to one of the glimmering lights that will appear by the Treasury Dome and you'll receive the item you seek in exchange for your captured Sprites.

Returning with the Dagger:

Head back to the isles of the Spirit Guardians. Your finder will lock onto them- just follow its guide.

When you arrive, maneuver your Jet-Sled onto the glimmer that shines between the Spirits to return the Dagger and obtain your next mission.

Advanced Missions: 

Advanced missions are no kids' stuff. Each adventure at a new island village presents new and more difficult challenges- deadly Flyers swarming at you in ever greater numbers, flown by an increasing number of Sprites. For each more difficult mission (except the last), the Spirit Guardians will arm you with additional, more powerful weapons to defeat the Flyers and capture the elusive Sprites.

You'll have to master each new weapon as you get it and you'll need them all to succeed.

Rescuing the Child:

At last success is in sight! Once you've retrieved all four artifacts, you have only to find and rescue the child. The Spirit Guardians will be a great help in this final endeavor.

DESCRIPTION OF FLYERS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to demo mode of game to display pictures and descriptions of each of the Sprites' Flyers and their modes of attack.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY NOTES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To catch your breath while under attack, dive under water where most Flyers cannot sense or harm you. And remember that your Sprite Magnets and Freeze Bombs can be fired under water.

On the upper levels of play, 2 or 3 Sprites will fall from each Flyer you destroy. Each Sprite that makes it back to its island will emerge in a new Flyer; thus, you could wind up battling larger and larger swarms of the Flyers.

If you get lost at any point in the game, try to recenter the white cross on your navigational Finder. Use your thrusters to jet in the direction the arrows on your finder point until the white cross appears in the center. Then fly straight ahead until you arrive at your destination.
