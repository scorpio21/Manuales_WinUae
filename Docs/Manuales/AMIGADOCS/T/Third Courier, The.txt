                             THE THIRD COURIER

                             Mission Overview:



Moondancer:

Your assignment is vital.  Three couriers headed to a top-secret conference
in Brussels are missing.  Each was carrying a crucial component of the NATO
non-nuclear defense plans.  Now two are dead and the third - last seen in
Berlin - has vanished.  You must find the three critical components (a
computer chip, a floppy disk, and a CPU) before the NATO meeting - and
before they fall into the wrong hands.

You know what's at stake.  This time it isn't surveillance.  It isn't a
drop.  Or data farming.  This is the majors, and you've just been called
up.  And there's only one rule in this game: don't trust anyone.

Fly to Berlin and and (THATS THE WAY THE MANUAL READS) await further
instructions.  Outside of occasional electronic contact, you're on your
own.  But then, you've always liked it that way.

THE THIRD COURIER

                         How To Create Your Agent

There's a small mater regarding your cover.  Field Operatives are allowed
to select their own now.  After hiring a few Human Resource Psychologists
the Company was convinced morale would improve if you had a hand in
selecting your new profile.

                            Create Your Profile

You can have up to four different agents on file at any one time.
To create a new agent identity:

1.  Position the cursor on CREATE AGENT and press the button (or press C).
2.  Type in the name you want to use for your new identity.
    (up to 23 characters)
3.  Press Enter.

The folder will open to display and Electronic Dossier for you to complete.

                      Complete an Electronic Dossier

The fist page of the dossier is mandatory.  Think of it as your social
security number.  You choices determine your agent's ability.

1.  Use the mouse, joystick or cursor keys to select and option from each
    background area (sex, occupation, etc.).  If you are using the
    keyboard, the tab key will move you from one selection group to the
    next.

2.  Click on NEXT PAGE (or press N) to continue when you've completed the
    first page.

                              Character Traits

On Page two of the dossier, you are assigned Character Traits based on the
information you provided on page one of the dossier.  The numerical values
beside Character Traits are indicators of your particular abilities
relative to the best agents of all time.  (The scale runs from 0 to 99, the
highest number being the best, 0 the worst.)

                            Personality Traits

These are additional characteristics that affect you character's abilities.
As you gain more experience, more of your character's idiosyncrasies will
be revealed to you.  You will learn one more positive and one more negative
aspect of your character's personality with each level you gain.

Experience Points

Experience points are gained by playing the game.  You gain points by
exploring, encountering other characters, finding objects and by solving
problems.  Promotions are based on you accumulated experience.

Grade Level

Indicates you progress.  No matter how good you may be now,  everyone
starts out as Sleuth.  As you advance (gain experience points), you
graduate to higher levels: AGENT, RESIDENT AGENT, SPY, and finally, MASTER
SPY.  You attain these levels based on the following experience points:

			Agent			25,000

			Resident Agent          40,000

			Spy			60,000

			Master Spy              75,000


                          How To Change Your Mind

If you're satisfied with your character, you have two choices:

1.  Select ACTIVATE and start the game.

2.  Click on DONE or press D and return to the Agent Selection Screen.

However, unlike life, if you don't like you character profile you can start
over again.  Just click on PREV PAGE (or press P) and fill in the dossier
with new information.

                         How to Activate an Agent

After you create an identity (you can create up to 4), you can activate it
at will from the agent file disks:

1.  Click on SELECT AGENT (or press S), then click on (or use the arrow
    keys to move the cursor to) one of the four file disks.

2.  Click on ACTIVE AGENT (or press A). You will begin in your apartment or
    wherever you last save the game.

                         How to Terminate an Agent

If you wish to create a fifth identity, you must first "retire" one of your
other agents.

1.  Click on SELECT AGENT (or press S)

2.  Choose one of the four file disks by clicking on it or moving the
    cursor to it and pressing ENTER.

3.  Click on Terminate Agent (or press T).  You will be asked if your want
    to delete this agent.  Press Y or N.  If you terminate, he's gone.

4.  Go back and create a new agent as you did in Create Your Profile.

                       How to Review an Agent's File

Allows you to review the dossier and current statistics of any your saved
agents.

1.  Click on SELECT AGENT or press S.

2.  Choose one of the four files disks by clicking on it or moving the
    cursor to it and pressing return.

3.  Click on REVIEW FILE (or press R).  You will be taken to the second
    page of the dossier.  When finished reviewing the file, click on DONE
    (or press D) and you will return to the Agent Select Screen.

                           How to Quit the Game

To return to DOS, follow these steps:

1.  Click on QUIT GAME (or press Q).  You will be asked if you want to save
    the current status of your agent.

2.  Select Y, N, or ESC (Esc returns you to the menu).  Selecting Y saves
    your agent's status and returns you to DOS.  Selecting N does not save
    your agent's status and returns you to DOS.

                                Keystrokes

In The Third Courier, you can use a mouse, joystick or keyboard to control
your movements.

If you are using the keyboard, simply press the appropriate key for the
desired action.  With a mouse or joystick, highlight the desired option and
press the mouse button or fire button.

The directional movement works as follows: Select a direction, such as
North.  You will now be facing north.  To continue moving north, continue to
click on North or press N on the keyboard.  In other words, the first
selection turns you in that direction, the second moves you in that
direction.  NOTE: If using a mouse or joystick notice that the direction
you are facing will rotate to the top of the on-screen compass.

                             Welcome To Berlin

You'll be staying at a Knesebeck Strasse apartment building where most CIA
people stay.  If you venture beyound the Berlin Wall, prepare yourself for
a trip into the past.  Where West Berlin is alive with technicolor
brilliance and sparkle, East Berlin still has the look of a forty-year-old
black and white WWII movie.  Nothing has changed.  It has only aged.
Little reconstruction, no modern services.  The trains still carry wooden
seats, the cars with their two-piston engines sound like noisy motorcycles,
and the air is thick with the smell of cheap, burnt motor oil.  A cloud of
despair hangs over the city, making the shadows grayer and the faces
longer.

                  How to Negotiate the Main Action Screen

Your apartment is the first place you'll see in Berlin.  We trust you'll
find it comfortable- and quite secure.  Your apartment is furnished with a
computer and an answering machine.  The computer is the only way The
Company can contact you.

to the building represented by the icon.  The building may or may not be
open to you.  Remember that most businesses have set hours.  Most in West
Berlin open about 6 a.m.

Character Information Display Unit (C.I.D.)

The C.I.D. Unit on the right of the screen has multiple functions.  You
will use this handy device to access special menus, keep track of your

                         Dynamic Character Traits

Your character's traits reflect the choices you made on the dossier.  They
are represented as bar graphs on the C.I.D> Unit.  Each graph fluctuates as
you move, have encounters and gain experience.  Watch these stats as you
play.  They affect how well your character can react to different
situations.

* Intelligence: It is affected by your experience, solving problems and
  your health.

* Strength: Increases due to successful combat and decreases based on the
  amount of damage your character has taken.  Health also affects your
  strength.

* Knowledge: Increases as you uncover facts and gain proficiency with new
  items and weapons.

* Intuition: Changes as a result of encounters with other characters.

* Health: A big factor in strength, hence in your ability to fight.  Thus,
  if your health is low you might want to flee a possible attacker instead
  of standing your ground.  You might even want to get yourself to the
  doctor at Mission Support.

                                  Levels

The digital readout provides you with time of day (represented in military
time) Many places in the city open at 0600 hours and close at 1800 hours.

Chat		A good way to get information; chat with everyone unless,
 		of course, they're ready to swing an ax in your direction.

Run		If your health or strength is down, you might want to let
                your feet do their stuff.  A word of warning, however.
		When you run, you have no control over where you go.  You
  		are dropped randomly in the city.

Fight		Combat goes in rounds between you and the other guy.  The
		outcome will be determined by your strengths and weapons
		and strengths and weapons.  You can be wounded in combat,
		which will affect some of your character traits.  During
		combat you may arm or change weapons by opening the Action
		menu and selecting ARM.

		Your inventory menu then opens so you can select the weapon
		you wish to be armed with.  Combat continues until one of
		you is defeated or one of you runs.  If you win, you can
		now search your opponent.  If you lose you are
		Terminated... dead.  But if you open the ACTION menu and
		select RESTORE, Moondancer is returned to the last "saved"
		position.  So it may be prudent to save the game often.

		fight, some will call police, and some will call you names.

Search		If you happen to eliminate an opponent, be sure to frisk

                          Field Operations Begin

To begin your assignment you'll want to USE some equipment in your
apartment.  Try logging onto your computer or using your answering machine.
Remember, aside from the contacts you make on the street and in the shops,
these two machines will be your only sources of information.  Check them
periodically.

                            Know Your Password

You'll need to enter a passcode when you LOG ON to your Computer for the
first time each game session.  To decipher the password:

1. USE A CRACKED COPY!!

Once in the computer you can check your MAIL and the dossiers of important
people with whom you will deal throughout your mission.  The dossier list
is dynamic and new names will be added as you meet these people and make
use of your PHOTO-FAX.  Only people Langley has a dossier on will show up
in this list, which can be found under NAME CHECK.  When you're finished
using the computer, click LOG OFF.

                            Denizens of Berlin

Our intelligence has told us that there are come contacts and informants in
Berlin who will be helpful to you during the mission.  However, specific
information as to their identities died with the two couriers.  Don't
forget to use your PHOTO-FAX - Langley most likely has Dossiers on some of
those people.

We also know thats as in many large cities, there is a flourishing black
market.  Usually, these operations are fronted by normal-looking
businesses.  Check out the local merchants.  Maybe you'll locate some
sources for specialized items.

Due to the nature of this particular situation, we have reason to believe
that counter-espionage activity will be very heavy in Berlin.  Watch your
back.

And watch your front.  Reports from the field indicates that the streets of
the city have become more dangerous, especially at night.  Good luck,
Moondancer, we'll support you in the mission however we can.  But as
always, you are alone out there and will have only your quick wits and
clever ways to see through.

poison, these can be antidotes.

Tools
=====

LOCK PICKS: Come on, you've supposed to be a super agent.

FLASHLIGHTS: Used in dark places, like underneath buildings, so that you
can see the vermin you're sliming around with.

                     BERLIN TOUR GUIDE FOR NON-GERMANS

Whenever visiting a new city, it's always a good idea to bring along a good
guide book.  It increases the pleasure of your wanderings and you never
know what interesting nuggets of information you might pick up.  Here's a
brief description of some of Berlin's notable districts.

West Germany
============

THE PARK DISTRICT: To the south and east lies the great Berlin park, a
place of scenery, beauty, and enchantment.  For centuries, lovers have
strolled hand in hand through these woods, enthralled by their pastoral
beauty.  Many forms of entertainment abound herein and, of course, public
restrooms are provided.

THE PALACE DISTRICT: North and east is the home of the famous
Charlottenburg Palace, the largest mansion in Berlin and bastion of German
culture.  Surrounding the palace are some of the finest restaurants and
bars Berlin has to offer.  Be sure to sample the beer.

THE TEMPLEHOFF DISTRICT: Smack in the center of Berlin lies the Templehoff
business district, home of Berlin's thriving international trade community.
Experience the hustle and bustle of truly dynamic economy at work, and
perhaps see the city from a new perspective - high atop the Templehoff
building itself.

THE DAIRY DISTRICT: The mere mention of Germany immediately conjures up
images of good food.  Beer, pretzels, and of course, wurst are as German as
bagpipes are Scottish.  This south western district is the home of these
rural delights.  These merchants, known for their biting wit and rural
wisdom, are always glad to exchange pleasantries with foreign travelers.

THE INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT: What city could survive without the working man?
Berlin is no exception.  North and west lies the home of the proletariat
and his pleasures.  Here you will be staying in some of the most affordable
housing in all of Europe.

EAST GERMANY
============

MARX ENGLES PLAZA: Wide open space and open air cafe's mark this plaza, the
largest in East Germany.  Here, it is said, old friends may meet and
relive happier times.

CULTURAL DISTRICT: Traveling east from the plaza along Unter den Linden,
one encounters the home of German culture.  If one is careful, one might
almost be able to see the spirits of such German immortals as Beethoven,
Mozart and Wagner as their music drifts out from the opera house.

GOVERNMENT DISTRICT: Between Friedrichstrasse and Otto Grotewohl along
Unter den Linden sits the center of international government in East
Berlin.  Travelers who encounter troubles may wish to consult their
embassy, located along this stretch of road.

BRANDENBURG GATE: Of all of the beauties of Germany, one of the greatest
must be the gates of Brandenburg, the inspiration for Bach's immortal
Brandenburg concerti.  It was once said of these gates: "If I could choose,
from all of lifes pleasures, my last sight, it would be of the gates at
Brandenburg."
