The wildlife is dangerous, dizzy looks good enough to eat...
The old chest makes a good step in the right place...

The are two ways to complete the game..
SOLUTION 1 - Tricky, find a way off the island and back to the yolkfolk
SOLUTION 2 - Very tricky, there are THIRTY pieces of gold hidden on the
island,find these before making your escape... some of them are VERY well
hidden!

GOOD LUCK

Dizzy was looking forward to the round-the-world cruise. When he told the
other yolkfolk about the good deal he found, they wondered just what lay
ahead of him...
Dizzy enjoyed the cruise at first. The captain, Long John Silver, was
a lovely old bloke with a kindly manner, good at insulting and degrading the
fare paying punters. He was well balanced - he had parrot on one shoulder
and a chip on the other.
Dizzy thought he would organize a game of cricket on the aft deck. In a fit
of blinding stupidity he used LJ's spare leg collection as makeshift stumps,
and when they were lost overboard he was made to walk the plank! That was how
he came to find himself gently poaching on the silent, sun-kissed beach of a
seemingly deserted island... He had to somehow find a way back to the yolkfolk
and lodge his compensation claim with the travel agent...
