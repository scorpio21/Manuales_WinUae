GRASSLAND / DESERT / SNOW / LUNAR

when you enter the theatre of death your operations will commence in the
grasslands. you will notice a number of flags on the terrain, each flag
represents an individual mission but is coloured coded to make your
progress across the terrain more straegically based and therefore more
ordered (in accordance with maxim 472 pp569 para A C4 which states watch
your back or the enemy will attack)

WHITE FLAG.....the mission is currently available
RED FLAG.......mission is not yet available-will become available in future
BLUE FLAG......mission has been completed

each terrain comprises of 15 individual missions,however at any one
time,only 3 will be available(3 white flags displayed) click on a flag to
select that mission and to enter the mission briefin,when a mission has
been completed,one red flag will become white and the previous mission flag 
will become BLUE,after completing 10 missions on a single terrain area,you
will then be allowed to enter the RESTRICTED zone of the def Com Sim - THE
LUNAR LEVELS! -
once a mission has been briefed,it may be selected by clicking the left
mouse button at the bottom left hand side of the screen,the mission may be
aborted prior to its commencement and a new mission chosen by clicking the
left mouse button at the bottom right hand side of the screen.

CONTROL SYSTEM
--------------
In accordance with the sim control device GL1000(K1) the human/simulator
interface has been developed to offer the optimum level of control over the

location - all buildings and troops present will be targeted,WITHOUT
DISCRIMINATION.

optimum effectiveness. to issue a command to a platoon,it must be
highlighted on the map screen.

Attack.....once the platoon has reached its destination,each member of the
unit will hunt down and engage the nearest enenmy.

Defend.....once the location is reached the platoon will remain stationary
and only fire upon enemies that come within firing range.

rather than engaging in combat. this option is not...I repeat NOT an option
our cadets are expected to use regularly.
