 INTRODUCTION:

 Deep within her subterranean fortress the evil Madame Q has launched a new
and dastardly plan-to build an army genetic mutants to take over the world!

 You have been dispatched to infiltrate her defenses and thwart her insane
Plans.

 Along the way you will encounter her guards both on land and underwater 
lizard women and half human cyborgs patrol her island defenses, while 
cybernetic sharks infest the surrounding waters.  Use the weapons provided 
wisely and remember to pick up the weapons dropped by her guards.  Reports 
of giant armoured sharks and unconfirmed, but watch out!

 GENERAL:

 Thunderjaws is divided into two main Sections - underwater and inside 
Madame Q's various Bases.  You must infiltrate each base in turn through
underwater entrances and, once inside, make your way to the control room
Choose either one or two player mode, but remember Madame Q will dispatch 
more guards if there are two of you.  Each control room is guarded by a 
boss monster who is very difficult to destroy, so collect extra weapons 
before taking these guyz on!
