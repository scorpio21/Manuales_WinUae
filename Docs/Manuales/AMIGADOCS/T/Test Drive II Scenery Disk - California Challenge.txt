                             CALIFORNIA CHALLENGE
                          TEST DRIVE II SCENERY DISK

                                  THE MANUAL

This promises to be among the shortest product manuals in the history of
entertainment software. In fact, it has but one instruction.

1   To find out how to install CALIFORNIA CHALLENGE into THE DUEL: TEST
    DRIVE II, see your Test Drive II manual. Pay most attention to the
    section called HOW TO USE THE INSTALL OPTION.

That's it. That's all. But what about all the space left on this paper? In
the interest of competition, we're going to fill it with a description of
each roadscape along the seven legs of C.C.

The California/Oregon Border to the Trees of Mystery - The sign says
"Welcome TO California" - but don't plan on a long stay. The race begins
at the border and immediately catapults you down a twisting redwood
highway.

Trees of Mystery to Eureka - Hold tight. The roads are as gnarled as the
trees. Handling is at a premium. The lush forest and oceanscape may be
beautiful but one errant glance could pile you head-on into a logging
truck.

Eureka to Rockport - Prepare to climb. This stretch starts off like an
elevator ride - then the bottom drops out. Definitely not for the faint of
heart. Best to keep one eye on the road and one eye on the elevation
markers.

Rockport to San Francisco - No stopping for souvenirs in the small coastal
towns. Time to make your move. Blast down 101, through the tunnel near Mill
Valley, then feast your eyes on the famous Golden Gate Bridge and city
skyline.

San Francisco to Carmel - Grab your sourdough to-go and step on it.
Infamous Devil's Slide takes no prisoners and the heavy traffic makes even
the locals sweat. Shoot past Santa Cruz and wind your way down the
Monterey peninsula.

Carmel to Santa Barbara - The view from the vistas is postcard perfect.
Trek through the towering redwoods of Big Sur, then zip by a lighthouse
off the Santa Barbara coast. No time for California Dreamin'. The
snakelike curves, narrow bridges and undulating roadway demand full
attention.

Santa Barbara to Mexico - What makes the Beach Boys sing? Take a gander out
your window. Sunny Santa Monica, Del Mar and La Jolla beach. Wave adios
to the palm trees, weave down that L.A. freeway and make a run for the
border.

Important Note #1: The mileages used in California Challenge are not the
actual number of miles from Oregon to Mexico. They are "scale" miles that
represent the exact distance.

Important Note #2: After you boot up the Master Disk for The Duel: Test
Drive II, and you want to use the Scenery Disk, you must assign the
Scenery Disk to a drive. You will then be instructed to insert your
Scenery Disk into the assigned drive. At that time, a serial number is
assigned to that disk. Once that number is assigned, Play Disks can be
created with that Scenery Disk only with the Master Disk that was in use
when the serial number was assigned.
