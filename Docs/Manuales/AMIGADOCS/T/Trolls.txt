IMAGINE A VILLAGE NEITHER HERE OR THERE,NOR IN ANY PARTICULAR TIME,IN FACT
IT COULD BE RIGHT IN BETWEEN!. THINK OF BIRDS FLYING THROUGH GOLDEN
CLOUDS,FAR OVER THE MOUNTAINS, AND THE FLAKES OF SNOW TWISTING AND TURNING
DOWN ONTO THE BRILLIANT WHITE LANDSCAPE. THERE`S A WATERFALL IN THE
DISTANCE WITH STRANGE SHAPES AND VISIONS RIDING ON THE ARCS OF A
RAINBOW.LIGHT EMERGING FROM ITS WASH,REFLECTED ON A TIMELESS RIVER,FLOWING
BENEATH THE SHEETS OF ICE.

A LONELY COTTAGE STANDS QUIETLY,ITS STEPS WORN BY THE FEET OF MANY
PEOPLE,OLD-YOUNG AND POOR. A SIGN ABOVE THE WINDOW READS `TOYS` IN LARGE
GREEN LETTERS. SNOW FALLS FROM THE BRANCH OF A NEARBY TREE AND THUMPS TO
THE GROUND. MAKING A LARGE HOLE IN THE DRIFT.

INSIDE THE TOYMAKER ARISES,CAREFULLY PUTTING HIS TOOLS IN THEIR RIGHTFUL
PLACES WHILST WIPING THE SHAVINGS OF WOOD FROM HIS CLOAK. AFTER LIGHTING
HIS CANDLE HE PUTS ON HIS NIGHTCAP AND STARES AT THE CLOCK ABOVE THE
MANTLEPIECE. AS THE FLICKERING FLAMES CREATE STRANGE VISIONS AROUND THE
ROOM, HE YAWNS AND BEGINS YET ANOTHER JOURNEY TO BED.
THE WORKSHOP IS LITTERED WITH BOXES FULL OF ALL KINDS OF TOYS -
SOLDIERS,CARS,WOODEN TOPS,DOLLS,TEDDY BEARS. SHELVES ARE STACKED HIGH WITH
AEROPLANES,BALLS,ROBOTS AND OH YES! A TROLL, A SMALL WOODEN TROLL EXCHANGED
BY A YOUNG BOY FOR A SPINNING TOP.

THE CLOCK STRIKES 12...THE CHIMES ECHO AROUND THE DUSTY OLD COTTAGE. A TOY
SOLDIERS KEY BEGINS WHIRRING IN HIS BACK,SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO
THE TROLL WHO`S ALONE ON THE SHELF...AND HE SEEMS TO KNOW.
SUDDENLY THE SNOW STOPS FALLING,THE CLOCK WHICH HAS CEASELESSLY TICKED
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS ABRUPTLY GRINDS TO A HALT.
NOT A SOUND CAN BE HEARD,NOT EVEN A MOUSES HEARTBEAT. BUT WAIT, THERE IS A
STRANGE CREAKING NOISE. THE TROLLS EYES OPEN,HE TAKES HIS FIRST BREATH OF
AIR AND BURSTS INTO LIFE,RUNNING ALONG THE SHELF WHERE HE HAS SAT
MOTIONLESS FOR ALL THESE YEARS.

A MAGICAL ROOM HAS APPEARED,WITH MNAY STRANGE DOORS,SURELY THIS IS AN
INVITATION TO A GREAT ADVENTURE. THOUGHTS FLASH THROUGH HIS MIND, WHY IS
THIS HAPPENING? WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO IN THESE NEW WORLDS?.....A VOICE
ANSWERS, `YOU WILL BECOME A HERO TONIGHT LITTLE TROLL,YOU MUST FIND THE
LOST BABIES AND RETRUN THEM HOME SAFELY. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FLY,SWIM AND
SWING WITH A MAGICAL YO-YO, POPPING BALLOONS ALONG THE WAY`
SOUNDS STRANGE DOESNT IT?..WELL REALLY THIS IS GOING TO BE A MAGICAL NIGHT
OF ADVENTURES AND FUN,AFTER ALL....EVERYONE HAS TO BE A HERO ONCE IN THEIR
LIFE,DONT THEY?..
