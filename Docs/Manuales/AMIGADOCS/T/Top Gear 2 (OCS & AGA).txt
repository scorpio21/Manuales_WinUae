2.Plug in your Joystick(s)
3.Turn on your computer and monitor.  The game will now load automatically/
Follow any on-screen loading instructions.


INSTALLING TOP GEAR 2 ONTO AN AMIGA HARD DISK (1200 and 500/600)
----------------------------------------------------------------

3.Click on the disk 2 icon.  A window will open with an Install Top Gear 2
icon, click on the icon.
4.The install program will now load.

your hard drive.


HARD DRIVE TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------------

If after clicking on the Top Gear 2 icon, an Iconx window opens with the
message "Top Gear 2: Not enough memory available" ; then reset the machine.
Hold both mouse buttons down, you will then boot into the Amiga Early
Startup Control Panel.  Select Boot with No Start Up Sequence.  Your
machine will now boot into the CLI shell.  Once this has happened you will
see a blank screnn with a prompt (1>).

1) Type "cd games:" (or the name of the drive the game is installed into,
e.g. "cd dh0:" or "cd games:")
2) Press return
3) Type "Topgear2" or if you have renamed the directory yourself, type that
name
4) Press return
5) type "Topgear2.exe"
6) Press return.

The above problem is caused by not having enough free "graphic memory" if
you follow the above procedure each time you play Top Gear 2 the problem
should be rectified.  Having several windows open at the same time will use
up your machines memory.  To avoid this problem keep the number of windows
open at one time down to a minimum, also ensure any external devices such
as printers are disconnected.
