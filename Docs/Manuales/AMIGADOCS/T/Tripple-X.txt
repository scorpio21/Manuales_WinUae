    At last Mankind's dream to travel through time has been realizied. The
sphere you are to travel in may appear small but, like some "Tardis" it's a
technical marvel capable of traversing time and space to escape to new
dimensions of reality and hopefully to return once again to this mundane
world.
    Five magnificent epochs, seperated by thousands of years, each still
veiled in mystery are now made accessible to you, by the ingenious pro-
gramming of the "Possibility Processor" (PosProz), technological breakthroug.
    Onwards to the very limits of time, future Utopias where all is possible
are now open to you, including the many treasures that are your's for the
taking, and then to escape any reprisal by disappearing once more through the
time warp. Back, back to forgotten cultures and civilizations to the tombs
and catacombs of ancient Egypt, the mysterious statutes of Easer Island and
then down, down to the very dungeons of the dark ages haunted by ghosts and
demons. Deeper, deeper in the underworld, the realm of Astorath and Lucifer,
where the hounds of Hell dance their macabre ritals and blasphermous orgies.
    This is the demonic plane, beyond time itself, and as such it is 
timeless; existing before time began, continuing to haunt us up to this
veryday in our fears and night mares.
    The course of your journey through time can be plotted from a "possible"
five different realities called levels, these are:

        1. Demonic level
        2. Pharao level
        3. Western level
        4. Easter Island level
        5. Future level

    Your first experience as a time-traveler is a confrontation with the
first level, there you collect all the treasures you can, without being 
caught by its guardians. You may continue with consecutive levels, or choose
any level you perfer at the beginning of the game, but to get the highest
score, and extra graphics, it's best to go through the levels from 1-5.
    Once achieved you qualify for the honorary title of "Time Lord", until
then you're just a "Time Peasant". Ha!
    On each level you're granted eight lives (Time Paradoxing makes this
possible) but powers gained will not be transferable from level to level.

EQUIPMENT (useful objects, etc.)

    On the first level you have 8 bombs, the second 6 bombs, third 4 bombs
and so on. While stationary, hold down the firing button long enough to
detonate and unload the time-bomb beneath your capsule, and then move, if
you want to save your butt. You have only seconds...
    If you collect a torch or pistol this will enable you to shoot 
(to collect an object simply roll over it). Each weapon is loaded with 8
projectiles, so shoot sparingly. To shoot, just aim first with the joystick,
and then fire. In this way you can destroy (as many bombs) attackers and
many of the walled boundaries.
    Otherwise there's an elixir to collect granting you one extra 
reincarnation, and keys that open one door each, the door will then open on 
approach. The life-giving elixir is however, always well guarded, and you
may well lose a life or two, to gain one.

OTHER OBJECTS

    These are multifarious for example there's the horned devil, cute as a
teddy-bear, and harmless while resting, can transfom into a fireball that
nothing can stop.
    In island tropics grow rare enchanted trees, that will transform you on
contact to another destination. The tropical flowers are beautiful but
beware their deadly thorns, and keep your distance. Then there are monsters 
of stone, tombstones, deadly to the touch. Spectres, mummies, mean cowboys
and Pharaos, wizards and tin-can robots and they're all out to get you!
    You will find bare stone plates that suddenly become infernos, poisonous
snakes or death dealing lasers. And more still awaits you to surprise, excite
and simply take your breath away, and then there's all those precious stones,
treasure chests, and golden rings, boy!
    How boring our everyday world appears in comparison, just lots of
miserable people, and a few trees abd sea-lions that have survived the rush. 
Not to mention the mountains of plasti bags, YUK!

THE AIM OF THE GAME

    To qualify as a "time-Lord" you need a high score and to do this you
have to defeat all dangers and collect points. If you destroy a guard or 
opponent you receive 10 points. The real high-scorees, however come from the
doors anad discs, collect a disc and you get a full 50 points, open a door
with a key and you hit the jackpot of 80 points. Most other objects carry
ten points, but you receive 20 points for an apple, a golden cross, a sack 
of coins, a rocket or a treasure chest. Well, we at Micropartner thought
you might need some more, so here's a list of the objects on each level and
their implications.
