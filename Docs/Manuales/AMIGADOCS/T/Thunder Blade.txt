			THUNDER BLADE

This 3-D chopper combat mission is hectically spectacular. 'Cause
everything's always changing.  The scenery.  The enemies.  Even the
perspective.  As the pilot of Thunder Blade, the ultimate flying machine,
you are the last hope of freedom.  Dip down into war torn city canyons and
pick off enemy patrollers.  Maneuver hidden canyons, virgin forests and
craggy desert ranges.  Down screaming jets and dodge enemy fire as you go.

Winning Tips

* To hit tanks and jeeps on overhead view, swoop down and shoot them from
  about less than one half the height.

* Vary your speed and position fairly randomly in order to "throw off"
  enemy fire.

* On the end level of each stage, try to stay towards the top of the 
  screen.  This will allow you to retreat under enemy fire.

* Keyboard speed control allows you freer movement.  Joystick speed control
  allows total control from the joystick, but you have to be careful not
  to hold down the fire button, and affect your forward speed.  Experiment
  with both methods of control until you find the one that is comfortable
  for you.
