Transplant Instruction.

Not A500+ compatible (Have not tried in conjunction with ReloKick).

Uses one or two joysticks.
 
After screen title has disappeared pressing F1 will cycle you through the 3
game modes which are One player, Two player or competition.
You can also type in a level code here when you get one.
(Please note this program uses a german keyboard so z and y are swapped)
Once done press fire to play.
Left/right rotates your ship.
Up moves ship forward.
Down moves ship backwards (very slowly - only retros!!!)
Fire ??????

Shoot everying that moves and then shoot everything that does not.

The dots around your ship is the radar to show you where everything is.

After you complete a level you will be presented with a bonus screen.

If you have earnt enough credits you can buy any of the following.

Pressing F1 buys extra ships.
Pressing F2 buys extra flexability.
Pressing F3 buys extra firepower.
Pressing F4 buys extra shield power.

Pressing F5 will show level code.

When all done press fire to continue.

When you die and are returned to the main screen you will be presented
with the level code if you was in a one player game.

In a two player or competition mode you can set various things like
number of enemies, ships etc.


I do hope these instructions help. None came with the version I got so
I worked these out myself.
