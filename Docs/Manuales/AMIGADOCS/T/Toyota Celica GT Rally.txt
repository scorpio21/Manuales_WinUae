DOC FOR TOYOTA CELICA GT RALLY!
TYPED BY FOXY!



			    PLAYING TOYOTA CELICA GT RALLY!
			   ---------------------------------

  Once the game has loaded, the first screen that you will be presented with 
is the Control Preferences screen, from wich you can tailor the game to your
own requirements. Use the cursor keys to move up and down the options, and 
left and right keys to highlight your chosen option, or use joystick. On the
other versions, use the keyboard (keys indicated a little later) to make yer
choice.
     The options are:
	Controller:joystick or mouse.
 
	Gears:Manual or Automatic. 

	Steering:Auto or click.
		  This option allows you to have either self centring, or non
		  self centring steering. If you chose self centring (Auto),
		  the steering will return to a central position once you re-
		  turn the joystick to the center. With 'Click' steering you
		  will need to move the joystick in qn opposite direction to
		  the one in wich the car is currently being steered to chan-
		  ge the direction.

	Sensitivity:Low, Medium or High.
		  This option will allow you to to alter the sensitivity of 
		  the steering. High sensitivity will make the game more dif-
		  ficult and challenging, whilst the Low sensitivity will 
		  make the game easier for beginners.

	Reverse steering:On or Off.
		  While we were demonstrating Toyota to a number of journa-
		  lists, they had the opportunity to try to drive a car with
		  the steering reversing, so that turning the steering whell
		  left would turn the car right, and turning it right would
		  turn the car left. this proved so popular that we decided 
		  to include it as an option in our game. So, once you com-
		  pleted Toyota with correct steering, an even bigger chal-
		  lenge will be to try it with the reversed steering.
		
		  Once you have altered the game to your preferences, hit the
		  space bar or the fire button to exit menu. On living this 
		  screen, you will be given the options 'Start a Season' or 
		  'Practice a Track'. You will also bi given a chance to load 
		  a saved game by pressing F10, or by using the joystick. If 
		  you chose the 'Practice Track' option, you will be given the
		  choice of wich country to race in, either England, Mexico or
		  Finland. Once this is chosen, you will automatically be 
		  taken to this track. Should you chose to 'Start a Season',
		  you will be taken to another menu.

  		  Note:Pressing the HELP key will return you to this menu from 
		  any point of the game.

			   --------------------------------

	
	  Having chosen to start a season, you will be asked to decide on the 
	  current driver line up. Pressing fire will allow you to keep the 
	  current drivers. If you chose to alter the number or change the name 
	  of the drivers, you will first be asked to enter the number of dri-
	  vers, from one to four, by pressing the number key. You will next be
	  asked to enter the name for the players. Once the names have been en
	  tered, you will automatically move to the Racing Menu.

	  The racing menu allows you to save a gamem create a co-driver or ac-
	  tually begin the race. Pressing fire will take you to a race. Press-
	  ing the F1 key will take you to the Co-driver preparation menu, 
	  wilhst pressing the F9 key or highlight the appropriate section will
	  allow you to save a game, F10 will allow to load a game on the appro
	  priate screen.



			     CREATING A CO-DRIVER!
			    -----------------------


	  On this menu you will be offered to carry out Co-driver preparation
	  This will lead you to the Co-drivers notes. At the top of the screen
	  you will see two labels, Start and Finish. As you progress along the
	  road, a line will be drawn between these two to indicate the lengh
	  of track remaining. The larger illustration in the bottom left hand
	  corner shows the road and how it progresses.
	  The two flashing chevrons indicate at what point a message will be 
	  said or displayed if you enter one at this point. The messages avail
	  able to you are readable on the right hand side of the screen, and
	  by each one is a key to press to enter the particular message. So, 
	  for example, should you wish to signal a 'Hard Left' message, you 
	  would press the '3' key at the point on the track that you wished to
	  have the message presented. Moving cursor up and down the track, 
	  from the start to finish. Once you have created you co-driver, you 
	  will be returned to the Racing Menu, from wich you can begin the race

     NOTE:This is already a 'built in' co-driver, but he is not a perfect. He 
          will give some messages out, but should you want every bend and turn 
	  indicated, you will need to carry out your own Co-driver preparation.
