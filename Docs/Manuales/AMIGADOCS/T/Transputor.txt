Transputor

The rules for TRANSPUTOR are simplicity itself:

To clear each of the 32 screens of bricks using the bat (to the left hand
side of the screen) and sphere, WITHOUT allowing the sphere to fall off the
edge....

To help you with this challenge you are given 10 lives (one taken away each
time you lose a ball) and 10 missiles which destroy bricks ( and marauding
creatures) on contact.  There are also some bricks which can help you by
giving you bonuses when hit (e.g.  extra lives and missiles, larger bat,
keys which exit you to the next screen etc.)

Once booted up, the options are chosen using the mouse, but once into the
game you must use either the joystick or keyboard (the keys in operation
upon booting are:

Amiga:  cursor left (left, towards you)
	   cursor right (right, away from you)
	   SPACE (fire missile)
	   ESC (pause)

These keys can be changed using the REDEFINE KEYS option.

If you wish to examine the screens before playing them, go to the VIEW
SCREENS option.  You will see that the numbered screens are split into
color coded groups of four (i.e.  1 to 4, 5 to 8 etc, up to 29 to 32).
When you exit to play TRANSPUTOR, you will begin at the first screen of the
last group of four you viewed (i.e.  if the last screen you examined was
number 19, your next game will begin at screen 17).

If you wish to examine the different types of bricks, to to the VIEW BRICKS
option and simply go through their separate characteristics.  For easy
access however, they are all printed together on this leaflet.

Finally, should you reach the exalted heights of the high score table,
simply type in your name on the keyboard and press RETURN.

You now have all the information you require:  it is time to enter the
realm of TRANSPUTOR.
