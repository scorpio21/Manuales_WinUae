GAME PLAY:  An interesting feature of this game (an appropriately so) is the
fact that there is NO GAME hints or even instructions.  After all, you are
in the Twilight Zone.  Do Read everything carefully!  Lots of clues are
hidden in the descriptions!  If there is anything to take, TAKE it then
EXAMINE it!  To determine what you have taken over the course of the game,
simply type I or INVENTORY.  Finally, make sure your first word in in verb
form (go, buy, examine, take, run, etc.) Also, it helps to make a map (this
is in the process of being compiled and will accompany these instructions
soon.  Have to quit now as the lights just went out......wait what is that
noise?  Probably forgot to pay the electric bill..... there's that noise
again...........................................
