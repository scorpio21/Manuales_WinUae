                                   LOADING
				   -------
For ST and Amiga, turn off computer, insert game disk, and switch on. The
game will load and run automatically. If you experience any problems on the
Amiga version, disconnect any extra drives or accessories.

                                  OVERVIEW
				  --------
Twylyte is a solid 3D game of skill. The object is to manoeuvre your your
spacecraft through as many stages of the alien landscape, avoiding
obstacles and shooting down aliens. The further you go, the more difficult
it gets. Try to last as long as possible, amassing as many points, by
shooting the aliens.

The stages are all different. In the first level, for example, avoid the
purple pyramids, and fly under the green pyramids to gain extra energy. The
other levels you will have to find out for yourself! To pass through the
end-of-level task, you must shoot the green pyramid a number of times.

You have a limited amount of energy, and hitting objects or firing your
laser reduces this. When you have no more left - BOOM! end of game! Your
score and energy is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

                                  CONTROLS
				  --------
Use the joystick to control your ship. The button fires your laser. ESCape
quits the game. Space-bar pauses the game. Good luck and have fun!
