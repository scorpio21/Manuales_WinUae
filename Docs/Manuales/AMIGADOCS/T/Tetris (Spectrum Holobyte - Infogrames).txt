                        TETRIS for the Amiga
                        --------------------

Loading the Program

Turn on the computer (Amiga 1000 owners must use Kickstart.) When prompted
for the Workbench disk, place the Tetris disk into the drive. The game will
"auto-boot."

If you're running CLI, place the Tetris disk in the drive, and log onto the
drive. The type tetris and press return. Unfortunately, the program cannot
be run from Workbench.

There is no desk accessory version as stated on page 5 of the manual. If
you have 1 megabyte RAM or more, Tetris can be multi-tasked.

General Rules for Game Play

Your mouse has two buttons. Hold, down the right button to display the menu
bar. Move the pointer beneath the option you want, and then "pull down" the
menu. Drag the pointer to highlight the item you want and release the mouse
button.

Use the left button to select height and level options.

Making a Backup Copy

Tetris for the Amiga is key disk-protected, which means that you can make
a backup copy. The backup copy cannot be named "Tetris." You must insert
the original disk, however, when prompted by the program for "Tetris."

Keyboard Commands

Several of the File menu items may be selected from the keyboard. Hold
down the Amiga key (located to the right of the space bar) and the
appropiate key simultaneously.
