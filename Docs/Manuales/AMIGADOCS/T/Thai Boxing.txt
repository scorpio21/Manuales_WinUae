Documentation for Thai Boxing:

Thai Boxing combines the lightning-fast movement of karate with the brute
strength of boxing. In this sport there is only one aim, to inflict as much punishment
as possible in the shortest amount of time. The face of your boxer will show the
punishment he receives at the hands of his opponent. The cuts, bruises, and the bloody
nose as the knock-out punch lands are all shown in excruciating detail.

There are six levels of play and each level gets progressively more difficult. You
can only get to the next level by reducing your opponent's stamina to zero. If you
defeat your opponent before the counter reaches zero, bonus points will be added to 
your score. Each level consists of three rounds, each lasting one minute. Stamina
is displayed by the two colored bars at the top of the screen, one for each player.
Each kick or punch landed causes a reduction of stamina. It is a good idea to move
back if you are under a sustained attack, in order to recoup some of your lost stamina.
However, be careful that your opponent does not use this opportunity to deliver a 
deadly flying kick.
