Tanx N Stuff - Docs.


Instructions:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The game can be played by up to four people at a time - computer
players will fill in for any missing humans.  The aim of the the
game is to collect more flags than anyone else before the time
limit expires.
Your vehicle can only carry three flags at a time so you must
drop them back at your base before you pick up more.
Other players can attack you at any time and take the flags you
were carrying or go to your base and steal them.

You have several mines which you can drop anywhere on the map
which become active after a couple of seconds.  This can be used
to make a mine field around your base, but remember you can be
blown up by your own mines too!

The winner is the player with the most flags in their possession
when the time limit expires.


In-game stats:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

While in the game each person has four on-screen stats:

1. Current flags:   This shows how many flags you have on you.
2. Safe flags:      This shows how many flags you have at base.
3. Mines:           Shows how many mines you have left.
4. Time:            This displays how long the game has got to go.


The options screen:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
There are four user-definable options enabling you to personalise
each game.

1. Map:             You can choose your field of battle by 
                    clicking on this, it will cycle through 
                    available maps.
2. Time:            The game length can be anywhere between one 
                    and sixteen minutes. (The longer the game the 
                    better the computer players will get.)
3. Screen contol:   If you are having a four player game you 
                    usually want to see all the players so this 
                    will split the screen in quarters.
                    Alternatively if you are playing a two or one 
                    player game against computer players you can 
                    have a half or full screen view.
4. Player controls: These four icons select between directional, 
                    rotational or computer control for each 
                    player.  Directional control is where the 
                    vehicle moves immediately in the direction of
                    the controller. Rotational control is more 
                    indirect.  Try it out.

Player one is in the top left corner, and uses a joystick in port 
two.
Player two is in the top right corner, and uses a joystick in 
port one.

To drop a mine using joystick control, wiggle the joystick 
rapidly from left to right.
