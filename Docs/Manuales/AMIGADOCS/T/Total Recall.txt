GAMEPLAY

LEVEL 1

where he will receive further instructions. Along his way he must collect
five vital objects to help him on his quest: a briefcase, passport, ticket
to Mars, disguise and a surgical instruments for removal of implanted homing
device.
Richter, the Chief of Police, and his cronies are waiting to stop him. Quaid
must find a gun and cache of bullets to battle his way through or use his
unarmed combat skills.

LEVEL 2
Having received his instructions Quaid commandeers a Johnny Cab and must
make his way to the derelict warehouse area where he can utilise the
briefcase-video and learn further information regarding his past. Richter
and his mobile police are in deadly pursuit.

LEVEL 3
A stsrting revelation lies within the video briefcase. It appears that the
full answers to his questions lies on Mars. Now he must escape from the
warehouse to the Spaceport to begin his journey.

LEVEL 4
Upon arrival on Mars, Quaid is beset by Richter once again. He must now
fight his way through Venusville where he will contact Melina, possibly the
Mars until they discover the way to the Rebel hideout.

LEVEL 5
Melina and Quaid meet Benny, a taxi driver who helps them escape from the
pursuing forces. They must negotiate a dangerous route through the caverns
of Mars until they discover the way to the Rebel hideout.

LEVEL 6
Their taxi discarded, Melina and Quaid must proceed on foot back through
Venusville down into the caverns to meet Kuato the rebel leader.
Along the route are switches that must be activated to open the dorrs into
the alien reactor that is the heart of Quaid's dilemma. Lifts allow access
to the higher levels but they are icon-controlled. The correctly shaped icon
for each lift, or series of lifts must be found and dropped into the
corresponding slot by the lift - without this the lifts are inert. Other
icons will be found along the way. Each icon will be shown as an alien
symbol. There are four of these to be collected.
Finding Kuato, Quaid will be given the key to the entrance to the reactor.
Once you have used the key you will have access to the alien computer. This
will display a panel containing the four alien symbols collected on your
route through the complex. A cursor will allow you to manipulate the symbols
one at a time. Positioning these in the correct order will open the final
doors to the alien reactor. Between Quaid and his final confrontation are
the last vestiges of Richter's armed forces.
Fight your way through then battle Richter himself on the lift up to the
core room. Emerge victorious and within. You will find the villain behind
your strife, Cohaaggen. Here in the core room, he has planted a bomb which
will destroy the reactor and Mars onlly chance of salvation
