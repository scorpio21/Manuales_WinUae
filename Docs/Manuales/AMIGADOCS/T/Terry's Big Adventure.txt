GAMEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS

 The idea of the game is to guide Terry to his house through 12 levels
of obstacles and adversaries. You have 2 choices of ammunition to fend
off the relentless stream of creatures, your trusty Yo-Yo or stones
that you find along the way. Some of the nasties require more than one
hit in order to destroy them and some will have to be avoided
altogether.

After each round is completed you are placed in a Bonus level before
entering the next round. There are some areas in each section which may
only be entered if you have found a key. These are found, as are most
of the features, by catching them having hit a baddie. Other features
gained in this way are:

Invulnerability for collecting the letters of the word "TERRY"
Extra bonus time by catching the rings.
Extra life for finding all the letters in the word "EXTRA"

The white mushrooms should be collected for points qhilst the ones
moving up and down increase the time alloted for the round. The others
however, should be avoided.

The stones can be collected by jumping on the smooth rocks. Collecting
the flags will act as score multipliers and for each 20.000 points an
extra life will be awarded.

There are a number of other features but you will have to look and
learn!
