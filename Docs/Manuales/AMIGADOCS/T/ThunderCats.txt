NOTE: Yes, this is an old game, but we have never seen the docs to it,
so here they are at last!


THE PLOT
During a raid by the wicked MOLEMEN, agents of the evil MUMM-RA entered
the CATS-LAIR, kidnapped several members of the Thundercats team, and
stole the eye of Thundera, the magical jewel which holds the mystical
power of the sword of omens.  LION-O was out on a mission when the raid
took place but vows that, as the eye was given into his safe-keeping, he
must go to the castle Plun-dar, rescue this team-mates and retrieve the
eye.  Can LION-O battle his way past MUMM-RA's henchmen in the forests
and underground caverns and return the power to the sword of omens and
glory to the Thundercats name?

THE GAME
Extra weapons, bonuses and lives can be collected by hitting mushrooms
and trees with your current weapon.  A bonus is awarded if a level is
completed in the time limit.  You also get a 'kill' bonus according to
the number of enemies destroyed.  On the special mission levels where
you have to rescue a team-mate, be careful as you only get one chance.
If you get into a tight spot, try jumping over the enemy and killing him
from behind.

JOYSTICK CONTROLS
Control of Thundercats is through a joystick.
