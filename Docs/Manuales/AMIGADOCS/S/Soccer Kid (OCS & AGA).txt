A million miles away in outer space,far above the planet Earth, the alien pirate SCAB is scanning the area for a trophy of Great Importance to add to his enormous collection."Beep beep beep!" goes the scanner as it locates the World Cup,the most prestigious reward on Earth,shining brightly in the American sun.

Suddenly,a blanket of darkness falls over the stadium and SCAB'S spaceship materialises.The crowd is dumb struck until the World Cup disappears from view.They gasp,They boo,They cry,! Seconds later when the stadium is re-light... and SCAB'S ship is already orbiting the Earth.

"Bang" the smug SCAB collides with an asteroid.The World Cup shatters into five pieces which fall to Earth,each chunk landing on a different part of the globe.SOCCER KID decides there and then to save the day by recovering the five pieces of World Cup.
