BUT NOTHING WILL QUECH YOUR DESIRE TO SAVE, YOUR MASTER FROM DISATER.
UNFORTUNATELY, YOUR YOUNG, CUTE, ADORABLE MASTER DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ENDOWED
WITH THE SAME MAGICAL QUALITIES, AND SUFFERS BADLY IF RUN OVER, SQUASHED OR
GETS THE SLIGHTEST BIT WET. CAN YOU DO IT? ARE YOU 'DOG' ENOUGH TO SEE THAT
POOR DEFENCELESS KID SAFELY THROUGH 6 LEVELS OF THE TOUGHEST CITYSCAPE YOU

THAT LEE ENCOUNTERS. WHEN IT REACHES THE FAR LEFT, LEE HAS WOKEN UP, 
WATER HAS THE GREATEST EFFECT, AND MAY WAKE HIM UP COMPLETELY. WHEN LEE
AWAKES, YOU MAY USE ONE OF YOUR 'ATTEMPTS' AND CAN RESTART THE  CURRENT
LEVEL AT A POINT NEAR WHERE LEE LAST AWOKE. IF YOU HAVE NO ATTEMPTS LEFT,
