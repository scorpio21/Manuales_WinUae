  ENEMIES

  THE TRAIN...THIS IS A RELITAVELY HARMLESS OBJECT BUT IT CAN GET IN YOUR WAY
  AND IT TAKES SEVERAL SHOTS TO DESTROY IT.TRAINS ALWAYS TRAVEL ALONG THE
  BOTTOM OF THE TUNNELS

  MAG CYCLES...THESE ZOOM ALONG THE TUNNELS AT HIGH SPEEDS BUT ARE PRONE TO
  SUDDEN BRAKING.THEIR SMALL SIZE CAN MAKE THEM DIFFICULT TO SHOOT.

  DRONES...THESE ARE USUALLY FOUND IN GROUPS OF THREE AND ARE SLOW MOVING.THEY
  ARE INTELLEGENT AND WILL ATTEMPT TO BLOCK YOUR PATH.

  ARMED DRONES...THESE BEHAVE LIKE THE OTHER DRONES BUT THEIR ARMOUR MAKES 
  THEM INDISTRUCTABLE TO LASER FIRE

  FLIERS...THESE ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH AS THEY ZOOM PAST DROPPING
  BOMBS OR MISSILES ONTO THE TRACK.SHOOT THEM FOR HIGH POINTS.
