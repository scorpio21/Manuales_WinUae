                     STRIKE FORCE HARRIER

YOUR MISSION: Is to destroy the enemy HQ 125 miles NNE of your starting position (grid square AA). To reach enemy HQ you will need first to destroy enemy tanks threatening your ground sites. When you've done this your next move is to set up a new ground site in an adjacent operational area. These will also come under fire from enemy tanks and so it continues.

TEST FLIGHT

1. Load program when prompted for workbench.
2. Select Practice then enter name at prompt.
3. Increase your thrust to 80% by pressing P (power).
4. When speed reaches 125 knots (just above the second mark on Air Speed Indicator) ease back on the joystick and adjust to give a pitch of 20 Degrees (+20 on Head Up Display).
5. Raise Undercarriage by pressing U. If power is too great (vibrations) then decrease by pressing O (power down).
6. Fly straight and level with pitch around 0 degrees.
8. If you explore your immediate area, you will see your course pattern appear on FOFTRAC (Friend or Foe Tracking Radar). If you leave your operational area you will get a "FOFTRAC WEAK" message.
9. When flying into a new operational area you must fly to an altitude of 16,000 feet and pass over the white dot that is in the centre of your FOFTRAC screen. Your spy camera will automatically take a picture of your current grid square so that when you fly back below 10,000 feet (cloud cover) you will find that your FOFTRAC screen has been updated with new info on enemy SAM sites and enemy tanks.
10. To land you must first locate a suitable landing site.
11. Press 8 (Homer). Followed by Q W E or R(the codes for the prepared landing sites).
12. Alter direction so that the line on the HUD is lond and vertical - this gives you the heading to take. If it is short then turn 180 Degrees to bring your Harrier on course.

GAME PLAY

SETTING UP GROUND SITES: Unprepared ground requires a vertical landing with zero horizontal speed. WHen you've landed use the Homer (8) to select which landing sites (Q W E or R) you wish to move up. Yo will hear a high pitched sound when the ground forces have moved up. If you don't then it means that the site you have chosen was not ideal so just take off and you will find them located close by in the best spot (use homer). Once they have arrived you can refuel and rearm by pressing 2.


SHORT TAKE-OFF: 

1. Power up to 80%
2. Press 4 to select 45 Deg thrust.
3. At 100 knots, lift off by easing back on the joystick.
4. Raise the Undercarriage (U) and reduce power as necessary.
5. Fly at a pitch of less than 10 Deg.
6. At 150 Knots press 5 to select Horizontal thrust.



              
                     
VERTICAL TAKE-OFF: 

1. Press 3 to select vertical thrust.
2. Power up to 100% (Back off a bit if vibrations occur).
3. After lift-off, raise the undercarriage and reduce power a bit.
4. At 700 ft lower the nose slightly to increase forward speed.
5. Press 4 to select 45 degree thrust and ease to zero pitch.
6. At 150 knots press 5 to select horizontal thrust.

LANDING:

1. If landing on prepared site, locate using Homer (8).
2. As you approach site you will see some beacons, and when you reach it's centre you will hear a high pitched note indicating the optimum landing position has been reached. Ignore Hillocks.

VERTICAL LANDING:
1. Approach your proposed landing area at 500 ft and 400 knots. Each step on the Air Speed Indicator is 50 knots.
2. Select 45 deg thrust and use the joystick to maintain level flight. Wait until speed drops to 200 knots.
3. Lower the Undercarriage (U) and Flaps (F). Maintain level flight and let speed drop to 120-100 knots and no lower.
4. Push joystick forward to lose height. At 200 feet pull back to level the plane.
5. Select 90 deg thrust (3) and you will now be hovering above the ground.
6. Reduce power (O) carefully to achieve a slow steady descent.

SHORT LANDING:
1. As Above.
2. As Above.
3. As above but also keep pitch between 0-6 degrees.
4. Adjust power and pitch to keep the rate of descent under 10 feet fper second.
5. On landing, take off all power and apply the brakes (B).
6. Press 2 for refuelling, rearming and any necessary battle damage repairs.

* Don't worry if you find it difficult at first to land accurately at a ground site. The simplest way is to land vertically then press Homer key (8) followed by the nearest ground site key (Q W E or R) to call up the ground crew.
