     The movement of the main character in the game can be controlled by
either the Joystick (In Game Port#2), The Mouse (In Game Port#1), or by the
numeric keypad.  To make the joystick active you must press <CTRL>-J.
Movement via the joystick is obvious.  Movement via the mouse is done by
clicking the left mouse button on the floor of the room that you are
currently in at the spot that you want the man to move to.  With the numeric
keypad:
                 Up+left     Up      Up+right
                      7       8        9

              left    4       5        6   right
                            Stop
                      1       2        3
               Down+left     Down    Down+right

      At times short commands are needed to be typed (to search things, to
get thinks, to talk, etc).  They should be entered as directly and simply as
possible.  There are two speeds that the game can be played at, it can be
changed by typing 'fast' or 'slow'.  There are also several other keyboard
commands:
                   F1 or <HELP>: shows list of control keys(the list
                     changes as different circumstances arrise)
                   F2: Toggle Sound <on/off>
                   F3: Repeat previous command.
                   F5: Save Game
                   F7: Restore Game
                   F9: Restart Game
                   <CTRL>-C or <CTRL>-X: cancel command
                   <CTRL>-J: select joystick mode
                   <ALT>-Z: Quit Game
                   <TAB>: Inventory
                   <ESC>: Pause/Resume Game
