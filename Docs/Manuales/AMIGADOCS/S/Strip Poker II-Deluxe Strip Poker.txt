				STRIP POKER 2

LOADING: Insert the STRIP POKER disk and select the STRIP icon. 

GETTING STARTED: Select your opponent by using the joystick or mouse. Each
opponent employs a particular playing strategy; you will get to learn each
player's "personality" the more you play. You are given two opponents on the
master disk: Melissa, a highly skilled player, and Suzi, who is rumored to lose
a little more often. In addition, DATA DISKs are also available for most
versions of STRIP POKER. These disks provide you with additional female and
male opponents to play against. Be sure to leave the disk in the drive at all
times.
	You and your opponent will be playing draw poker. There are no jokers
or wild cards. You can open the betting with any kind of hand. The value of the
hands (in order) are as follows:
	royal flush, straight flush, 4 of a kind, full house
	flush, straight, 3 of a kind, 2 pair, 1 pair, high card.
Note that an ace can only be used as the high card in filling a straight. If
both players have similar hands then the highest numerical value wins.

MODESTY SWITCH: With the exception of the IBM, all versions of STRIP POKER
employs a "modesty switch" for those times when you feel it is necessary to
temporarily extinguish the screen display:
	Macintosh - select Graphics menu
	Atari-ST - press the help key
	Amiga - press the space bar
	Commodore - press the F1 key
	Apple - press Control key to remove, Escape key to return
	Atari - press the Start key to remove, Select key to return

GAME PLAY: Both you and your opponent start the game with $100. Your opponent's
current holdings are displayed to the right of the screen. During play you will
be selecting betting choices (Stay, Bet, Raise or Drop), the amount of a bet
($5 - $25) and which cards to discard. Use the joystick or mouse to move to a
selection and press the button to register that selection. The Apple and IBM
versions use the cursor keys for selection and the spacebar (or Return/Enter
key) to register that selection.

ANTE: At the beginning of each hand, both players must ante $5. This is done
for you automatically.

BETTING (first round): Whenever "WAGER" shows, it is your turn to bet. Select
from the following options:
	STAY: If you stay, it means that you are electing to do nothing for now
	and are waiting to see what your opponent does. If your opponent also
	stays during the first round, then the hand is redealt and another $5
	is added to the pot. You cannot stay if your opponent has bet or 
	raised.

	DROP: This means that you concede the hand and the money in the pot to
	your opponent. You can drop at any time it is your turn.

	BET: This means that you want to put some money into the pot in the
	hopes that your opponent will do the same so that you can win it all.

	RAISE: If you or your opponent has bet and you believe that you have
	the better hand (or you wish to scare your opponent into dropping), you
	can raise the amount of money in the pot. Point and click the mouse on
	the amount to bet, or use the joystick or arrow keys to cycle through
	your choices. Bets and raises have a minimum of $5 and a maximum of 
	$25.  They are made in increments of $5 and there is a maximum of two
	bets or raises per player per round of betting.

	CALL: You can only call if your opponent has bet or raised. Call means
	that you are willing to equal the amount that your opponent has put
	into the pot, but you do not want to raise any higher for now.

DRAWING CARDS: If either player completes the betting by calling, you may then
draw new cards. You always draw first and you can draw up to 5 cards. Use the
mouse to point to a card to discard; click the button to register your
selection (click STRIP POKER, you will see a pointer over your first card; move
the pointer by using the joystick or arrow keys. Enter your selection by
pressing the spacebar or joystick button. When done, move the pointer off the
screen. The word "Finished" or "Done" will appear on the screen. Press the
spacebar or joystick button and you will see your new cards and then be
informed as to how many cards your opponent drew.

BETTING (second round): A new round of betting occurs after the draw. If either
player calls or both players stay on the second round of betting, you are shown
your opponent's hand, and are informed as to who won the hand and how much the
winnings were.

WINNING THE GAME: Any time that either you or your opponent use up all of your
money, $100 must be borrowed against an article of clothing. This will be noted
by the computer. If you win, you do not have to give up your cloting and your
debt is cancelled. But if you or your opponent lose, the article of clothing
which was borrowed must be given up! Clothing is won back any time that
winnings go over $100. When this happens, the clothing is returned and $100 is
subtracted from the winnings. Any time that you or your opponent lose all of
your clothes, the game is over! You can end the game early by pressing the
right mouse button on the Atari-ST or selecting the Poker menu with the
Macintosh, or the Escape key with the IBM.
