Coaching strategies (if option is chosen)

DEFENSIVE TEAM IN FULL STRENGTH
 - "Protect" Strategy - 
	CENTER - always will cover the opposing center
	WINGS - When the puck is NOT in the team's defensive zone, the 			wing will cover the wing. When the puck is in the teams'                defensive zone, the wing will cover the defenseman.


 - "Normal" Strategy - 
	CENTER - always will cover the opposing center
  	WINGS - When the puck is NOT in the team's defensive zone, the 			wing will cover the wing. However, if a defensemen gets the puck,       the closer wing will go after him. When the puck is in the teams'       defensive zone, the wing will normally cover the defenseman.            However, if a wing gets the puck, the closer wing will go after         him.

 - "Forecheck" Strategy -
	CENTER - will go after the puck wherever it is on the ice
	WINGS - When the puck is NOT in the team's defensive zone, the 			wing will cover the wing. However, if a defensemen gets the puck,       the closer wing will go after him. When the puck is in the teams'       defensive zone, the wing will normally cover the defenseman.            However, if a wing gets the puck, the closer wing will go after         him.

DEFENSIVE TEAM SHORTHANDED (CENTER IN THE PENALTY BOX)

 - "Protect" Strategy - 
	CENTER - is in the penalty box
	WINGS - A wing will try to stay in front of the wing and/or             defenseman in his zone. A wing will not attack a puck directly,         but will wait for something to happen.
	DEFENSEMEN - The defenseman will only attack the puck if the            opposing center has it in his zone. Otherwise, he will try to           stay in front of the wing and/or defenseman in his zone.  

 - "Normal" Strategy -
   	CENTER - is in the penalty box
 	WINGS - A wing will attack the puck or puckhandler that is in his       zone. When the puck is not in his zone, he will stay in front of        opponents in his zone.
	DEFENSEMEN - A defenseman will attack the puck or puckhandler           that is in his zone. When the puck is not in his zone, he will          stay in front of opponents in his zone.

 - "Forecheck" strategy - 
	CENTER - is in the penalty box
	WINGS/DEFENSEMEN - A defenseman will attack the puck or                 puckhandler that is in his zone. He will get as close to the puck       as possible while staying in his zone, trying to intercept any          passes. It's risky.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

OFFENSIVE TEAM

	On offense, the main difference between the three offensive strategies is the frequency of passes vs. shots. For example, in the offensive zone the players are six times more likely to pass if SETUP is chosen rather than ATTACK. 

	CENTER - The center is more likely to pass to either wing. The center will occasionally pass to a defenseman, but the wings are the centers' primary receivers.
	WINGS - The wings first priority is to feed the center, which they will do more than half the time. A wing will also feed a defenseman who is sharing the same side of the rink with him. In addition, a wing will occasionally feed another wing.
	DEFENSEMEN - More than 1/2 the time a defenseman will try to feed a wing that shares the same side of the rink with him. If not, he'll probably go to the center. Occasionally, he'll go to another defenseman.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Features:
--------------------
