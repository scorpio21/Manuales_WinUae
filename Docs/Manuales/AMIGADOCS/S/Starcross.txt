Preface to the Story

The year is 2186. Humanity has established colonies on the Moon, Mars, and
several of the larger asteroids. Earth's sky is dotted with space habitats, and
the spaceways are always busy. As usual, there is the urgent need for energy to
power this advanced civilization; one of the primary sources of that energy is
quantum black holes. In STARCROSS, you are a black hole miner, scouring the
asteroid belt in your one-man survey ship. Finding and harnessing a single
black hole can make a person's fortune. It's a lonely business, fraught with
the known and unknown hazards of space. You've equipped your ship, the mining
vessel Starcross, with the best gear you could afford. You've put everything
into venture, and though you've tried before, you somehow sense that this time
will be different. The ship's computer handles the functions of navigation and
routine maintenance. You watch the sophisticated mass detector as it
unceasingly scans the vicinity for uncharted masses. To assuage the tedium of
your long trip, you browse through the compact tape library, a compendium of
human knowledge and culture. But the drone of the ship gradually lulls you into
a deep sleep. As you sleep, you dream of the riches which would be yours if
your search for a quantum black hole is successful. Little do you suspect that
the ala your mass detector is about to jolt you out of your dream - but not to
grapple with the long-sought black hole. Your quest has taken an unexpected
turn, for you are destined to rendevouz with a gargantuan alien spaceship from
the outer fringes of the galaxy.
