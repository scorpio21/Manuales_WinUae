SWAP

THE GAME

Basic principle

The screen is made of different colored tiles and
different shapes : square, triangle, hexagon. When you
click - using the mouse or the keyboard - at the
intersection of two tiles, they swap places.

If two neighbour tiles have the same color, they
disappear. The objective is to get rid of all
available tiles.


Game options

*       Avalanches

When this option is selected, when clicking on the
"avalanche" icon, all the tiles will fall down the
screen until they encounter other stable tiles or the
bottom of the screen.

*       Additional tiles

When this option is selected, you will get additional
tiles that you will be able to place wherever you
choose on the game screen.

*       Credits

When this option is selected, each permutation cost
two credits, each deleted tile earn you 1 credit.

-       Activating the avalanche will cost you 100 credits.

-       Using the additional tiles will cost you 10 credits
per tile.

If you come out of credits, you cannot swap tiles
without deleting at least 2 tiles.

*       Time

When this option is selected, a limited time is
allowed for each level.

*       Number of colors

You can choose the number of colors for the tiles.
From two to six different colors, the most difficult
mode being generally with three colors.


COMPETITION

Your progress is shown by the stars displayed in the
top right corner of the screen. Each time tiles are
erased, you are been given a score. When the stars are
lit, you can exit the current level, the game
statistics are displayed and you can process to the
next level or stay in the current level to increase
your score.

If you decide to continue in a level despite the 8
stars are displayed, you will accumulate additional
points which will allow you to skip several levels.
