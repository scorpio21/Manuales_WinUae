     Introduction

   Welcome to the Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle, the latest and most
  revolutionary of the new range of two-seater fight craft designed and
  manufactured by Draziw Industries.  Novenias leading armaments company for
  the past eight hundred years.

   This manual is divided into chapters detailing most of the features of the
  AGAV.  However, because of the unique flexibility of the craft's design.
  notably the ability to upgrade and modify the weaponry, control systems, and
  fuel-feeders without needing to rebuild the craft from scratch.

   You are reminded that this document is classified at Level 4.2, and is
  therefore printed on anti-Holostat paper.  Any attempt to duplicate this
  manual will result in auto-decomposure of the complete document, and the
  simultaneous release of Kryplex gas, which will paralyse the nervous system
  of all known carbon based life-forms in the western spiral arm of the
  galaxy.

     Entering the AGAV

   To enter the AGAV craft, follow the standard procedure:-

  1.  If the AGAV plasma drive is in operation, press the switch marked OPEN
    CANOPY, situated below the canopy rim (there is a switch on both sides of 
    the vehicle).  If the drive is inactive, release the safety catch and
    slide back the blister canopy manually, using the handles of the rim.

   2.  Climb onto the wing and stand as far forward as possible, close to the
     auxiliary oxygen port.

   3.  Place both hands on either side of the rim of the canopy, and lift your
     legs over the rim and into the cockpit.

   4.  Lower yourself into the pilots seat.

   5.  Adjust the seat until comfortable, using the posture control switches
     situated under the seat.

   6.  Fasten the safety harness.

   7.  Close the canopy by pressing the small green button to your immediate
     left (marked CLOSE CANOPY).  If emergency power restrictions are in
     force, slide the blister canopy forward, using the handles situated just
     behind the pilots seat.

   The co-pilot or instructor should follow steps 2 to 7, standing slightly
  further back on the wing.

     The AGAV Instrument Panel

   Your AGAV has one of the most comprehensive computer control systems ever
  developed for a fighter craft.  This means that the pilot only has to
  concentrate on the vital aspects of flying, such as navigation, combat, and
  docking at repair stations for fuel and extra weaponry.

   A-Local Area Scanner

   This hexagonal screen displays the position of all objects within the
  AGAV's range.  The scanner can detect density and movement extremely
  accurately, to the extent of the sensing the colours of each building, 
  vehicle or aircraft.

   B-Energy Level

   This instrument shows a constant indication of how much energy the AGAV has
  stored for its Plasma Drive Unit.  It is advisable to always keep the energy
  level above 15%.

   C-Shield Status

   The molecular Neutralising Force-Shields should NEVER be allowed to drop
  below 10% under any circumstances.  Shields are replenished when the craft
  is repaired at a maintenance silo.  The shields are at their weakest around
  the undercarriage, therefore it is important that you never allow the AGAV
  to scrape along the ground during flight.

    D-Laser Cell Status

   All four Saphire II laser units are fed from the laser cell.  If it drains
  completely, your craft will be unable to fire laser bolts.  The laser cell
  can be refuelled at any Novenian airbase or maintenance silo equipped with a
  PosiLok recharger.

    E-Altitude Meter

   The altitude meter shows your current height.  If it gets below a safe
  level (usually 5%), the meter will flash rapidly and emit a sonic warning.
  You are reminded that it is an offence to fly low in a surburban area
  except in times of military emergency, unless you have clearance from your
  Area Commander.

    F-Velocity Indicator

   The velocity indicator displays the current air speed, up to 2550 urads.

    G & H-Bank Level Indicators

   These twin indicators (one indicator is affixed to each wing tip) display
  the level at which the AGAV is banking.  The AGAV can bank to 45 degrees
  unladen, although cameras or missles will alter the maximum banking angle.
  Both indicators should always display the same bank factor, unless one of
  the wings is severely damaged.

    I & J-Plasma Drive Status Display

   These waveform display units indicate various internal values of the Plasma
  Drive.  As an AGAV pilot, you need not worry about these unless they stop
  completely, or start moving in a reverse direction during flight.

    K-Sector Display

   The Novenian landscpae is divided into 10,000 sectors, on a 100 x 100
  matrix.  The sector indicator will show the current X and Y position ranging
  in value between 0 and 99.

    L-Missle Indicator

   The missle indicator shows the number of missles currently on board.  The
  maximum number of missles allowed at any one time is two.

    M-Heading Display

   This instrument displays the heading of the AGAV in relation to the Irralya
  Star (discovered by Carrido Otnip in 2601.55.2) in accordance to the north,
  south, east, west convention.

  The following is a crude map of the above devices.....

     Flying the AGAV

   Taking Off

   Once all safety checks have been completed, you may take off using the 
  following procedure:

  1.  Pull back on the joystick to increase altitude.
  2.  Increase thrust and accelerate forward.

   The AGAV has a top speed of 2550 urads, enabling it to outrun any sub 
  light-speed Alliance craft, as well as all Egron and Aruloid military craft
  currently in service.  It is quite safe to fly at full speed, as the
  computer will monitor the plasma drive at all times, and modify the neutron
  stabilizer automatically to ensure the plasma converter is always operating
  within its safe range.

     Flight Manoeuvres

   If you have not had full training in one of Draziw Industries comprehensive
  flight simulators, you should familiarise yourself with the more frequent
  manoeuvres when attacking land vehicles and escaping reprisal from a nearby
  enemy is accelerating, banking and gaining altitude in one smooth operation.
  Likewise, when at high altitudes, it is essential that you are able to
  decelerate, change direction downwards, and accelerate towards an attacking
  enemy target as quickly as possible.

   When flying at low speeds, the bank factor of the AGAV is so acute that you
  will be able to turn by 180 degrees with extreme ease.  Even at maximum
  thrust, the turning circle of the craft is very tight.  The quickest way to 
  turn by 180 degrees is to decelerate to standstill, bank left or right to
  the AGAV's maximum bank factor, and accelerate quickly away.

     Landing the AGAV

   The AGAV is fitted with all-terrain landing pads, enabling you to land on
  any surface, including molten lava, acid rock, and the vast Erialc fungi
  reefs.  To land on a surface, bring the craft to level flight, and 
  decelerate until the computer cuts in and holds you in hover mode at zero
  velocity.  Push forward on your joystick slowly until you touch down.  If
  you are landing on molten lava, do not be alarmed by the loud hissing sound 
  of the landing pads cooling the surrounding lava streams.

     WARNING:  During flight testing of the AGAV prototypes in the vast
  Tranalua desert, it was found that flying at extremely low altitude over an
  inductive energy powerline resulted in the absorption of small amounts of
  plasma energy.  At the time, this seemed unimportant, but as the mk.1 AGAV's
  were brought into service in urban areas, where high capacity powerlines
  were more commonplace, the full size of the problem was realized.  Daredevil
  rookie pilots, trying to prove their aerobatic prowess, decided that flying
  just above the ground at high speed between the twin towers at the beginning
  of a powerline and following the path until swerving to avoid the apex tower
  was a great test of skill.  This resulted in large amounts of volatile
  energy being absorbed by the AGAV's energy storage pod, and subsequently
  overloading the neutron stabilizer and inflicting fatal damage to the plasma
  drive.  Attempts to refuel in this way will result in severe action being
  taken by both the Novenian airforce, and the Plasma Energy Corporation
  against all guilty parties.

     Weaponary Systems

   The AGAV's main weapon is the Sapphire II quadpulse laser system. The laser
  is powered from a dedicated laser energy cell situated in the nose-cone of
  the craft, directly behind the PosiLok refuelling nozzle.

   Two laser cannons are situated under each wing of the AGAV, and each group
  of lasers fire simultaneously.

   The AGAV has two laser sight operation modes:  fixed sights ensures that
  the sight is always in the center of the screen, requiring the AGAV to be
  directly in line with its target; whereas floating sights allows the sights
  to move freely about the screen in the direction of the joystick control
  movement.

   The laser fire button has a rapid auto-repeat, enabling a target to be hit
  many times at great speed.  The Sapphire II has an armour piercing factor of
  0.45 - powerful enough to destroy a vehicle with similar armour to an
  Alliance tank with only six direct hits.  The laser cell has a capacity for
  around 250 full-power laser pulses and can be recharged by a PosiLok station
  at any Alliance airbase, maintenance depot or silo.

   Some AGAV's (mainly carried on Interstellar Exploration Fleet Dredgers) are
  fitted with short-range mk.  12 and mk.  14 proton missles.

   As a desperate measure, and provided your shields are sufficiently intact,
  it is possible to intercept enemy craft and ram them if no other option is
  available.  For this to be successful, the enemy should have little or no
  shield or force wall of its own.

   The AGAV is fitted with a revolutionary new system:  The VidiMon remote-
  controlled television guided camera.

   Using a high-definition video camera, the AGAV pilot is able to transmit
  pictures directly back to Military Headquarters at Qazalon City.  An 
  automatic sliding visual display has been incorporated into the craft which
  monitors the flight of the camera.

   The camera's flight is started by pressing the LAUNCH button on your
  keyboard console.

   Once the camera has been launched, you can guide it using the normal AGAV
  flight controls (the AGAV itself will simply hover in its current position
  under computer control).  The plasma drive should be able to transport the 
  camera for at least twenty minutes.  If the camera is not returned to the
  proximity of the AGAV within that time, or if it is intercepted by the
  enemy, it will self-destruct.

     Docking and Maintenance Procedure

   Routine maintence checks are made on all Alliance craft, before and after
  every flight.  The AGAV has a major overhaul after every five flights, or if
  any mechanical or computer related faults are discovered.

   During a flight, if you need to refuel the plasma drive, laser cell, or
  replenish the shields you should establish a datalink with the nearest
  airbase and follow standard docking.  During a state of military emergency,
  or if the AGAV has been damaged and is in need of immediate attention, you
  may dock at an Alliance space station repair silo.

   The Alliance silos are vast underground chambers with a sloping entrance
  building at ground level.  The entrance hatch to the silo is marked by a 
  laser strobe which is easily detachable by the AGAV's Enhanced Vision
  System.  The silos are used to build and maintain all Alliance space
  stations and large military air vehicles, but also have facilities available
  for the AGAV.  Not all space stations maintain geostationary orbit, so as
  they approach the entrance, the silo will rotate to face the space station
  using the NavSynch system, and the pull it in using its tractor beams.

   The current docking procedure is as follows:

  1.  Establish a datalink with the Chief Engineer at the silo, and wait until
  clearance is given.  The silo will rotate to face you, and then stop, unless
  you adjust your flight path.  Manual flight into the silo is necessary,
  since the AGAV is too small to be automatically pulled in using the tractor
  beams.

  2.  Slowly guide the AGAV through the doors to the silo.  Keep the AGAV 
  central at all times, as hitting the door or a wall could result in major
  stuctural damage being inflicted upon your craft.

  3.  Once inside the silo, your Enhanced Vision System should alter your
  display so that only relevent sections of the silo are visible.

  4.  If you need to collect any new equipment, such as a replacement
  television guidance camera, or armaments for special projects (such as
  sonic bombsm or mk.  14 proton missles), instruct the Chief Engineer to
  deposit the equipment at an AGAV collection point, which is usually situated
  near the center of the silo.

  5.  When the equipment is ready, fly towards the collection point, where an
  AGRO unit will unlock it into place on the AGAV's fuselage.

  6.  To refuel your laser cell, fly towards the end of the silo, and slow
  down to an almost stationary speed.

  7.  Align centrally with the PosiLok Refuelling Point, and fly forward until
  you lock into position.  When your laser cell has been refuelled, the force
  shields will be replenished, and any superficial damage will be repaired by
  the AGRO androids.

   While the AGAV is being prepared, you will be able to obtain food, liquid
  input, medical treatment, or a place to sleep in the recreation sector of
  the silo.





   When the AGAV has been prepared, you will be escorted to the launch pad. 
  To launch from the silo, wait until an AGRO unit has started up the plasma
  drive.  When the drive reaches full power, press the button on the console
  marked LAUNCH FROM SILO.

   Once you have been launched from the silo, accelerate slowly forward, but
  do not try to increase altitude until you are clear of the silo.

     AGAV Specifications

   The main features of the AGAV are as follows:

   Plasma Drive

   The retro-Thrust plasma power units are a development of the mk.  6 neutron
  fusiondrives which were used to great effect in the single-seater GS20
  fighter class craft.  They have been substantially redesigned to incorporate
  a neutron-stabilizer circuit, which has almost completely eliminated the
  spontaneous explosions occasionally experienced by unfortunate GS20 pilots
  who flew above plasma storms in the ionosphere, against the advice of their
  Atmostat data reports.

   Molecular Neutralizing Force Shield

   These are the latest concept in the shield technology and have been 
  developed at great cost by the Irata University Molecule Research Unit.  The
  shields work by fusing all unstable molecular structures into an integral
  part of the shield shell, therefore minimizing the destructive force of any
  solid matter coming in contact with the force shield.  The second advance in
  shield design is in dealing with laser bolts, by converting laser energy
  into sound waves.  This is a great improvement over the energy-thirsty
  fission based shields used on all previous Alliance units.

   Laser Cannons

   The AGAV class craft retain the tried and tested Sapphires II laser system,
  which has been fitted with a new longer-lasting laser energy cell, using the
  new PosiLok cell refuelling system now installed at all airbases and
  outlying service depots.  The original duo-pulse unit has been modified to a
  quadpulse system for the first time to take advantage of these developments.

   Communication Systems

   The standard issue military two-way radio system has been fitted to the
  AGAV.  A sub-etha data link, using the new NetCell cellular communication
  system developed by Novenia Telecom has been added for remote tracking, and
  other computer controlled operations.

   Computer System

   The AGAV is the first craft to have a ship's computer specifically designed
  for a single craft.  Draziw Industries has worked in conjunction with
  Imperial Business Machines, to produce the P-Cat (ProIntelligence-
  Communication and TransProcessor).  The P-Cat is the pilots main interface
  with the AGAV, and informs the pilot of the ships status at all times using
  its built in SynthaVoice circuitry, message projection, and the 
  ergonomically designed control panel instrument display.

   Because the AGAV has been designed as a low-flying attack and
  reconnaissance craft for use in unchartered landscapes, there is no computer
  controlled navigation system.  The advantage of this decision is that in the
  event of the enemy gaining control of an airbase, they would be unable to
  control an AGAV remotely, or follow its exact flightpath.

   *The P-Cat developement team has been assigned to develop the computer
  control systems for the newly-announced Sentinal Defense Initiative 
  (referred to as the "Sky Wars" program by the media), and will therefore be
  unable to produce updated versions of the P-Cat system in the future.

   Television Guidance Systems

   One of the most important developments in the AGAV program has been the
  VidiMon system.

   VidiMon is a remote controlled television reconnaissance system, consisting
  of a high-definition video camera mounted on a miniature Plasma drive unit,
  a result of 15 years of research at the Hibbard Technology Center.

   The AGAV pilot can launch the camera on a surveillance flight, lasting up
  to 20 minutes.  A special control display has been incorporated into the
  AGAV which is automatically activated when the camera is launched.

   *N.B.  Although early tests using the camera mounted on a short range
  proton missle were unsuccessful, the option is still available for the 
  camera to be mounted on a lightweight remote guided weapon of some kind.

   Computer Enhanced Vision System

   Probably the most spectacular feature of the AGAV is the enhanced vision
  system.

   The greatest problem encountered by most attack crafts in the past has been
  searching out tanks and armoured vehicles in built-up areas, in order to
  destroy them.  Tanks can easily hide behind buildings or under bridges, and
 take pot-shots at fighter craft.

   The blister canopy of the AGAV is actually part of a complex display
  system.  Rather than looking at the outside world with standard infr-red
  goggles, the canopy actually intensifies the normal levels of background
  gamma and x-ray radiation, and enhances the edges of all solid matter to
  give a stunning translucent display of anything within its visual range,
  even if objects are behind solid buildings.

   The inclusion of the enhanced vision system makes the AGAV the most potent
  seek-and-destroy craft ever developed for the Alliance.

    Pilot Control Mechanisms

   The AGAV is unique amongst modern fighter craft in its control mechanisms.
  The pilot (and co-pilot) manoeuvre the vehicle using the joystick.

   There is a secondary control system, used by the co-pilot or flight
  instructorm consisting of a keyboard module.

   In the event that the joystick is not functional for one reason or another,
  the keyboard may be used for complete control.
