  GAME SYSTEM
  ===========


  IN STAR TREK 25TH ANNIVERSARY YOU TAKE ON THE ROLL OF CAPTAIN OF THE
  ENTERPRISE,JAMES T.KIRK.AS CAPT KIRK YOU ARE FACED WITH THE SAME COMMAND
  DECISIONS HE FACED,BUT IT`S YOUR CHOICE THAT WILL DECIDE THE FATE OF THE
  USS ENTERPRISE CREW.THE GAME IS SPLIT INTO TWO SECTIONS,ONE FOR WHEN YOU
  ARE ON THE BRIDGE,THE OTHER FOR WHEN YOU ARE ON A PLANET OR ANOTHER STAR-
  SHIP.


  ON BOARD THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE
  --------------------------------

  CAPTAIN KIRK OVERSEES THE CONTROLS OF THE USS ENTERPRISE FROM THE BRIDGE
  FROM HERE YOU CAN ISSUE COMMANDS TO THE CREW,TRAVEL TO AND COMMUNICATE 
  WITH NEW WORLDS,AND ENGAGE DEADLY COMBAT.THE BRIDGE CREW EACH HAVE THEIR
  OWN DUTIES.BY SELECTING THE APPROPRIATE CREW MEMBER,YOU CAN ORDER THAT
  OFFICER TO EXECUTE THAT TASK.WHAT TASKS EACH CREW MEMBER PERFORMS IS 
  LISTED BELOW.

  CAPTAIN KIRK
  ------------
  YOU ARE CAPTAIN KIRK.YOU CAN CHECK STARFLEET COMMANDS REVIEW OF YOUR PER-
  FORMANCE BY SELECTING THE CAPTAINS LOG ICON.CHOOSE THE TRANSPORTER ICON
  WHEN YOU WISH THE LANDING PARTY TO LEAVE THE SHIP.EVEN STARSHIP COMMANDERS
  HAVE TO GO TO SLEEP NOW AND THEN!OR WOULD LIKE TO LET OTHERS SLEEP.SELECT
  THE OPTIONS ICON AND A NEW SET OF ICONS WILL BE DISPLAYED-: 
  
  SAVE GAME
  LOAD GAME
  MUSIC ON/OFF
  EFFECTS ON/OFF


  SPOCK
  -----
  COMMANDER SPOCK OCCUPIES THE SCIENCE STATION.ONCE YOU ENTER ORBIT,HE WILL
  SCAN THE AREA WITH THE SHIPS SENSORS AND GIVE A REPORT.HE WILL OFFER VALUE-
  ABLE ADVICE IF YOU SELECT THE TALK ICON.SPOCK HAS ACCESS TO THE SHIPS 
  LIBRARY COMPUTER-IF YOU SELECT THE COMPUTER ICONYOU CAN TYPE ANY SUBJECT
  TYPE THE SUBJECT YOU WISH TO GET INFORMATION ON AND THEN PRESS <ENTER>


  MR SCOTT
  --------
  COMMANDER SCOTT SITS IN THE ENGINEERS STATION.FROM THERE HE DIRECTS DAMAGE
  CONTROL AND THE SHIPS ENGINES.DURING COMBAT,MR SCOTT WILL DIRECT HIS DAMAGE
  CONTROL TEAMS TO FIX THE MOST DAMAGED OF THE SHIPS SYSTEMS FIRST UNTIL ALL
  THE DAMAGE IS EQUAL,THEN SPREAD THE TEAMS OUT SO THAT ALL THE DAMGED AREAS
  ARE BEING FIXED AT THE SAME RATE.BY SELECTING THE DAMAGE CONTROL ICON,YOU
  CAN TELL MR SCOTT TO CONCENTRATE ON A PARTICULAR SYSTEM FIRST.ONCE THAT IS 
  FIXED HE WILL AUTOMATICALLY RETURN TO HIS AUTOMATIC PATTERN.SEE THE SECTION
  SHIP SYSTEMS FOR MORE DETAILS.ALSO YOU CAN ORDER MR SCOTT TO GIVE YOU EMER-
  GENCY POWER.THIS ONLY LASTS A SHORT TIME THE STRAIN ON THE ENGINES IS SUCH
  THAT IT WILL TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE THAT COMMAND CAN BE GIVEN AGAIN.


  UHURA
  -----
  LIEUTENANT UHURA IS THE COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER.IF YOU NEED TO TALK OR SEND
  INFORMATION TO ANOTHER SHIP OR PLANET,SELECT THE COMMUNICATIONS ICON.UHURA
  WILL OPEN HAILING FREQUENCIES AND TRY TO ESTABLISH CONTACT.ONCE COMMUNICAT
  -TIONS ARE ESTABLISHED,YOU CAN ORDER HER TO SEND COMPUTER DATA FILESAND
  OTHER INFORMATION BY SELECTING THE COMMUNICATIONS ICON AGAIN.


  SULU
  ----
  LIEUTENANT SULU IS THE SHIP`S HELMSMAN,BY SELECTING THE ORBIT ICON,SULU
  WILL TAKE THE SHIP IN OR OUT OF ORBIT.YOU CAN`T "BEAM DOWN"TO A PLANET
  UNTIL YOU ARE IN ORBIT DUE TO THE TRANSPORTERS RANGE.SULU ALSO CONTROLS THE
  SHIPS SHIELDS-BY SELECTING THE SHIELDS ICON HE WILL RAISE OR LOWER THE MAIN
  DEFLECTOR SHIELDS


  CHECKOV
  -------
  ENSIGN CHECKOV IS ASSIGNED TO NAVIGATION.SELECTING THE NAVIGATION ICON WILL
  BRING UP A STAR MAP.YOU WILL NEED TO REFER TO THE STAR MAP FOR THE NAMES OF
  THE STARS.SELECT YOUR DESTINATION AND THE USS ENTERPRISE WILL ARRIVE AT 
  WARP SPEED.DURING COMBAT,CHECKOV CONTROLS THE SHIPS WAEPONS SYSTEMS.BY
  SELECTING THE WEAPONS ICON,HE WILL ACTIVATE OR DE-ACTIVATE THE SHIPS PHASERS
  OR PHOTN TORPEDOES.YOU CAN`T SHOOT UNTIL YOU`VE ARMED THE WEAPONS!



  SHIP SYSTEMS
  ============


  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SYSTEMS THAT ARE VITAL TO THE OPERATION OF THE USS
  ENTERPRISE DURING COMBAT.IF DAMAGED,MR SCOTTWILL ASSIGN DAMAGE CONTROL
  PARTIES TO MAKE REPAIRS.


  SHIELDS
  -------
  THE MAIN DEFLECTOR SHIELDS PROTECT THE USSS FORM DAMAGE DURING COMBAT.ONCE
  ACTIVATED,THEY WILL NULLIFY A PORTION OF THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE SHIP.THE 
  MORE DAMAGE THEY ABSORB,THE LESS EFFECTIVE THE SHIELDS BECOME UNTIL THEY 
  FAIL COMPLETELY.THERE ARE SIX SHIELDS FRONT,LEFT,RIFGT,TOP AND BOTTOM.
  EACH IS DAMAGED INDIVIDUALLY,SO IF YOUR LEFT SHIELD IS DAMAGED,YOU MAY WANT
  TO TRY AND KEEP THAT SIDE AWAY UNTIL MR SCOTT CAN REPAIR IT!


  PHASERS
  -------
  THESE ARE ONE OF THE TWO PRIMARY WEAPONS USED BY THE USS.PHASWRS ARE PHASED
  LIGHT BEAMS.SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO A LASER BEAM.AFTER FIRING,THEY MUST RECHARGE
  BEFORE THEY CAN BE FIRED AGAIN.THIS IS QUICKER THAN PHOTON TORPEDOES CAN BE
  RELOADED,BUT DRAW A LARGE AMOUNT OF THE SHIPS POWER AND DON`T PACK QUITE SO
  MUCH PUNCH TORPEDOES DO.IF SUFFICIENTLY DAMAGED,ONE OR BOTH PHASERS CAN BE 
  KNOCKED OUT OF COMMISSION.


  PHOTON TORPEDOES
  ----------------
  THESE ARE CHARGED OF MATTER AND ANTI-MATTER SEPARATED IN MAGNO-PHOTON FORCE
  FIELDS.PHOTON TORPEDOES DETONATE ON IMPACT.THE ADVANTAGES OF PHOTON TORPEDO
  S IS THAT THEY TAKE LESS ENERGY TO RELOAD AND ARE SOMEWHAT STRONGER THAN
  PHASERS.THE DOWN SIDE IS THEIR LENGHTY RELOAD TIME,AND SLOWER SPEED TO TARGET
  THE SLOWER SPEED REQUIRES YOU TO LEADTHE TARGET MORE THAN YOU WOULD WITH
  PHASERS.


  SENSORS
  -------
  THE MAIN SENSOR ARRAY IS REPRESENTED BY THE MAIN VIEW ON YOUR SCREEN.WITH-
  OUT THIS YOU ARE VIRTUALY BLIND!AS IT ACCUMILATES DAMAGE,THERE WIL BE A 
  GREATER AND GREATER INTERFERENCE PATTERNS OBSCURING YOUR VIEW.IF YOU EVER
  WANT MR SCOTT TO CONCENTRATE HIS DAMAGE PARTIES ON SOMETHING THIS IS IT.


  BRIDGE
  ------
  THE BRIDGE ITSELF IS HEAVILY ARMOURED AND SHEILDED,BUT THE CONTROLS TO THE
  SHIP CAN TAKE DAMAGE.THE SHIP WILL HANDLE SLUGGISHLY AS DAMAGE TO THE BRIDGE
  MOUNTS.


  HULL
  ----
  THERE IS NOT ALOT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF COMBAT.MR SCOTT
  WILL REPAIR IT AFTER BATTLE,BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE OTHER SYSTEMS
  GOING WHILE THE HULL RIPS ITSELF TO PIECES FROM THE STRESS DAMAGE.ONCE THE
  HULL FAILS,THE USS IS DESTROYED.


  WARP AND IMPULSE ENGINES
  ------------------------
  POWER FOR THE SHIPS MOVEMENT IS PROVIDED BY THE USS`S ENGINES,THE TWO WARP
  PODS PROVIDE THE BULK OF THE POWER AND ARE REQUIRED FOR WARPING SPACE TO 
  TRAVEL AT FASTER THAN LIGHT SPEEDS BETWEEN STARS.THE IMPULSE ENGINES 
  PROVIDE CONSIDERABLY LESS POWER THAN WARP ENGINES BUT CAN PROVIDE A NICE 
  RESERVE.DURING COMBAT,THERE IS NO DISTINCTION MADE BETWEEN POWER TYPES.NR
  SCOTT WILL REPAIR THE WARP AND IMPULSE ENGINES AS A WHOLE RATHER THAN TREAT
  ING THE WARP AND IMPULSE ENGINES AS SEPARATE UNITS.


  POWER ALLOCATION
  ----------------
  POWER ALLOCATION IS OPTIMISED BY THE SHIPS COMPUTERS.SHIELDS ARE THE FIRST
  PRIORITY AND WILL BE CHARGED AS LONG AS POWER IS AVAILABLE.AS LONG AS THE
  WEAPONS ARE ARMED THEY WILL HAVE SECOND PRIORITY ON POWER.PHASERS DRAW A  
  FAIR AMOUNT OF POWER TO CHARGE,BUT POWER REQUIREMENTS ARE LOW ONCE THEY ARE
  FULY CHARGED.PHOTON TORPEDOES HAVE LOW POWER REQUIREMENTS.WHATEVER POWER IS
  LEFT OVER IS FOR SHIP MOVEMENT.THE SHIP WILL TRY TO MOVE AT THE SPEED LAST
  COMMANDED BUT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO THAT FAST WITHOUT TAKING SHILEDS OR
  WAEPONS OFF LINE.AS LONG AS THE ENGINES ARE DAMAGED,THE USS HAS THE POWER 
  TO GO TOP SPEED AND ARM WEAPONS AND SHIELDS.IF THE POWER SHOULD BE LOST THEN 
  THE SHIP EFFECTIVELY SLOWS DOWN,FURTHER DAMAGE CAN BRING THE SHIP TO A HALT
  AND THEN PREVENT THE PHASERS HAVING ENOUGH POWER TO CHARGE.THE DESTRUCTION 
  OF THE USS ENTERPRISE WILL PROBABLY SOON FOLLOW.


  OPPOSING SHIPS
  --------------
  ASIDE FROM MOCK COMBAT WITH ANOTHER FEDERATION HEAVY CRUISER,THERE ARE
  SEVERAL STARSHIPS THAT MAY OPPOSE YOU IN COMBAT-:


  KLINGON BATTLE CRUISER
  ----------------------
  THE KLINGON EMPIRE IS AN AGRESSIVE CULTURE THAT EXOLS WARRIOR VALUES.
  OUTRIGHT WAR IS PREVENTED BY THE ORGANIAN PEACE TREATY,BUT THE KLINGONS
  HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREVOKE MORE THAN A FEW INCIDENTS.ARMED WITH DISRUPTORS   
  AND PHOTON TORPEDOES,KLINGON VESSLES ARE SIMILAR IN SPEED AND MANOEUVRABILTY
  TO THE USS.THE SINGLE TORPEDO LEAVES THE FIRE POWER SOMEWHAT WEAKER BUT 
  FACING TWO OF THESE CRUISERS WOULD BE DEADLY.


  ROMULAN WARBIRD
  ---------------
  ROMULANS FOUGHT AN INCONCLUSIVE BUT EXCEEDINGLY FEIRCE WAR AGAINST THE
  FEDERATION A CENTURY AGO.A NEUTRAL ZONE AGREED BY TRAETY SEPARATES THE TWO
  SOCIETIES,BUT VIOLATIONS ON BOTH SIDES HAVE ACCURRED.ROMULANS ARE THE SAME
  GENETIC STOCK AS THE VULCANS,BUT HAVE NOT LEARNT THE VULCANS VALUES OF PEACE
  AND LOGIC.THE ROMULAN SHIPS ARE SLOW,MANOEUVRE POORLY,BUT HAVE TWO ADVANTAGE
  S: A POWERFUL PLASMA TORPEDO AND A CLOAKING DEVICE THAT RENDERS IT DIFFICULT
  TO DETECT IN BATTLE ECEPT WHEN FIRING A TORPEDO.
   BEWRAE DUR TO THE RECENT ALLIANCE THE ROMULANS HAVE AQUIRED SOME KLINGON 
  BATTLE CRUISERS WHICH HAVE BEEN RETRO FITTED WITH CLOAKING DEVICES.


  ELASI PIRATES
  -------------
  A LOOSE CONFEDERATION OF PIRATE CAPTAINS THAT PREY ON SHIPPING FOR THE MOST
  PART.THIER SHIPS ARE SMALL AND QUICK AND ARE ONLY ARMED WITH PHOTON TORPEDO
  THEY ARE PRIMARILY A DANGER WHEN ATTACKING WITH TWO OR MORE SHIPS.



  THE LANDING PARTY
  =================


  WHEN TRANSPORTIMG TO PLANET OR OTHER STARSHIP THE CAPTAIN WILL LEAD THE 
  PARTY OF HIMSELF,SPOCK,BONES AND A SECURITY OFFICER.BE WARNED,SITUATIONS
  CAN GET DANGEROUS.IF KIRK,SPOCK OR BONES GETS KILLED BY YOUR ACTIONS THEN
  THE GAME IS OVER.GENERALLY THERE IS SOME KIND OF WARNING PLACED IN THE GAME
  - YOU DON`T HAVE TO LEARN BY DYING BUT YOU CAN DIE!LOSING A SECURITY DOESN`T
  MEAN YOU HAVE LOST,YOU CAN CONTINUE THE MISSION.CONSTANTLY LOSING SECURITY
  OFFICERS IS FROWNED UPON BY THE FEDERATION.


  MOVING ABOUT
  ------------
  SIMPLY CLICK AND POINT TO THE AREA YOU WISH KIRK TO GOTO.OR JOYSTICK FIRE
  BUTTON.HE WILL WALK TO THE SPOT AUTOMATICALLY.YOU WILL ONLY CONTROL THE KIRK
  MOVEMENT DIRECTLY.THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LANDING PARTY WILL MOVE WHEN 
  CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE IT.


  COMMAND ICONS
  -------------
  BY PRESSING RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON OR SPACE BAR,YOU CAN CALL UP THE COMMAND 
  INTERFACE.SELECT WITH THE FIRE BUTTON,LEFT MOUSE OR ENTER KEY.TO CLEAR A 
  CURRENT SELECTION OR ESCAPE A MENU USE THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTONOR ESCAPE KEY
  THIS PATTERN IS USED THROUGHOUT THE LANDING PARTY MISSIONS.BY SELECTING THE
  APPROPRIATE AREA YOU CAN USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS-:


  TALK
  ----
  PLACE THE CURSOR OVER THE ICONS MOUTH TO SELECT IT.THE NORMAL CURSOR WILL
  THEN BE REPLACED WITH THE TALK CURSOR.PLACE THIS OVER THE CHARACTER YOU WISH
  TO TALK THEN HIT SELECT AGAIN.YOU MAY BE GIVEN SEVERAL OPTION OF WHAT YOU 
  SAY-BE SURE TO READ THEM ALL BEFORE MAKING AN ANSWER.YOU CAN SCROLL THROUGH 
  THE SELESCTIONS BY CLICKING THE RIGHT MOUSE OR <SPACE> BER.REMEMBER,YOU ARE
  REPRESENTING THE FEDERATION AND STARFLEET COMMAND WILL REVIEW YOUR PERFORM-
  ANCE.WHAT YOU SAY CAN AND WILL EFFECT THE ENTITY YOU ARE TALKING TO.DON`T 
  FORGET TO TALK TO SPOCK,BONES AND THE SECURITY OFFICERS THEY MAY HAVE 
  VALUABLE ADVICE TO GIVE.


  LOOK
  ----
  PLACE THE CURSOR OVER THE EYE ICON TO SELECT IT.THERR WILL NOW BE A LOOK
  CURSOR.PLACE THIS OVER THE PERSON OR THING YOU WANT TO LOOK AT AND SELECT IT
  ADDITIONLY,THERE WIL BE AN INVENTORYICON IN THE UPPER LEFT OF THE SCREEN.BY
  SELECTING THE INVENTORY YOU CAN LOOK AT WHAT YOUR CARRYING.


  GET
  ---
  PLACE THE CURSOR OVER THE HAND ICON THAT IS EXTENDED DOWNWARD TO SELECT IT.
  PLACE THE CURSOR OVER THE THING YOU WISH TO GET AND SELECT IT.IF THE ITEM
  CAN BE TAKEN,IT WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR INVENTORY.


  USE
  ---
  PLACE THE CURSOR OVER THE HAND HOLDING THE BALL AND SELECT IT.THE CURSOR
  WILL BECOME A BALL.FROM HERE IT IS A TWO STEP OPERATION:SELECT THE ITEM OR
  CREW MEMBER YOU WISH TO USE FOLLOWED BY THE ITEM OR CHARACTER YOU WISH IT 
  TO EFFECT.USE SPOCK ON ALIEN CONTRAPTION AND HE WILL TRY AND USE IT.USE 
  MEDI-KIT ON SECURITY OFFICER AND BONES WILL TRY AND USE IT HEAL HIM.USE
  KIRK WITH COMMUNICATOR AND HE WILL CONTACT THE SHIP.REMEMBER THIS IS A TWO
  WAY OPERATION IT MUST INCLUDE TWO THINGS.


  OPTIONS
  -------
  PLACE THE CURSOR OVER THE STARFLEET SYMBOL AND SELECT IT,THIS WILL BRING UP
  A SELECTION OF ICONS SIMILAR TO THE ONES AVAILABLE ON THE BRIDGE:
  SAVE GAME,LOAD GAME,MUSIC ON/OFF SOUND EFFECTS ON/OFF



  STANDARD EQUIPMENT
  ==================


  THE LANDING PARTY COMES EQUIPED WITH SEVERAL ITEMS.THE FOLLOWING GIVES A
  BRIEF DISCRIPTION OF EACH.OTHER ITEMS CAN BE FIGURED OUT AS YOU GO ALONG.

  PHASER
  ------
  TWO ICONS ARE SHOWN,ONE FOR STUN AND THE OTHER FOR DEMATERAILISATION.THE
  HAND PHASER IS SIMILAR TO THE USS PHASERS IN OPERATION.IT IMPARTS A SMALL
  AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO AN OBJECT IN STUN MODE,A DESTRUCTIVE AMOUNT ON FULL 
  POWER(DEMATERAILISATION).


  TRICORDER
  ---------
  THIS IS FOR SENSING AND SCANNING.THINK OF IT AS A POWERFUL LOOK DEVICE.IT 
  IS CALABRATED FOR SCIENTIFIC READ-OUTS AND BONES FOR MEDICAL READ-OUTS.IF
  SOME ONE IS INJURED BONES IS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE AND SCIENTIFIC MATTERS FOR
  MR SPOCK.


  MEDICAL KIT
  -----------
  BONE`S TRICORDER IS A DIAGNOSTIC AIDE-YOU NEED TO USE THE MEDI-KIT TO 
  ACTUALLY CURE SOME-ONE.


  COMMUNICATOR
  ------------
  YOU CAN TALK TO MR SCOTT ABOARD THE USS WITH THIS AND GET ADVICE OR ISSUE
  COMMANDS.YOU CAN GET ANYONE TO DO THIS,BUT IT`S KIRK WHO WILL DO ALL THE
  TALKING.


  
  THE SCENARIOS
  =============
  
  EACH MISSION WILL START WITH A BRIEF FROM STARFLEET CONTROL.YOU WILL NEED TO
  NAVIGATE TO THE STAR SYSTEM STARFLEET ASSIGNS YOU AND RESOLVE THE SITUATION.
  YOU MAY FACE INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER SHIPS.AFTER COMPLETION OF THE MISSION
  STARFLEET WIL EVALUE YOUR POSITION.THER ARE MULTI OUTCOMES.SO BE SURE TO 
  SAVE THE GAME IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIMENT.



  COMMENDATION POINTS
  ===================


  THE BETTER YOU DO ON A MISSION THE BETTER STARFLEET WILL AWARD YOU POINTS.
  THIS WILL HELP YOUR FINAL EVALUATION,BUT ALSO IN A MORE PRACTICAL SENSE.THE
  PERFORMANCEOF YOUR CREW IN COMBAT WILL INCREASE.MR SCOTT WILL BE ABLE TO 
  REPAIR QUICKER,SULU WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE THE SHIP BETTER,CHECKOV WILL BE
  ABLE TO TARGET ENEMY SHIPS BETTER.IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT AGAINST LATER
  COMBATANTS WITHOUT THESE SKILLS.

All the numbers in the grid above relate to the Planets that you will have to Orbit. The position of the numbers in each section is roughly where the Star is positioned on the Star Map.

    1: Centurius                    11: Shiva Omicrom
    2: Cameron's Star               12: Alpha Proxima
    3: Ark-7                        13: Omega Mealstrom
    4: Harlequin                    14: Argos IV

Use the above Star Map by pressing N when you need to visit a location. (from Bridge)

It looks a little different from what you will see on screen but you should be able to work out the positions easily if you split the screen into blocks like my grid above.
