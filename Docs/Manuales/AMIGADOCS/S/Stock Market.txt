Part two: Playing the game

An overview of STOCK MARKET



STOCK MARKET:The Game can be played with one to six players.
Each player will have thier chance to buy and sell stock at the
beginning of each week. A single game consists of ten turns or "ten
weeks" of trading. The object is to make more money then your
opponet(s).

Once STOCK MARKET:The Game has been loaded, the game will
ask you if you want to read the instructions. This complete set of on-
line instructions is very useful if you ever misplace the manual. The
next question it will ask is how many players will be participating in
the game. Any number from one to six can be entered.

NOTE: If you type a minus sign (-) in front of the number of players
then the game will play faster than it's original pace. This feature
should only be used by experienced players!

After entering the number of players, STOCK MARKET:The Game
will prompt you for the name of each player beginning with player
one. Each player's name can be up to nine letters in length. Once all of
the player's names have been entered, a "MARKET OPEN" screen will
be displayed followed by the stock chart a few seconds later. For
more detailed information on the chart look at the following chapter
"Using The Chart".

NOTE: The order in which the player's are given the opportunity to
buy and sell stock is selected randomly. For example, Player One may
not have the first opportunity to buy and sell stock for every turn.

                                    -3-

After you have finished making all of your transactions, you will signal
the end of your turn and either thenext player's chart will appear or
the market will open again. In STOCK MARKET you are trading for a
ten-week period. Each turn represents the passing of one week.

When the market opens, you will notice immediately that it is either a
bear market or a bull market. A bear market means that the 
cumulative rise or fall of all stock on the market is between $5 and
$19 per share. A bull market specifies that the cumulative rise or fall
of all stock on the market is between $8 and $38 per share. The
exception to this is when the market either crashes or "goes sky
high."

Below the bear/bull market indicator is the ticker tape, which will
begin by announcing some world event that has influenced the stock
market for that week. Remember, the stock price thatyou see on the 
ticker tape is that company's high or low price per share -it may be a
slightly diffrent figure on the chart screen.

After the tenth turn the computer will present a new ticker tape with a
message rating your performence. if you were incredibly succesful
with your investments your name may be recorded on the top 12
players list.

This is not an arcade game and it does not require a alot of hand-eye
coordination. But it does require careful thinking and patience. An
average two-player game lasts approximitly 45 minutes. The amount 
of time, of course really depends on how long it takes you to make
your buying and selling decisions.

Using The Chart

The Chart in STOCK MARKET is the most important screen in the
game. From the Chart screen you can buy and sell stock, obtain a
loan from the bank, or pay off a debt, analyze a graph or even calculate
your assets. the Chart looks like this:

The first column shows teh company name. The second column Last,
displays the price per share from the previous turn. The third column,
Current, is the price per share for the present turn. The Change
column shows the diffrence in price per share between this turn and
the previous one. Cost is the price per share that you paid for the
stock. If you bought the same stock on diffrent turns at diffrent
prices, then Cost price per share is averaged. Difference shows
how much money you have made or lost since buying the stock.
Shares shows the total number of shares that you own of a particular
stock.

There are two lines of information at the bottom of the chart. The first
line is the command line, which is described further on in this
chapter. The second line is the status line. The status line provides
each player with four important pieces of information. Cash displays
the amount of money that you have available for purchasing stock.
Turn specifies which turn you are currently making transactions in.
Player is the number of the player that owns the portfolio currently
displayed. Name is the name that was entered at the begining of this
game for that player.

Using The Command Line

The command line allows you to use any of seven diffrent functions
during your turn. Below is a list of functions and what they do:

Sell - Pressing "S" for Sell will produce a highlight bar that you can
move up and down woth the arrow keys. once you have positioned
the highlight bar over the stock you wich to sell, press <ENTER> and
teh selling screen will appear and you will be asked how many shares
of stock you wish to sell. Simply type in the number "1" and press <ENTER>,
all of your shares will be sold.

                                    -6-


Buy - Exactly like the Sell command, pressing "B" for Buy will
produce a highlight bar that you can move up and down with the
arrow keys. Once you have positioned the highlight bar over the
stock you wish to purchase, press <ENTER> and the selling screen will
appear. Some information regarding your purchasing potential will
appear and you will be asked how many shares of stock you wish to 
buy. Simply type in the number of shares and press <ENTER> to
continue. You can enter "1" and press <ENTER>, to buy as
many shares as you can afford.

Loan - If you are in need of some extra capital, press teh "L" key for
Loan. A picture of THE BANK will appear along with your account
information (borrowing limit, initial intrest rate and present interest
rate). From this screen you may Borrow by pressing the "B" key,
make a Payment by pressing the "P" key, or Return to the Chart by
pressing the "R" key.

Assets - When you press teh "A" key the Assets screen will appear
with a complete breakdown of your net wealth. The assets screen will
display your available cash on hand, and your present portfolio value,
along with a total of both figures. The computer will then subtract the
amount owed to the bank (including interest), and then display your
net wealth.

Graph - If you are interested in analyzing a particular stocks' "track
record", simply press the "G" key and the graph screen will appear.
The graph will display Am. Air (teh first stock listed in the chart) and
will advance to next stock on the chart each time the "S" key is
pressed. Pressing "R" will Return you to the chart screen.

End - Pressing the "E" key ends your turn and either displays teh
next player's screen or opens the market.

Top 12 - Press "T" to see how you are faring against the top 12
player's recorded.


                                    -7-


The Last Turn

On the last of the game, the computer will present a new ticker
tape with a mesage rating your performance. Keep in mind that the
computer only judges your final net wealth and not, for example, on
how well you pulled out of a major stock market crash.

After the ticker tape presentation, the computer will print the players
in list form ordered by thier net wealth. It is on this screen that a clear
winner can be determind. Depending on how well each player did,
he or she may be added to the top 12 list and recorded on disk.

Part three: PLAYING TIPS

Every "Tycoon" has thier own playing style and after a few games you
will soon develop your own. However, the following playing tips may
help you gain more profitable results.

Dividends

* Dividends may be awarded as long as a company's stock is worth
more than 10 dollars per share.

* At the end of each turn, one to three companies will awarded
dividends.

Graphs

* Analyzing graphs is a good way to forecast potential investments
but just like the real stock market, there are no guarantees.

Loans

* You may only make one trip to the bank during each turn to either
borrow money or pay back a loan.

* All loans taken when you already owe money are considered
"rewritten" to the present interest rate.

Selling

* You must always sell before you buy stock.

* To sell all of your shares of a particular stock, simply press "1"
when asked how many shares to sell.

* Selling 250,000 shares of stock (or more) could cause the selling
price to drop (as long as the selling price is higher than 10 dollars).

                                    -9-


Shares

* Remember that each company has a total of one million shares for
sale at the beginning of each game.

* If a company has a service a reverse video bar across the Current column on
the chart then all of its stock (1 million shares) has been acquired
and there are no more left for sale.

* Stocks will split at 140 points (dollars). A stock split can be 2 for 1,
3 or 1, or even 4 for 1 but the price will only be divided by two
regardless of how much it splits by.

* If a stock goes bankrupt, you lose all of your shares. If the
comapny ever returns to the board, it is considered a new
company and you will not receive any shares.

General Hints

* Playing low cost stock can be risky (they go bankrupt easily) but
could also generate a lot of quick cash.

* Investing in stocks near the 140-point splitting mark may prove to
be a fruitful decision but keep in mind that stocks with a high
dollar value can drop 10,20 or even 30 points in a single turn.

* Unless you have an abnormal amount of cash to play with, try not
to invest in more than six companies at a time. Otherwise you
could find yourself losing or gaining too little to make it worth
you while.

* This is your chance to think big! Buy stock in hundreds of
thousands, iunstead of just hundreds of shares.
