SCENARIO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Super Cars is set in a pseudo-fantasy world with fictitious cars
battling for Championship supremacy on a spine chilling and perilous
circuit in the middle of a desert viewed from overhead. Each track
consists of tortuous turns, straights, tunnels and bends which become
progressively more perilous as you speed your way through the levels.
Other hazards include mud, water and oil on the tracks which have a
variety of effects on speeding cars. As you progress through the game,
the amount of opponents you race against and the on-track hazards
increase at an alarming and unnerving rate.


GAMEPLAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 You start the game with a credit of 5000 pounds. You can choose to
view the specifications of the cars available, go into the sales office
or start racing straight away. To select your option, use the pointer
(a white hand) to click on the option of your choice and then press
FIRE/MOUSEBUTTON.


THE SPECIFICATION SCREENS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Each car has its own specification screen. The information includes
details on engine variation, top speed, dimensions and a brief
description of the car's capabilities. To view any of the screens,
simply place the pointer over the relevant car and press FIRE.


THE SALES OFFICE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The sales man will offer you a trade-in price for your old car - the
amount offered is dependent on its condition. You have the choice of
handing over the asking price or bartering with him for a bargain.
Place the pointer on the information bar at the bottom of the screen
and press FIRE/MOUSEBUTTON when you want to speak, and then on the line
relevant to your answer to him.
 Be careful not to push him too far otherwise he might throw you out of
his office altogether. If this is the case, you will have to compete in
another race before being allowed entry again. To exit from the sales
office, place the pointer on the exit door and press FIRE/MOUSEBUTTON.


THE GARAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 You can enter the garage at the beginning of the game or at any
interval in between races. This is where you make the essential repairs
to your car's engine, bodywork and tyres. You can also purchase extra
fuel here. To improve your on-track performance and increase your
chances of winning, you can also purchase extra fuel here. To improve 
your on-track performance and increase your changes of winning, you can
also buy a range of "optional extras" from the garage:

Power Steering - Essential for decreasing your turning circle and
                 allowing for faster corner-taking.

Turbo-Charger  - Use this to increase your acceleration rate. This
                 option is particularly useful when running into
                 patches of mud which slow your car down.

High Speed Kit - Increases your maximum speed - Invaluable on the
                 straights!

Retro          - Use this for faster braking.

Front Missile  - You can only buy one these per race. Fire it when an
                 opponent is directly in front to ensure a total
                 write-off plus a hazardous obstruction for all other
                 cars behind.

Rear Missile   - Blow any persistent tail-ender out of the race - but
                 like the front missile, you can only buy one per race.

Spin Assist    - You will need this if your car is thrown into an
                 uncontrollable skid caused by either oil or water.
                 Spin Assist will always point your car in the right
                 direction.

Side Armour    - Use this to send any other vehicle into an
                 uncontrollable spin simply by ramming it.

 Place the pointer on the special feature or boxes marked "Tyres",
"Fuel", "Engine" or "Body" that you want to buy. As the till rings up
the sale, your money total is decreased accordingly. You can only use
the extras that you buy in the following race. Anything not used will
be cancelled out and you will have to buy it again for any future race.

 To leave the garage, place the pointer on the exit door and press
FIRE/MOUSEBUTTON. To begin the first stage, you select a track numbered
from one to nine. Place the pointer on the track number that you want
to race in and press FIRE/MOUSEBUTTON.

 You will start the competition in a Taraco Neoroder Turbo because you
will not be able to afford a smarter set of wheels until you have
earned some prize money.

 You can race the tracks in any order you want. You must however race
all nine tracks before you can advance onto the next stage. At this
point, a password will appear automatically on the screen. Press
FIRE/MOUSEBUTTON to continue onto the next level. (Blank boxes appear
at the end of these instructions for you to record the passwords so
that you can go straight onto the second and third levels at any time
after having completed the first stage.)

 You will have to come within the first three competitors during any
race to qualify for the next round. Fourth or worse means you are out
of the competition! Failure of either fuel, tyres, bodywork or engine
whilst racing will also result in disqualification.


PLAYING TIPS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Press the FIRE button to move your car forward. Then move the joystick
either left or right to steer.

 When screenhing into a bend, try taking your finger off the FIRE
button but still steering. This has the effect of a handbrake turn!

 If you have to drive through an oil slick on one of the straights,
make sure your car is going in a straight line to ensure a controllable
slide.

 Always use the front or rear missile on the straights. If you hit and
immobilise a car, it will cause a massive pile-up on the next lap!


SCREEN DISPLAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The dashboard of your car constantly monitors the condition of tyres,
engine wear and bodywork. These conditions deteriorate accordingly as
you race dependent on tyre screeches, engine speed and damage
substained to bodywork from collisions with either course or other
vehicles. Your current position and laps covered are also displayed.
