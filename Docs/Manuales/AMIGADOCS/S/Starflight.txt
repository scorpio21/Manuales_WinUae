How it works:

Match the outer ring and the inner ring using the number chart. Get the
number from the Table of Races and go to the listings of the places. Match
the number of the race with the line number under the number found on large
chart.  This gives the correct code number to enter.

Starport Central, Arth Orbit Station

Dear Starship Commander:

We are sorry you were unable to attend the Operation Starflight briefing
last week.  Those who attended can vouch for the enthusiasm and excitement
that prevailed during the meeting.  We at Interstel feel that this is the
beginning of a new era, and that you and your colleagues will be
instrumental in making this mission a success.

To make sure you will have all the information you need, we have included a
copy of the briefing transcript, and your own copy of the Technical
Reference Manual.  This latter document contains the information you need
to operate your starship; without it, you could find yourself in deep space
with no way out.  Guard it carefully.  Needless to say, it is highly
confidential and is, if you will excuse the old cliche, For Your Eyes Only.
The briefing transcript is included for the background information it
contains.  It was decided to provide this information in this form rather
than as a summary, to give the absent members a sense of the atmosphere
that prevailed during the meeting.

As you know,  Interstel is in no position to outfit starships as fully as
you might like; consequently, a lot hinges on you entrepreneurial ability
to generate revenues early on.  You will then be able to use those revenues
to outfit your starship for more distant (and more profitable) voyages. The
following are a few suggestions in that direction:

Your initial allotment of 12,000 mu's is enough to allow you to buy four
cargo pods, and to gather and train a crew.  Your ship comes equipped with
one Class 1 engine and 20 cubic meters of endurium, so you won't need to do
anything to your starship except name it.  We suggest you train your crew
with the funds you have remaining after you purchase the cargo pods.  You
will then be in a good position to mine the minerals found on the planets
in our own solar system.  Fill the cargo pods with minerals and bring them
back to Starport, where you will find willing buyers.  We realize that some
of you may find this strictly commercial endeavor somewhat degrading, but
we have found that it is necessary in order to complete your primary
mission.  Of course, you are free to follow whatever strategy you see fit
--  just be aware that Interstel cannot afford to give you a second chance
should you fail in your first attempt.

No matter what strategy you choose to adopt, it is wise to avoid the
following, any one of which can spell disaster:

1.  Running out of fuel

2.  Running out of energy in your terrain vehicle

3.  Running out of money

4.  Getting killed in combat

5.  Landing on a planet with crushing gravity

6.  Engine or communication failures

8.  Getting killed on planetside by storms or hostile lifeforms

In addition, we recommend that you check your Notices in Starport
Operations before embarking on a journey.  Notices often contain valuable
clues, and may help you avoid potential disaster.

On behalf of all the personnel here at Interstel headquarters, we would
like to wish you great success in your mission.

May the Rock of Truth shine brightly upon you.

Terrence Willwater
Director, Interstel

			BRIEFING TRANSCRIPT

(The following is a transcript of a briefing before a group of starship
commander trainees.  The briefing was chaired by Vice-Director Phexipotex
and included and cross-representation of various races).

Phexipotex:  Thank you for coming everyone.  Please be seated.

You have all been carefully selected for your special skills and abilities
and your aptitudes in the areas of diplomacy and exploration.  We are
counting on this driving force inherent in all of you to help answer the
puzzles and riddles that have long plagued our scientists.

While conducting research in the Southern Hot Zone 15 years ago, on the
sixteenth day of ten-month, 4604, a team of Interstel scientists found a
deep shaft in the crust of the planet, leading to a vast and ancient
underground network.  Investigation revealed this to have been built by...
the first colonists of Arth.

People, please!  May I have some quiet...  Thank you.  I assure you that
this conclusion was reached only after many years of careful study.  At
this point there is little room for doubt that Arth was, in fact, colonized
by a group called Noah 2, and that this group came from a planet called
Earth.  I'm sure you can all appreciate now why this information has not
been released to the public.  Obviously, it is vital that up to date proof
be offered when we commence public announcements, otherwise the notion that
Earth was a real place and that Noah 2 an actual group would be met with
skepticism, to say the least.  I realize that the acceptance of a new
system of beliefs and of new technological concepts is a difficult task.
Many of you may still be skeptical -- this is perfectly understandable.  I
only ask you to bear with me for now.  After this briefing you will be
seeing some holo-footage which will, I think, cast any doubts from your
minds.  And, of course, when you begin your explorations you will be using
the new technology yourselves.

As you might imagine, this discovery answers a good many questions; but it
also raises quite a few.  There was an Old Empire and a Great Interstellar
War.  From what we have been able to piece together it appears that during
the final stages of the war, when the Empire was facing imminent defeat, an
ambitious project, Project Noah, was launched by an organization then known
as the Institute.  The reasons for the war, for Noah 2's failure to
maintain their level of technology, and for the Empire's final fate have
not yet been determined.  We have, however, found several references to
"Uhlek", "Gazurtoid", and "Phlegmak" and believe these to be names of races
which were hostile to the Empire -- possibly responsible for its downfall.
Further evidence confirms the theory that the Humans, Elowan, Thrynn, and
Velox (referred to then as the Veloxi) were all part of the Old Empire and
were represented in the Noah 2 group.

In addition to the historical data, we have uncovered sufficient technical
data to let us reconstruct some of the Old Empire technology.  The most
significant area of this technology has focused on peculiar lumps of
crystaline matter which the Empire called Endurium.  It was on this
substance (unlike any we have ever encountered) that their superphotonic
(or faster than light) technology was based.  Fortunately, there was enough
Endurium in the underground colony to allow us to experiment freely and
actually construct a few prototype starships.  Yes, we have constructed
starships, and superphotonic technology does work.  The next phase of our
experimentation involves exploration.  Our scientists and the public are
eager for answers.

In front of each of you is a Captain's Technical Reference Manual.
Information relevant to your mission can be found in the main body of the
text; other information allowing a deeper understanding of those with whom
you will deal has been compiled by our researchers and can be found in the
Appendices.  Should you decide to participate in the exploration of the
unknown, you will be given command of a ship and your choice of crew.  As
an additional incentive you will be paid for any discoveries you make; you
may use this money to purchase  anything you desire or to train your crew
and modify your ship further.

One final note: you are not the first Interstel exploration group.  The
first group, which consisted of 13 ships and 78 explorers, was dispatched
five years ago.  To date, only two of these ships have returned and we have
had no word as to the status of the others.  Because each ship was carrying
only enough fuel for a one year journey we must assume that they are...
well, that they will not be returning.  Nevertheless, in the past five
years we have made significant advances in starship technology and you are
a much more capable group than the first.  We are confident that you will
have no major difficulties in successfully completing your missions.

I would now like to open this briefing to questions.  Yes, Navigator
Eshhh-ahhr.

Eshhh-ahhr: Vice-Director Phexipotex, you mentioned that two ships had
returned from earlier explorations.  Is there anything that you might be
able to tell us of their experiences that would be of interest?

Phexipotex: It so happens that one of the captains of those vessels is here
among us, Captain Thyss Thyrrthynnn of the ISS Hyperion.  Captain, would
you mind standing up and answering this question?

Thysss Thyrrthynnn: Cccertainly. It iss difficult to know wherrre to
beginn.  Ourrr voyage lasssted forr the betterr parrt of two yearrsss.  As
it happened we chose initially to trrravel in a downssspin dirrection with
a 14 degree corewarrd orientationnn.  Ourr firsst encounterr with alien
vesselsss was jusst corewarrd of a G-class ssysstem at 150,64.  We were
sssurrounded by three ssout shippsss of avery peculiarr dessign.  Upon
entering communicationss we were asstonisshed to find that these sshipsss
were manned by Elowannn. We were even morre asstounded to find that the
Elowannn have nnot outfrouwnn theirrr foolish animosity forr the Thrynn as
have the Elowann herre on Arrrth. Thisss wass evedenced by the fact that
ssshortly affter communcationsss were essstablisshed the Elowan ssent uss a
message to the effect that they could detect my pressence annd that of the
otherrr Tyrynn aboarrd the Hyperrionn, wherreupon they immediately
terrminated communicationsss annd opened airre on usss.  Fortunately I had
equipped the Hyperrionn with adequate wweaponrry to handle
thisss...annoyancce.  In fact, I consequenntly found it necessary to
desstroy quite a numberrr of Elowann shipsss; purely in sself-defense of
courssse.  Mossst rregrretable.

Phexipotex: Please! Please! May I have order! I am certain that Captain
Thyrrthynn resorted to the use of force only when absolutely necessary.  I
am confident that she acted only in good faith and never fired the first
shot - is this not so Captain?

Thysss Thyrrthynn: Of courssse.  Though it was necesssary upcon ccertain
occassionsss to...  

Phexipotex:  There, you see?  Now please, may we have some quiet so that
the Captain can continue her narration?

Thysss Thyrrthynnn: Yesss.  Well durring the sssecond month of ourrr
explorationss we altered courrssse and trravelled in an outwarrd and
downsspin dirrection.  It was only a matterrr of weekss before we
encounterred ourr ssecond alienn rrrace.  Thesse alienss werre harrdly
alienn howeverr, for thisss time we had encountered the Thrynn.  It isss a
difficult thing to desscrribe how it feelss to come faccce to faccce with
oness remote ancestorrsss.  To feel that one hass finally come home affter
being lossst for a thoussand yearsss.  After ssspending the nexxt yearr and
an half among my lossst brrotherss and ssistersss it was all that I could
do to forrce mysself to returrn herre.  In fact, both of the otherr Thrynn
on my crrew, ThyssArrla and N'qrrlsss chose to ssstay behinnnd.

Phexipotex:  Question?  Yes, in the back.

G694337:  If I may put a question to Captain Thryrrthynnn.  What did you do
for fuel all this time Captain?  I understand you did not take along enough
to last the entire two years.

Thysss Thyrrthynnn:  Of courrsse.  We did manage to buy a fairrr bit frrom
Ssstarport by doing ssome local ssectorrr mining beforre leaving on ourrr
expeditionn.  During ourr time in Elowannn sspacce we managed to ssalvage
enough ennndurrium from the debris of the shippss we desstroyed in sself
defensse.  We alsso sssalvaged a conssiderable amount of plutoniumm which
the Thrynn willingly trraded forrr fuel.  Finally, with the help of the
Thrynn we managed to llocate a few planetsss with abundant ancient ruinsss.
These we used as refueling basesss for local explorationsss.

Phexipotex:  We have time for one more question.  Ok....yes.

Garan Leb:  A question for you, Vice-Director.  I wonder if you could
explain why it is necessary that we earn the money to build our ship and
crew.  Surely Interstel has the resources to provide us with the best
equipment which would optimize our chance for success.

Phexipotex:  I would like to remind you that Interstel is not a government
controlled organization, nor are we a military operation.  Our resources
are, in fact, limited and we have no way of knowing which few of you will
possess the necessary qualities to successfully command an Interstellar
Starship.  It is not in our best interest to waste what other resources we
have on the rest of you who will, pardon the expression, wash out right
away.  This therefore, is our means of determining who among you is most
capable, while at the same time providing a little personal incentive to
ensure that we get the most from every one of you.

I wish you all the best of luck in your explorations.  Thank you.

PART 1:  General Information

1.1  Objectives

Apart from any other goals you may set for yourself, two goals will be of
primary importance to you.  These are: 1) gathering information 2)
generating revenue.  It should be obvious that the more information you
gather, the more effective your explorations.  As for revenue, capital is
indispensible for building an optimal ship and crew, thereby maximizing
your efficiency.  Interstel offers only a minimum amount of capital at the
outset of your explorations.

You can generate revenue (measured in monetary units or mu's) in a number
of ways. The following is a partial list.  Commanders with an
entrepreneurial bent should find no difficulty expanding the list.  Of
course, space piracy is frowned upon, except in self defense.

1.1.1  Sale of Minerals:   Interstel will purchase any minerals you bring
back.  Some, for example Endurium, are worth more than others.  You will
need to decide which ones are worth bringing back.  The values of minerals
can be found in the Mineral Value Chart in Part 5 ("Planetside") of this
Reference Manual.

1.1.2  Sale of Artifacts:  Interstel will pay for any artifacts you find,
whether contemporary or ancient.  The amount of mu received depends on
Interstel's evaluation of the artifact.  Note that you can repurchase
artifacts previously sold.

1.1.3  Sale of Lifeforms and Lifeform Data:  Alien lifeforms can either be
captured or holographically recorded, and then sold at Starport.  Specimens
bring a higher price than recordings, but take up cargo space.  Interstel
will not purchase specimens or recordings already in its collection.

				1

1.1.4  Recommending Viable Colony Worlds: Superphotonic message drones
installed in the ships can be used to recommend planets that appear
suitable for colonization.  Do not take this responsibility lightly, since
the lives of thousands of colonists may depend upon your recommendation.
When you return to Starport you will be given a report on the suitability
of your recommendations.  Should your recommended planets be found
unsuitable, you will be fined.

The rest of this manual contains valuable information, including
descriptions of the races found on Arth, a list of mineral values, a chart
of specific lifeform evaluations aids, and the criteria to be used in 
determining the suitability of a planet for colonization.  Study it well,
for the future of the galaxy may well depend upon the success of your
mission.

Your kit contains two additional items:  First, the Starmap, an invaluable
guide to the galaxy, provides important information on space coordinates
and interstellar distances.  Keep it handy at all times.  Second, the
Security Code Wheel provides the access code that allows you to leave
Starport.  (This protection was removed in the Amiga version).  See
instructions for its use in the Command Summary reference card.

1.2  Races

You can choose from the following races of Arth when composing your crew.
Each category includes a descriptive synopsis and some characteristic
statistics.  These statistics include:

  Learning Rate: A number from 0 to 10 which represents the number of skill
  points a member of that race acquires from a single training session.

  Durability: A number from 0 to 10 which represents the amount of physical
  damage a member of that race can sustain.

				2

  Inherent Aptitude:  The innate ability for each race in any of the five
  skills.  The range of abilities is Excellent, Good, Average, and Poor. 
  The Initial Value defines the beginning skill levels, and the Maximum
  Value defines the maximum skill level a member of that race is capable of
  attaining.  The values are tabulated as follows:

    |---------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Ability Level	 Initial Value		 Maximum Value      |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------|
    |  Excellent	     50                      250            |
    |  Good                  30                      200            |      
    |  Average		     10			     150            |
    |  Poor 		      0                      100            |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------|

See Section 1.3 ("Skills Overview") for a description of the five essential
skills and their roles in the successful exploration of space.

1.2.1  Human:  Humans are a bi-pedal omnivorous race with smooth skin and a
characteristic matt of scalp hair.  They are 1-1/2 to 2 meters in height,
and are light beige to dark brown in color.  Humans have an internal
skeleton and two small, narrow-set eyes which allow binocular vision.  This
race is particularly aggressive and tenacious.  While moderately weak
physically, Humans are highly flexible mentally and are particularly adept
at theoretical modeling and in applications of logic and inference. 
Finally, although there is a degree of sexual dimorphism in this race, the
differences are insignificant.

	Durability				06
	Learning Rate				09
	Inherent Aptitude:

		Science				Excellent
		Navigation			Good

				3

		Engineering			Good
		Communication			Good
		Medicine			Good


1.2.2  Velox:  The Velox are insect-like creatures with two legs, two arms,
and two intermediate appendages which can serve as either.  They have a
hard, red chitinous exoskeleton, two large compound eyes, and two antennae
which serve as olfactory sensors.  When in an upright position a Velox is
approximately 1-1/2 meters in height if male and 2-1/2 meters if female.
Velox culture is akin to hive culture and they are not known to be
particularly intelligent.  They are, however, exceptionally strong and
durable and they have excellent hand/eye coordination.  These traits, in
conjunction with a well developed spatial sense, make them well suited for
engineering and technical tasks.

	Learning Race				06
	Inherent Aptitude:

		Science				Good
		Navigation			Excellent
		Engineering			Excellent
		Communication			Poor
          	Medicine			Poor


1.2.3  Thrynn: The Thrynn are a bi-pedal, carnivorous, reptilian race. 
Although graceful, with long necks and tails.  They are very muscular and
are covered with tough protective  scales.  They range in color from green
to grey and are approximately 1-1/2 meters in height.  Like Humans, they
have an internal skeleton, and two forward set eyes.  The Thrynn are
cultured and diplomatic, but are said to be devious and cunning.  For no
apparent reason, they harbor an ancient animosity for the Elowan.  The
plant people, in turn, have little love for the 

				4

Thrynn (see note below).  They Thrynn have a fair overall learning rate and
a fair constitution.  They excel in situations involving protocol and
diplomacy.

	Durability				06
	Learning Rate				07
	Inherent Aptitude:

		Science				Good
		Navigation			Good
		Engineering			Good
		Communication			Excellent
		Medicine			Poor


1.2.4  Elowan:  The Elowan are a bi-pedal photosynthetic race, 1 to 2
meters in height. They are willowy and delicate with numerous prehensile
vines.  Their color may range from a light yellowish-green to a deep
greenish blue.  They have two large, compound eyes which are
characteristically a deep reddish-brown. They are highly empathetic and are
particularly creative thinkers. Although weak physically, they excel in
interpersonal skills.  Their excellent learning rate allows them to learn
all skills relatively quickly.

	Durability				02
	Learning Rate				10
	Inherent Aptitude:

		Science				Average
		Navigation              	Good
		Engineering			Average
		Communication			Excellent
		Medicine			Excellent

				5

1.2.5  Android:  Androids are sophisticated automatons and not, strictly
speaking, a race.  Because they are constructed of metals and plastics they
are the most durable of all the races.  At the same time, however, they
cannot benefit from training because their programming is hard-wired and
their skills are set at a fixed efficiency level.  Of the numerous models
available, Interstel uses the popular Biosynthetic DX99 series, best suited
for use in tasks requiring straight-forward computation and linear
analysis.

	Durability				10
	Learning Rate				00
	Fixed Skill Levels:

		Science				50
		Navigation			150
		Engineering			100
		Communication			00
		Medicine			20

Note:  Because of the ancient enmity between the Elowan and the Thrynn, it
is not advisable to include a member of each race on your crew.  Although
the individual members of these two races would undoubtedly deal with each
other civilly on board your ship, you would be unable to communicate with
either race in a space encounter.  This is because the presence of a member
of one race precludes any useful communication with the other race.

1.3  Skills Overview

Crew members (except for Androids, see Races, above) can be trained in five
essential skills:  science, navigation, engineering, communications, and
medicine.  All training is done in Personnel.  A given crew member's
learning rate depends on the learning rate of his or her race.  All skills
are important to the proper functioning of your vessel, with the most
important being Communication, Science and 

				6

Navigation.  Following is a brief description of each skill and its
relevance to your crew.


1.3.1  Science:  Your ship's sensors are your primary means of gathering
information, and it is the duty of the Science Officer to interpret that
information.  The more skilled a Science Officer the more complete and
accurate will be the information from the sensor reading.  This information
can be of vital importance (e.g., an alien vessel's military capability; a
planet's suitability as a potential colony world).  At skill levels greater
than 150, a Science Officer can detect aliens over long distances and can
pinpoint their position.


1.3.2  Navigation:  Navigation is of primary importance to space travel. 
Without an effective Navigator you face the danger of becoming lost in
space.  This may result in the loss of precious time and fuel and may even
place you in hostile territory.  In addition, a skilled navigator (with a
skill level greater than 150) can determine the presence of continuum
fluxes in space. These fluxes are paired and connected by extra-dimensional
worm-holes, so that  by entering one of a pair of fluxes, your vessel will
be transported, almost instantaneously, to the other.  Although continuum
fluxes can be useful in navigation (since a highly-skilled navigator can
take advantage of their ability to transport you instantaneously), than can
also be very hazardous.  A poorly trained Navigator will have difficulty
spotting fluxes and may even cause your vessel to hit one accidentally. 
Navigators with skill levels of 150 or below will not be able to see them
at all.  In addition, after transportation through a flux, it takes the
Navigator time to determine the ship's new position.  The more skilled the
Navigator, the less time it will take and the less risk your crew will
face.  It is the Navigator who fire the ship's missiles and lasers; the
more skilled the navigator, the greater the accuracy of the shot.  
Finally, if your Navigator's skill is less than 200, your terrain vehicle
may become lost during storms on a planets surface.


1.3.3  Engineering:  It is your  Engineer's responsibility to repair any
damage your ship  sustains.  The speed and efficiency with which the
repairs are executed 

				7

depends on the Engineer's skill rating.  In addition, key elements may be
required for repairs, and the longer a repair takes, the higher the
probability that one of these elements will be required.  Repairs must be
suspended until the missing element is obtained.  All the elements that may
be required for repairs can be obtained in the Trade Depot at Starport (see
Part 2, Starport).


1.3.4  Communications:   Alien races will be your primary source of
information. The Communications Officer interprets all communications using
an on-board translating device.  The less skilled the Communications
Officer, the more untranslated material you can expect to receive.  It is
also helpful if your Communications Officer (and to a lesser extent any of
the other crew members) is a member of the alien race with which you are
communicating. Thus, if one of your crew is a member of  the alien race,
your Communications Officer's skill level will be effectively increased by
25 points during the encounter.  And if the Communications Officer happens
to be a member of the alien race, his skill level is effectively increased
by 50 points.


1.3.5  Medicine:  Your Doctor's skill level determines the speed and
efficiency of his medical treatment.  Even though your ship is equipped
with the latest in  Medi-Tech devices, it is the Doctor's skill level that
determines the speed and efficiency of the treatment.  The higher the skill
level, the less time it will take to treat a wound.  All injuries heal
naturally over the course of time at a rate proportional to the Doctor's
skill level. Planetside treatment can never equal shipboard treatment where
the Doctor has access to Medi-Tech equipment.


1.3.6  The  Captain:  Although there is no single "command" skill, your
Captain's combined skill levels in the above five areas contributes to your
ship's apparent power.  A highly skilled  captain  can effectively double
your ship's perceived power.  Also, if any of your crew should be killed,
the next most capable crewmember will take over the dead  crewmember's
functions.  Training your captain can therefore provide backup skills.

PART 2:  Starport

2.1  Overview

The Starport is your stepping stone to the universe, the place where each
new adventure begins and ends.  At the Starport you can select your crew,
outfit your ship, read your messages, make financial arrangements, and
generally take care of all your affairs before launching into space.  The
Starport consists of six independent modules and a docking bay.  Each
module provides you with a number of options, each one corresponding to a
particular operation or activity.  To enter a module, maneuver your
character to the module's entry field (the small area like a welcome mat in
front of the door) and press a key.  See the enclosed Command Summary Card
for details.  The modules are described in detail below. 


2.2  Starport Modules

2.2.1  Operations:  In  Operations you can receive message from Interstel,
and have your colony world recommendations evaluated.  The following
options are available:

  Notices -- This option lets you read the messages in your electronic
  mailbox.  Messages can provide clues regarding alien encounters,
  possible colony world recommendations, locations of continuum fluxes,
  etc.

  Evaluation -- Use this option to evaluate your colony world
  recommendations, and to be informed of fines levied.

  Exit -- Returns you to the Starport amphitheater.

				9

2.2.2  Trade Depot:  At the Trade Depot you can buy or sell commodities or
artifacts, and analyze any artifacts in inventory,  whether your or
Starport's.  The following options are available:

  Buy -- Shows items that are for sale, and their cost per cubic meter.

  Sell -- Shows all the salable items in your inventory except ship
  components.

  Analyze -- Describes all artifacts listed for sale.  Will also
  describe, for a fee, any artifacts in the Depot's inventory, and all
  those in your ship's hold.

  Exit -- Returns you to the Starport amphitheater.


2.2.3  Personnel:  The Personnel module controls the selection and training
of crewmembers, and the maintenance of all personnel files.  The following
options are available:

  Create -- Use this option to select the members of your crew.  You can
  select crewmembers from any of the five races described in Section 
  1.2.  Each crewmember has his or her own personnel file, containing
  statistics on race, skill levels, training and so on.

  Train -- Use this option to train your crewmembers in any of the five
  skill areas  outlined above (see Section 1.3).  Skill levels increase in
  accordance with the following formula:  number of training sessions times
  learning rate.   Note that training is expensive, and that initial 
  capital provided by Interstel may not allow you to train all your
  crewmembers to the highest skill levels.

  Delete -- This option delete all the data from the selected file.
  Note that any funds expended in training a deleted crewmember are not
  refunded upon deleting the file.

				10

  Exit -- Returns you to the Starport amphitheater.


2.2.4  Crew Assignment:  Any assignment or change in the duties of your
crewmembers takes place in the Crew Assignment module.  Here you can page
through your personnel files and make or change any assignments.  Each
crewmember is summarized on the cover of his or her personnel file, which
is displayed on the lower part of the screen.  Duties and current
assignments (if any) are displayed on the upper part of the screen.  You
can assign a crewmember to a particular duty when that crewmember's file is
on the screen.  See your Command Summary Card for details. 


2.2.5  Bank:  Here you can examine your bank records, in the form of your
10 most recent financial transactions, showing dates, descriptions, 
amounts and your ending balance.  If your ending balance is negative, and
you need to buy engines or Endurium, you will need to sell off inventory in
order to leave the Starport.  You may not buy anything on credit.


2.2.6  Ship Configuration:  Here you can outfit your ship, repair damage,
sell old equipment, and name (or rename) you ship.  You can choose from the
following options:

  Buy -- Use this option to outfit your ship with cargo pods, engines,
  shields, missiles and laser cannons.  The following equipment is
  available for purchase (given sufficient funds):

	Cargo Pods:  Cargo pods can hold 50 cubic meters of cargo.  Only
	one class of pod is available, at a cost of 500 mu.  Tip: As
	soon as you can afford it, buy a pod, fill it with fuel and take
	it with you.  It will extend your effective range.

	Engines:  You can choose from five classes of engines, ranging
	from class 1 (1,000 mu) to Class 5 (100,000 mu).  The higher the
	class, the 

				11

	better the fuel efficiency and the greater the ship's acceleration
	during encounters.

	Shielding:  Shields provide protection during combat, and range
	from Class 1 (4,000 mu) to Class 5 (125,000 mu). The higher the
	class, the more effective they are against enemy missiles and
	laser cannons.  Shielding uses energy, and shields need to be
	raised and lowered (by the Navigator) as circumstances dictate.
	(A good Navigator should not be caught with his shields down, but
	neither should he keep them raised unnecessarily).  In addition,
	shields are more expensive than armor (see below), and they do
	not function in nebulas.  On the positive side, shields do not
	slow your ship down with a lot of weight (as does armor), they
	can be repaired if damaged, and they automatically recharge
	slowly during each encounter.

	Armor:  Armor provides alternative protection during combat.
	Unlike shields (see above, armor weighs a great deal and will
	slow your vessel down.  In addition, armor cannot be repaired
	when damaged, and must be replaced.  On the positive side, armor
	is cheaper than shielding (Class 1:  1,500 mu to Class 5 25,000
	mu), it is always in place, and continues to function in nebulas.

	Missiles:  Missiles cost more than lasers (see below), they can
	be dodged, and they use five times as much energy when fired.  On
	the positive side, missiles inflict three times the damage of
	lasers, and they are effective at long range.  Missile launchers
	cost more than laser cannons, ranging from 12,000 mu to 200,000
	mu.

	Lasers:  Lasers are strictly short range weapons, and they
	inflict less damage than missiles.  On the other hand, laser
	cannons are cheaper that missile launchers (ranging from 8,000 to
	150,000 mu), and they cannot be dodged.

				12

	Sell -- This option lets you sell the components of your ship, so
	you can buy a higher (or lower) class item.  Note that depreciation
	begins the moment you buy an item, so that your selling price will
	always be lower than your purchase price (with the possible
	exception of cargo pods).

	Repair -- This option offers you quick dry-dock repairs.  Be
	prepared for the high cost of this convenience.

	Name -- Use this option to name or rename your ship.  Unchristened
	ships may not leave Starport.

	Exit -- Returns you to the Starport amphitheater.


2.2.7  Docking Bay:  When you are ready to launch your ship into space,
maneuver your character onto the docking bay in the center of the
amphitheater (see Figure 1) and press a key.  Starport will direct you from
there.  Remember to keep your Security Code Wheel handy as you leave
Starport.

				13


The Ship's Console is divided into four main areas.  The Main View Screen,
the central viewing area for the main spatial displays and communications;
the Auxiliary View Screen, for viewing ship status and sensor information;
the Control Panel for executing commands through an array of buttons; and
the Text Window, where all the text messages are displayed.  These four
areas are described in detail below.  An additional area, above Main
Screen, displays your coordinates in space.  The first number displays your
horizontal position, and the second your vertical position.


3.1.1  Main View Screen:  This screen displays spacial and communications
information.  On it your computer will display tactical information during
encounters, contour maps of planets from orbit, and planet and stars during
system and hyperspace travel.  Planet size as reflected on this screen is
to scale.


3.1.2  Auxiliary View Screen:  This screen displays Stars and Sensor  data
from your Science Officer, Officer, and Damage and Repair information from
your Engineer.  You will also see system maps, Mercator projections and
malfunction alerts displayed here.


3.1.3  Control Panel:  The Control Panel can execute all the main ship
commands through an array of buttons.  Here you can select a crew member,
and then select a function associated with that crew member.


3.1.4  Text Window:  All text messages,  both incoming and outgoing, are
presented here.  When you enter a System the Text Window displays the
following information:

	Spectral Class:  See Spectral Chart.
	Ecosphere:  The band of acceptable radiation around a star, capable
	of sustaining lifebearing planets.  Given in terms of orbital
	position. (e.g., Ecosphere, 2-4).

				14

3.2  Flight Operations

Ship Functions are accessed via the Control Panel.  Each crewmember
controls a specific set of ship functions.  To access a particular
function, you first need to select the appropriate crewmember.  Following
is a brief description of all available functions classified by crewmember.


3.2.1  Captain:  The Captain is the ultimate authority both in space and at
Starport.  The Captain decides when to launch or land the ship, which
planets to recommend to  Interstel, and when to disembark.  When you select
Captain from the Control Panel, you are provided with the following
options:

  Launch/Land -- This option reads Launch until the ship has launched
  from Starport or a planet, after which it reads Land.  The ship can
  only land from orbit.  Choosing Land presents you with the following
  options:

	Select Site:  Allows you to select a promising landing site on
	the planet's surface.  Move the cursor, using the arrow keys,
	over the target landing site.  The planetary coordinates of the
	cursor's position will also be shown.  You will be aided by a map
	is a topography key.  The color of the top bar represents the
	highest altitude, the bottom color represents liquid terrain.
	While it is possible to land and travel in liquid terrain it is
	not recommended, since fuel efficiency is low and there are no
	minerals lifeforms to ruins to be found.

	Note:  Generally, lifeforms tend to cluster in temperate climes
	at the lower altitudes, and minerals are found in much greater
	density at higher altitudes.

	Descend:  This option engages the autopilot.  Descent to a
	Planet's surface is automatic once the landing coordinates have
	been chosen in the Select Site option.

				15

	Abort:  Returns you to Captain's option screen.

  Disembark -- This option allows the crew to leave the ship when it has
  landed on a planet or docked at Starport.

  Cargo -- This option allows the Captain to examine the current cargo
  list, jettison undesired items, and pick up debris from destroyed
  alien  spaceships.  Note that any item jettisoned is considered
  destroyed and cannot be recovered.  Note also that messages obtained
  from ruins are considered cargo.

  Log Planet -- This option allows the Captain to recommend a planet to
  Arth for colonization via a superphotonic homing drone.
  Recommendations may be made either from orbit or from the planet's
  surface but can only be made once for any given planet.

  Ship's Log -- This option allows the Captain to read from and write to
  a personal ship's log.  There is a limited amount of space in the log.
  To quit this option move to EXIT and press the Return key.

  Bridge -- This option is the same for all crew members, and restores
  you to the Control Panel so you can choose another function.


3.2.2  Science Officer:  The Science Officer is responsible for gathering
and analyzing all relevant information about the status and condition of
the ship and well as its surroundings.  When Science Officer is selected
from the Control Panel, the following options become available:

  Sensor -- This option provides various items of information, depending
  on current status or location.  The Sensor is one of the main sources
  of information about your ship, alien ships, and planets.  The
  following information is available through the sensor, classified by
  location:

				16

	In Orbit:

		Auxiliary View Screen:

			Mass:  Mass of planet (in tons).

				Bio:  Percentage of life density.

				Min:  Percentage of mineral density.

				Note:   100%  life  or  mineral  density 
				would  be the maximum  possible under that
				planet's geologic and life sustaining
                                conditions.

		Text Window:

			Atmosphere:  Lists the main components of a
			planet's atmosphere, in decreasing order (i.e.,
			first listed is the primary component, etc.).

                        Hydrosphere:  Major components of a planet's
			liquid surface area.

                        Lithosphere:  Major minerals to be found on a
			planet's land surface area.

	During an Alien Encounter

		Auxiliary View Screen:

			Mass:  Mass of alien ship (in tons).

			Bio:  Displays percentage of undamaged
			Lifeforms on board the alien vessel.  If 50 percent
			of the Lifeforms are dead, the display will read
			50.

				17

			Energy:  Undamaged percentage of alien ship.

		Text Window:

			Object  Constituents:  Displays the composition of
			the alien vessel.


  Analysis -- Use this option ot have the Science Officer present his
  analysis of sensor data he has gathered.  Note that the Science
  Officer needs to take the corresponding sensor reading before you can
  exercise this option.  Analysis data is given below classified by
  location.

	In Orbit

		Text Window:

			Orbit Number:  Each star has eight possible orbit
			positions, ranging from Orbit Position #1 (the
			closest to the star) to Orbit Position # 8 (the
			furthest from the star).  The Orbit Number refers
			to the orbit position (or slot) occupied by the
			planet you are orbiting.  Not all positions are
			occupied, so it is possible that a planet may
			appear to be the third planet from the star, when
			in fact it is occupying Orbit Position #5.

                      	Predominant Surface:  The planet's primary surface
			constituent.

			Gravity:  Shows the planet's gravitational force. 
			A gravity of more than 8.0 g's will crush you hull
			if you attempt to land on the planet.

			Atmosphere:  Shows the primary constituents of the
			planet's atmosphere.

			Temperature:  Shows the planet's possible
			temperature range.

			Global  Weather:  Shows the predominant global
			weather conditions.

				18

	During an Alien Encounter

		Text Window:

			Object:  States the general nature of the object.
			(e.g., SHIP)

			Type:  States the general type of the object. 
			(e.g., SCOUT)

			Size:  Gives the size of the object (in relation to
			the size of your ship).

                     	Shields:  Gives the alien vessel's shield status
			(e.g., Equivalent of Class 3, raised).

			Weapons Status:  Shows whether the alien vessel's
			weapons are armed.


  Status -- This option presents the ship's General Status on the Auxiliary
  View Screen.  The following information is provided on the Auxiliary View
  Screen:

	Date:  Day.Hour-Month-Year.

	Damage:  Amount of damage sustained by your ship.

	Cargo:  Percentage of cargo hold full.

	Energy:  Displays amount of  Endurium  remaining, in cubic meters.

	Shields:  States whether shields are up to down.

	Weapons:  States whether weapons are armed or unarmed.

  Bridge -- Return to Control Panel.


3.2.3  Navigator:  The Navigator is responsible for maneuvering the ship
through space, for raising and lowering the ship's shields, and for arming
or disarming the ship whenever necessary.  In addition, the Navigator is
responsible 
	
				19

for firing your ship's weapons during combat.  When you choose Navigator
from the Control Panel, the following options become available:

	Maneuver or Leave Orbit -- This option engages the navigational
	controls.  Once engaged, you can maneuver your ship by using the
	appropriate keys.  See your Command Summary Card for details.

	Raise Shield/Drop Shield -- This option reads Raise Shield when the
	shields are down and Drop Shield when they are up.  Shields use
	energy while they are up.

	Arm/Disarm -- This option reads Arm when weapons are disarmed and
	Disarm when the are armed.  Weapons must be armed before firing.

	Combat or Fire Weapon -- This option allows the Navigator to fire
	the ship's weapons, once they have been armed (see above).  Once
	Combat has been engaged, you can aim by swiveling the nose of the
	ship.  Your ship also has a limited Maneuver capability while in
	the Combat option.   If your ship has more than one kind of weapon,
	the on-board combat computer will fire the most appropriate one,
	depending on the range of the target.  See Command Summary Card.

	Bridge -- Return to Control Panel.


3.2.4  Engineer:  The Engineer is responsible for surveying any damage to
the ship and for repairing it.  Highly skilled engineers are capable of
repairing more than their lesser counterparts.  When you select Engineer
from the Control Panel, the following options become available:

	Damage -- This option displays the Engineer's damage report on the
	Auxiliary View Screen Graphs indicate percent of damage for each
	section of the ship.  Note that percent of damage is also equal to
	the percentage  proba-

				20

	bility that the damaged section will fail altogether.  Thus if a
	section of the ship has sustained 50 per cent damage, there is a 50
	per cent probability of a total malfunction of that section.

	Repair -- This option allows the Engineer to repair damaged sections.

	Bridge -- Return to Control Panel.

	Amiga, Atari ST and Mac users have these additional options:

	Up -- Moves highlight to the systems above.

	Down -- Moves highlight to the systems below.

	Select -- Lets you use a mouse to select a system.


3.2.5  Communications Officer:  The Communications Officer is responsible
for all communications with Interstel as well as with alien life forms
encountered in space.  The higher a Communications Officer's skill, the
more efficient the communications.  See Section 4.2 below for more
information on alien space encounters.  When you select communications
Officer, you are presented with the following options:

	Hail/Respond -- This reads Hail unless you have already been hailed
	by another vessel, in which case it would read Respond.  All
	Communications activity is carried out through this option.  When
	you Hail/Respond you can adopt one of the following postures:

		Friendly
		Hostile
		Obsequious

	Your message will be transmitted in accordance with the chosen
	posture.  Becoming friendly with aliens can give you access to new
	information.  When 

				21

	you Respond (as appropriate), you can choose from:

		Statement:  If you wish to make a statement of some kind. 
		Note that statements are more likely to affect the alien's
		attitudes than are questions.

		Question:  If you wish to ask a question.  You can choose
		from the following possible areas of inquiry:

			Themselves
			Other Races
			Old Empire
			Ancients
			General Information

		Posture:  To change your posture.  You do not need to
		select this if you wish to maintain the same posture.

		Terminate:  To terminate communications.

	Distress  --  Launches a superphotonic homing drone to Starport. 
	This results in your ship and crew being put in stasis and towed
	home by another Starport vessel.  These is a stiff fee for this
	service, which	will vary depending on the distance you are towed.

	Bridge -- Return to Control Panel.


3.2.6  Doctor:  The ship's doctor is responsible for examining and treating
injured crewmembers.  The higher the doctor's skill level, the faster the
cure. Selecting Doctor from the Control Panel provides you with the
following options:

	Examine -- This option allows the Doctor to study a readout of the
	physical condition of any of the crewmembers.  IBM: Press the up or
	down arrow to view other crewmembers.  C64 users:  Use the joystick
	to view other crewmembers.

				22

	Treat -- This option allows the Doctor to treat injured
	crewmembers.  Even though natural healing will occur on board ship,
	selecting Treat will speed up the process.

	Bridge -- Return to Control Panel.

	Amiga, Atari ST and Mac users have these additional options:

	Up -- Moves highlight to the crewmember above.

	Down -- Moves highlight to the crewmember below.

	Select -- Lets you use the mouse to select a crewmember.


PART 4:  Space

4.1  General Information

All navigation and maneuvering in space is effected with the help of the
main View Screen displays generated by the on-board computer.  The computer
provides spatial information at four different levels, as follows:


4.1.1  Hyperspace:  This is where interstellar travel occurs.  When you are
in Hyperspace you can see stars (see  Starmap), continuum fluxes, and
nebulae.  Note that the size of a star in hyperspace varies with its
spectral class (see Appendix A).


4.1.2  Star Approach:  Approaching a star lets you enter its solar system.
To return to Hyperspace, simply maneuver past the edge of a system.  


4.1.3  Planet Approach:  Approaching a planet lets you establish an orbit
around it.  To enter into orbit around a planet, press any key when you are
over 

				23

the planet's center.  To leave a planet's orbit, use the Navigator's
Maneuver option (The same applies to exit Starport).  A planet's color or
pattern indicates its primary surface type (see Appendix A).


4.1.4  Tactical Level:  The Tactical level is automatically obtained
whenever an encounter occurs with an alien vessel.  You can enter the
Tactical level from Hyperspace, from the solar system, or from orbit.  To
leave an encounter you must continue traveling until the alien craft is no
longer visible on the screen.


4.2  Alien Encounters

You can encounter alien vessels at any time, even when you are in
Hyperspace.  When that happens, you automatically drop from Hyperspace.  If
you need to quit an encounter, enter your Navigator's Maneuver mode and
move away from  the alien ship until it is no longer visible on your view
screen.  Note that during an encounter, the alien ship can scan your ship
and analyze your strengths and weaknesses, just as you can theirs.  In
particular, they can detect if your shields are up and whether or not your
weapons are armed.  These may be interpreted as hostile gestures.


4.2.1  Communications:  Communicating  with  aliens  can  be an
enlightening experience, to say the least.  The main points on alien
communication have already been covered in Section  3.2.3.   

Not all races respond optimally to the Friendly posture.  Experiment with
different postures until you discover the most effective approach for each
race.  Make notes of any information you receive during each encounter,
including information on the success or failure of a particular posture, as
well as general information that can help you complete your mission.  Once
you develop friendly relations with a race, they will be willing to give
you more information.

				24

Not  every  member of a given race will have the same knowledge  and 
information as any other member of that race.  Feel free to ask others the
same question.


4.2.2  Combat:  The  greater the number of combat incidences with any race,
the less likely it is that you will ever be able to establish friendly
communications with that race.  It sometimes pays to be friendly, or even
obsequious, if that doesn't offend your sense of dignity.  

Some alien vessels are impervious to certain kinds of weapons, so even a
direct hit may amount to nothing against a vessel immune to that kind of
weapon.  Experience will guide you on the correct choice of weapon under
the circumstances.  And while you may be able to evade missile attacks, you
cannot evade laser fire.  

It is not always desirable to completely destroy alien vessels during
combat.  If you cease combat and enter communications, the aliens may
surrender and tell you anything you want to know.

When the smoke settles from a hostile encounter (and  if you emerge
victorious) you can pick up any item of debris from the destroyed alien
spacecraft.  Have your Navigator Maneuver over to the craft, and then exit
Maneuver.  Enter the Captain mode, and select the Cargo option.  Pick up
any valuable debris.

For  more detailed information, refer to the Combat option of the Navigator
mode Section 3.2.3.

				25

PART 5:  Planetside

5.1  Planetfall  

As Captain, you can give orders to make planetfall via the Land Option.
When you select Land, you are presented with the options Site Select and
Descend, as well as a Mercator Projection of the surface of the planet.
Site Select allows you to choose your landing site, while Descend engages
the auto-approach  sequence.  See the Spectral and Planet Surface Charts is
Appendix A for selecting favorable planets and suitable landing sites.


5.2  Planetside 

Once on the surface of the planet you have a number of options available.
These are listed at the bottom of the screen:  Maps, Move, Cargo, Look,
Scan, Weapons, and Icons.

5.2.1  Maps:  Your Terrain Vehicle is equipped with numerous sensors as
well as an on board computer.  This computer is capable of generating
contour maps of the terrain at three levels of magnification.  You can
toggle between these three levels by pressing any key.  The colors (or
patterns) on these maps represent different altitudes and surface types.
The key for these can be seen whenever the contour map is up.  It is a good
idea to check Maps after the message Scanning New Terrain appears on the
screen.  Use right arrow key to leave this option.

5.2.2 Move:  This option returns control of the Terrain Vehicle's movement.
Your terrain vehicle has a small reserve fuel supply sufficient to take you
from 5 to 25 "steps" depending on terrain.  Fuel efficiency is a function
of altitude -- the higher the altitude, the less the efficiency.   See your
Command Summary Card for more details of moving.

				26

5.2.3  Cargo:  This presents you with a list of all the cargo you are
carrying and gives you the option of dropping anything.  When an object is
dropped on a planet's surface it can be picked up again.  Cargo also allows
you to pick up any item (including Lifeforms) next to your terrain vehicle,
record messages found in Ruins, and make holographic recordings of
Lifeforms.  (C64 users:  There are no holographic captures.)  You must be
directly beside an object to put it into Cargo.  Any messages you find are
identified by the date found.  The cargo hold has a capacity of 50 cubic
meters.


5.2.4  Look:  This option places a moveable cursor on the tactical map,
allowing you to examine any part of the terrain.  


5.2.5  Scan:  This option places a moveable cursor on the tactical map,
allowing you to scan the terrain using your sensors.  The results of your
scanning are made available in a readout.  Only lifeforms can be scanned.
Note that lifeforms are not distributed evenly over the planet's surface,
but tend to clump in the lower elevations near the equator or other
temperate areas.  The configuration of lifeforms on a planet is consistent
with that planet's gravity.


5.2.6  Weapons:  Your Terrain Vehicle is equipped with a laser and a
stunner.   You can choose which one to fire through the Weapons option.


5.3  Planetary Conditions

Recommending a planet for colonization requires assessment of a number of
variables.   Remember that if you recommend a planet as habitable and it
turns out to be otherwise, you can incur heavy penalties.  The following is
a set of guidelines to help you make the right recommendations.

				27

5.3.1  Temperature:  Some portion of the planet must fall within an
acceptable temperature range.  The following table shows the range of
temperatures:

	SUB-ARCTIC
        ARCTIC
	TEMPERATE
	TROPICAL 
	SEARING
	INFERNO

Parts of a planet must fall within the highlighted range to be suitable for
colonization.


5.3.2  Gravity:  The gravity of a planet must not be "crushing" and it is
preferable if it is lighter than "very heavy." Gravity must be below 2.0
g's for a planet to be suitable for colonization --- .7 to 1.3 is optimal.


5.3.3  Atmosphere:  The  planet must have an atmosphere and the atmosphere
must contain Oxygen.


5.3.4  Water:  There must be at least a minimal amount of free water.


5.3.5  Atmospheric Activity:  Planets with violent or very violent
atmospheric activity are unacceptable.  The following chart can serve as a
guide:

	NONE
	CALM 
	MODERATE 
	VIOLENT
	VERY VIOLENT

Weather conditions must be within the highlighted area to make a planet
suitable for colonization.

				28

5.3.6  Bio-density:  Planets with a higher bio-density are more preferable
but this is not a necessity.


5.3.7  Minerals:  Planets with abundant mineral deposits are also
preferable, although this, too, is not a necessity.

Note:  A planet may be suitable in a number of ways but have just one
feature that makes it untenable as a colony world.

4.  LIFEFORM VALUE CRITERIA CHART

Use the following five criteria for judging the value of a lifeform:

New  Species:   It  must  be a species not previously captured or recorded.
Intelligence:   The more intelligent it is, the more valuable.  
Niche:  	The higher its position on the food chain, the more
		valuable it is.
Size:           The bigger it is, the more valuable.
Distance:       The farther away from Arth, the greater the lifeform's
		value.

Note:  You cannot capture flying or floating lifeforms.

       Appendix C:  Excerpt from the Religious Writings of Arth


The Book of Endurium

Chapter One:  The Years of Darkness (and Chaos).  Verses 1-6.


1.   In  the  beginning  there  was darkness...  or was there light...  no,
     there was darkness.  Anyway, then Man came on the scene and verily did
     he create a great spacefaring empire and unto him...  you know I'm
     almost positive there was darkness in the beginning.

2.   Well, so anyhow, man spreadeth wide and extended himself amongst the
     heavenly bodies of the universe, and it was good (really, in fact, it
     was great!).  And thereby and thusly did he findeth the other races. 
     And unto his Empire did he take them, and yea did he accepteth them
     almost as equals.

3.   And for a time there was rejoicing and forsooth all has hunky dorey.
     The, upon Mankind was there laid the greatest of catastrophes and he
     was bummed.  The lands trembled and the skies burned and Yea
     destruction was brought down upon the Empire of Man.

4.   And in the fall of this righteous an glorious empire did the other
     races seize upon the opportunity to express their disapproval of
     mankind's ways and verily did they slaughter billions of his number. 
     And following this were the Dark Years of Chaos.

5.   Woe and Yea and Woe were these years not dark, and were they not also
     chaotic?  Verily were they chaotic and dark.  In these years was there
     the darkness of chaos and the chaos of darkness.  Both the darkness
     and the chaos were like unto no darkness or chaos as had been seen
     before.

				33

6.  And from this dark chaos, which as both chaotic and dark, were born the
    colonial worlds of Noah, which were like unto children of the empire. 
    And among these worlds, which were like unto siblings, as Arth, and its
    moons were like unto children of Arth, which were like unto
    grandchildren of the Empire, and first cousins of the other colonial
    worlds.


Chapter Two:  The Prophecy.  Verses 1-4


1.  And Yea shall Arth be plunged into dark years of chaos.  I say unto
    thee Yea.  Yea!  Shall these years be dark and chaotic and unto the
    other dark years of chaos.  Woe, shall they be even more dark and more
    chaotic. Verily shall they be so dark and so chaotic it can not even be
    imagined how dark and chaotic they shall be.

2.  Long and long shall these years of darkness and chaos be.  And then
    from these dark years shall there arise a new Arth and a New Council
    and lo, they shall be new.  And the, within the bowels of Arth shall
    there once again be movement.  Yea, and proudly shall man once again
    walk the corridors of the children of Noah.

3.  And within these corridors shall he once again findeth the Rock of the
    Ancients, which was first found by Man within the ruins of the Ancients
    wherein they did dwell and live and generally hang out, long and long
    ago. Praise be to the Ancients who were like unto...  Well, who were
    like unto nothing in particular, and who did walketh amongst the stars
    before even mankind was a twinkle in the cosmic eye of reality.

4.  Hail Endurium, oh holiest of rock-like, high-yield energy materials! Oh
    beauteous shining Rock of Truth!  Praise be to that holy legacy of the
    Ancients for in it shall mankind once again findeth his destiny amongst
    the stars!

So it is written.

        Appendix D:  Excerpts from Captain's Log --  Noah 2 Expedition


1100 hrs.  3-22-3454

We are exactly 9 hours away from Earth and the crew is completely
exhausted.  It has been four hours since we were attacked by the Gazurtoid
ships and I am going to Yellow Alert so that some of the crew can get some
rest.  While the ship has sustained major damage, all systems are
operational and there are, miraculously, no casualties.

I am afraid that in my optimism I have made a grave error in judgement and
endangered the lives of all aboard.  In selecting our course I was fully
aware of the fact that the primary jump link would leave us just outward of
the Staff Constellation; lately there has been a good deal of Gazurtoid
activity in that area.  Since the link was only about 8 sectors from the
Sol System, however, and since there existed a secondary link which would
deposit us in the immediate vicinity of Arth in a matter of hours, I
foolishly decided to risk an encounter rather than spend weeks in
hyperspace.

The moment we dropped out of the Flux we were under attack.  Our missiles
had little or no effect on the Gazurtoid ships.  Apparently they have
devised some new form of shield against missile attacks.  Fortunately, we
accidentally hit another Flux just upspin and core-ward of the first one. 
Our Navigator has just located our position and we are at 189,190. This
puts us quite a long way from out destination, but we are alive.  With luck
and no more surprises we should reach Arth in approximately two days.

Captain out.

                     Appendix E:  Timeline


With the information we've discovered in the underground colony ruins our
researchers have been able to piece together a timeline which we feel is
fairly accurate.  We are still not sure about a lot of the details, and
many of the references are obscure.  We are hoping that from your
explorations you may be able to provide us with enough data to fill in all
the remaining gaps.

2100 - Man discovers Endurium.

2150 - Man discovers Endurium's application to superphotonic technology and
       begins exploring.  Colonization beings.  Start of Empire.

2300 - Man meets Velox.

2650 - Major Endurium finds usher in Empire's Golden era.

2675 - Empire discovers Spemin.

2770 - Empire discovers Thyrnn and Elowan.

3000 - Start of first wave (?).

3120 - Velox pact of 3120.

3260 - First wave (?) ends.

3400 - Start of second wave (?).

3450 - Project Noah is initiated.

3454 - Launch of Noah 2 expedition.

				36

3480 - Fall of Earth.

3505 - Bomb hit Arth, creates Southern Hot Zone and forces underground
       colonists above ground.

3520 - Arth society collapses and the Dark Years begin.

4400 - Arth's new era begins with the new council and the industrial
       revolution.

4500 - Rediscovery of space flight (sublight).

4594 - Discovery of Noah 2 colony and Endurium.

4615 - First group sent out in superphotonic ships.

4620 - Present day.

                       Command Summary Card

Getting Started

To play Starflight, you need a computer with at least one floppy disk drive
and 512K of free memory.  Your machine must be operating with Kickstart 1.2
or 1.3.

Loading Starflight

Before you begin play, MAKE A COPY OF THE PROGRAM DISK.  The program isn't
copy protected, so if you play on the original disk, you'll alter it
forever.  Make a copy now and put the original away in a safe place. 
You'll need a blank, initialized floppy disk.  Note:  You cannot install
Starflight onto a hard drive.

To make a copy of the Program Disk:

1.  Turn on your computer.  (Amiga 1000 owners, insert Kickstart 1.2 or
    1.3.)

2.  Insert Workbench into DF0:

3.  If you have a single drive system, remove Workbench and insert the
    Starflight Disk.  If you have two drives, simply insert the Starflight
    Disk into the other drive.

4.  Place the mouse pointer on the Starflight disk icon and click to
    highlight it.

5.  Pull down the Workbench menu from the menu bar.  Drag the highlighted
    bar down to Duplicate and release.

6.  Follow the onscreen instructions.  You'll need to swap disks from time
    to time.  After copying, you don't need to rename the disk.

To start playing:

1.  Turn on your computer.  (Amiga 1000 owners, insert Kickstart 1.2 or
    1.3).

2.  When the computer asks for Workbench, insert your copy of the
    Starflight Disk instead.  Press the spacebar to get past the splash
    screen and Interstel Police Warning.

3.  The Load Game screen will appear.  Select the game you want to play (if
    you're playing Starflight for the first time, select Game 1).  Select
    Load.

4.  If you're starting a new game, the Starport screen will appear.  See
    Additions to the Manual on this Command Summary Card.

Selecting Commands

You run your starship and command your crew selecting options from the
screen.  Point the mouse cursor to the option you want (the pointing hand
icon indicates that your mouse is over an option).  To select an option,
click (quickly press and release) a mouse button.

Selecting Options Using the Keyboard

To move the cursor using the keyboard, hold down the Amiga key and press a
cursor key (<- -> /|\ \|/).  Holding down Shift-Amiga and pressing a cursor
key moves the cursor in large increments.  Pressing Amiga-Alt is equivalent
to clicking the mouse.

Almost every option on a screen also has a key assigned to it - pressing
that key automatically selects that option.  The key is usually the first
letter of the option.  For example, pressing S while in Starport
automatically selects Ship Construction.  Note:  The same key may have a
different function in different places.  For instance, pressing S from the
Bridge of your starship selects Science Officer.  See Keyboard Commands on
this Command Summary Card.

Scrolling

Occasionally, you're presented with lists of items (in Cargo, the Trade
Depot, etc.).  You can scroll through lists by pressing the up/down cursor
keys (/|\ \|/) to move the highlighted bar to the item you want.  You can
also scroll by clicking on the arrow icons to the right of the list.  Press
Amiga-Alt or click a mouse button to select the highlighted item.

Continuing Messages

The hourglass informs you that the game is pausing to do something (for
example, Launch).  The hourglass also appears when the game pauses to let
you read a message.  Click a mouse button or press any key to continue the
message.

Confirming Commands

Occasionally questions appear in the Text Window asking you to confirm

				2

commands.  You can move the mouse until the appropriate answer appears on
the screen.  Click once to answer.  You can also confirm commands from the
keyboard by pressing Y to answer Yes and N to answer No.

Game Options

The Game Options menu lets you save, begin, load, or quit a game.  You can
also turn music and sound effects on and off here.  Game Options can be
selected anytime except inside a Starport Module or when selecting a
landing site.  To bring up the Game Options, press Esc or click the
Interstel icon anywhere it appears on the screen (usually somewhere on the
left side of the screen).  When the menu appears, select one of the
following:

	Resume Game -- Returns you to the game without saving.

	Save Game -- Saves your current progress in the game.  You can save
		up to five games, identified by the numbers 1-5.  Select
		the number you want to designate your current game and
		select Save.  When you save, you permanently erase any game
		you previously saved under that number.  Note:  You can't
		save while on planets.

	Load Game -- Loads a previously saved game.  Select the game you
		want to continue (Game 1-5) and select Load. 

	New Game -- Begins a new game.  Select the game you want to start
		over (Game 1-5) and select New.  This erases any game you
		may have saved under that number.

	Quit -- Quits the game.  When you select quit, you're given a
		choice of saving before exiting.

	Sound On -- Click on the button to turn the sound on and off.  When
		the button to the left is filled, the sound is on.

Pausing the Game

You can pause the game by bringing up the Game Options (see above).

Security Access Code Wheel

YOU MUST ENTER A SECURITY ACCESS CODE when requested by Interstel Security
at launch.  The access code consists of three variables: a location, an
artifact, and a race.  Locations are on the rim of the outer wheel;
artifacts are on the rim of the inner wheel.  Races appear below the
cut-out windows on the inner wheel.  Use the wheel like this:

				3

	1)  When the request appears on the screen, find the location on
            the outer wheel.  Line it up with the artifact on the inner
            wheel.

	2)  Without changing the alignment, find the race on the inner
	    wheel.  The correct access code is visible in the window above
            the race name.  Type the access code and press Return.

Example: Suppose Interstel Security requests the code for Akteron, Black
Box, Uhlek.  To find the correct access code, line up Akteron with Black
Box.  Look in the window above Uhlek on the inner wheel.  The correct
answer in this case is 22917.

Movement

In the Amiga version, there is no Maneuver option under Navigator.  Use the
mouse to move your starship in hyperspace and your terrain vehicle while on
planets.  Move the mouse cursor to the Main View Screen - the pointer turns
into an arrow.  Point the arrow in the direction you want to travel and
click or hold down a mouse button.  You can also use the numeric keypad on
your keyboard to move your terrain vehicle and starship.

                       
                        \        |        /
                         (----)(----)(---)
                         | 7  || 8  || 9 |
                         (----)(----)(---)
                         (----)(----)(---)
                      ---| 4  ||  5 || 6 |--
                         (----)(----)(---)
                         (----)(----)(---)
                         | 1  )(  2 || 3 |
                         (----)(----)(---)
                        /        |        \
                                                     
WARNING:  Starflight has a large keyboard buffer that temporarily stores
keyboard commands that the computer can't readily execute.  Because of
this, your starship or terrain vehicle may continue moving after you've
released the movement key.  Instead, use cruise control.

Cruise Control

Cruise control lets you travel in a direction without holding down the
mouse button or a movement key.  You can activate cruise control while
traveling in hyperspace, through a system, or on a planet.  Select the
cruise control icon or press 0 on the numeric keypad to set your ship or
terrain vehicle on cruise control; use the mouse or numeric keypad to set
the direction of travel.  To deactivate cruise control, select the icon
again or press 0.
