Quick Start Guide
-----------------
We are sure that you are anxious to get blasting the aliens right away. We 
would advise you however, to become familiar the rules and their 
implementation before you do. Knowing that this advice will generally be 
ignored, we have included a 'Quickstart' mode which allows you to play the 
first mission with all chapters armed with a default set of weapons, 
equipment and order. All you will need to do is select the number of 
players. This is done by clicking on the 'Chapter Select' Icon on the
Main Options Screen. This takes you to the screen showing a picture of the 
three chapters in action. Each player must click one of the pictures, and 
the appropriate door will close. When each player has done this, the last 
player should click on the double arrow in the bottom right hand corner, 
which will return them to the Main Options Screen, where a new 'Start 
Mission Icon will have appeared. Click on this to begin the first mission.

THE IMPERIUM
------------
More than 25 millennia ago mankind took the first tentative steps to the 
stars. With the discovery of the Warp drive came the Great Expansion. What 
was once a journey of several centuries became a journey of several days.

Warp Space
----------
Warp space is the parallel universe through which starships may jump, 
travelling hundreds of thousands of light years in a few hours. Warp space 
is also the domain of Chaos. In Warp space nothing may be taken for granted. 
It is a universe filled with cross-currents, eddies and whirlpools of power.
Ships have disappeared without reason, and emerged from the Warp centuries 
after they entered it, millions of light years from their destination. These 
derelict starships, distorted beyond all recognition, are known as space 
hulks.

The Age of Strife
-----------------
During the Great Expansion man reached ever further into the stars. In time 
the hidden power of the Warp came to be noticed. By entering Warp space man 
had awoken an ancient evil: the minions of Chaos had escaped the Warp. The 
first great war known as the Age of Strife, had begun.

For more than five thousand years, warfare wracked mankind, nation battled 
with nation, planet fought planet, system destroyed system. Abandoned 
colonies perished by the scores whilst aliens plundered and grew fat on the 
wreck of humanity.

Then came a saviour. The Age of Strife, arguably the greatest time of 
peril man has ever faced, brought forth the greatest man history has 
recorded - the man who would be known as the Emperor Of Human Spaee. A 
shrewd diplomat, he gathered the fragments of human society and formed 
them into the Empire. A brilliant soldier, he conquered and reclaimed the 
worlds lost to Chaos. For this task he created the space marines, the 
greatest warriors of all.

The Legiones Asartes is the official title of the warrior organisation 
known as the space marines. Its warriors are acknowledged as the most 
powerful and feared fighting men in the Imperium.

In numerical terms the space marines are a small force, but their superhuman 
ability and fearsome reputation make them worth many times their own number 
in conventional troops. They are held in are throughout the Empire.

Space marines are organised into self-contained chapters, each with its 
own fleet. A chapter's fleet provides accommodation, training facilities, 
machine shops, armories, shuttle silos and every other facility the chapter 
requires. The fleet roams through the galaxy in pursuit of the enemies of 
mankind. Task forces break away from it for individual missions or 
campaigns, and rejoin the fleet when their mission is accomplished.  


Space Marine Equipment
----------------------
Space marines have access to the full range of Imperial weaponry and 
equipment. The distinctive space marine you armour protects them in all 
environments and is capable of withstanding direct hits from all but the 
most powerful weapons. The standard space marine weapon is the bolt gun or 
the bolter. This is a devastating automatic weapon, which fits small-calibre 
explosive shells. The main close-assault weapon is the bolt pistol, a 
smaller version of the bolter that because of size is ideal for hand-to-hand 
fighting. The space marines also have a number of heavy weapons that may be 
employed when greater firepower is needed for a mission.

Assaulting Space Hulks
-----------------------

A common assault procedure is as follows:

1. The mothership launches one or more assault vessels towards the alien 
   starship. Once alongside, a number of docking claws extend from the 
   assault vessels and grab the side of the alien ship. The powerful claws 
   tear into the alien ship and pull the assault vessel into the attack 
   position.

2. Probes which pierce the skin of the alien ship are then extended from the 
   claws. Each probe has within it a passageway through which the space 
   marines attack. Once this has punctured the alien ship and been made 
   airtight, the blast opened and the space marines assault the alien ship.

3. The space marine squad is expected to move fast and accomplish the set
   mission. Once the mission has been accomplished the space marines make 
   their way back to the docking claw. With all the space marines back on the 
   assault ship, the docking claws release the alien ship and the assault 
   vessel returns to the mothership.


SPACE CRUSADE: THE GAME
=======================

Space Crusade is a science fiction role playing game, in which you control 
a commander and four marines. Your commander starts off as a Sergeant, and 
can work his way through the ranks. The computer version allows for three 
players, each commanding one marine chapter each. The alien is 'played' by 
the computer.

If you do well you will be promoted until you reach the exalted rank of 
Captain Senioris, or, if you manage to accomplish each of the primary 
missions, you will become Captain Supremus. (Some of the terms being used 
here will seem a little daunting at first. Don't worry - everything is 
explained in detail over the next few pages.)

You will also be awarded honour badges if you do well in a game. The six 
marine ranks are shown on the marine Rank Section following.                                                                  ~ .;

The Rules of Play
=================
The best way to explain how to play Space Crusade is to explain the rules of 
the board game, and then indicate how they are implemented on your computer. 
The game is for one to three players. The players control three marine 
commanders and their space marines. These players are called the marine 
players. The computer plays the alien. Each game is a mission, and details
of all the missions appear at the end of this manual. Put as simply 
as possible, the game goes as follows:

At the start of a game, the marine players choose the marine chapter they 
wish to represent, the weapons for their marine team, the mission to be 
played and the equipment packs and orders for their marine team. The marine 
players take their turn first, after each marine team that are in play have 
had their turn then the alien takes its turn. The marine players must
attempt to accomplish the mission they have selected from the mission list. 
During their turn, each marine may move, fire or fight using hand to hand 
combat. As the marines explore the game map, they will obviously 
encounter aliens. Marine players score points for eliminating their 
opponents, and the player who scores the most points wins the game. 
That's it-move in, kill aliens, achieve mission objectives, move out.

The Missions
------------
The marine players choose one of the missions from the mission list and 
read the mission brief text which explains the mission objectives.


INCREASING IN RANK AND GAINING AWARDS
=====================================
The player with the most points, at the end of each mission, wins, provided 
that the minimum point threshold has been reached by that player. The player 
who won the game moves up a rank by one level and players who have scored 
sufficient points will receive awards. If none of the players have reached 
the highest rank, another mission will need to be played.

A player may trade in four honour badges to move up one rank. The awards 
are lost, but the player moves up one rank. Awards may not be used to reach 
the rank of Captain Senioris - you can only reach this rank by winning a game.
Awards may not be used to reach the rank of Captain Supremus - you can only 
reach this rank if you are already Captain Senioris, and then accomplishing 
all of the primary missions.

Between games any casualties that were lost are replaced so that you start 
each new game with a full set of marines. The exception to this is the 
marine commander. If a marine commander is eliminated then that player 
must start off with a sergeant in the next game, and any honour badges that 
the player had are lost. Marine commanders of any rank start each level with 
six life points.


THE CAMPAIGN GAME
=================
The campaign links all twelve games that you have played together. The 
object of the campaign is to be the first player to reach the rank of 
Captain Senioris, or even better, to accomplish all of the primary missions 
to become Captain Supremus, but you have previously reached Captain Senioris.

In the first game you play in a campaign you will choose your roles as normal.
You must then play the same role for the rest of the games until one player 
has won the campaign game. Therefore, a player who chooses to be the Ultra 
Marines will continue to play the Ultra Marines until the campaign has been 
finished. The games need not be played all at the same time. You choose to 
play the games over a number of days or even weeks. At the end of each game 
that is played the players may be promoted or receive honour badges depending 
on how well they played and how many points they scored.

In the campaign game the number of equipment packs and orders a marine 
player may choose will depend upon their rank and how many honour badges 
they have been awarded in previous games. A player always has four equipment 
packs and one order. For each honour badge they have been awarded the player 
may take an additional equipment pack. For each rank he has promoted, the 
player may take an additional order. A player may never have more than 8 
equipment packs or 4 orders.

The Marine Players
===================
The marine players must choose which marine chapter they are going to play 
with. The marine players must then choose their weapons, equipment packs and 
orders. Each player must choose four of the eight equipment packs and one of 
the four orders available to that chapter, although they may choose more if 
their rank or honours allow.

Choosing Weapons
================
Each marine player has a range of weaponry to choose from at the start of 
each mission. The weapons chosen may vary from one game to another, depending 
on the aim of the mission.

Commander's Weapons
===================
There are three alternative weapon combinations for the marine commander:

1. Power axe and Bolt Pistol.
   --------------------------
   This gives him a good hand-to-hand combat weapon with a little firepower.

2. Power Sword and Power Glove.
   ----------------------------
   This gives him no firepower at all, but two fearsome hand-to-hand combat 
   weapons.

3. Heavy Bolter.
   -------------
   This gives him better firepower but his hand-to-hand combat ability is 
   only as good as a normal marine.

Marine's Weapons.
=================
The four marines may choose from the available weapons. One of the four 
marines must carry a heavy weapon and one other must carry a bolter. The 
remaining two may choose between carrying a bolter or a heavy weapon. The 
three heavy weapons available are:                                                           - " " ' '

1. Assault Cannon
   --------------
   A useful weapon for attacking scattered groups of the weaker aliens or 
   for attacking single, more powerful aliens.

2. Missile Launcher 
   ----------------
   A good weapon for attacking aliens who are closely packed together or 
   for attacking more powerful aliens.

3. Plasma Gun
   ----------
   The plasma gun is a very powerful weapon that is best used in the 
   corridors where it is effective against all manner of aliens.


Order of Play
==============
The Blood Angels will move first, followed by the Imperial Fists, and then 
the Ultra Marines.


Marine Players Turn
===================
During a marine player's turn they may move and/or fire (or engage in hand 
to hand combat) all of their marines. They may move and fire each marine in 
turn. A marine may move first, then fire, or fire first and then move. A 
marine does not have to, fire or move. However, a marine may not move twice 
or fire twice unless an order is played that allows the marine player to do
so. The marine player may use any of their equipment packs during the 
course of their turn. However, marine players may only use one order per 
turn. The order is played at the beginning of a marine player's turn before 
moving or firing, and cannot be played again for the duration of that game.

1. Movement
------------
The game map is divided into squares which are used for movement. Squares 
are either corridor or room squares. A command and any marine with a bolter 
may move up to six squares, and marines with heavy weapons may only move up 
to four squares although one of the equipment packs will allow a chapter to 
move six. A marine may be moved in any direction, horizontally, vertically or 
diagonally. The player may always choose to move a marine less than the 
maximum distance allowed, or not to move a marine at all.

When moving, you will not be allowed to finish your move on an occupied 
square. You may, however, pass through a square occupied by one of your own 
marines provided you have enough movement to move beyond the square. You 
may not move through a square occupied by an alien or a marine from another 
marine chapter, otherwise you must take another route or stop. Only one 
marine or alien may occupy a square.

2. Opening Doors
----------------
Aliens and marines may only enter and leave rooms through open doors. A 
door may be opened by moving a marine onto one the squares in front of it, 
clicking on the Door Icon in the control panel at the bottom of the screen. 
Players do not have to open a door if they do not wish to. Opening a door 
does not count as a move. Players may not close doors or open doors they are 
not adjacent to, unless an alien event (see Alien Events) has occurred and 
allows them to do so. A door will open automatically if a player moves on, 
or past it.

3. Scanning
------------
Any of the marines in your team may scan for aliens during their turn, but 
only one scan is allowed per turn. If there are aliens within scan range 
then blips, which are unrevealed aliens, will appear . Blips will only 
appear if they are not within a marine line of sight. Obviously, any aliens 
within the sight of a marine will be shown as an alien, regardless of 
whether you have scanned or not. If a marine moves onto a square from which 
a line of sight can be traced to one or more blips, then those blips will 
be revealed and an alien will appear in place of the blip.

Blips
=====
If a marine or commander moves onto a square from which a line of sight 
can be traced to one or more blips, then those blips will be revealed.


Line of Sight
=============
Line of sight between marines or aliens is calculated by tracing a straight 
line from the centre of one square to the other. If the line of sight 
passes through a square containing a marine or alien, a closed door or a 
wall, the line of sight is blocked. Aliens or marines only block the line of 
sight for firing, they do not block the line of sight for the purpose of 
seeing if a blip needs to be revealed. Obviously, on the computer this is 
calculated automatically.


Firing
======
You may only fire at targets that are visible and cannot fire at blips. 
Targets are visible if you can trace a line of sight to them. There is no 
maximum range for any of the weapons used in Space Crusade. The dice rolled 
will depend upon which weapon you are using.

Light Weapons
-------------
Bolter or Bolt Pistol	2 Light Weapons Dice.
Heavy Bolter            2 Heavy Weapons Dice.

Heavy weapons
-------------
Assault Cannon		2 Heavy Weapons Dice
Plasma Gun              2 Heavy Weapons Dice
Missile Launcher        2 Heavy Weapons Dice

Obviously, in the computer version the appropriate dice will be chosen for 
you.

Rolling to Hit
--------------
When firing, the appropriate dice for the weapon being fired are rolled. If 
the total is greater than the armour value of your target then you will have 
scored a hit. The target must then lose one life point for each point you 
rolled over its armour value.

All aliens, except the dreadnought, have only one life point and are 
therefore eliminated when they are hit. Marine's also have one life point. 
Marine commanders start the game with six life points. Points are scored 
when a rival marine or alien are eliminated.


Re-rolling Dice
----------------
Having rolled the combat dice, some equipment packs allow you to 
re-roll one dice. You do not have to re-roll a dice, but if you do then the 
new roll will be used. Click on the dice you wish to re-roll or click on 
the Cancel button below the dice if you do not wish to re-roll. 

Heavy weapons
=============
There are three heavy weapons in the game and each has a special way of 
firing. All heavy weapons affect an area, and therefore may hit more than 
one target.

Assault Cannon
--------------
When using the assault cannon the total number rolled may be split between 
any visible targets. Eliminating a marine or alien may make others visible 
targets. These will then be eliminated provided you have scored enough 
points.

Assault Cannon Example:
----------------------- 
If the player's dice roll scores a total of four and there are three 
gretchins, two orks and an android all of which are visible then the 
player may split their total of four in four possible ways.

One point against each of the gretchin. The last point is then wasted as 
it cannot overcome the armour value of either an ork or an android.

Two points against an ork and then two points, one each, against two of 
the gretchin.

Two points against both orks.

Three points against the android and then one point against one of the 
three gretchin.

The number of points remaining will be displayed in the Dynamic 
Information Window. If there are no more aliens to fire at or the 
points are lower than an aliens armour value, then click on the Fire Icon 
to end your weapon fire.

Plasma Gun
----------
The plasma gun fires at all marines or aliens in a straight line of 
squares, which may be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. The total number 
rolled is compared to the armour value of each and every marine or alien 
in the line of fire. The line of fire will be blocked as soon as it hits 
a wall or a closed door.

Plasma Gun Example
------------------
In the example the player with the plasma gun may fire in any one of the 
three directions. He scored a total of four. Thus all the aliens in 
his chosen line of fire will be hit with four points. The alien in square 
B will also be hit with four points, regardless of whether the alien in
square A is eliminated or not. He may only fire one square diagonally 
before hitting the wall.

    ________________________________________________
   |  4   |      |      |      |      |      |     |
   |------|------|------|------|------|------|-----|
   |  4   |      |      |      |      |      |     |
   |------|------|------|------|------|------|-----|

   |  X   |  4   |   4  |   A  |   4  |   B  |   4 |
   |______|______|______|______|______|______|_____|

The missile launcher must fire at a square, rather than at a specific 
marine or alien, although the target square may contain an alien or 
marine. Any alien or marine in the target square will be attacked with the 
total number rolled on both dice. Furthermore, any marine or alien in an 
adjacent square will be caught in the blast and is attacked with the 
higher of the two dice rolled. The blast will not affect marines or 
aliens on the far side of a wall or closed door.

Missile Launcher Example
------------------------
In the example below the darker shaded area is the target square. The two 
heavy weapons dice scored a two and a three. Therefore the target square 
is hit for five and all adjacent squares are hit with a three. The squares 
beyond the wall are not affected by the blast.

       |//3///|///3//|///3//|      |
       |______|______|______|______|


Hand to Hand Combat
-------------------

Instead of firing, a marine or alien may attack using hand-to-hand combat. 
A marine or alien may attack using hand to hand combat before or after 
moving. To attack a marine or alien in hand-to-hand combat you must 
be in one of four squares to the side, front or rear. You cannot attack 
diagonally unless your marine team carries an equipment pack that 
allows them to do so.

The hand-to-hand combat dice are rolled and the points of the two 
opponents are compared. Whoever rolled the most wins. The loser must lose 
one life point for each point his opponent rolled above their own total.
Therefore if one player rolled one and their opponent rolled four, 
he would lose three life points. If both roll the same score then it is 
a draw and neither of them loses any life points. In hand to hand 
combat, the strength of any armour is not considered.


THE ALIEN'S TURN
================
During the alien's turn thy may move and/or attack. An alien event 
takes place immediately before the alien's turn. Once they have 
moved/attacked then the alien's turn is over.                                                                                  r

Aliens Attacking
----------------
Each alien, except the dreadnought, may make one attack per turn. The 
attack may be made before or after the alien moves. Aliens attack either 
by firing or hand-to-hand combat. Some aliens have heavy weapons. Some 
of the Chaos marines may have heavy weapons and the dreadnought may be 
armed with two. These heavy weapons fire in the same way as heavy weapons
carried by marines. Aliens may not fire their weapons and attack in 
hand-to-hand combat in the same turn.

Eliminating marines
-------------------
Marine players lose points for each marine eliminated, more points 
for each marine with a heavy weapon eliminated or if their marine 
commander is eliminated. Marine players continue to play normally, 
even if their marine commander is eliminated. 

The Dreadnought
---------------
The dreadnought is a fearsome war machine, developed by the alien 
followers of Chaos. It is an adversary to be feared and respected.

Moving the Dreadnought
----------------------
The dreadnought occupies four squares, instead of one. When moving it 
may pass through other alien's but may not end its move if any of 
the four squares it occupies contains an alien or marine. The 
dreadnought may always change the direction in which it is facing 
by turning on the spot. The dreadnought may not move diagonally.

The Dreadnought's Weapons
-------------------------                                                                                                           ~,
The dreadnought starts the game with bolters mounted onto its body and 
two heavy weapons. When a dreadnought fires it may fire all three of 
its weapons. The weapons are fired one at a time. It may fire more than 
one weapon at the same target or may choose to fire each weapon at a 
different target. The dreadnought can fire all its weapons as long as 
it can trace a line of sight to its intended target from at least one 
of the four squares it occupies. The dreadnought may not fire those 
weapons that have been lost during combat. When both heavy weapons 
have been lost then it may only fire with its bolters.

The Dreadnought's Life Points
-----------------------------
The dreadnought has three life points. When it loses the first life 
point then it will lose one of its heavy weapons. The second heavy weapon 
is lost when it loses another life point. It continues to roll its full 
number of combat dice for hand-to-hand combat, even when it is damaged. 
The dreadnought is destroyed when it loses its third life point.

Dreadnought Example
-------------------
The dreadnought begins on the four darker shaded squares. It moves four
squares, first onto the two squares marked 1, then moves onto the two 
squares marked 2. The dreadnought then turns and moves onto the two 
squares marked 3 and finally onto the two squares marked 4. The 
dreadnought therefore ends up occupying the four lighter shaded squares. 
From this position the dreadnought can trace a line of sight, for all its 
weapons onto any of the squares, except those marked with an X.

Alien Reinforcements
--------------------
The alien starts the game with a number of reinforcements. The exact 
number will depend on the mission being played. The alien may move up 
his reinforcements at the end of his turn. Alien reinforcements will not 
be placed on a square that is visible to a marine. Obviously, all the 
above actions will be carried out by the computer.

Completing the Mission
======================
If one of the marine players succeeds in fulfilling the mission they 
will be awarded the primary mission, for which you will be awarded thirty 
points. A marine player who accomplishes the secondary mission will be 
awarded the secondary mission, and points. For more information on 
secondary missions, see 'Alien Events' later in the manual.

Once the mission has been accomplished the marines must return to their 
own docking claws. Any marine on a docking claw is safe from attack. 
Aliens may not move onto a marine docking claw. Once a marine has 
returned to the docking claw it plays no further part in the game. A 
marine may not fire or move back onto the map. If the marines fail to 
complete the mission they may still return to their docking claw to escape.

End of the game
===============
Once all the marine's and commanders have returned to their docking claws 
then the game ends. The game ends automatically after each remaining 
marine chapter have taken their final turn. The marine players have one 
last turn each, to try to save as many of their marines as they can. 
Any marines left still outside their docking claw after this last turn 
are assumed to be eliminated.

WinningtheGame
==============
The computer will total up the score for each of the players, and will 
tell you who the winner is, providing that at least one player has reached 
the minimum winning points required. Again, this number is mission 
dedendant, but this number will be given in the Mission Briefing Screen. 
Once a game is over, the players will be given the opportunity of saving 
their chapters to use in later games or campaigns.

Those are the rules of play, and you will need to be familiar with them 
before you play the computer game. The computer will enforce most of the 
rules for you, of course. The following section explains how the computer 
game works.

Main Options Screen
===================
When the game has loaded, the first game screen featured will be the Main 
Options Screen, which has three icons: Select Mission, Select Chapter
and Expansion Missions. The Expansion Mission Icon is provided for 
future missions that will be released at a later date. When all of the 
players have made their selections for the forthcoming mission then 
a new icon will appear, this is the Start Mission icon, looking like a 
3D isometric view of the board. Click on this and your mission will 
begin.

Select Mission
--------------
Having chosen this option a hand held computer will appear with a list of 
slots with the names of the available missions. Click on one of the mission 
slots, we recommend that you play the missions in the order that they are 
presented. The mission brief for the mission you have just selected will 
now appear in the text window of the hand held computer.

Mission Brief
-------------
This will be the marines mission and will tell the marine players what 
they must try to do to achieve the primary mission objective and so 
score bonus points. Each mission will have a points threshold over which 
the player(s) must score in order to successfully win the mission. If 
the word 'MORE>>' appears in the text window then click on the text
window and any additional text will appear. Click on the Accept (The 
Tick) button, at the bottom of the hand held computer, if you wish to 
play that mission, you will then be taken back to the Main Options Screen 
ready to select your marine chapter. If you wish to select a different 
mission then click on the Refuse (The Cross) button and you will be
taken back to the mission list.

Select chapter
--------------
When you click on this icon you will be presented with a screen showing 
a picture of each of the marine chapters in action. Each player wishing 
to play Space Crusade must choose a chapter of marines to play with. The
first player should click on the chapter picture representing the marine 
chapter they wish to play with, a blast door will close over their 
selected marine chapter to indicate that the marine chapter  has been 
chosen, and will be taking part in the forthcoming mission. The marine 
chapter emblem above the blast door can now be clicked on, this will 
take the player to the Chapter Option Screen (see below), from where the 
player will equip his chapter for the mission.

If the chapter emblem is flashing then this indicates that the player has 
not fully prepared their chapter for the forthcoming mission and can not 
start a mission. If this happens then click on the flashing emblem and 
select a full complement of weapons, equipment and order/s via the 
Chapter Option Screen. When all of the players have chosen a marine 
chapter and made their selections for their marine chapter they should 
click on the double arrow in the bottom right hand corner of the Select 
Chapter Screen which will return them to the Main Options Screen ready to 
click on the Start Mission Icon.

Note: 
-----
Once a mission has been completed the players must choose their new 
mission and return to this screen. All of the blast doors will be open, 
players must again choose which marine chapters are to take part in the 
next mission by following the above procedure. If a player does not wish 
to access any of the options from the Chapter Option Screen, for example
changing weapons, then they should not click on the chapter emblem above 
the blast door, unless it is flashing, but click on the double arrow in 
the bottom right corner to return them to the Main Options Screen ready 
to click on the Start Mission Icon.

Chapter Option Screen
---------------------
This screen has three icons, Select Weapons, Load/Save Commander and 
Commander Status.

Select Weapons
--------------
To select the weapons for your marine chapter click on this icon. You will 
first be presented with the commander and marine weapon selection, and 
then the equipment and order selection screen. There is a default set of 
weapons, equipment and an order for each marine chapter already present 
and you may wish to alter these (see below).

Commander and Marines Weapons Selection
---------------------------------------
Each marine chapter must select their weapons carefully and with the 
mission they are about to undertake in mind. The hand held computer 
displays the available weapons, click on a marines face at the top 
of the device, the face will now highlight with a yellow box surround.

For your convenience we have included a set of default weapons, so you 
can start a mission without having to set up your own marines weapons. 
If you do wish to change the weapons we have set up for you then follow 
the procedure on discarding weapons below.

Use the single arrows either side of the currently displayed weapon to 
move through the choice of weapons. When you have decided on the weapon 
for the currently selected marine click on the picture of the weapon, the
LED underneath the marine will now turn from red to green and 
'Currently selected' will appear underneath the weapon to indicate that 
the marine that is currently selected has now got that weapon.

Continue to do this for the rest of the marines. You will notice that 
any weapon already selected and to another marine will have the phrase 
'Previously selected' underneath it. If you wish to change and discard a
marine's weapon then select him again, click on the currently 
selected weapon, the LED underneath the marine will now turn from 
green to red, then select another weapon in the same way as before. When
all of the marines have chosen their weapons click on the double arrow 
button at the bottom right hand corner hand held computer, this will take 
you to the Equipment and Order Selection Screen. If you wish to return to
the Chapter Options Screen then click on the double arrow button at the 
bottom left of the device.

Equipment and Order Selection
-----------------------------
Note: If you wish to recap or re-examine the information on the 
equipment and orders you have selected whilst you are playing, details 
are given at the back of this manual.

For your convenience we have included a set of default equipment and 
an order, so you can start a mission without having to set up your 
marines equipment and order. If you do wish to change the equipment
we have set up for you then follow the procedure about discarding 
equipment or orders below.

A hand held computer will display the equipment and orders available 
to your marine chapter. The following procedure can be used for 
selection of both equipment and orders. When you first enter this screen the
button is already active and highlighted and a picture of one of the 
available orders will be present in the window in the top left corner of 
the hand held computer. Click on either the equipment button or the order
button. The one selected will highlight with a yellow box surround to 
indicate that it is active. A picture of a piece of equipment or an order 
will be displayed in the window at the top left hand corner of the hand 
held computer.

You will notice that one or more LED's have appeared underneath the 
equipment/order picture at top of the hand held computer. The number of 
LED's present when the equipment button is selected will depend on how many 
equipment packs you are allowed to possess, the number will range from 
four to eight, the exact number is determined by the number of honour 
badges your commander currently possesses. The number of LED's present 
when the order button is selected will depend on how many orders you 
are allowed to posess, the number will range from one to four, the 
exact number is determined by your commanders current rank.
Click on one of the two single arrows below the equipment and order 
buttons to move through the available choices. A description of the 
equipment or order you are currently viewing will appear in the text 
window below the LED's. If there is more text to follow then 
'More>>' will appear at the end of the text, click on the text window and 
any additional text will then appear.

When you wish to select a piece of equipment or an order simply click on 
the picture of it in the top left hand corner of the hand held computer. 
You will notice that one of the LED's has turned from red to green, this
indicates that an order or equipment pack has been selected and will 
be present when you start your mission.
Continue to do this until all of the LED's for both equipment and 
orders have turned green.

If you change your mind and wish to discard an equipment pack or an order 
then click on the single arrows until the picture of the equipment or 
order appears in the top left hand window of the hand held computer.

Then click on the picture to discard the equipment or order and the 
previously green L.E.D will now turn to red. Follow the above procedure 
to select another one. When you are happy with your selections click on the
double arrow at the bottom right of the hand held computer to take you 
back to the Chapter Options Screen. The double arrow button on the left 
hand side will take you back to the Weapon Select Screen.

If the marine player chooses a targeter as part of their equipment then 
a weapon with green arrows either side will appear in the text window. 
Click on the arrows to move through the available weapons. When you wish 
to attach a targeter to a weapon simply click on the picture of the 
weapon and the targeter will be assigned to that weapon and 'Now Selected' 
will appear underneath the weapon. If MORE>> is clicked on then a targeter 
symbol will appear next to the weapon to indicate that it is assigned to 
that particular weapon. If you wish to change your mind and assign the 
targeter to another weapon ensure that the targeter picture is in the 
top left hand window, a weapon should now appear in the text window. Click 
on the weapon and the targeter will no longer be assigned to that weapon. 
Using the green arrows next to the weapon move through the available 
weapons until you find the one you want and follow the above procedure 
for re-selection.

After a mission has been played, and as long as the computer has not been 
turned off, then the equipment, orders and weapons from the previous 
mission will already be set up for the next mission. Remember you must 
always reselect a marine chapter by closing a blast door on the Select 
Chapter Screen. If you are happy with your order, equipment and weapons, 
and do not want to load or save then you need not click on the chapter 
emblem. If you wish to re-select any equipment, orders or weapons then 
you must click on the chapter emblem which will take you to the Chapter 
Options Screen. See Appendix One for details of Equipment and Orders.

Load/Save Commander
===================
Click on ,this icon and three new icons will appear. Load Commander, 
Save Commander and Format Disk.


Load Commander

To load a previously saved commander, click on the Load Icon and follow 
any on screen instructions. A screen with list of load slots will appear, 
click on the slot you wish to load and follow any on screen instructions. 
If you do not wish to load, then click on the EXIT button at the bottom 
of the screen. When you have finished and have returned to the 
Load/Save/Format Screen click on the double arrow button at the bottom 
right of the screen to return you to the Chapter Options Screen.

Save Commander
==============
To save a commander, click on the Save Icon and follow any on screen 
instruction6s If you have not saved previously then a screen with a 
list of empty UNUSED save slots will appear, click on a slot, the name 
of your marine chapter and a number will appear, then follow any screen 
instructions. On future saves ensure that you click on the slot you wish 
to update. If you do not wish to save, then click on the EXIT button, 
this will return you to the Load/Save Format Screen. From here click on 
the double arrow button at the bottom right of the screen to return you to 
the Chapter Options Screen.

Format Disk
===========
This will allow you to create a disk onto which you can save your marine 
commander. If you choose this option, simply follow the on screen 
instructions, taking care not to format your game disk.

Commander Status
================
This screen shows the current status of a marine commander. This screen 
will show the commanders current rank, any honour badges he holds, the 
total number of kills for the last mission and the number of points for 
the last mission. If your commander has four honour badges then they will 
be flashing to indicate that they can be traded. A TRADE button will appear
at the bottom of the screen, in place of one of the normal EXIT buttons, 
to allow you to trade the honour badges in for a promotion by one rank, 
unless your commander is already at the highest rank or the rank below 
(there will be no rank ceremony when increasing in rank from the status 
screen). If you click on the TRADE button, you will loose the four 
badges, and be promoted by one rank. The trade button will then disappear.
If MORE>> appears at the bottom of the text window then click on it and 
the mission record will be shown. The mission record displays any 
previous missions and whether they have been successfully completed 
or not. This will be indicated by a tick or a cross next to the mission 
and its number. When you have finished on this screen then click on the 
EXIT button.

Once the player has made all of the selections for their marine chapter 
then click on the double arrow in the bottom right hand corner of the 
Chapter Option Screen, this will return them to the Select Chapter Screen 
ready for the next player to choose a marine chapter.

Order of Play
=============
The Blood Angels will move first, followed by the Imperial Fists and then 
the Ultra Marines.


Playing the Mission
===================
After all the selections for each of the marine chapters taking part in 
the forthcoming mission have been made and they have returned to the 
Main Options Screen then the Start Mission icon should be selected, the 
mission will then begin. Each marine chapter starts a mission from their 
own docking claw. The docking claw is also the place that the team 
should return to at the end of a mission in order to be safe. When 
marines return to the docking claw then they can not perform any actions.

During a marine player's turn they may move and/or fire/or hand-to-hand 
combat all of their marines. A player may move and fire each marine in 
turn. A marine may move first, then fire, or fire first and then move. A 
marine does not have to fire or move. However a marine may not move twice 
or fire twice unless the player possesses an order that allows them to do 
so. During a mission the pointer will appear as a commanders glove in 
the colour of the current chapter.

The Main Screen
===============
The main screen is made up of the Main View Window, the Small Map Window 
and the Dynamic Information Window. Underneath these is the Control Panel.

1. Main View Window
-------------------
This is where all of the action takes place. You may click on any of 
your marines in this window whilst in plan view in order to select them. 
Also clicking on a revealed alien and holding the fire button down will 
activate the Alien I.D mode and will show the alien in 3D isometric along 
with its name in the Small Map Window. The Main View Window has arrows 
around the edges, clicking on any of these, or along the edges of the 
Main View Window will scroll the Main View Window in the chosen direction.

Clicking and holding down the fire button on these arrows or the edges 
of the Main Window will continue to scroll the Main View Window until 
either the fire button is released or until the end ort he mission 
map is reached. When the 3D button is active, clicking on the four 
arrows surrounding the Main View Window will display the four angles of 
the isometric view.


2. Small Map Window
===================
This window displays the mission map. Aliens and your marines are shown 
as dots and they can be seen moving around the map when ordered to do so, 
aliens and blips are shown as green dots, objects such as rubble are 
shown as blue dots and marines are shown as red.

To aid in identification a graphic and name of an alien or an object can 
also be seen displayed in this window in 3D isometric by clicking and 
holding down the fire button, left mouse button or space bar on the square
they occupy whilst in plan view mode.

Clicking anywhere on this map will take Main View Window to that position.

When the 3D button is selected a 3D isometric view of part of the map 
will be displayed in the Main View Window. Whilst the 3D button is active, 
clicking anywhere on the small map will cause that part of the map to be 
displayed in 3D. Clicking on the 3D button again will cancel it.

When the dice are being rolled this window will display the dice roll 
as digital read-outs, dice that are not active will be dehilighted. Heavy 
weapon dice are coloured red and are at the top, light weapon dice are 
coloured white and are at the bottom.

A player may sometimes be given the option to re-roll some of the dice, 
you will be informed of this option in the Dynamic Information Window, 
click on the particular dice you wish to re-roll or click on CANCEL if 
you are happy with the dice roll and do not wish to re-roll.

3. Dynamic Information Window
=============================
This window at the top right hand corner of the screen shows information 
about the currently selected marine in the marine team currently taking 
its turn, or the aliens when it is their turn. When a marine team are 
taking their turn the marine's chapter emblem will be displayed at the 
top of this window along with the name of the currently selected 
marine, the number of life points the marine holds, the weapon carried 
by that marine and also any targeter that may have been chosen as one 
of your equipment choices. If a marine has collected an object as part 
of the mission objective then this will also be displayed in this window 
to indicate which marine possesses it.

When all of the marine teams have had their turn and have clicked on the 
next player icon, this window will then display the number of turns 
remaining and will prompt you to press the fire button. The number of 
turns will count down. Once the turn counter reaches one then your marine 
team will have one last turn to get all of their marines back into the 
docking claw, otherwise they will all die. After the number of turns 
remaining have been displayed then it is the alien's turn. Before the alien
takes its turn an alien event will be played (see Alien Events) which may 
be beneficial or detrimental to the marines. The alien will then take its 
turn. You will see the alien emblem in this window and the Control Panel 
Action Icons will light up with a green surround when the aliens are 
taking their turn, this helps you see what actions the aliens are 
performing. If the alien attacks using hand-to-hand combat then the marine 
involved will automatically make a defensive dice roll. You will be 
prompted in this window to re-roll under certain circumstances, a chapter 
emblem will also appear in this window to indicate which chapter must 
choose re-roll or CANCEL.

Control Panel
=============
The panel at the bottom of the screen is where you control your 
marines actions. Each icon has a particular function. Only the
currently available actions will be highlighted. A marine must be 
selected before any of these icons become highlighted, with the
exception of the Order Icon.

Control Panel Action Icons
==========================
This is the main section of the panel, and appears under the Main 
View Window. Clicking on these icons will cause them to be surrounded by 
the colour of your marine team to indicate that it has been selected. The 
coloured surround will stay active whilst the action is taking place. 
Once selected, an icon can be cancelled by clicking on it again, with the 
exception of the Scanner, Door and Next Player icons.

The icons are from left to right:

A. Scroll Icon
--------------
Click on this icon and move the joystick, mouse or keys to scroll around 
the mission map. Click on this icon again to exit this mode. Pressing the 
S key will also activate this option, use the joystick, mouse or keyboard 
to move around the map.

Pressing the S key again will de-activate this option.

B. Move
-------
Click on this icon and the Main View Window will dehilight all squares 
that can not be walked on. Squares that the marine  can move to will stay 
as normal. Marines with bolt pistols and commanders are able to move up 
to six squares. Marines with heavy weapons can only move up to four 
squares, unless they possess a piece of equipment that allows them to do so.
When the Main View Window has dehilighted the unavailable squares, click 
on a square and the marine will move to that square. If you have failed 
to Scan then there may be an un-revealed alien blocking your marines 
path, your marine would then stop, and the alien would be revealed.

C. Fire
-------
When the Fire Icon in the Control Panel is clicked on, the Main View 
Window will display the squares that can be fired upon in yellow and 
'Select Target' will appear in the Dynamic Information Window. Click on 
an alien to be fired at or, if the missile launcher or plasma gun are 
being used, click on any square either containing an alien or an empty 
square with aliens on adjacent squares. The digital dice roll will now 
appear in the Small Map Window. If CANCEL appears underneath the dice 
then the player has the opportunity to get a re-roll. This is done by 
clicking on the actual dice. If the player does not wish to re-roll a 
dice then they should click on CANCEL. If the player's dice roll has scored 
more than the alien's armour value then the alien will be eliminated, 
with the exception of the dreadnought, who has three life points beyond 
his armour value. If you get a high dice roll score when using the 
assault cannon, and have beaten the alien's armour value, the alien will 
be eliminated, your dice score will then decrease by the alien's armour 
value, and you will be requested to select another alien to attack. This 
will continue until there are no more aliens to fire at in the vicinity, 
your dice roll has reached zero or your dice score is not sufficiently 
high enough to eliminate an alien, click on the Fire Icon to cancel when
this is the case.

D. Hand-to-hand
---------------
When this icon is selected, any aliens on adjacent squares to the 
currently selected marine can be attacked in hand-to-hand combat. Marines 
can not use hand-to-hand combat diagonally unless they have equipment that 
allows them to do so. The aliens that are able to be attacked will be 
standing on a yellow square, all other squares will stay as normal. Click 
on the square containing the alien you wish to attack. The dice will now 
roll for the marine's attack score, followed by the defensive dice roll
for the alien. Whoever gets the highest dice roll will win, the loser will 
lose one life point for each point his opponent rolled above his own total. 
If it is a draw, then neither loses any life points. The icon will not be 
available for selection if a marine is not adjacent to an opponent or if 
they have already fired a weapon this turn.


E. Orders
---------
This icon will only be active and highlighted at the start of the marine 
player's turn before a marine has been selected. Once marine has been 
selected the order will not be available for the rest of the turn. If the 
player has more than one order, only one can be used per turn. Selecting 
this icon displays the currently available orders as pictures in the 
Small Map Window. If you possess more than one order, then click on the 
arrows either side of the order picture to view the others. To select
and use an order, click on the order picture displayed in the Small Map 
Window. Click on the Order Icon in the Control Panel again to cancel if 
you no longer wish to select an order (For a description of the orders and 
rules involved see Appendix One: Space Crusade Equipment and Orders 
section).

F. Equipment
------------
Clicking on this icon will display all the equipment you have previously 
chosen in the Small Map Window as pictures. Equipment which is used 
throughout a mission, for example the bionic eye, will not be shown here 
because it is always in use, and does not need to be selected at any 
particular point in the game. Use the arrows either side of the equipment
picture to view any other equipment you may possess. To select and use a 
particular equipment pack, click on the equipment picture in the Small 
Map Window. Click on the equipment icon in the Control Panel again to 
cancel if you no longer wish to select any equipment (For a description 
of the Equipment and the rules involved see Space Crusade Equipment
and Orders section).

G. Doors
--------
When a marine is standing next to a door he can open it by clicking on 
this icon. A door will open automatically when a marine or alien's move 
allows them to travel past the door. A door can not be closed once it 
has been opened unless the master controls have been discovered 
(see Alien Events).

H. Scanner
----------
The scanner can be used by any selected marine to reveal blips, but 
only once per turn (unless an Alien Event allows them to do so). 
A commanders scanner has a larger scan range than a normal marines scanner.
The Scanner Icon will dehilight when not available.

I. Next Player
--------------
Clicking on this icon will finish your marine team's turn and transfer to 
the next player's marine team, or the alien, for them to take their turn.

J i-v. Marine Team Icons
------------------------
This panel shows the faces of the marines in your team. A marine must be 
selected before Move, Fire, Hand-to Hand Combat, Door, Equipment or Scan 
can be selected from the Control Panel. To select a marine, click on one 
of the marine face icons at the bottom of the screen, on a marine 
displayed in the Main View Window or press keys F1-F5 which correspond 
to the commander and the four marines. The Control Panel will now 
highlight the actions available to the selected marine. Double clicking 
on a marine icon, or a marine displayed in the Main View Window or 
pressing one of the F1-F5 keys twice, will centre the screen on the 
selected marine. When a marine is selected a red LED will light up 
underneath his face. There are two smaller LED's above his face, the 
left one will turn from green to red when that marine has moved, the right 
one will turn from green to red when that marine has fired or used 
hand-to-hand combat. If any of your marines do not leave the docking claw 
during the first turn or have returned to the docking claw after the 
first turn, their faces will be dehilighted to indicate that they cannot 
be selected. When a marine is eliminated a skull will appear in place of 
his face. Any orders should be played prior to selecting a marine. 
Refer to Appendix One (Space Crusade Equipment and Orders) for further 
information.

3D Button
---------
Clicking on this button will make it active and cause it to have a 
surround in the colour of the currently selected marine chapter. If 
using the mouse, then clicking on the 3D button with the left hand mouse 
button will display the view with wire frame see-through walls (standard 
with joystick or keys), if the 3D button is clicked on with the right 
hand mouse button then the walls will not be transparent. No actions can 
be selected whilst this button is active. When this button is hilighted 
the current position of the map will be displayed in 3D isometric, 
clicking on any of the four arrows surrounding the View Window using the 
left mouse button or the fire button will display the 3D view from the 
four angles.

When the 3D button is not selected only the outcome of firing and 
hand-to-hand combat will be displayed in 3D isometric view. If the player

isometric view of that part of the map will be displayed in the Main View 
Window. To exit the 3D isometric view click anywhere with the right hand
button or click again on the 3D button again to cancel it and you will

Quit Mission
============
There may be times when you may wish to quit the current mission and 
start again or your marines may be trapped somewhere because they are 
surrounded by a vacuum. Press the ESCAPE key to quit the mission. Your 
commander and marines will now all die.

Mission De-brief
================
When all marine chapters have either returned to the docking claw, or have 
died, the mission is finished and your marine commander will get a 
mission de-brief from the Imperium. You will be told whether you have 
won the mission. Each mission will have a minimum score that is required 
to win the mission. If playing a game with more than one marine team 
then the team with the most points wins the mission, but only if they 
have scored above the minimum number of points required to win that 
mission. The commander of the winning team will be promoted by one rank 
and will take part in an award ceremony. Completion or non-completion of 
the primary mission will also determine the type of de-briefing message 
you will be given. If 'More>>' appears at the bottom of the text then 
this indicates that there is more text to follow, click on the text 
window and any additional text will appear. When you wish to leave this 
screen click on the EXIT button at the bottom of the screen. Once all
the marine players taking part have had their mission de-brief they will 
then be taken to their Chapter Option Screen where they can save or view 
the status of their commander. When a marine player has finished on the 
Chapter Option Screen they should click on the double arrows in the 
bottom right hand corner of the screen.

If more than one marine player was taking part then the next players 
Chapter Option Screen will appear. When the last player has finished on 
their Chapter Option Screen they should click on the double arrow in the 
bottom right hand corner, this will take the players to the Main Options 
Screen ready to select a new mission.
