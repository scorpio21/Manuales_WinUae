FORMATION

SETS THE TEAM FORMATION,THAT YOU'LL BE ASKING YOUR PLAYERS TO USE.
OPTIONS AVAILABLE INCLUDE:
4-3-3:ONCE COMMON FORMATION USED THROUGHOUT ENGLISH FOOTBALL.UNFORTUNATELY
      YOU FIND AT LEAST ONE AND SOMETIMES TWO OF THE FRONT THREE PULLED
      BACK TO PREVENT DEFEAT.HOWEVER THE FOUR ACROSS THE BACK DOES ENABLE
      THE OFF-SIDE TRAP TO BE PLAYED.(HISS)
4-4-2:PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON FORMATION NOW IN THE U.K.GIVES PLENTY OF
      DEFENSIVE COVERAGE AND IS VERY EFFECTIVE.
4-2-4:MADE POPULAR DURING ENGLANDS 1966 WORLD CUP RUN.VERY ATTACKING,BUT
      CREATES A GREAT WORKLOAD FOR THE TWO MID-FIELDERS.VERY RARELY SEEN
      NOW-A-DAYS BECAUSE OF THE RISE IN IMPORTANCE OF DEFENCE.
5-4-1:THE SWEEPER SYSTEM,PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR SYSTEM THROUGHOUT EUROPE
      CAN BE VERY ATTACKING IF YOU POSSESS TWO QUICK FULL-BACKS WHO CAN 
      TURN INTO WINGERS.HOWEVER MOSTLY USED TO ENABLE MAN TO MAN MARKING 
      WHILE THE SWEEPER OR "LIBERO" HANGS BACK TO INTERCEPT THROUGH BALLS.
5-3-2:RARELY SEEN VARIATION ON 5-4-1.
4-5-1:WORKS BEST IF YOU HAVE MIDFIELDERS WILLING TO GO ON THROUGH RUNS.
      WORKED VERY WELL FOR TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR RECENTLY,ENABLING THEIR LONE
      STRIKER TO GRAB NEARLY 50 GOALS IN ONE SEASON.

SELECT/TACTICS

POSITIONS.THESE ARE YOUR MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS.TO HELP YOU LISTED BELOW

PLAY

YOU HAVE THREE OPTIONS:
-THE FULL GAME
-A SHORT GAME
-IMMEDIATE RESULT
IMMEDIATE RESULT IS THE MOST REALISTIC OF THE OPTIONS,AS IT IS RARE THAT A
MANAGER HAS TOO MUCH IMPACT ON THE GAME ONCE IT HAS STARTED (WELL THATS
WHAT THE RULES STATE).
THE OTHER OPTIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED TO DEMONSTRATE THE TACTICAL PROBLEMS
ANY FOOTBALL TEAM FACES.

PLAY CONTROL-PLAYER MOVEMENT

YOU CONTROL ALL 11 PLAYERS OF YOUR TEAM (THE RED TEAM PLAYING LEFT TO RIGHT
).TO MOVE A PLAYER CLICK ON HIS NAME,THEN POINT TO THE AREA OF THE PITCH
THAT YOU WANT HIM TO MOVE TO AND CLICK AGAIN.AWAY HE'LL GO.YOU CAN HAVE ALL
11 PLAYERS MOVING AT THE SAME TIME.
WHILE CONTROLLING YOUR TEAM,THE OPPOSITION WILL BE ATTACKING AND DEFENDING
AS APPROPRIATE.

PLAY CONTROL-BALL CONTROL

THE GAUGE AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT WILL SHOW HOW FAR YOU'LL KICK THE BALL IF ANY
OF YOUR PLAYERS TOUCH IT.TO KICK THE BALL A SHORT DISTANCE MOVE THE GAUGE
TO LOW STRENGTH (TO THE LEFT) AND GET A PLAYER TO RUN TOWARDS THE BALL.
WHEN HE TOUCHES THE BALL IT WILL TRAVEL AT THE STRENGTH SET ON THE GAUGE.
TO GET A DRIBBLE GOING,SET THE STRENGTH GAUGE TO LOW AND SET THE PLAYER TO
RUN ON A COURSE THAT GOES PAST THE BALL.WHEN HE REACHES IT HE WILL BEGIN
MOVING THE BALL UNTIL HE ARRIVES AT THE POINT ON THE PITCH THAT YOU MARKED
HIM TO GO TO.LIKE ALL BALL GAMES SOME PRACTICE IS NEEDED,BUT ONCE MASTERED
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GO ON RUNS AND PASS THE BALL TO COLLEAGUES (BY INCREASING
THE STRENGTH INDICATOR).

AUTOMATIC PLAYS

TO KEEP THE GAME FLOWING ALL DEADBALL SITUATIONS (THROW-INS,FREE-KICKS AND
CORNERS) ARE TAKEN AUTOMATICALLY.

-CONTROL YOUR CLUBS FINANCES.

 IN THE MODERN GAME).
