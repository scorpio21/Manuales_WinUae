                                 SHERMAN M4
				 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Months of painstaking research and development aided by historical and
military specialists have gone into Sherman M4, paying careful attention to
realism, graphics and scenario.

Everything but the campaign maps are exact, as they have been recreated in
order to bring you more pleasure. There are 3 campaigns, each one
portraying a time during the 2nd World War where SHERMANS played an
important part.


THE ATTACK:		The Normandy landing.

THE DEFENCE:		Hitler's ultimate Tank attack in the Ardennes.

THE STRATEGY:		The desert with its natural hazards and the
"Afrikakorps "Fox".


In addition to historical facts, we have left the option to modify certain
parameters: Difficulty, enemy, troops... For the stronger among you, a game
may be played using only the map, but it would be a shame not to take
advantage of the superb graphics and the "realistic 3D" vision you'll have
in travelling in a computer controlled tank. Switch from one Sherman to
another, to drive it or to leave it in the computer's hands. You'll be
amazed by its realistic decisions, as well as the enemy tank' logic.

The TIGER is the most famous combat tank ever of the German forces. Its
sophisticated equipment was much better than the allied forces and stayed
this way during the months that followed its appearance till the allies
could improve the equillibrium. The thickness of its armour made it
virtually indestructible.

The Jagdpanzer 4 represents the transition between assault cannons and the
German Tank hunter. Very simple in the way it was realised, very cheap
because its parts were taken from already existing tanks, only with stroger
equipment, these had only one disadvantage, no turrets.

			      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Landing was difficult. Your SHERMAN division is the first to land while
many others were destroyed. 2 divisions were planned for the mission, but
yours is the only one left.

NORMANDY 1
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You are at E-14, without any jeeps. Your mission - to destroy the
headquaters BUNKERS located at points C12 and G12. All bunkers are
connected to each other by tunnels and telephones. The two target bunkers
are equipped with radios, which allow them to communicate battle
information to costal batteries and recieve orders from headquaters.

Once the BUNKERS are destroyed, take possession of the camp in E-11. You
are able to re-supply.

Meeting point at the end of your mission: Camp in E-11.

NORMANDY 2
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Your jeeps which have arrived by glider during the night are in the hands
of the enemy. The glider has landed too far away from the rendezvous point
due to violent winds.

The camp is in point B9. Get the JEEPS back but be careful not to destroy
them as they might be very helpful for your next missions.

Meeting point at end of mission. Camp in B9.

NORMANDY 3
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The U.S. General chose the house in F7 to establish an advanced base. A
convoy has already left, with no support due to their belief that the place
was in the hands of the allies. Join it before they fall into Enemy hands.
Take advantage of the parts they carry. Do not destroy the bridges - they
are necessary to the allies progress.

NORMANDY 4
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The costal battery, located in B3, has inflicted damage on our fleet. You
must destroy it. It's protected by BUNKERS and MINE FIELDS. You will need
many good shots to dispose of it.

Meeting point by the ned of the mission: Battery in point B3.

NORMANDY 5
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Your last mission is very simple. Liberate the village located in G1. Be
careful, this mission is very important. This village is the first one that
our allied troops have to take back from the enemy.

Meeting point by the end of the mission: Village in G1.


                             ARDENNES CAMPAIGN
			     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
A German soldier wearing a US uniform has been captured. He speaks English
with an American accent and was discovered when not opening his chewing gum
the way a real American soldier would. He said there are 150 of the REICH's
soldiers planted within our troops. Be aware of tricks like this one.

ARDENNES, DECEMBER 44
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
During the landing, Hitler was asleep. As the allied divisions progressed
through the occupied territories, Hitler stays calm as he thinks his V2,
when operational, will quickly conclude the war. When he realises that the
allies would soon be in Germany, and the V2's attacking London are not
worthwhile compared to the allied bombardments on the Ruhr, he decides to
counter the attack.

Hitler commands all his reserve divisions to fight the Occidental allied
troops to prevent them going any further. The allies are surprised by the
final offensive. The Germans, in this last attack and more fanatical than
ever, will try any possible trick to win. The weather conditions, by the
end of December, are very bad, and morale is low as your soldiers are
spending Christmas far away from their families.

You will fight against KARL GERD VON RUNDSTEDT, commandant of the Ardennes
offensive.

                [REFER TO IFF PICTURE FILE - ARDENNES.PIC -]

ARDENNES 1
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You are in g12. Facing the massive offensive of the PANZER DIVISONS, get
back to C14. Protect yourself and stay on the defensive. Keep cool and
think about a way to strike back.

Meeting point at the end of the mission: Camp in C14

ARDENNES 2
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The base in F9 was abandoned by the enemy and some SHERMANS are already
there refuelling. Go there to refuel as well.

Meeting point at the end of the mission: Camp in F9

ARDENNES 3
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The enemy's progress must be stopped. Destroy the bridge in H3. A radio
message informed is that the forest, at the North of the bridge was
deserted. Be careful the next mission will take place at the south of that
same bridge.

Meeting point by the end of the mission: South side of the bridge in B3.

ARDENNES 4
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Neutralize the enemy's camp in D1. Be aware, it seems well protected by
BUNKERS, MINE FIELDS and other TIGERS. Don't leave anything behind for the
enemy.

Meeting point at the end of the mission: Base in D1.

ARDENNES 5
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You are starting to take over, you must go on now and finish the job.

Buisson-Ville, in F5, is in the hands of the Germans. Let's take back
Buisson-Ville and do not have any mercy for them, we shall end this war
once and for all. Take the maximum advantage of the SHERMANS, they'll take
you to victory.

Meeting point at the end of the mission: Buisson-Ville in F5.


                             THE DESERT CAMPAIGN
			     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
EL ALAMEIN, IN THE DESERT, NOVEMBER 42
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Here your principal enemy is the desert itself, as mines are quasi
invisible, the groun weak, torture used a lot and the distance from the
coast and cities prevent regular food supplies.

During the battles, to win land against the enemy is less important than
preserving your own retreat. You will take part in battles where the two
camps try to mutually prevent any possible retreat for supplies.

Numerous vehicles, especially armoured divisions, are abandoned in the
desert, because they run out of fuel and destroying or seizing an enemy
fuel tank is a real victory.

The Deutsches Afrikakorps (DAK) of Rommel is a war machine perfectly set up
for desert combat. The Reich soldiers go from victory to victory, their
morale is excellent and they have an important fuel reserve, stolen from
the British who are waiting for your SHERMANS before attacking Rommel in
his camp retreat.

You will fight against Field-Marshall ERWIN ROMMEL, also known as THE
DESERT FOX.

Good luck.

DESERT MISSIONS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Beware of quicksand and mines. Be careful where you're going, as
unnecessary kilometres could be fatal. Beware of the DAK movements. Don't
get caught by their tanks.

DESERT 1
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You are now in G0. Quickly go to G5, at BAB-EL-QATTARA, before the German
Tanks arrive for more supplies.

Refuel and destroy their provisions.

Meeting point at the end of the mission: Bab-El-Qattara in C5.

DESERT 2
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The tanks which need more supplies are getting to the village. Defend your
position and destroy those 6 PANZERS. They were not told you'd be coming,
so take advantage of this surprise.

Meeting point at the end of the mission: Bab-El-Qattara in point C5.

DESERT 3
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
A column of enemy lines must reach Sidi-Abd-Rahman, in F10, through the
south to re-enforce its position. You must make this plan fail and prepare
an ambush between F6, F7 and F8 (your mission is over if all tanks are
destroyed or if only one reaches the village.)

Meeting point at the end of the mission: The location of the ambush.

DESERT 4
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Refuel at Sidi-El-Rahman. if the Germans were going there in masses, it
would mean the village is badly protected. As always, don't leave anything
behind you.

Meeting point at the end of the mission: Sidi-El-Rahman in point F10.

DESERT 5
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Rommel retreated into a far away camp in B15. To end the desert combats you
must aim at the head. Attack the camp and destroy it. Count on active
resistance.

Meeting point at the end of the mission: Rommel's camp in B15.

                              TO START THE GAME
			      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Insert the disk as shown in "Commands and Piloting", then select the
Normandy campaign. Start the game by pressing the SPACE BAR several times.

You are now in Sherman Number 1. Press the F4 key to get the map. Examine
it with help of the arrows. Press RETURN to give orders to the Shermans.

Shermans moving towards their target. Once a Sherman moves in the automatic
mode, you may change your viewpoint by pressing the F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6,
F7, F8 keys. Once at your destination, destroy the bunker using the SPACE
key (shooting). Repeat for your second goal: the flag is in C12 (F4).

To visualise the map and return to give orders on R or F9 for the radio and
"Vehicles" to directly give orders. Once the headquarters are destroyed,
send all of your Shermans (survivors) in E11 at the refuel point. Destroy
the Stug 3 which protects the camp and put up the flag by touching your
Sherman at the point where the enemy has put his. You've just completed
your first mission. Congratulations!

In order for you to re-supply with fuel, let your Shermans go back to camp
one by one, except if you have destroyed it.


                           SERGEANT BUCK'S ADVICE
			   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The only way to stay alive intact in this war is to follow my orders
carefully and act the strategy carefully.

If your enemy is behind you, destroy the bridges after you've gone through.
To shoot, stop and set the elevation of your cannon to go over obstacles or
shoot far away. If the combats are more violent get inside the tank: the
way to check elevation of your cannon is to look at the horizontal black
line at the centre of your target.

If all the bridges are destroyed, you can go through in the river. If one
of your Shermans is close to a bridge and you're not inside you will not
destroy it.

It is your turn, go to the commands and give the order to fire. If you have
recieved an enemy's shot, and your tank is turning in aa circle, your track
is out of service. If your view is prevented, it may be replaced up to 5
times. To avoid facing the enemy use the jeep to view the situation, their
visibility being twice as good as a Sherman's. Do not stay too long in the
same place or the enemy will see you. Don't stray far away from the limits
of the map or you might get lost. The bunkers shoot further than your
tanks. You need to view the horizon first with your longview before getting
closer. After all of these dangers if you are still operational obtain a
re-supply of fuel by taking them to the warehouse before fighting once
more.

Synopsis:
¤ Take the tanks out of reach for refuelling.
¤ A tank piloted by the computer can't destroy a bridge. You must manually
  act on the commands to destroy it.
¤ To destroy a bridge could be helpful in order to avoid being followed.
¤ There are some ways to go through when the bridges are destroyed.
¤ Be aware that you may only shoot once the Shermans have stopped.
¤ In case you were shot the Sherman would turn around in circles.
¤ You have 5 bomb sights in stock.
¤ In a Sherman the long views double your vision.
¤ By elevating your cannons you may shoot above obstacles.
¤ In a Sherman the elevation of the cannons is indicated by a horizontal
  line inside the visor.

The bases and camps belong to you if they show your flasg. If a SHERMAN
touches one of the enemy's flags, the German flag becomes an American and
the camp becomes a prisoner. You'll have to group your forces together if
the flag or the place you are in is American.

The small bunkers are superior to yours and are protected by combat tank
patrols. Repairs are carried out while you refuel your tanks if the camp
has the parts.
