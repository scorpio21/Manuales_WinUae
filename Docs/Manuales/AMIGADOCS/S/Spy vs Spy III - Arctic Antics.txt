                  SPY  VRS  SPY III  -  ARCTIC ANTICS

OBJECTIVE:

     You're stranded on an iceberg island somewhere in the Arctic with your
arch enemy. And the year's worst blizzard is headed straight towards you.
There is only one way off the island - in a rocket ship built for one.
     In order to launch the rocket and make your escape, you'll first need
to gather the following items: a Punch Card, Gyroscope, Fuel Canister and
Launch Briefcase. Collect these hidden items, by fair means or foul, make
your way to the launch site and leave your enemy behind to battle the arctic
elements.


SELECTING OPTIONS:

     Use the joystick on the Options screen to move between the top and
bottom screens. Highlight each of the following options and press the
joystick button to make the following selections.

1) Top Screen: The size and shape of the Iceberg Island.

2) Bottom Screen:
       * Hidden or revealed Rocket Launch Site
       * Number of Players (1 or 2 spies)
       * Difficulty Level (choose the computer's "intelligence" 1 = the
         lowest level, 5 = the highest level.)

When finished selecting options, highlight GO! and press the Fire Button
to begin the game.


CONTROLLING YOUR SPY:

       * Move the joystick Right to move right
       * Move the joystick Left to move left
       * Move the joystick Up to move backward
       * Move the joystick Down to move forward

The iceberg is variable in size. When you move your spy to the extreme right
or left, you will automatically "scroll" to the next screen. Also by enter-
ing the doors in the background or foreground, you'll be able to "scroll"
vertically.


PICKING UP / DROPPING / BURYING OBJECTS

     Move your spy over an object and press the Fire Button to pick up an
object. To drop an object, move to the location you want to drop it and
press the Fire Button again (this applies only to the escape items). To
bury an object (hide it from your opponent), move to the location you want
to bry it. Press the Fire Button to drop the object, and move the object in
any direction BEFORE RELEASING THE FIRE BUTTON to bury it.

      The Trapulator is the set of seven small windows below the view screen.
In each window, you can see different items that you can use to help you get
around and booby trap your enemy. When you find an object that is not in
your Trapulator (the light is not on) pick it up and press the Fire Button.
Once an object is in your Trapulator, the light will turn on above the
storage box.


USING OBJECTS FROM THE TRAPULATOR

     1) Press the Fire Button twice to access the Trapulator storage boxes.
        You must not be standing too close to any objects that can be picked
        up or you will end up with that object instead of acessing the
        Trapulator.
     2) Move the joystick right or left to select the desired item. ( A bell
        will sound and you'll see a blinking light every time you move.)
     3) Press the Fire Button when the light above your choice is lit in
        order to select it.
     4) Press the Fire Button while holding the object to return an object
        to the Trapulator.

Note: The Punch Card, Gyroscope, Fuel Canister and Launch Briefcase cannot
be stored in the Trapulator. You must either hang on to them, or put them
in a safe spot. You may even decide to bury or booby trap them to keep them
out of your opponent's sight or possession.


LAUNCH BRIEFCASE

     Normally a spy can only carry one item at a time unless he has the 
Launch Briefcase. With the briefcase, a spy can pick up and carry the other
three necesary items. This makes the briefcase extremely valuable when
trying to collect everything you need for your escape.
     The large rectangle in the lower left-hand corner near your Trapulator 
shows you what items you have found. If you have gathered them in the Launch
Briefcase, they will be flashing. If you have found them, but have them 
hidden in the snow, they will not be flashing.
     In order to win the game, the Launch Briefcase must eventually contain
the Punch Card, Gyroscope, and Fuel Canister. Other items, like picks, 
buckets and snow-shoes, will be stored in the Trapulator.


NATURAL HAZARDS

     Throughout the course of the game there are several natural hazards that 
you'll either have to avoid or endure. Here's what they are, and what to do
about them.

Blizzard: The digital clock on the right side of the screen tells you when
the game will end. "The Big Storm" will start before the clock runs out. When
it does, it may be over for both spies, unless one can escape in the Rocket.
When the storm does hit, you will move at an increasingly slower pace.

Thin Ice: Try to go around the patches of ice. If you fall through, they will
slow you down and lower your body temperature.

Icy Water: If you manage to slip into the icy ocean, get out of it as fast as
you can. Your body temperature will decrease as long as you are in the water.
(Note: In the higher levels of the game, it may be necessary at times to jump
in and swim to reach the opposite side of the island and the rocket. If that
is the case, you must position yourself as close to the right or left, back
edge of a cliff wall to jump into the ocean.)

Freezing to Death: When your temperature gets low (watch the therometer on
the left side of your screen), you should warm yourself by the fire inside of
an igloo. If your body temperature falls to zero, the game is over for you.

Hanging Icicles: Icicles by themselves pose no threat, but if BOOBY TRAPPED
by your opponent, they can fall on your head and knock you out.


BOOBY TRAPS

    You can set and fall victim to Booby Traps. The following items are used:

Saws: used to cut holes in the ice.

Ice Picks: used to loosen hanging icicles.

Water Buckets: used to spill water on the snow to make icy patches.

Dynamite: used to blow up your opponent. You can set dynamite in two ways.
    Use it to booby trap an object. It will blow up if the enemy touches it,
    but you can move it again without harm. Or you can set off dynamite with
    your plunger from across the island. The White Spy may only use the white
    plunger to set off dynamite he has placed. The Black spy may only use the
    black plunger to set off dynamite he has placed. Your opponent must be 
    standing over the dynamite before you can set it off with your plunger.


SETTING A TRAP

    1) Retrieve one of the items from the Trapulator.
    2) Move your spy to the place you want to set the trap.
    3) Hold down the Fire Button and move the joystick in any direction to
       set the trap. Be careful to remember where you set your traps or you
       may be the victim! (Dynamite is the only trap you can set on top of
       an object - it will blow up your enemy, but not you.)


READING THE MAP

     This will help you locate the four necessary objects for escape, and
your position on the iceberg island.

    1) Press the Fire Button twice and select the Map.
    2) The flashing quadrant is where you are located.
    3) The dotted line shows the quadrant you've recently been in.
    4) The small squares represent the required objects for launching the
       rocket. If there is more than one object in a quadrant, they will be
       represented as a single square.
    5) To put the map away, press the Fire Button again.


SNOW BALL FIGHT

    1) Both spies must be in the same screen, (the other screen will blank-
       out.)
    2) Get in position (avoid standing on ice), hold the Fire Button, press
       and hold the joystick in the direction of your enemy to throw
       continuous snow balls. To throw single snow balls, press and hold the
       Fire Button and press (then release) the joystick in the enemy's
       direction.


THE END OF THE GAME

     The game ends automatically when the clock on the right side runs out.
To end the game any any point, press ESC? key.

To Win the Game: Collect all four necessary items, find and enter the rocket
hatch to make your escape from certain death on the arctic island.
You lose the game if your enemy finds the items and gets away on the rocket.
You also lose if you freeze to death or time runs out.
