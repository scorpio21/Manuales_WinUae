Getting Started

Note: If you are playing from floppy disks, we recommend that you first
make backup copies of all disks and put the originals in a safe place. The
disks are not copy-protected, so to copy them, just follow the
instructions that came with your computer.

You can play from either a hard disk drive or a floppy disk drive:

From a floppy drive, insert the Secret of Monkey Island Disk 1 in your disk
drive (DF0:) and boot off of this disk.  Open the disk icon and
double-click on the Monkey Island icon.

If your Amiga has more than one floppy disk drive, you can play the Secret
of Monkey Island by swapping disks in the drives when prompted.

To install the Secret of Monkey Island on a hard disk, double-click on the
Install Monkey icon on the Secret of Monkey Island Disk 1.  From the list
of options, select the hard disk partition on which you wish to install the
game.  Insert subsequent disks as prompted on-screen.

To load the game from your hard disk, open the Monkey Island hard disk
drawer, and double-click on the Monkey Island icon.

Keyboard Controls

All of the verbs used in the game can also be selected by using keyboard
commands. Each key corresponds to one verb.  Pressing the appropriate key
once is equivalent to moving the mouse pointer over the verb on-screen and
pressing the left mouse button.  The keys are mapped as follows:

                  O            W           U

Save/Load Instructions

If you are playing from floppy disks, you will need to prepare a blank,
formatted disk BEFORE you start play.  This disk will become your save/load
disk.  Hard disk players will have their games saved in the directory with
the game files.

Press F5 when you want to save or load a game.

If you are playing from floppy disks, you should insert your save/load disk
when prompted.  Note: Be sure to wait until the drive light turns on - then
off - before selecting LOAD or SAVE. Once the save/load screen is
displayed, you can move the mouse pointer and click on SAVE, LOAD, PLAY, or
QUIT.  The save/load option will not be available during the opeing
sequence or the closing credits.

To SAVE:

Click on the SAVE option.  The current list of saved games will be
displayed in slots along the left side of the screen.  Select a slot by

Read This First...It's Important!

Although you may have played other Lucasfilm games, there are a few
differences in The Secret of Monkey Island that you should be aware of.

The interface you use to play the game now has an "auto-highlight" feature
that highlights an appropriate verb when the cursor touches and interesting
or useful object on the screen.  For example, when the cursor touches a
door that can be opened, the verb OPEN is highlighted on the screen.  By
pressing the right (or second) controller button or equivalent key (see
your reference card for details), you can automatically perform the
highlighted action - in this case, opening a door.  Don't worry, though,
this won't give away solutions to any puzzles!

Also, you do not need to double-click on objects (or anything) to use or
activate them.  A single click of the controller button should be used
consistently through the game.

About The Secret of Monkey Island

In the Secret of Monkey Island, you play the role of Guybrush Threepweed, a
young man who has just hit the shores of Melee Island (somewhere in the
Caribbean).  Our naive hero's travels have lead him to Melee Island in a
quest to fulfill his life's ambition...to become a fierce, swashbuckling,
bloodthirsty pirate.  Unbeknown to Guybrush, however, there have been some
strange happenings in the area surrounding Melee Island and on the more
mysterious Monkey Island.  As he walks into this maelstrom of mystery,
Guybrush will soon be very aware that things are not what they appear to
be, that even bloodthirsty pirates can be scared, and that there's more to
being a pirate than swinging a sword and drinking grog!

Here's where you come in... You direct the actions of Guybrush as he first
explores Melee Island and then ventures on to Monkey Island.  On Melee
Island, Guybrush will have to prove himself worthy of becoming a pirate by
completing the three trials.  Through the course of completing the trials,
you and Guybrush will learn much about pirate life and local folklore.  But
don't be surprised if you find that some of the people that you meet seem
rather anachronistic!

If this is your first computer adventure game, be prepared for an
entertaining challenge.  Be patient, even if it takes a while to figure out
some of the puzzles.  If you get stuck, you might need to solve another
puzzle first or find and use an object.  But hang in there and use your
imagination, and you will guide Guybrush to discover... the Secret of
Monkey Island!

Getting Started

To start the game on your computer, please use the computer reference card
included with the game.  It contains all the instructions specific to your
computer.

Copy Protection

Once you've started the program, a screen will appear displaying a pirate's
face (actually a combination of two faces).  You will be prompted to enter
a date that was significant in that pirate's life at a given geographical
location.  Use your Dial-A-Pirate wheel to match up the top and bottom
halves of the pirate face you see on the screen.  Then, locate the window
on the wheel that matches the geographical location mentioned on the
screen.  Using the keyboard, type the date you see in the window.

Don't lose your Dial-A-Pirate wheel!  Without it, you won't be able to play
the game.  If you lose the Wheel, you may purchase another from Lucasfilm
Games.  Call 1-415-721-3333 for more information.

Playing the Game

After the opening title sequence and introduction, Guybrush will meet the
Official Lookout for Melee Island.  When they've finished talking, Guybrush
will walk down to the dock at one end of the town of Melee.  You may begin
directing his actions as soon as he gets to the dock.  The screen is
divided into the following sections:

1) The Animation Window is the largest part of the screen and is where the
animated actions take place.  It shows the "camera's-eye view" of the room
or location that the main character is in.  Dialog spoken by the
characters, as well as game related messages, also appear here.

2) The Sentence Line is directly below the Animation Window.  You use this
line to construct sentences that tell Guybrush what to do.  A sentence
consists of a verb (action word) and one or two nouns (objects).  An
example of a sentence you might construct on the Sentence Line is "Use
shovel on dirt."  Connecting words like "on" or "with" will automatically
be inserted by the program.

3) Verbs must be selected from the words in the columns below the Sentence
Line.  To select a verb, position the cursor over the word and press the
left mouse/joystick button or the ENTER key.  Verbs are highlighted in a
bright color when an obvious use for them appears in the Animation Window.
For example, when Guybrush is near a door that can be opened, position the
pointer over the door that can be opened, positioning the pointer over the
door will highlight the verb Open.  Pressing the right mouse/joystick
button or the TAB key (to emulate the right button) will use the
highlighted verb with the object, which in this case happens to be the
door.  But remember, although a verb is highlighted, that one verb may not
be the only way to use an object.  Try the other verbs as well!

4) The Inventory is the area to the right of the Verbs.  At the beginning
of the game the inventory is empty.  When Guybrush picks up or is given an
object to use during game play, the object is added to the Inventory. 
There is 

          			4

no limit to the number of objects Guybrush can carry (after all, he's young
and strong!).  When there are more than six objects in the Inventory,
arrows appear to the left of the list.  Use them to move the list up or
down.

Nouns (objects) can be selected in two ways.  You may select a noun by
placing the cursor over an object in the Animation Window.  Many objects in
the environment, and all usable in the game, have names.  If an object has
a name, it will appear on the Sentence Line when you position the cursor
over it.  If no name appears for an object on the screen, you can be sure
that it has no signifigance other than as part of the background.  You may
also select nouns by clicking on them in the Inventory.

To move Guybush around, simply point the cursor where you want to go, and
click.  Notice that Walk to is the default verb in the Sentence Line - this
is because moving around is what Guybrush will be doing most often.

"Cut-scenes" are short, animated sequences - like scenes from a movie -
which can provide clues and information about the characters.  They're also
used to show special animated sequences, as when Guybrush gets himself into
a fight while "exploring" a mansion.  When you are viewing a cut-scene, you
do not direct the action.

Things to Try in the Town of Melee

Look at the poster on the first house at the dock.  Select the verb Look at
with the cursor aby pressing the left mouse/joystick button or the ENTER
key.  Notice that the words "Look at" appear on the sentence line. 
Position the cursor over the poster and press the left mouse/joystick
button or the ENTER key.  This completes the sentence "Look at poster" on
the sentence line.  If Guybush is not already standing in front of the
poster, he will walk over to it and read it to you.

Open the door of the SCUMM BAR.  Place the cursor over the door to the bar.
You will notice that the verb Open is highlighted.  Press the right
mouse/joystick button or TAB key to open the door.

Go into the SCUMM BAR.

Talk to each of the pirates who pop up on the Sentence Line inside the
bar... they'll provide you with useful information.  See the next section
entitled "Talking to Characters" for more information.

Talk to the Important-looking Pirates seated in the adjoining room. They're
full of good advice about how to become a pirate!

See if you can outwit the Cook to get into the kitchen for a look around.

Once in the kitchen, step out onto the dock... you might be able to have
some fun with that bird!

Talking to Characters

There are plenty of "colorful" characters in the game with whom you can
converse.  Each person Guybrush meets will have something to say, whether
friendly or unfriendly... helpful, or unhelpful!  Often, you can talk with
someone at one point in the game, and then return to them later to get new
information.  To talk with a character, position the pointer on them and
press the right 

				5

mouse/joystick button or the TAB key to use the Talk to verb
automatically.

In a conversation, you will have to select what Guybrush says from among
the possible phrases at the bottom of the screen.  Just click on the phrase
you want him to say.  Of course, what Guybrush says will affect how other
people respond.  And, as conversations continue, you could be presented
with a new array of dialog choices.  Don't worry - we'll never punish you
for selecting the "wrong" or funny dialog response.  After all, you're
playing the game to have fun!

Function Keys

To save your progress in a game, enabling you to turn the computer off and
start again later in the same place, use the save feature.  Simply press
the Save/Load Game function key (F5 on most computers - see your Reference
Card for more information).  Note: The name you use for a saved game must
be at least two letters long.

To load a game you have saved, use the Save/Load Game function key any time
after The Secret of Monkey Island has been loaded.

To bypass a cut-scene, press the ESC key, or press both mouse/joystick
buttons at once.  See your computer reference card for details.  After
you've played The Secret of Monkey Island several times, you may want to
use this function to skip over scenes you have seen before, including the
title sequence.

To restart the game from the beginning, press the key indicated on your
reference card (F8 on most computers).

To pause the game, press the SPACE BAR.  Press it again to resume play.

To adjust the speed of the Message Line to suit your reading speed, press
the keys indicated on your reference card (+ and - on most computers).

To turn the sound off and on, press the keys indicated on your reference
card.  Note: Sound for some computers can only be adjusted with the volume
control on the monitor or television.

Our Game Design Philosophy

We believe that you buy games to be entertained, not to be whacked over the
head every time you make a mistake.  So we don't bring the game to a
screeching halt when you poke your nose into a place you haven't visited
before.  We make it clear, however, when you are in a dangerous situation.

We think you'd prefer to solve the game's mysteries by exploring and
discovering, not by dying a thousand deaths.  We also think you like to
spend your time involved in the story, not typing in synonyms until you
stumble upon the computer's word for a certain object.

Unlike conventional computer adventures, you won't find yourself
accidentally stepping off a path, or dying because you've picked up a sharp
object.  There are a few dangerous situations where Guybrush can die, but
to anticipate them takes just a little common sense, not excessive
paranoia.  Save the game when you think you may be entering a dangerous
area, but don't assume that every wrong step will result in death.  Usually
you'll get another chance.

A Few Helpful Hints

* Pick up everything you can.  Odds are, at some point all those strange
  things will serve some purpose.

* If you get stuck and can't figure out how to proceed, try looking through
  all of the itmes you've found and thinking about how each one might be
  used.  Think about the places you've gone, and the people you've met.
  Chances are there will be a connection that'll put you back on track.

* There is more than one way to solve many of the puzzles.

* If you want to speed up game play, order a hint book from Lucasfilm
  Games.  In the United States: 1-800-STAR-WARS (1-800-782-7927). In
  Canada: 1-800-828-7927.

* If you want to access our automated hint line, call 1-900-740-JEDI
  (1-900-740-5334) in the United States only.  The cost is 75¢ per minute. 
  If you're under 18, first get your parent's or guardian's permission.

* If you need technical assistance, call 1-415-721-3333.  We're sorry, but
  no hints can be given on this line.
