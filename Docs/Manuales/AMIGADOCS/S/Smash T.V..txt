 The cheering from the ecstatic crowd fades away as you leave the safety
of the studio and enter the first of four insanely dangerous and devious,
gaming arenas. Instantly you are set upon by hoards of thugs weilding 
baseball bats. Each with only one intent - beating the living daylights 
out of you! Deal with these guys if you can, there are lots of them.
 Use your skill to navigate the arenas and collect power-ups, speed-ups, 
spinning shurikuns, mace balls, genade and rocket launchers, multiples 
and, of course, smart bombs. All these items will increase you ability 
to wreak havoc upon the mindless meatheads. Watch out for mines though!
Wall Mounted gunners and tanks will constantly make your task just a 
bit harder than it already is. However, you will find yourself 
relentlessly drivin on by the lure of countless prizes awaiting you. It
doesn't seem so bad to be risking life and limb when you are winning 
holidays , sleek raodsters, luggage, and of course, mindbending amounts
of cash. As you progress through the game zones you will encounter 
floating droids, electris pulse generation orbs, poisonous snakes, 
walking time bombs, mutant lizard men, and countless other mechanical
and biological opponents. However, you haven't seen the worst of it yet.
Prepare yourself for the end-oflevel baddies who will make you regret 
your decision to enter this gladiatorial-like game at all!! For example, 
at the end of level one, you will encounter a huge mutant skinhead tank.
He will do his upmost to crush you under foot (or track)-and he is the
easiest opponent of them all!                                        
 If you make it through all four of the nightmarish game zones you will
confront your final and more leathal challenge. The game show host 
himself. Sounds easy? Think again - he's insane, enourmous and can only
understand one thing.........

 Defeat him if you can - the rewards are well worth it. Good luck, and
remember.....

HINTS AND TIPS
--------------
1. The triple shot is the best weapon to collect.
2. Big shots auto repeat by holding the fire button down.
3. Make a map and work out the shortest route.
4. Collect extra lives as soon as they appear.
