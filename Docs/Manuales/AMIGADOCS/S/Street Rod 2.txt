you know a guy can do a lot just hangin out in his garage. move the wrench
around to see all the great stuff you`ve got. you can use your joystick,mouse
or arrows on the keyboard. when the wrench is touching an item,a message about
it appears at the lower right. to use an item,press fire button,click the
l/m/button or press spacebar.

when a list appears,you can scroll thru it by using the arrows on the right of
the list box.select the single arrows to scroll up or down by one item. select
the double arrows to scroll up or down by one page.

be sure to watch yer dough,though. just about everything you`ll do costs
money,except,like,lookin at yer spare parts. and always you gotta have some
bread for gas and the grudge night entry fee (30$).

you`re fairly organized,so you keep a list of all the cars you own(even if you
only have one).
you can see the list by selecting the banner at the top of your work bench,the
one that says your cars name. while your looking at the lsit,you can switch
cars in your garage,or sell one of them. pretty cool eh!.

make a high offer when your selling a car. dont be stupid and go sky high, or
you`ll never sell, but try to get as much money as you can. if the buyer wont
go for your 1st offer,make another one, a little lower.

getting the right tranny(transmission) can turn a lead sled into a bitching
rod!. an automatic is the easiest to handle, but its slow, with no get and go!,
3 speed manuals pop you off the starting line.
4 speeds are best, if you can afford them. be sure to get the right tranny for
your car make.
transmissions endure a lot of wear,especially in road races,so keep an eye on
how yours is holding up.
when replacing trans,mission, make sure you tighten the bolts. otherwise,
you`ll go NOWHERE fast!.
