                               STACK UP DOCS


AMIGA LOADING INSTRUCTIONS
Switch on the computer.  When the `Workbench` prompt appears, insert the STACK
UP disk in the drive, and the game then loads automatically.


OPTIONS

Stack Up is controlled by a joystick connected to the relevant port on the
16-Bit computer.

Pressing FIRE starts the selected game.

Pressing SPACE pauses the game, and ESCAPE quits the playing frame.


GAMESPLAY

The aim of Stack Up is to guide the falling groups of blocks so that they form
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines of more than three of the same colour.
Once this "Stack" has been made, the blocks disintegrate earning points.

As the blocks fall from the top of the frame, pressing SWOP allows the colours
to exchange positions.

The next block to fall is also displayed on the screen, so it is worth bearing
that colour formation in mind before placing the falling blocks.

As you Stack Up to higher frames, the falling blocks get faster, and the
puzzles become more difficult.  

If your stack reaches the top of the screen, the frame is declared void and you
lose your credit.

As the game progresses, various new playing blocks can be selected by pausing
and selecting the following:

1.  Weather Symbols
2.  Road Traffic Signs
3.  Food Symbols
4.  Outer Space Signs

Stack Up is split into 22 rounds, each of which has a target number of lines
that must be reached before play can progress to the next level.  After a
successful round you are awarded CLEAR BONUS, plus a SPACE BONUS depending on
how much empty space is left on the screen.

As higher levels are reached:

* Frames are started with blocks already in them.
* Blocks appear randomly on the screen.
* Only diagonal lines count towards your target levels.
* Left and Right controls may be reversed !!
* Black blocks will fall that cannot disintegrate.


BASIC SCORING

Each group of three blocks placed in frame: 50 points
Verticle line of three: 200 points
Horizontal line of three: 500 points
Diagonal line of three: 1000 points

EXTENDED SCORING

Line of four: Scores double and counts as Two.
Line of five: Scores triple and counts as Three.
Line of six:  Scores quadruple and counts as Four.

CHAIN REACTIONS

First Step:  Single Score.
Second Step: All lines are worth Double.
Third Step:  All lines are worth Triple.

So a diagonal line of Five formed on a Second Step Chain Reaction is worth 5000
points.
