The holiday
-----------
Our heroic trio, Scooby Doo, Scrappy Doo and Shaggy are enjoying
a well earned break aboard the pleasure cruiser "Blubell", away from the 
the haunted houses, ghosts and villains.

Or so they think
----------------
As Scooby lies dreaming of munching his way through a second box of Scooby
Snax, a menacing black shadow looms above.  In a flash, the evil Baron Von
Drak whisks the trembling Scooby and Shaggy from their sun loungers carrying
them far across the ocean to his lair, the "Isle of Sorrows".

The Fun and games
-----------------
And so another adventure begins. Scrappy Doo, our hero, remains stranded on
the "Bluebell" and must save the day.  A mammoth task lies before him and he
needs all your help to free Uncle Scooby and Shaggy from the clutches of the
evil Baron.

Along the way
-------------
This breath taking arcade adventure takes you through nine levels, meeting
a variety of "nasties" along the way.  If you think you can cope with 
bouncing octopi, mutant killer fish, one legged pirates, dinosaurs, cavemen,
long armed yetis, then what about the mad mallet, hoppong gravestones, Frankie
Stein Junior, mermen, eyes on legs, sea monsters, swinging logs and walking
hammer heads?
