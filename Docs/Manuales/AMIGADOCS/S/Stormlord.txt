                          STORMLORD'S STORY

StormLord, the last remaining hero in The Realm of the Faeries, was
sleeping beneath a large oak tree when a scrap of parchment fell on
is face.

He jumped up quickly, sword drawn and ready for battle; but what he
saw was a large eagle perched on the low-hanging limb above him.
He looked warily around, then bent his tall muscular frame to pick up
the ragged paper.  It seemed to him the eagle was watching him as he
read the scribbled message.

     This note is the last chance we may have before the triumph of
  Badh the Crone.

     We, the Faerie Guardians, haved lived in harmony with The Realm,
  watching over it and protecting all of its creatures.  The Realm
  was famed throughout the land of Llyn Cerrig as a place of wonder,
  peace, and beauty.

     Word of The Realm reached the ears of the evil Elwords, and so
  came Badh the rotting Crone to suck The Realm's life force to
  prevent her body from decaying further.  She imprisoned my sisters
  and I - without us to care for it, The Realm will die.

     I have commanded Mael Ovin the great eagle to help you.

     Please hurry, StormLord, before it's too late.

                                                    Rose The Faerie

StormLord looked the majestic eagle in the eye and said, "I accept
this mission on behalf of all the living creatures in The Realm.  With
your help, we will defeat the wicked Crone who could be Monarch of
The Realm and destroy all the joy that is here.  Come, Mael Ovin, and
let us begin."

So, with the eagle flying low above his head, StormLord purposely
strode off to meet his greatest challenge.

                                    GAMEPLAY

The objective is to release the imprisoned Faeries before time runs
out.  Each level of the game contains a small number of Faeries that
must be released before StormLord can progress to the next level.
In his journey, StormLord encounters Venus fly-traps, huge worms,
bees, gargoyles, and many other foes that must be destroyed or avoided
entirely.

At the bottom of the game screen is an information panel that keeps
you up-to-date about StormLord's situation.

                                                           (right)

StormLord begins each level with a particular number of lives (maximum
of nine, depending on how well he did in the previous level) and a time
limit.  Keep track of time passage in the area with the sun and moon -
when the moon is completely risen, the time is up for that level.

Scattered about The Realm are various objects that StormLord must use
to free the Faeries and get through certain areas (he can carry only
one item at a time).  These objects are Keys (for entering locked doors);
Umbrellas (for protection from acid rain); Honey (to lure bees away from
an area StormLord wants to enter); Winged Sandals (to help StormLord
jump higher than he normally can); and Buckets of Water (to put out
flames from the fire-breathing gargoyles).

To pick up an object, or swap something StormLord is holding with an
object on the ground, guide StormLord to walk through the item.  It
takes time and practice to learn where to use particular objects,
how to use them, and in what order to use them.

To gain access to the remote parts of The Realm, StormLord must step
on one of the stone blocks marked with a skull.  Once he steps on a
block, Mael Ovin swoops down and carries him to distant and otherwise
inaccessible areas of the land.

                           GAINING AN EXTRA LIFE

At the end of each level, after all the Faeries on that level have been
released, StormLord gets a chance to gain extra lives.

The object in this segment is to capture as many Faeries' tears as
possible within a short time limit (10 tears = 1 extra life; each tear
after that = 1 extra life).  In order to get the Faeries' tears to
fall, StormLord must blow kisses (press FIRE - the kisses are
represented by red hearts) to them.  If a kiss touches a Faerie,
she falls in love with StormLord and drops a tear for him to collect.
Tears dissolve quickly after touching the ground, so speed is of the
essence.
