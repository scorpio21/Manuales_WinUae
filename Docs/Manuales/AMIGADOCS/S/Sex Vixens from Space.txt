6     You are Captain Brad Stallion, owner and operator of the
7     one-man space vehicle know throughout the galaxy as
8                                   The 'Big Thruster'.


9      Getting Started: Hardware requirements for this game
10   are as follows: Amiga 500/1000/2000 with at least 512K
11   memory.  Only one Floppy Drive is required.
12     To start the game, boot your computer in the normal
13   manner.  When prompted for the Workbench disk, insert
14   the disk marked 'Disk 1' in the internal disk drive.
15   If you have a second drive, insert the disk marked 'Disk 2'
16   into it.  After a few seconds, you will be prompted to enter
17   a phrase from this manual.  Enter the phrase, punctuation NOT
18   included, then press the return key.
19   Game controls:  You are Brad Stallion, you see through his eyes
20   and you manipulate objects with his hands (the pointer).
21   The lower one fourth of the screen display is your 'console',
22   you have a text display area and game controls.  The text
23   display area will display a 'What Now' prompt when there is
24   no text to display.  You clear, or 'activate' the console by
25   clicking (pressing down) the left mouse button.  The pointer
26   is also used to manipulate objects in a scene.  This may
27   include touching someone, turning on controls opening doors,
28   etc.  But be careful, some things may not be safe to touch!
29   Additionally, the pointer is used to tell you of certain game
30   conditions.  If there is more text for you to read than can
31   be displayed in the text area, the pointer will become the
32   word 'TEXT'.  When this happens, no other game controls are
33   active.  Clicking the left mouse button will then display the
34   next section of text.  The pointer will also tell you to 'WAIT'
35   during any disk activity.  And finally, the pointer will on
36   some occasions actually turn into what ever is in your right
37   hand!
38     Other game controls: To the right of the text display area
39   is a four point compass rose, up-down gadgets, and three
40   buttons, labeled 'I' for Inventory, 'L' for Location and
41   'S' for game status.  The compass rose and up-down gadgets
42   may be used to move about the various locations you will
43   visit.  Clicking on the 'I'nventory button will show you a
44   list of all objects you currently have on you.
45   NOTE: The objects will usually be in your pocket.  To do
46   anything with them, you first have to get them from your
47   pocket!  Clicking on the 'L'ocation button will display the
48   text associated with a scene.  Clicking on the 'S'tatus




                                                   Page 1

49   button will get you a status report from Sandie, your Ship's
50   Computer.  ('Sandie' stands for "Ships Automated Navigation
51   Data and Information Entity").  Sandie is your best friend and
52   companion, totally dedicated to your well being.  She will
53   help you, offer advice on occasion and sometimes act as your
54   conscience.  But be careful!  Sandie has been in space a LONG
55   time.  Thanks to the wonders of futuristic electronics, Sandie
56   is always with you through a tele-link, even when you are off
57   the ship.
58     The 'What Now' prompt: This is your keyboard entry method.
59   All game commands have a keyboard equivalent.  Typing 'n' or
60   'N' or 'North' is the same as clicking on the upward arrow of
61   the compass rose.  You get the 'What Now' prompt by pressing
63   the left mouse button with the pointer over the text display
64   area, or by pressing the <ESC>ape, <RET>urn or <SPACEBAR>
65   keys.  The 'What Now' prompt must be displayed before any
66   keyboard commands can be given.  To execute a command, type
67   in the command, such as 'stat' or 'status' for a
68   Status report, then press return.  If an illegal command is
69   given, the text area will display 'Can't'.
70   NOTE:  Every scene has its own group of legal commands.  What
71   may be illegal in one scene may be a required command in
72   another.
73     The Game Options Menu:  Directly above the Text Display area
74   is the Game Options Menu.  Pressing the right mouse button
75   will show this menu.  Continue to hold the right button down
76   then move the pointer over the desired selection and release
77   the button.  Two options are available at all times, unless
78   the pointer indicates 'WAIT' or 'TEXT'.

79   Remember Brad, it is a dangerous world you inhabit, but your
80   animal cunning and sexual prowess can see you through as it
81   always has before!
