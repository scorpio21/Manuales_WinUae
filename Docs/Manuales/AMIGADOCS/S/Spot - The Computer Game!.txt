 HOW TO DIVE STRAIGHT IN:
 If you are the only player and would like to challenge the computer, move 
 the cursor over the START GAME icon and click. The game will begin with you
 in control of the red game pieces and a Level 1 Computer player in control
 of the green pieces. The animated character, Spot, will dance around the 
 board as moves are made; you fight over all 49 squares on the board, the 
 Secret Spot Squares facility will be active but there will be no time limits
 set for either you or the computer.

 THE OPTION SCREEN:
 Spot can be played by one to four players, any or all of which can be cont-
 rolled by the computer, and there are several timer facilities that can be
 used to make frantc. These game parameters are set on the Option Screen -
 click on the OPTION button on the Spot main screen:
 Here, the default settings for the game are active - this is how Spot is 
 configured when it first loads. The four groups of three buttons at each
 corner of the Option Screen are used to set the options for the four players
 who can join in a game. as this option screen is set up for a two-player
 game, the two player pannels in the lower half of the screen are 
 'greyed out'.

 SETTING PLAYER OPTIONS: -CHOOSING PLAYERS-
 The three buttons in each player panel are used to set up attributes for the
 player. By moving the cursor over a button and clicking, you can change the
 icon it display-keep clicking on a button, and you will eventually cycle
 through all the alternative parameters that it can be used to control.
 The button at the four corner of the Option Screen allow you to tell the
 computer whether a human player will control that player position on the
 board. Player 3 and Player 4 are greyed out when you first load Spot - to 
 call those player position into play, just click on the appropriate grey 
 player button in the player panels at the base of the screen.
 Choosing Control Devices: A player can choose to use the mouse, a joystick,
 or the keyboard.

 GAME OPTIONS: -Setting Computer Skill Levels-
 whenever you select the computer as a player, an icon that looks like this
 will appear in the button that would allow you to choose between mouse,joy-
 stick and keyboard as the control device for a human player:
 The computer can play at nine different skill levels, conveniently numbered
 1 to 9. Keep clicking on the skill button to cycle through until the skill
 level you want the computer to play at appears - 1 is the least intelligent,
 9 is the smartest....

 -Setting A Player Time Limit-
 When Spot first loads, the games is configured so that there is no limit on
 the amount of time the two players can take thinking about their move.
 You can choose to play whit the Player Time set to NO TIMER, or by clicking
 on this button, you can cycle through the time limits that can be set for a
 particular player. You can configure the game so that a player has 5,10,20,
 or 40 seconds in which to ponder a move. If you have activated the Timer,
 when the turn passes to a player a window opens on the screen and starts a
 countdown. If the player fails to make a move before this timer counts down
 to zero, then he or she loses the chance to make a move and the turn passes
 to the next player in sequence. NB if the player has selected a counter, but
 fails to move it when the timer reaches zero, that counter is lost....

 SETTING GAME OPTIONS:
 Once the player buttons have been set up to your satisfaction, it is time to
 consider what global parameters you would like to set - they will apply to
 all the players in the game.
 
 -Controlling Your Host - SPOT-
 Your host during a game is the athletic character SPOT - as the turn passes
 from player to player, SPOT will move around the margin of the board and tap
 his foot impatiently next to the meter that shows how many counters the 
 current player has turned to his or her colour.
 When Spot first loads, your host has been set to take a more active part in
 proceeding - he will leap and cavort over the board each time a counter is
 moved.
 The button in the centre of the Option Screen shows SPOT giving the 
 'thumbs up' against a bright green background. If you click on this button,
 it will toggle to show SPOT giving the 'thumbs down' against a dark back-
 ground you have turned SPOT off and he will not perform his acrobatics
 during play.

 -Setting a Game-time Limit For All Players-
 By clicking on the timer button in the player panel that relates to one of
 the participants in a game, you can set a time limit within which that 
 player has to take each turn. Rather than limit the amount of time in which
 individual players have to make a move each time it is their turn, you can
 use the Game Clock to set a time limit which applies to all the players.
 This Game-time is in effect an allowance of time in which each player has to
 make all the moves that he or she makes during the game.
 When Spot first loads, the Game Clock button is disabled - the button which
 controls it displays NO CLOCK. By clicking on this button , you can cycle
 through the set of Game-time options:1,2,3,5,7 and 9 minutes. If you click 
 on this button, all the timer buttons in the player panels are automatically
 reset to NO TIMER.
 The Game-Clock does not directly govern how long a game will last - what it
 does is set a time allowance that applies to all the players. If the Game
 Clock has been set, each player can take as long as he or she likes over 
 making a move during a turn. When the game is started, the timer is set to
 the number of minutes you select in the Game Clock button on the Options -
 Screen. When the turn passes to a player a clock appears on screen showing
 the amount of Game-time remaining for that player, and begins counting down
 until the player makes the move - once a player uses up his or time her time
 allowance, then he or she can make no more moves in that game.

 -The Extra Button-
 When Spot first loads, the Extra button is toggled on. You can toggle it off
 again if you likr - but it won't affect the way the game is configured. It 
 is in fact a bonus button for you to play with - it does nothing!

 ACTIVATION GAME OPTIONS:
 Once you have configured all the buttons on the Options Screen to your 
 statisfaction, a click on the EXIT button returns you to the Spot main menu
 screen with your parametars for play set up. A summary of the Options Screen
 controls appears over the page.

 EDITING THE SPOT BOARD:
 When Spot first loads, the game defaults are set so that you play on the 
 full 49-square board. There are a further 512 preprogrammed playng boards
 for you to enjoy - and a powerful board editing facility allows you to 
 customise the play area to your heart's content.
 The Edit Board screen is accessed by clicking on the EDIT BOARD button on
 the Spot main screen.
 Squares on the playng board can be edited out of play by clicking on 
 individually - in the picture above, a square to the top left of the board
 has been 'removed' by clicking on it. When you first access the Edit Board
 is set up so that squares can be edited out of play one by one. You can't,
 of course, block out the four start squares at the four corners of the 
 playing board.

 -Symmetrical Editing-
 If you click on the SYM button on the Edit Board screen, squares that you
 edit out are also 'reflected' in the horizontal and vertical axes that run 
 through the centre of the board. Clicking on the square towards the top left
 of the board with the SYM facility toggled on produces this board.

 -Using the Pre-programmed Boards-
 There are 512 pre-programmed boards in the game - if you don't want to 
 design your own cutsom board, click on the SHAKE button on the Edit Board
 screen to call up one of the pre-programmed boards. Keep clicking on SHAKE
 until a board that you want to play on appears.

 Once you are happy with a board that you have designed or selected on the
 Edit Board screen, clicking on the EXIT button returns you to the Spot main
 screen with the board confirmed as your desired playing area.

 If things aren't going too well for you on the Edit Board screen, clicking 
 on the UNDO button will immediately clear the the board for you - and you
 can start the editing process afresh.

 PLAYING SPOT:
 -THE GAME OBJECTIVE-
 No matter how you configure the game or the board, the goal is the same - to
 achieve domination by filling as many of the squares with your colour 
 counter as you can. The winner is the player who has the most game pieces on
 the board when the game ends, which is usually when the board is full.

 -Taking Turns-
 Players take turns, starting with player 1 who controls the red counters,
 moving on to player 2 who controls green. If you have set up a game for more
 than two players, then player 3 uses blue couters while player 4 has black
 counters.
 Little meters at the corner of the game screen keep a running tally of the
 number of counters each player has on the board, and your host SPOT reminds
 you which player has the turn by standing under his or her score meter und 
 tapping his food impatiently until the moves is made. The computer players
 automatically take their turns without being propted by SPOT.

 -Making Moves-
 At the start of a turn, a human player must first select the counter that he
 or she wishes to move by clicking on it - it will begin to flash, indicating
 that it is the active counter. To make the move, the hand cursor then needs
 to be moved over a vacant square on the board - clicking again will make the
 move with the selected counter, providing the move complies with the rules
 of the game. If a player attempts an illegal move, the computer will beep
 when he or she clicks on the destination square for the active counter.
 It is possible to change your mind as to which counter you want to move 
 during a turn - just click on another one, and it will beckome the active
 counter which can be moved.
 
 -Legal Moves-
 Counter can only be moved into vacant squares on the board.
 If a counter is moved to an adjacent square, then it will clone itself - at
 the very laest, your score will increase by one.
 A counter can 'jump' in any direction over one square(which can be occuped
 or vocant) to load on a vocant square. If this move is made, then the 
 counter will not clone itself and it leaves a vacant square behind.

 -Capturing Pieces-
 The real key to playing Spot succesfully is mastering the strategies
 involved. When a player's counter lands in an empty squares on the board it
 will capture any pieces that belong to other players that are in squares 
 that are adjacent to the square in which the counter lands. You will see 
 this happening. Cloning moves are relativly safe - jumping moves can leave
 a vacant square into which one of your opponents might leap, thereby 
 capturing some of your counters. Use them with care, or you could find that
 a short-term gain is very quickly turned into a long-term loss.
