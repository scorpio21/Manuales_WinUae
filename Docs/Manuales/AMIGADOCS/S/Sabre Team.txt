throw grenade
-------------
allows a player to throw a grenade,grenades may be thrown through
windows,and bounced off walls.

how to throw grenades
---------------------
once throw has been selected the aiming of the grenade takes place
similarly to the firing of a gun. however, the grenade may not reach its
target as the distance it can be thrown is limited by the strength of the
player throwing it.grenades may be bounced off walls and thrown through
windows. the effect of a grenade lasts one game turn.

note: a grenade must be primed before it can be thrown,and must be thrown
before switching control to another player,or ending the game
turn,otherwise it will explode.

aim shot
--------
allows a player to take an accurate shot at a traget. the out-come of a
shot is influenced by the players markmanship and the weapons effective
range.

snapshot
--------
allows a player to take aim and fire quickly, using minimal action
poits,resulting in poor hit ratio

how to fire guns
----------------
once a snapshot or aimshot have been selected the mouse pointer is joined
by sights, and an image of a snipe appears at the bottom of the screen. aim
your shot by moving the sights with the mouse pointer until the sights
encompass the base of the target, click the left mouse button to confirm
the target. note; the target must be in line of fire(ie the direction the
gun is pointing) if the target is off visible screen,it is possible to
scroll around the game zone by moving the sights to the edge of the screen
and pressing the right mouse button. the screen will now centre around the
point the sights were placed.
once the target has been selected,you must select the number of rounds to
fire. this is done by clicking the left mouse button over the arrows (<
decrease number of rounds,> increase number of rounds) surrounding the
number box below the snipers gun, and then clicking on the number in the
box. firing will now commence. the number of rounds selected is limited by
the action points needed to fire, or the number of rounds remaining in the
gun. single shot weapons can only fire one shot before reloading is
required.selecting zero rounds cancels the shot.

note; before a gun can be fired it must be loaded with ammo

opportunity move
----------------
if some action points are saved before ending a players turn,during the
enemys turn an opportunity move may be awarded, an opportunity move occurs
if a player has more than 5 action points,and can be seen by the
opposition. the number of action points saves determines the chance of
being awarded an opportunity move;saving 20 or more action points gives a
100% chance,decreasing towards 0% as less action points are saved.during an
opportunity move control is taken from the enemy and the player concerned
is given a chance to use his remaining action points. ending his turn gives
control back to the enemy. only one opportunity move may be awarded per
game turn.
