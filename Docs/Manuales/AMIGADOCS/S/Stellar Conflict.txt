STELLAR CONFLICT
Here are some (I think about 75%) of the access codes you will need to gain
access to Stellar Conflict.  If you get one that isn't on the list, just
boot over.  Happy Hunting!  MAD MEL.

Stellar Conflict is a space game that resembles the board game RISK.  You
start out on a planet in a system that has 6 planets in close to it.  This
is your base system.  The object of the game is to spread out and capture
first your systems planets and then your opponents planets.  The planets
are rated from 1 to 4 and produce more ships accordingly.  A number 4
planet is the best and will produce the most.  The Each turn you take
equals one year of production.  All ships that you receive for production
of planets will be automatically sent to your home planet so that you can
then send them out to explore or conquer  other planets.

The game is very easy to learn if you will just play it a little.  Load it
up and play a couple games to get the hang of it.  You will learn the
commands quite fast, and most are listed right on the screen.  I will now
list all commands below.

Action Commands (on right of screen)

Send Ships.  This is how you send your ships out.

View Space.   This  

One last Item, if you get tired of watching the opening screen, you can
take it out of the sequence by doing the following:

1.  Open a file worker like Disk Master, or Cli-Mate.
2.  Get the directory of the Stellar Disk.
3.  Get the sub directory of StellarStuff.
4.  Rename Stelone to any name you will remember later. (perhaps
    Real-Stelone)
5.  Now copy any non-object file to this sub directory. (I used an icon
    file, like Disk.info)
6.  Rename this file to Stelone.

Ok, your all set!  Now when you load the game, you will skip directly to
the opening option screen.  Sorry about not being able to skip over the
codes.  I am working on it.

Take it easy.....    Mad Mel.....
