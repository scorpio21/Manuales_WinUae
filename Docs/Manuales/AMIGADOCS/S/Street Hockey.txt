MANHATTAN
----------
There are sixteen parks on your route to the undisputed champions
tournament in Central Park.You start in Battery Park on the southermost tip
of the island,close to the famous World Trade Centre.You must win your 
league to get a chance to move on up to a more competitive park and tougher
opposition.But it's also tough on the streets on your way from one park
another you must try to avoid being it by the killer New York traffic;Yellow
cabs and police cars etc... each time you are hit your street cred suffers
a dent and you may find your players don't perform so well in the next few
games.Bonus energy is awarded to your players if you are quick on your feet
and make it to the next park in time.The overhead view displays an authentic
map of the downtown island and your destination will be flashing.


STREET HOCKEY SCENARIO
------------------------

Street Hockey is an all-action game with a fully interactive 3-d viewpoint
so you feel you are right in the thick of the action! In keeping with the
spirit of the street game and its origins,there are no rules and no referee.
Anything can happen and it's all to playfor but you may have to defend
yourself.This game is so fast there just isn't time for the usual nicities.

As your skill develops you will find your team growing in confidence and 
street cred.You will be able to perform delicate passes upfield or block 
an opposing player.Fights can break out without warning and are an integral
part of the game,but a smart player will not waste too much time brawling
with his opponents.

You can control any member of your team at any time during the game using 
the function keys to switch between players.Pressing f10 gives you AUTO
PLAYER CONTROL and instantly gives you control of the player nearest to 
the ball is and the flashing player is the one in possession of the ball.

When you've won your local league you can progress through the streets of
downtown Manhattan to the next park and a whole new set of opponents.

One final point STREET HOCKEY is based on the Original North American street
game and not the European derivative,so there are five players to each
team not six.


STREET HOCKEY HISTORY
----------------------

STREET HOCKEY is the only computer game to be officially endorsed by the 
british Street Hockey Association,the governing body of the game in the UK

The game was first played in the 1930s,using simple unsophisticated 
equipment which was sometimes passed down by local ice hockey teams.In those
days the game really was played on the streets,and it is in deference to 
those roots that the name survives today.During the 1950s the game fell into
decline.Then in 1965 the development of eurethane plastic for use in
skateboard wheels led to a resurgence of roller skating in the United 
States,and this eventually reached Britain in the mid 1970s.

Thereafter many hard,flat playing areas in parks and play grounds across 
the country were packed with roller skaters of all kinds.Street Hockey
was rediscovered in this country in 1978,and the present national league
structure came into being in 1982.Since then the sport has grown 
phenomenally.Today there are around 250 teams,male and female;from under-10s
to seniors,throughout the country.Street Hockey has attracted major
commercial sponsorship and receives regular coverage on channel four
television.
