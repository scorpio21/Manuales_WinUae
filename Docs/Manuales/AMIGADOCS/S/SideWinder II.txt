SideWinder II
Typed by Belgarath


Initial Briefing

Long range detectors are sensing a huge mass approaching
from the direction of the aliens homeworld. Initial reports
from remote scouts indicate it to be a massive battle station,
many times larger than the "Star Killer", the ship you
destroyed 27 years ago in the mission that brought pace.

The "SideWinder" mission.

Computer selection, after many considerations has chosen
you as the only possible candidate for the second
SideWinder mission.

The mission will begin when we have obtained more data.

End of initial briefing.


Briefing Update

Covert intelligence report a possible weak point has been
found:

Access to the alien battle station is via a tunnel used to vent
any excess energy. Lining the tunnel are defensive positions
which may be destroyed.

There are also a large number of venting doors. These
automatically open and close and cannot be destroyed.
They must be avoided.

Finally, maintenance and defence drones patrol the ducts
watching for faults and space scavengers. To help you, extra
weaponry will be 'ported' in so you must watch out for these
and collect them. The extra weaponry includes lasers and
multi shots.

This 'bolt-on' capability can, should the pilot choose
carefully, increase the fire power of your vessel tenfold.
