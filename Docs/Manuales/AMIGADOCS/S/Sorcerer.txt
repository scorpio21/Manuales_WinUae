Preface to the Story

Welcome to the world of the Enchanter saga - a world where magic is
commonplace, a world where guilds of professional magic-users spend their
lifetimes mastering the intricacies of thaumaturgy, a world where great forces
of evil must constantly be held at bay.
In your late youth you left home to join the Guild of Enchanters. After years
of schooling, you achieved the rank of Apprentice Enchanter. In fulfillment of
an ancient prophecy, you were sent to find Krill, an evil warlock who had
loosed a pestilence upon the land, and who threatened the very existence of the
Circle of Enchanters. Only some guileless and inexperienced in the ways of
magic could slip into Krill's realm unnoticed.
By defeating Krill, you earned a seat on the Cricle of Enchanters, sitting at
the right hand of your mentor, the leader of the guild, Belboz the Necromancer.
Several years have passed, and you have grown very close to Belboz as you
studied under his tutelage, learning the ways of magic from one of the world's
most learned practitioners.
But lately, Belboz has seemed troubled, preoccupied, withdrawn... small things
only a friend would notice. You have even heard frightening noises coming from
his chamber, and the voices of conversation when Belboz was supposedly alone.
His temper has seemed short the last few days, and the look in his eyes sends
cold shivers down your back. Could some evil spirit be at work here? You are
sleepless from worry - Belboz is possibly the most powerful Enchanter in the
kingdom. If his powers were used by the forces of darkness instead of the
forces of light, who knows what would result?
And now, unbeknownst to you, Belboz has vanished.

Note:

Before using a spell, you'll have to learn it. Before learning a spell, it must
be written into your spell book via GNUSTO spell. For example

  CAST GNUSTO SPELL ON REZROV SPELL or
  GNUSTO REZROV

will write the REZROV spell into your spell book. Now you can LEARN REZROV
and REZROV [SOMETHING].

There is yet another way of casting a spell. You'll find most spells on
scrolls. Holding the scroll, you can cast a spell without writing it into your
spell book (for some powerful spells this is the only method). But be careful,
the spell will be lost after a single use!

----------------------------------------------------------

BLOODWORM: Bloodworms live in shallow underground pools of water and are often
mistaken for mossy boulders. Their pointy, retractable fangs can extend up to
32 inches during attack. They are repelled by the smell of boiled chives: always
carry some if venturing near known bloodworm spawning grounds. Bloodworms are
usually white and gray and black and red and black.

BROGMOID: In rare cases, these squat creatures can achieve the intelligence
level of a three-year.old human. Domesticated brogmoids are tame and can be
even taught to perform simple tasks. In the wild, they can be seen in huge
packs sorting through rock piles for edible rocks. Brogmoids (which live
considerably longer in captivity) are red and purple and red and black and
purple.

DORN: The deadly dorn beast should be avoided at all costs - it can paralyze
its victim with a single glare from its powerful eyes. (Range: about three feet
for young beastlings to about 20 feet for full-grown dorns.) Dorns usually live
in crags and shadows near cliff bases. According to the last words of dying
explorers, dorns are gray and purple and black and gray and white.

DRYAD: Dryads, also known as tree spirits, are beautiful and shy. Many never
leave the shade of the tree they were born under. If coaxed, dryads can reveal
the location of forest treasures. They are only dangerous in large numbers, and
then only if threatened. (Angered dryads have been known to crush attackers
under tons of rose petals.) When awake, dryads are black and gray and white and
red and red.

GRUE: The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth.
Its favorite diet is Enchanters, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its
fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the light of days, and few have
survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale. Toxicologists believe that grues
are black and black and red and black and purple.

HELLHOUND: When you spot a hellhound, run in the other direction as fast as you
can! Hellhounds are fast, fierce and capable of devouring a human 12 times
their size in 3 1/2 seconds. They normally inhabit burnt-out or enchanted woods
and rarely venture beyond their turf, even in pursuit of prey. Hellhounds are
purple and white and gray and red and gray.

KOBOLD: Kobolds are very capcble fighters. If attacked, they will fight back;
if not attacked, they will fight back anyway. The look very similar to the less
aggressive paskalds, but can be easily identified because their middle toe is
slightly shorter than the toes that flank it. Kobolds live in small tribes in
caverns or in dark forests and are red and purple and black and purple and red.

NABIZ: Nabiz are mostly mouth, which is mostly teeth. They instinctively sense
their enemy's weakest point when attacking. Contrary to folklore, they cannot
fly, but they can leap tremendous distances. Nabiz are repulsed by the color
blue, which explains that color's popularity in adventurer's garb. Nabiz are
purple and black and black and black and red.

ORC: Once a fearsome race of warriors, the Orcs were civilized by their
fondness for computerized adventure games. Altough a small segment (the Hi-Res
Orcs) enjoy graphic adventures, the vast majority (the Orcs of Zork) prefer
interactive fiction. In the reflected light of a CRT screen, Orcs appear to be
red and gray and purple and gray and red.

ROTGRUB: Less than an inch long, the rotgrub lies waiting in food. Once
ingested, the rotgrub heads straight for its victim's brain and begins feeding.
Rotgrub death is excruciatingly painful and lasts years before a welcome
demise. They are totally impervious to all forms of magic, and, even worse,
smell like very old cheese. A common house rotgrub is gray and red and gray and
purple and red.

SURMIN: From their malodorous breath to their lice-ridden fur, surmins are
utterly repulsive creatures. If they get close enough, they can bore their
victim to death by reciting Greater Borphee County Penal Codes. A newly shaved
surmin is black and black and purple and red and black.

YIPPLE: The yipple is a master of disguise, able to alter form to match its
surroundings. If disturbed in the wild, some yipples may bite. They make
wonderful pets, but should never be allowed to rest in the cookie jar if guests
are expected. Yipples are violently allergic to many kinds of animal wastes.
When placed on a plain white tablecloth, yipples become gray and purple and
white and purple and black.
