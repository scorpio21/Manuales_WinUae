                        SPIDERTRONIC

                     

AIM OF THE GAME
     Rebuild the electronic web by making passage ways between 
each level. You do this with colored tiles. A flashing LED at the 
bottom of the screen tells you which color of tile to use.
     Move over the tile you want to pick up then go to the tile 
you want to cover.
     When they are all covered the passage way is complete. Go to 
the teleport grid to change levels.
     Easy huh!!
     Sorry folks, look out for BALLS...the dreaded BALLS.
      You can destory Balls with Webs which you can place on blue 
tiles only. BALLS no longer on the screen will die and regenerate 
on the Ball-starter tiles a few seconds later. Nasty huh.
     To gain time pick up the pastilles (little blocks).
     Restarter tiles (red and yellow). If you move over these 
before being destroyed then you will restart from that tile.
     Avoid the black tiles...paralysis.
     There are ten levels to the game.
