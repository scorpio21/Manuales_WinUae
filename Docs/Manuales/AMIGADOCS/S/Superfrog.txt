ABOUT THE PROJECT
 
EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER,WE ALWAYS WANTED TO PRODUCE A SUPER-PLAYABLE
PLATFORM GAME IN THE CLASSIC STYLE.. MUCH LIKE WHAT WE DID WITH PROJECT X
IN THE SHOOT-EM UP MOULD.THE IDEA OF SUPER FROG HAD BEEN AROUND FOR A 
CONSIDERABLE TIME AND IT WAS A MATTER OF FINISHING UP OTHER PROJECTS BEFORE
WE GOT AROUND TO COMPLETEING THE PROJECT.
 
NOW ITS FINISHED WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE GAME AND CHARACTER THAT IS AGELESS
IN APPEAL AND WILL HOPEFULLY BECOME A MILESTONE ON THE AMIGA.TECHNICALLY
WE HAVE SQUEEZED THE MACHINE VERY HARD,SO MUCH SO THAT I DOUBT IF MORE COULD
BE DONE.
 
THE TRUE TEST OF COURSE,IS WHAT YOU,AS THE PLAYER,THINKS TO THE GAME..WE HAD
EXCELLENT FEEDBACK DURING DEVELOPMENT AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL LOOK
UPON SUPER FROG AS AN EXCELLENT PURCHASE AND ONE THAT WILL GIVE YOU,YOUR 
FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY,MANY HOURS OF CONSIDERABLE ENTERTAINMENT.
 
AS FOR THE TEAM LISTED ABOVE,WE'RE BACK ON THE ALIEN BREED 2 ASSIGNMENT..
WORKING WITH A CUTE GREEN FROG WHO HASN'T GOT A GUN HAS BEEN,SHALL WE SAY,
~DIFFERENT~ !!

SUPER FROG.. ALMOST A FAIRY TALE 
 
Hi there and a warm welcome to magic land.. former home of the magic prince
and his lovely bride to be.All was peace and harmony until the wicked witch
lived up to those fabled danish fairy tales and predictably turned the poor 
old prince into nothing more than a little green frog.. but.. it was only a
matter of a few hours beside the river bank(being prince's far less statley
new home) when a strange bottle floated past.. intriguied, he grabbed it and
drank from bottle and the rest is history.. or at least it will be sooner or
later.
 
COMPATABILITY AND OTHER NOTES
 
SUPER FROG has been tested on an extensive variety of AMIGA machines and 
works on all varieties, from the A500 to the A4000 including the CDTV/1200.
Should you experience any difficulties then it is probably the case of faulty
or corrupt disks, in any case please refer to the TROUBLESHOOTING guide.If 
you have external drives connected, you may use those during play.
 
SUPER FROG is not hard drive installable.. the disks that SUPER FROG are 
supplied on are not the usual amigaDOS format and writing to them will most
likely result in damage,so ALWAYS keep them write protected.
 
RECCOMENDATIONS
 
SUPER FROG is controlled from the joystick in port 2,the gameport next to the
one where the mouse is usually located.Turn any auto fire off before play as
the game will not function correctly with auto fire enabled.
 
Hooking your AMIGA'S sound output through an amplifier or your HIFI will
result in even further enjoyment of the exellent music during the game.
 
Your SUPER FROG disks carry on disk protection and cannot be backed up.So
long as you treat them with care and keep them write protected they will give
you trouble free operation.Keep them away from strong magnetic sources such
as the top of TV'S/MONITORS and speakers.. if your disks do become faulty by
spilling coffee or whatever else on them,then please refer to the returns
guide.
 
LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

Turn your amiga OFF at the power supply and wait 10 seconds.. turn it back on
again and continue the instructions as laid out below -this ensures your 
system is clear of all other data.
 
When the usual insert disk prompt appears you can insert either the story 
disk or game disk 1.
 
Inserting game disk 1 will load the game straight away,missing out the 
introductory animation.
 
If, after a short while,nothing has appeared on screen or the insert disk 
prompt still remains then repeat the instructions once more and consult the
TROUBLESHOOTING guide for futher help and information.
 
MAIN MENU
 
When the game has loaded and the SUPER FROG character is on screen,pressing
your button will reveal two selections;START GAME and OPTIONS.
 
GAME OPTIONS
 
You can move through the various selections with the joystick,using fire to
toggle the various options.When you are satisfied you can return to the main
menu and start the game.
 
LIVES
 
Selectable between 1,3 or 5(default is 3)
 
SKILL LEVEL
 
Easy or normal.Easy gives you a slightly slower type of control,more game
time etc.(default is normal)
 
SAVE HIGH SCORES
 
You can save your high scores to a data disk to keep a permanent record of
your achievement.You should NOT use your SUPER FROG disks for this purpose.
 
LEVEL CODES
 
During the game you will be given codes to restart at various levels,these
can be typed in here.
 
PAGE 3
 
START GAME
 
If you have one of the LEVEL CODES as described earlier you may jump into the
game at a later level, so there's no need to cover old ground(unless you feel
that you need the practice or a big score!) otherwise you start at the 
beginning,in the magic woods as SUPER FROG sets off in his quest to vanquish
his froggy curse,get back his girl and teach that old witch a lesson or two!
 
GAME PLAY
 
The game is divided into worlds,of which there are six major ones,in each 
world there are a number of levels and you must complete all the levels in
order to advance through that world and on to the next.
 
MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO AROUND
 
To complete a level you must collect a certain number of coins,which acts as
a toll fee(even in magic worlds,bills must be paid,appearence fee's met and
so on..)-this is shown on the large coin in the bottom right hand corner of
the screen.When all the coins have been collected,the exit will open and you
can progress further.
 
THE TIME ELEMENT & BONUS AWARDS
 
You will also notice that when you start,a timer begins to count down..this
represents the time you have left before your SUPER POWERS run out and you 
tuen into a normal frog once more..which in effect means that the game is
over.To counter this effect,SUPER FROG must find and drink bottles of
LUCOZADE to maintain this SUPER ENERGY..in the first few worlds there is 
plenty of LUCOZADE scattered about,but as you progress it becomes 
increasingly rare and this means that you have to move quicker and be more
thoughtful in your approach.
 
Collecting fruit gives you points and also counts towards the SUPER BONUS
award and the conclusion of each of the games levels.You are awarded credits
for the amount of time left(increased by collecting more LUCOZADE),the 
number of fruit collected and also the number of coins collected(including
all the hidden ones).You are then given the chance to change these credits
into points,or gamble them on the bonus game.(see bonus game)
 
SPECIAL ITEMS
 
You will also find a number of special powers scattered around for your use,
these are detailed below;
 
WINGS
 
Enables you to fly by quickly pressing your button when in the air,this helps
perform greater leaps.you cannot stay airborne forever though and sooner or
later you'll drop back down to earth.
 
DESTRUCTO-SPUD
 
This little green blob does your dirty work,you can throw him at airborne
ememies and knock them to the ground.To fire SPUD,hold down your joystick
button when you are stood still(it will not work in the air).You can also
fire SPUD upwards and to the side by pressing the relevent direction whilst
holding fire down.
 
INVISIBILITY PILL
 
This little ped pill renders our hero inviible to his enemies for a short
term,which obviously has its advantages.
 
SPEED PILL
 
These come in two forms,SPEEDUP(green) and SLOWDOWN(red) and are obvious as
to what they do.Speed pills are usually placed in a position where speed is
either necessary or useful and not in places where going fast would be a 
hindrance,such as a particularly tricky jumping section.
 
LUCOZADE
 
This prolongs you SUPER ENERGY and also acts to boost your bonus award at the
end of each level.The more LUCOZADE you get,the more time you will have,the
better score you will achive.It pays to find those golden bottles!
 
RESTART PILL
 
This red pill with a large ~R~ on it enables you to restart at this point
should you lose a life.On the early worlds,these pills are pretty frequent,
enabling you to get further into the game more quickly.

PAGE 4
  
 
OTHER ITEMS
 
Other special items,such as JEWELS,CROWNS and so on,can be found in 
particular worlds and levels.These add greatly to your score and are well
worth seeking.You are awarded an extra frog every 200,000 points.
 

CONTROLLING SUPER FROG
 
The controls have been made as simple as possible,allowing precision and
comfort on the joystick.
 
Pushing left/right will move the frog left/right.Pushing up will make SUPER
FROG jump,pushing up and keeping the joystick up will make him jump a little
higher.
 
Pressing the fire button has no effect unless he has collected a special item
such as WINGS or he is carrying his friend SPUD.(see special items).
 
When in flight you can move SUPER FROG right/left and manouvre him over
dangerous obstacles and enemies.If you tap the joystick in the opposite
direction,he will drop straight down,allowing you to control where he land/
drop.
 
You can attack various enemies from the air,such as the snails and blue blobs
on world one.. this will ~SPLAT~ them and enables you to clear the world and 
collect a fruit bonus in the process.Some enemies,the bird and hedgehog in
world one for example,cannot be destroyed and it is for you to discover which
in other worlds.. the best way to find out is to get an invisibility pill 
and try jumping on the enemies! Airborne enemies such as the bats and wasps
can be jumped on or blasted by SPUD.

Its common sense to avoid things like fire,spikes and so on..frogs,even SUPER
ones are generally soft,gooey creatures that do not enjoy such contact.
 
LEVEL ONE HINTS
 
To get you started,you should note that LEVEL 1 has two hidden sections and 
that the blobs,snails and wasps can all be squashed by jumping on them.
 
BONUS GAME-FRUIT MACHINE
 
After the SUPER AWARD at the end of each level,you are given credits which
you can turn into points,or use on the FRUIT MACHINE.In the FRUIT MACHINE 
you can try and win level codes,extra lives and massive advances(all numbers
shown mean thousands of points).Playing the machine is simple enough and can
be done with either the joystick or mouse.
 
In general whenever something is lit on the far right,you have won that 
amount(in thousands)and you can either COLLECT it,or opt to GAMBLE IT,where
the outcome could either of the other two flashing squares above and below
it.The HI-LO feature enables you to gamble on the spin of a number(1-10)and
progress through the features on the right side.
 
The JACKPOT (gained by gambling,through the HI-LO feature or by getting three
LUCOZADE cans)rewards you with points for remaining credits,a hefty score 
bonus and the code to start at the next level whenever you play again!
 
GAME OVER
 
After each contact with an enemy,you lose one unit of energy.When you lose 
five units of energy,a life is lost.
 
The game ends when your supply of lives is spent or you run out of SUPER
ENERGY time(which shouldn't happen as there is plenty of LUCOZADE on each
level to enable it to be completed comfortably).
 
TROUBLESHOOTING
 
I'M NOT BOTHERING WITH THIS SECTION AS IT'S OBVIOUS THAT YOUR USING A CRACKED
VERSION OF THIS GAME!!!!!
