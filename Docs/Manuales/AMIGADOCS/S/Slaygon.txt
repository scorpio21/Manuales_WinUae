				SLAYGON

			      INTRODUCTION

You developed it....The Slaygon. The ultimate infiltration device.

Controlled from within by one highly trained specialist. It possesses the
strength of a hundred men, the armour and weapons of a small tank, and the
intelligence of it's operator. The Slaygon is the most sophisticated robot ever
created. Conventional weapons have no effect on it and normal defenses are
merely a nuisance.

You, and your one of a kind machine, are needed by the government to help
uphold peace and justice in the world.

The situation is critical. You accept immediate employment as an officer in the
United Defense Force.

	You receive the following top secret dispatch.....

(A report on Cybordynamics, a controversial business empire devoted to
replacing human workers with automated robots and machines)

	"Intelligence report: Cybordynamics Laboratories Incorporated"

	"Recent intelligence indicates Cybordynamics coastal based research
facility is working on a new strain of toxic virus which could annihilate all
human life."
	"Cybordynamics, along with their allies, could then launch a
devastating attack which would enable them to capture the world intact, without
the use of destructive nuclear weapons."
	"The Cybordynamics lab is totally automated, controlled by a Dantes
9000 megacomputer which monitors the plants fusion reactor."
	"Disable the main computer and the cooling system for the reactor will
fail, causing a reactor overload, destroying the facility."
	"None of our agents have ever been inside the complex, the location of
strategic targets is unknown."
	"We are, however, able to forge you a low clearance maintenance pass.
That will gain your access into the building."
	"Your orders are to destroy the facility at all costs."
	"Once inside you are on your own, Be careful and Good Luck."

		The transmission ends......

With your orders, you decide to activate the Slaygon.

			OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

The Slaygon master disk is not copy protected, so you will be allowed to create
backups for your personal use and/or archival storage. It is recommended that
you do this, and use the copy for game play. If you have any questions on how
to make working backups, please refer to your Amiga owners manual for the
proper procedure on how to make a backup.

LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

1-A) After turning on your Amiga, load Kickstart if needed. When the computer
asks for WorkBench insert the Slaygon Master. When the desktop with the CLI
prompt appears, type "Slaygon", then press the <Return> key. Slaygon will load
from here and you may proceed to step number 2.

1-B) The alternative is to load WorkBench as soon as you turn your machine on.
You must then open a CLI window and type "Run Slaygon", then press the <Return>
key. Or you may Double Click on the Slaygon program icon. The program will then
load and you should proceed with step number 2.

2) You will then be asked to continue a saved game (Y/N)? A response of "Y"
(yes) will load a previously saved game. While a "N" (no) response will cause a
new game to be created. If you decide to start a new game, you will then be
asked whether you would like to play the Novice or Expert level. A response of
"N" will start a Novice level adventure, a response of "E" will start the
Expert level.

3) The game will begin as soon as the computer says Slaygon is on-line and the
mouse pointer appears on the screen.

SPECIAL NOTES:

A) You can save a current game any time by pressing the screen button marked
"Save".

B) You can load a previously saved game any time by pressing the screen button
marked "Load".

C) You can exit the game without saving by pressing the screen button marked
"Quit".

D) Slaygon was written to accomodate the MultiTasking environment, allowing you
to take advantage of this feature on the Amiga. During game play if you hold
down the Amiga key and press "N", the WorkBench will appear over the top of the
Slaygon screen. You will then be free to use your computer with other programs,
while the Slaygon is still loaded. To bring Slaygon back to the front and
resume your game, hold down the Amiga key and press "M".

E) There is room on your disk to save one game to it. If you choose save a game
and one already is previously saved, then the game you are playing now will be
saved and the one on the disk will be erased.

				GAME HINTS

				-WARNING-

	   TURNING THIS PAGE MAY TAKE AWAY THE FUN OF DISCOVERY!

YOUR GOAL:
	To find the five override codes and enter them into the computer room's
system console. This will disable the computer causing the main reactor's
cooling system to fail and the complex to explode. Steal the top secret data
disk and get out of the building as fast as you can, before the reactor
explodes.

ABOUT OBJECTS:
	There are five security levels, a higher level key card will allow you
to pass through all lower level doors.

	Blue		=	Minimum security
	Green		=	Low security
	Yellow		=	High security
	Red		=	Very high security
	White		=	Maximum security

	Some objects need to be "used" while others just have to be carried. A
used object effects either the Slaygon or anything visible in the front view
screen.
	Some types of objects are color coded in order of quality and/or
importance.

	Blue		=	Useful/Important
	Green		=	Very Useful
	Red		=	Extremely Useful

	Certain objects will activate equipment in special rooms. Some objects
have no use at all.

	In the Novice level these things will always be found in the same
place.
	Security keys
	Terminal rooms
	Computer room
	Important objects (Force Field Neutralizer, D-Ionizer Rod etc.)

Only objects that do not perform very important tasks will be randomly moved
throughout the complex.

in the Expert level everything is randomly distributed throughout the complex.

ABOUT GUARDS AND TRAPS

	The Force Field Neutralizer, D-Ionizer Rod, and Mine Deactivator, when
carried allow safe passage through force fields, ionizer beams, and proton
mines.
	Use your short range scanner to keep an eye on traps and guards (It
will turn red when danger is near - and the computer may identify the source of
the danger).
	Your shields will absorb some or all of the destructive energy
generated by various traps and guards, but your energy decreases more rapidly
when the shields are left on.

IN GENERAL
	The more items you have activated, the more energy you will use. Turn
off devices when they are not needed.

	Energy Pods will restore power in 1/4, 1/2, and full increments.

	Blue	=	1/4 tank
	Green	=	1/2 tank
	Red	=	Full tank

	Shield and Lazer levels are color coded like the Energy Pods.

	Blue 	=	Low power
	Green	-	Medium power	
	Red	-	High power
