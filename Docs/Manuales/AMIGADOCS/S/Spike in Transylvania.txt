THE AIM OF THE GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All of Spikey's comrades have been locked away in the dungeons of the
local castle. Spikey must rescue all of his friends to complete
the game.
 
The prison cells are all locked but the keys can be found scattered
throughout the castle. To find the keys you must explore its many rooms
solving puzzles as you go.
 
Spike has only a certain amount of energy that he can use before he 
becomes too tired to continue. If he loses all of his energy the
game is over.
