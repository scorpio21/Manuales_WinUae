                  The Legend of Pulgram and Wuron

	This story takes place in a land far beyond our imagination.  In a
world long forgotten.  In a world where the destiny of all human beings,
elves and other life forms was very much in the hands of the druids and
magicians (and their different moods) of that period.

	At this time the land was split into three parts - Taljenhort,
Khorndal and Kendron.  While the human race in Taljenhort pursued their
daily chores, work and plans (which often included warring against others),
the dwarves made themselves comfortable in their wonderful homes in the
south of the land - Kendron.  Of the third part of the land - Khorndal -
there were many rumours.  Very few people actually knew anything about this
country, the exact location was not known, nor the life forms living there.

	Rumours about Khorndal were frequently swopped, rumours of
bewitched fairy spirits, of seas of bottomless depth, of terrible
creatures, at the mention of which one's flesh would creep, and of castles
built long ago of blood, death and huge stones fromt he sacred mountains of
Jargo.

	From time to time expeditions were sent out from Kendron as well as
Taljenhort to investigate the many rumors about Khorndal.  However, no real
information was written in the chronicles of

				3

that time, as the expeditions were never again seen or heard of after
passing the swamps of darkness - the border between Taljenhort and
Khorndal.  In the course of time, the humans and dwarves began to engage
their interests in other things - things like war!

	The tiniest conflict was often the cause of a break out in war -
there really was nothing else to do in this land by fight.  Some years
later, the race of elves was again sighted in the woods surrounding
Kendron, and they associated with the dwarves.  For a long time, the elves
had not been heard of, and had been forgotten about - most people believing
that they had become extinct.

	One of these elves, an elf at the best of age by the name of
Pulgram, was looked upon by his people as the one to bring back glory and
honour.  It was also he who first suggested that the elven folk should
arise out of hiding and discard their banishment to the forests, a
punishment spoken at least one hundred years previously.  The elves and
dwarves were not natural comrades but the legendary bitterness that had
always seemed to exist between the two races was slowly beginning to fade. 
An important turning point in history occurred when, although not helping
the dwarves directly in winning their war against the humans, they supplied
knowledge of nature that until then, no one had ever known of.

				4

	Pulgram made friends with Wuron, the dwarven magician, and often
the two sat 'till late in the night in Wuron's "brown study room"
discussing the higher sciences in great detail.  They had, after some time
come to the conclusion that a great occurrence lay ahead, an incident which
would be of huge importance to all living creatures...
	
	They had observed the constellations and studies the behaviour of
animals, dug about in old writings and documents, and read the old
phrophecies.  After many months of study, Pulgram found a possible trace to
the problem.  A dusty, ancient document in the great library of Taljenhort
seemed to be the key to all secrets - but how on earth could they get to
the library of Taljenhort - with a long and tedious war raging between men
and dwarves, with no end in sight?

	Pulgram and Wuron decided to dare the adventurous journey to
Taljenhort to find and study the mysterious document.

	The curtain of darkness revealed bit by bit that evil had returned
once more to earth.  The centre of this evil force was regarded by the two
friends to be located in (you guessed it) Khorndal above which the dark
clouds of wickedness had begun to gather.

				5

	Not much is known about the journey of the two to Taljenhort.  Even
the chronicles of Kendron do not contain information on this part of the
adventure.  The only thing mentioned is that the two had made use of black
magic, although both knew that the use of such was punishable with the
death penalty.  Several rumours spread about the two friends, one being
that there had been two peculiar figures seen in the libraries of
Taljenhort, another that a corpulent dwarf had been beheaded after being
caught breaking into the holy rooms of the temple, and that his friend with
the long, pointed ears had vanished into the swamps.

	No doubt Wuron and Pulgram found what they were looking for.  Today
it is believed that they had been looking for the document of Quarol, a
wise magician who had witnessed the birth of the earth and who came from
the stars.  In that writing a starball is mentioned, a ball containing a
power beyond imagination, and that Quarol had hidden it to prevent it
falling into the wrong hands.  The saga of Quarol also mentions that Quarol
had used the starball in banishing evil from the face of the earth. 
Nevertheless, Wuron and Pulgram were of the belief that Quarol had only
partially succeeded in doing this.

	Mrs. Gargl, Wuron's cleaning woman, maintained that she had
sometimes heard him saying something about "the dark swamps" and

				6

that "evil had been awakened again".  Mrs. Gargl, however, was of the
opinion that Wuron was only boasting agains.  The price demanded by the
starball for its use was practically the same as the penalty for using
black magic.  In using the starball's energy, the user had in turn to give
his life to join the inner sanctum of it - to become part of the starball
itself.

	Later prophets all over the world regarded Wuron and Pulgram to be
in rank with the greatest martyrs of all time because they had averted a
huge danger from the world.

	Many years later, as Pulgram's house was being pulled down, the
remains of a diary were found behind a large cupboard.  This is the first
time that the readable entries have been published:

	5. Decade: "... I know that we are perhaps making a mistake that we
will later regret, but only we are able to stop this evil.  There's no one
except my dear friend and I who have the knowledge and courage to..."

	12. Decade: "... there is no longer any doubt - Quarol had not
succeeded..."

	23. Decade: "... Wuron is of the opinion that the starball is the
only remaining hope.  Until now I haven't been sure, but the welfare of all
living creatures lies in our hands - what shall I do?  Oh help..."

				7

	The last and also the longest diary entry was written in the 26
Decade.

	26. Decade: "... and so I have a great horror for this adventure,
but I also know that there is no other hope.  If Wuron and myself don't do
something against this eveil we will all have to live under the tyranny of
Mirgal.  - He is no longer asleep and is becomming stronger day by day.  In
a few months he will control the world.  We love our people too much to
allow this!  It is our task to stop Mirgal, to banish him once again again
into the realms of dreams forever, while he's still weak.  Time is slowly
running out, but he still has not reached his greatest strength.

	"The task is difficult - to find Mirgal's castle and the room of
the Dragon.  I pray that his servants be not awakened..  Wait, I hear the
knock at my door - the sign.  The time has come, Wuron waits...  May Rangor
and Elsbeth be with us and help us on our quest..."

	Later information tells us that Mirgal was a legendary dragon who
lived 10,000 years ago beyond the swamps of Khorndal.  More I cannot tell
you of this story, but let's hope that Rangor, The God of Dwarves and
Elsbeth, The Goddess of Elves and keeper of the Inner Light, helped our two
friends on their quest.

	I don't even know if this story is true, but if you see an elf or a
dwarf somewhere, just don't

				8

forget to ask him about Wuron and Pulgram.  You may believe that there are
no longer dwarves or elves on earth today - but I wouldn't think like that.
 Just go and look in the woods, listen to the birds and maybe you'll hear
whispering voices telling of long forgotten events...

                      SPHERICAL - DESCRIPTION

	As you have most certainly learned from the background story, in
this game you have to accompany a magic starball through the rooms of the
dragon's castle.  You do this by preparing the ball's passage magically,
thus directing it onto a certain field.  Only then may you enter the next
room.  There are some important displays around the playscreen, which will
be of help to you:

A) These two bottles show you the amount of magic power that keep the
starball on this plane of existence.  In case there is no power left, the
ball will return into your parallel dimension.

B) These stones show you the number of time doors still remaining.  If you
should find yourself in a hopeless situation, you only have to press ESC in
order to be put back into the time when you entered the room.

C) This display shows you your current wealth.  On the opposite side you
will make out - in case you look - an identical display for the second
hero.

D) This display gives you the number of the room in which you currently
are.  Rumour has it, that there are more than a hundred rooms, each
changing completely according to the number of people entering, be that one
or two.

E) This is the clock givin you the exact time

				10

when the starball is set in motion.  This time can be affected by an
hour-glass.

F) These test-tubes show you the amount of energy the hero is left with -
in the upper display for the first hero and in the lower display for the
second hero.  You lose energy when touching monsters or stepping in acid. 
You must leave the castle when having lost all energy.

G) These small bottles show the number of red bottles which you have
collected.  You will find out exactly what initiates the effects of the
bottles under "magic aids."

When entering the dragon's castle, you find yourself in the entrance hall. 
There you will discover eight switches of a rather magic sort which are
described by the Seven Sages of the Country as follows:

F1: One Player: If you want to go on the adventure simply as a wizard, this
is the right key for you!  Be sure that a magic device called "joystick" is
plugged into your computer.  When using a demonic device called "IBM PC",
you may as well control the magic of your hero by typing about on the magic
keyboard.

				11

F2: Two Players: If you should need a helping hand, you can take your best
friend with you by pressing this key.  In this case two magic sticks are
needed.  If two people enter the castle, it is changed in a magic sort of
fashion.  If two people try to overcome the dragon, this task is of course
more difficult to manage.

F3: Training: This key gives you the opportunity to practise wizardry. 
When pressing F3, you enter an empty hall where you may then practise your
witchcraft to your heart's delight!

F4: Magic Aids: In case you are not familiar with the magic devides in the
castle, you will find some important explanations here, but keep in mind
what some people say: Not all is mentioned here!  Additionally, the Sages
of the Country teach that there is the possibility to skip rooms and find
hidden halls.

				12

F5: Program Information: By pressing this key you will receive some insight
into knowledge about a parallel dimension, which up until now nobody could
ever understand.  Nevertheless, this insight should prove worthwhile, for
under this key you will be informed about all the other keys that you will
need during the game.

F6: Give Password: There are old and legendary documents, on which powerful
spells are written.  These should prove useful in teleporting into the hall
in the castle in which the magic scroll was found.  With this key you are
able to activate one of the magic words, taking you immediately into the
desired hall.

F7: Music Menu: You will hear odd noises in the halls of the castle.  Very
strange indeed, but by pressing this key you will find yourself in a
position to influence the noises in such a way that they will appear as
lovely tunes.  Play areound with this key, and it will prove a pleasure for
your ears.

				13

F8: Start Demo: This key calls a crystal ball onto the screen.  By using
this crystal ball you may take a look into halls you might perhaps enter
some time in the future.  Learn from the information this magic artifact
gives you, because it will be of help to you on your further way.

				14

The Magic Sticks:

	Only after seven hundred and seventy seven years was it possible to
discover all functions of the legendary magic sticks.

	Stick left/right takes the wizard in the corresponding direction. 
By pressing stick upwards, he most certainly and surprisingly jumps!  You
may combine that with the left/right movement, thus making it possible to
jump across wide chasms.

	When pressing the stick button, the magi is called to life, after
which a stone appears.  The stone will appear on the same height as the
wizard.  Only when pushing the stick downwards at the same time as
pressing, will it appear below the wizard.

	Experienced magic stick wielders may bewitch a stone onto their
screen even while jumping or falling.

	When using sparklers in the later course of the game, you can let
the sparkler drift about on the screen by pressing the stick button for
longer periods.  If you repeat that action, the sparkler will return to
you.

The Book of the Seven Sages:

	The Seven Sages of the Country have written a book, which gives
some account of what will happen in the castle.  Unfortunately, you can't
rely on everything in this book, because the Ancienti Sources - out of
which the Seven Sages took their information - are of magical nature, and
magic is often a tricky king of thing...

				15

The Stones:

	There are stones of various sorts in the castle.  Some are solid
and will stubbornly refuse to be bewitched away; others are weaker and will
disappear when magic is used.  Another sort of stone produces acid that you
shouldn't touch, but in general you can walk on stones of every sort.

Doors and Amulets:

	These doors are no ordinary doors.  In every one of them you will
find a magic diamond of one or the other colour.  If you find an amulet of
the same colour, all doors of the corresponding color will be opened in the
course of time.  Rumour has it, that some rooms in the castle should be
opened at the correct moment, otherwise they will be of no use to you.

				16

Diamonds:

	Wealth has always been the dream of everybody.  Of course, you want
to live in comfort after you have overcome the castle and the dangers
lurking there.  The value of each diamond is determined by its colour and
shape.  The Sages say, that there are diamonds not worth being collected,
and that magic is needed in order to determine the true value of a
gemstone.

Hour-Glass:

	The magic which is necessary to keep the starball steady decreases
in the course of time.  You can strengthen the magic power by use of the
hour-glass, which will give you more time to prepare a certain room for
carrying the starball into the next one.

				17

Decanter:

	Together with his energy a wizard loses his life, as the Sages say.
 With the draught in the decanter you can revitalize yourself and encounter
the dangers of the castle with new strength.

Scroll:

	These ancient scrolls contain an ancient magic which will give you
the strength to jump further than ever before.  When casting the spell,
your wizard is filled with fresh power.  Rumour has it, that these scrolls
never lie around at random, but always have their purpose.

Document:

	Yes, you are right; this actually is one of the powerful documents
containing the most powerful magic of all!  Remember the word of power very
well; you find it on the yellowed

				18

page.  This word is very useful indeed for new efforts to master this
castle.

Gravitation:

	Unknown people have constructed these switches.  Unknown
possibilities are hidden within them.  When moving one of these switches
with magic, gravitation changes, but only for the starball!  Rumour has it,
that some switches change gravitation in only one direction, whereas others
switch it this way and that by turns.

Wand:

	A wizard called Yarmak left these wands behind in order to use them
later on returning to the castle.  A wand makes it possible to go directly
into the next room by using its magic.  Until today, only Yarmak knows how
to handle these wands!

				19

Helping Hand:

	This red bottle really has it!  When drinking the liquid in it, you
will, for a short time have the power to destroy all evil things in a room.
 Where the monsters vanish to, or how it works remains a secret, because
most experiments done with the bottle failed with the researchers vanished
themselves!

Timestop:

	A green liquid - contained in a small bottle - makes the impossible
possible: Time stands still (Gosh!).  Even though this effect remains only
a short "time", it has helped many a hero!  Abuse of this form of magic
nowadays leads to punishment, because most of all thieves make use of it in
order to rob their victims during the time-standstill.

				20

Magic Lantern:

	When you rub this lantern, you will be surprised to learn that NO
genie arrives!  On the contrary, you will be, for a short time,
invulnerable.  Even the evil eyes won't have the power to harm you as long
as the effect lasts.  The military people of a while lot of countries have
been trying to construct a duplicate of this lantern every since, but up
until now fortunately to no avail.

Sparkler:

	This strange artifact is of unknown origin.  When using the
sparkler, a ball from another plane of existence suddenly appears, then
circles around you and destroys all monsters trying to get near you.  When
the sparkler is burned down, the ball vanishes.  When using two sparklers,
the ball is able to drift around to its heart's delight.

				21

	Now you have all knowledge collected by generations.  Make use of
it in order to defeat the dragon, thus putting an end to the threat of
eveil
