                              Typed In By -Spirit-

 S P E L L  B O U N D - Elves in Hell!
 
Typical! just when your master and tutor, Poinat The Wizzo Warlock, was
about to show you how to advance in magic, meet people and be
influenced by them he goes and gets himself kidnapped.It wouldn't be so
bad but he's the only one 'round here who knows where the cat is.And
there's no way anybody will take you seriously as a spell caster without a
familiar: no cat, no credibility! And no chance of becoming a Warlock!

And not just any moggy will do you know, it has to be black as night,
carefully nurtured (or is that neutered?) and fed on only the best rodent
tit bits laced with carefully created magic munchies.It'd take years to
train another puss.You'll have to find Poinat in order to find the cat.

Typical! Just as you were about to advance one grade beyond Pathetic
Mage as well.But there was nothing you could do; it all happened so
quickly:

In the cellar of Poinat's house you were working on a new brew to rid the
world of cold sores, occasionally assisted by your twin apprentice,
Cerorapp (he comes and goes but you hope he'll be around to help rescue
Poinat). Everything was going quite well, you were just about to ruin
your fourth attempt at the brew whe, from under the door, an eerie
green vapour slinked its way into the room.

Nobody noticed it - well, when you're creating magic all sorts of weird
things happen - until it solidified into Poinat's nefarious step brother,
Krookose. Before anybody could move, Krookose zapped Poinat with
some of his Medusa Magic so's he couldn't move. Then he shrunk him  
down, picked him up and they both disappeared in a puff of oily smoke.

Once the coughing stopped you did what you do best and scurried around 
the room in a mad panic. It was then that you noticed a small clump of 
earth on the floor. Closer study revealed it to be a mixture of mud and
savite, a combination found only beyond the Gateway To Hell. You now had
a good idea of where to search for Poinat, although the thought of going
to such a spooky place sent creepy shivers up and down your spine to 
such a degree that your hat refused to sit properly on your head and
kept falling down over your eyes. However, accepting that your magic
days were over without the cat ... and Poinat, you knew you had to find
one to find the other. And so armed only with what little magic you'd
already mastered - but hoping to learn along the way - you adjusted
your head gear and set off in search of your master.


 P L A Y I N G  S P E L L B O U N D

We recommend you play SPELLBOUND as a simultaneous two-players game.
You control Sortice - and his twin Cerorapp - in a desperate quest to
rescue Poinat. Using platforms and lifts, you battle through eight
magically different areas. Each elf using his magic powers to defeat
the many and varied adversaries who're determined to keep Poinat  
prisoner.

Remember, two elves are better than one ... And they make a great team!


                       LOCATIONS OF FRUSTRATION
                       ------------------------

FORBIDDEN MARSHLANDS:

 Swamps usually stink, and this one is no exception. Luckily, to make up
 for having to put up with the whiff,you'll find this land not too heavily
 guarded ... but watch out for the fish!
 

SUBTERRANEAN SLIME PITS OF DOOM:

 Again not too heavily guarded (lots of time to build up your manna) but
 bee-ware the bee-hive!
 
 
UNDERGROUND CASTLE OF CONFUSION:

 Not many folk venture down here: the light is not good and navigation is
 tricky. Then there's the constant threat of falling masonry.


DINGY DUNGEONS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION:

 Get lost here and you'll get lost forever. In fact any wrong turns from
now on could be costly. The mad axeman roams these parts ... so look sharp!


LAND OF THE GOBLIN KING:

 False trails abound as the mischievous goblins try to trick you at every
turn. And don't get caught by the rock piles!  


ISLAND OF LOST SOULS:

 Watch out for the one-way systems in this weird and wonderous land.
 Animated bodily parts should be avoided at all cost!


DOMAIN OF GHOSTLY GOINGS ON:

 The path is beginning to decay! But careful should see you through.
 And remember: if it floats, shoot it!


GATEWAY TO HELL:

 Nifty footwork and accessing the inaccessible are clues to success here.
 "Get thee behind me Satan!"...and if he refuses? Shoot him!

THE END:

 You'll never get here so there's no point in describing it!


                       YOUR OBJECTIVE:
                       ---------------

As you battle through each land you accumulate lifeforce, needed to 
survive the long journey - no lifeforce, no game - magical energy
(manna) to increase magic experience plus a number of sometimes-useful
objects.

 Six spells are available to you:

STONE CASTING - Stones thrown explode on contact with the ground, killing
nearby enemies.

ROCK CASTING - Fire a rock straight ahead, killing the first enemy it hits.

FIRE WALL - Creates a barrier of fire, most enemies cannot pass it.

WATER WALL - As Fire Wall but for use against fire-resistant enemies.

LEVITATION- Enables flight.

STARBURST - Throws out a burst of energy in multiple directions.

To use many of these spells (apart from Stone Casting, which is yours
forever) you need sufficient manna.Casting spells without sufficient manna
results in a malfunction: the spell may return to hit the caster, causing a
disorientating whirlwind or a bad luck sprite that reverses movements until
it's disposed of.All spell casting drains manna (see below for how to
increase manna).

Collectable objects are scattered throughout the lands. Some are just lying
on the ground while others are contained in locked chests - some chests are
best left alone!

The more useful objects include:

                   CRYSTAL - Disrupts energy fields
                      BOMB - Guess!
                    SCROLL - Increases manna
                    POTION - Increases lifeforce   
                    JETPAC - Not that useful!
                    
Each player may only carry one object at a time (*).Objects are picked up
by moving over them. The console area at the base of the screen displays
your inventory.

(*) There is a special case where a player may carry two objects.In
    two-player mode, should one player die, his object (if he had one)
    floats in the air for a short time and the surviving player can collect
    it. It explodes if not collected in time.

Lifeforce is lost on contact with enemies or explosions. In two-player mode
you can shoot each other ... so be careful! Lifeforce is also olst by
falling from great heights.
