LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

GAMEPLAY
--------
Each of the sub levels in the game has had several explosive devices
planted by the terrorists,and your task is to defuse and remove all of them
in each area before moving on to the next.
This task is made more difficult as each bomb has a timer attached thus
creating a time limit for the completion of each level.Send your faithful
ninja dog to attack the enemy and then whilst they are distracted you can
move in for the kill.
Use ninja magic to eliminate all enemies in sight but use sparingly,as even
a skilled ninja such as yourself has limited powers.
The controls are as follows....
