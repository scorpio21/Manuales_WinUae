				Skweek
	Scenario

 Once upon a time, on a faraway planet, lived the harmonious people of 
"Skweez". But one day, the vile Pitark with his hordes of Schnoreuls attacked
Skweez'Land. Quickly defeating the defensless skweezettes. As a last
humiliation, Pitark had Skweez 'Land contaminated with a blue Skweezticide,
forcing the Skweezettes to flee to the planet Refuznoid.
 
 Many years later, Pitark died and the Skweezettes decided it was time to
decntaminate the 99 continents of Skweez'Land returning them to their 
origional colour:Pink.

 Skweek volunteered to attempt this difficult mission;indeed, the Schnoreuls
are very aggressive and Skweez'Land is a strange and dangerous planet.

 If Skweek succeeds in restoring all of the continents, the Skweezettes will
return and Skwez"Land will become a free and prosperous planet once again.
