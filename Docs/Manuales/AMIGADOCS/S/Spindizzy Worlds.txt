SPINDIZZY WORLDS DOCS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE INTRODUCTION:

HANGING IN SPACE IS A CLUSTER OF WORLDS.AFTER YOUR PERFORMANCE IN MAPPING SPIN
DIZZY YOU ARE ASSIGNED THE JOB OF EXPLORING THE SPIN DIZZY WORLDS. WE DO NOT
KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT BUT YOU DO HAVE A REFURBISHED SECOND HAND
`GERALD`(GEOGRAPHICAL ENVIROMENTAL RECONNAISSANCE AND LAND MAPPING DEVICE)TO
EXPLORE WITH.THIS IS A MARK IV GERALD WITH ENHANCE POWER SUPPLY AND MOTORS.

GERALD WILL BEAM ONTO THE SURFACE OF EACH WORLD AND EXPLORE,GERALD HAS ONLY A
LIMITED SUPPLY OF LIQUID FUEL BUT CAN EXTRACT ENERGY FROM JEWELS FOUND ON THE
PLANETS. EVERY TIME A NEW AREA OF LAND IS EXPLORED SOME ENERGY MAY BE EXTRACTED
FROM IT ALSO,HOWEVER,THE MISSION ENDS IF THE FUEL RUNS OUT SO DONT HANG ABOUT.

GERALD USES FUEL CONTINUOUSLY,ALSO IF FOR ANY REASON `GERALD` IS DAMAGED FUEL
WILL BE DRAINED.IN EXTREME CASES`GERALD` MAY BE DESTROYED. A REPLACEMENT
`GERALD` WILL BE CREATED BUT THIS TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY. `GERALD` MAY BE
DESTROYED BY FALLING TO FAR.CONTACT WITH DANGEROUS OBJECTS OR ALIENS OR GERALD
MAY SIMPLY FALL OFF THE LAND SCAPE ENTIRELY!

IF `GERALD` DETECTS IMMINENT DANGER A COUNT-DOWN WILL APPEAR. AT ZERO YOU WILL
BE DESTROYED UNLESS `GERALD` CAN ESCAPE TO SAFETY.

YOU HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH A PROTOTYPE MECHANISM PROBE. IF YOU ARE NEAR
MECHANIVCAL DEVICES THIS MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE CLUES ABOUT WHAT WILL ACTIVATE THE
DEVICE. THIS HAS SHORT RANGE.

EACH WORLD CONTAINS UP TO 15 LEVELS. THE SCREEN WILL SHOW ABOUT 1/10 OF A
LEVEL.THE REST SCROLLS INTO VIEW AS YOU APPROACH THE SCREEN EDGES. YOU CAN MOVE
FROM LEVEL TO LEVEL BY MOVING INTO THE WARPS. OFTEN A WARP WILL ONLY APPEAR
AFTER ALL THE JEWELS ON THE LEVEL ARE COLLECTED OR AFTER A SWITCH IS USED.WATCH
THE CLUE AREA. A FLASHING JEWEL MEANS COLLECT THE JEWELS. THE OBJECTIVE ON
`ALL` LEVELS IS TO FIND THE EXIT. ALONG THE WAY OTHER TASKS MAY NEED TO BE
ACCOMPLISHED.
AT THE END OF EVERY WORLD IS A SPECIAL LEVEL PLAYED AGAINST TIME.
COLLECT JEWELS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. YOU CANNOT DIE ON THESE LEVELS. THE JEWELS
HELP FILL A RESERVE TANK FOR USE IF YOUR NEW NORMAL SUPPLY IS EXHAUSTED. THERE
MAY BE OTHER BONUS LEVELS HIDDEN IN EACH WORLD....

THE CONTROLS.

DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.PUSHING FORWARD ON THE JOYSTICK WILL MOVE `GERALD` UP AND
TO THE RIGHT ON THE SCREEN(NORTH ON THE MAP).YOU MAY FIND IT USEFUL AT FIRST TO
HOLD THE JOYSTICK AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE

GERALD HAS INERTIA SO THE LONGER YOU PUSH THE FASTER `GERALD` WILL MOVE.USE THE
FIRE BUTTON FOR EXTRA BOOST.WHILE GOING UP SLOPES YOU MAY NEED BOOST TO MAKE
PROGRESS. MOST SURFACES WILL SLOW GERALD DOWN BY FRICTION(SOME MORE THAN
OTHERS)YOU CAN SLOW OR STOP BY THRUSTING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO GERALDS
MOTION OR YOU MAY USE THE BRAKES TO STOP AT ONCE.THE SPACE BAR APPLIES THE
BRAKES.

GERALD MAY JUMP OFF RAMPS TO MAKE JUMPS,FALL(A SMALL DISTANCE)CLIMB SLOPES AND
GENERALLY FOLLOW THE NORMAL LAWS OF PHYSOCS,EXPERIMENT!

WHILE PLAYING YOU MAY FIND `GERALD` IS HIDDEN BEHIND SOME SCENERY.IT IS
POSSIBLE TO SELECT 4 DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS.USE THE KEYS `R` OR `T` TO ROTATE THE
VIEW.THE COMPASS WILL SHOW THE NEW NORTH.SOMETIMES ONLY ONE VIEWPOINT IS

LIVING AND DYING:

WILL NOT MATTER MUCH,IF HOWEVER,GERALD COMPLETELY RUNS OUT OF FUEL SEVERAL
OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE.

USE RESERVE FUEL;
----------------
THIS WILL APPEAR IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH RESERVE FUEL.ALL THE RESERVE WILL BE
USED.THE GAME WILL CONTINUE AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED BUT WITH NO RESERVE FUEL.

RETRY THIS WORLD;
----------------
START THIS WORLD AGAIN.EVERTHYTHING IS RESTORED TO THE STATE IT WAS IN WHEN YOU
FIRST STARTED THIS LEVEL.RESERVE FUEL IS UNTOUCHED.

ABANDON THIS WORLD;
-------------------
RETURN TO THE TITLE SEQUENCE.FROM THERE YOU CAN CONTINUE WITH A DIFFERENT WORLD
OR RESTART THE ENTIRE GAME.
IN GENERAL ANY WORLD CAN BE ATTEMPTED AS OFTEN AS LIKED.(IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE
TO COMPLETE WITH THE INTIAL FUEL HOWEVER!)

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION:
-----------------------

SPIN DIZZY WORLDS DOES NOT GIVE SCORES IN THE NORMAL SENSE.INSTEAD IT MAINTAINS
STATISTICS ON YOUR PERFORMANCE ON EACH WORLD,FUEL TANKS,JEWELS COLLECTED`OF`
JEWELS DISCOVERED ON THE WORLD,EG..WATERWORLD 85% 23 OF 25 JEWELS.
THE JEWELS DISCOVERED VALUE IS THE TOTAL NUMBER FOR ALL LEVELS YOU VISITED. THE
FUEL PERCENTAGE SHOWS THE AMOUNT WHEN YOU COMPLETED THE WORLD.

SWITCHES AND CLUES:
-------------------

SWITCHES COME IN SEVERAL VARIETIES. PUSH BUTTONS TURN ON WHEN RUN OVER. THEY
CAN BE SQUARE OR ROUND AND MINTERACT IN VARIOUS WAYS.HOW IS FOR YOU TO FIND
OUT(THE EASY GAME HAS AREAS TO DISCOVER THIS)
FLOOR SWITCHES ARE PAINTED ON THE GROUND. THEY BEHAVE LIKE PUSH BUTTONS.BINARY
SWITCHES HAVE TWO STATES,AND CAN ONLY BE SWITCHED ON BY MOVING OVER THEM IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE ARROW. THEY CAN BE SWITCHED OFF BY TRAVELLING IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION OF THE ARROW,THEY ARE INDEPENDANT OF EACH OTHER(AND OF PUSH BUTTONS)
CLUES ARE GIVEN IN THE CLUE BOXES,THE BINARY SWITCHES ARE SHOWN AS DIM OR
BRIGHT(FOR OF/ON) THE CLUE SHOWS THE SWITCH STATE THAT TURNS ON THE DEVICE. IF
A JEWEL IS SHOWN THIS MEANS COLLECT ALL THE JEWELS ON THIS LEVEL. CLUES APPEAR
NEAR WHERE SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN(NEAR LIFTS FOR EXAMPLE).

ALIENS;
------
ALL ALIENS ARE DANGEROUS SO AVOID THEM.NOISY ALIENS ARE MORE DANGEROUS.

BACKGROUNDS;
-----------
CERTAIN FEATURES IN THE SCENERY ARE LETHAL TO TOUCH,OTHERS HAVE SPECIAL
PROPERTIES.
ICE GLASS ARE BOTH SLIPPERY.TRAMPOLINES(WORK IT OUT FOR YOURSELVES)WATER
`GERALD` CANNOT DROWN..OR FLOAT!!!SO AVOID WATER.
WATCH THE TITLE SEQUENCE TO IDENTIFY HAZARDS.

LIFTS;
-----
LIFTS MAY BE NEED TO BE SWITCHED ON TO GET SAFELY FROM PLACE TO PLACE ON A
LEVEL.MOST LIFTS ARE OBVIOUS...LIFTS HAVE OTHER USES.....

GENERAL ADVICE;
--------------

LOOK AT THE MAP.IF A LEVEL STARTS WITH A TIMER THIS WILL PAUSE THE GAME AND
GIVE YOU BREATHING SPACE TO PLAN AHEAD.
THINK DEVIOUS.....

THERE ARE NO DELIBERATE ATTEMPTS TO BUILD `OPTICAL ILLUSIONS` INTO THE
SCENERY.WHEREVERE POSSIBLE WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT ITS REALLY THERE.

LEVELS HAVE BEEN TESTED THOROUGHLY TO MAKE SURE YOU CANNOT GET STUCK IN
IMPOSSIBLE SITUATIONS.IF YOU SEEM STUCK IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT YOU ARE NOT IN
FACT STUCK. I APOLIGISE FOR THE FEW PLACES I DID NOT SPOT(OR LEFT IN!)

LOOK AT THE CLUES.DO NOT ASSUME THEY MEAN WHAT YOU THINK THEY DO!

THINK MORE DEVIOUSLY!!!
BE PREPARED TO MAKE SACRIFICES....
LOOK IN UNUSAL PLACES.
THINK REALLY DEVIOUSLY!!!!!!!

THE END......
