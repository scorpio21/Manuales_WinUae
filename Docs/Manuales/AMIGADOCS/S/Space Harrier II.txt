PLAYING THE GAME
----------------

You assume the role of the Space Harrier in your quest to rid
the  Fantasy  Land of  the cruel tyranny  imposed by the Dark
Harrier.

To  succeed you must battle your way through twelve levels of
awesome  dangers.  Each  level  culminates  in  a  terrifying
guardian  which  must be overcome  in order to proceed to the
next round.

Once  all twelve levels have been completed you move onto the
final  conflict. In  this round,  you will  have to  meet all
twelve  guardians before  the ultimate  battle with  the Dark
Harrier.


OPTIONS
-------

You may start the game at any of the twelve levels.  When the
name  of the  round appears (the first is STUNA AREA) you may
advance through the levels by moving right. (moving left will
take you back)


BONUS ROUNDS
------------

During  the  course of the game  you may enter a bonus round,
these  occur  at  various  stages. Whilst  on  you  jet-board
destroy as much as possible in order to gain extra points and
lives.


CONTROLS
--------

The joystick is used to control your player on all versions.

In addition to the joystick option the Spectrum, Amstrad, MSX
and  C-64 will  have the option of using the Z,X,O and K keys
and  the  Space Bar to fire.  The ST and Amiga will allow the
use of the mouse.


NOTE:-
------

Using  the DIRECTION option from the menu page it is possible
to  reverse  the UP  and DOWN controls.  (This option is only
available if using the keyboard or joystick).
