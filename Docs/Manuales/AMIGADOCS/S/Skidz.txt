LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

Insert disk at workbench prompt - The game will load and run
automatically.


AIM OF THE GAME

Youre local town is the scruffiest for miles around, and its about
time it was cleaned up.  Armed with nothing more than your trusty bike
and skateboard, you set about collecting as much as possible as fast
as possible.  Unfortunately, the townsfolk dont share your enthusiasm,
and although they wont try to stop you, they do tend to get in the
way.  Then theres the holes in the road, the kerbs, the cones, the
ramps.....loads of obstacles stand between you and your goal, and
theyre not doing you or your equipment any good.  Theres money lying
around just waiting to be collected thought, and performing stunts
will also improve your bank balance.  Collect enough, and itll give
you the chance to visit the shop and upgrade your skateboard or bike,
or to carry out essential repairs.

You have just one life, and the game will end when you run out of
energy.  You will then be given the option to start a fresh game on
the level you ended the game on with the same amount of money and
energy as you began that level.

There are six progressively difficult areas to be cleaned up, starting
with the fairly straightforward street, and ending on the dangerous
and difficult boardwalk.  Prove that youre up to the challenge of
these mean streets, and youll get the chance to really test your skill
in the ultimate challenge, against two other ultra skillful opponents.
Theres nothing to collect or do, just race to be the first to cross
the finishing line.  This race has the biggest rewards up for grabs,
but the hazards and narrow mean track mean that its gonna require
split second timing, ultra accurate jumps and spins, and loads of
speed to finish top.  Are you ready to prove youve got the gutz for
SKIDZ????


BIKE/SKATEBOARD SELECTION

You choose the bike or skateboard on the title screen at the beginning
of each game, using left/right on the joystick.  Each has different
advantages - the bike is narrower and can move through areas that the
skateboard is too wide for and uses less energy, but the skateboard is
more manoeuverable and makes collecting objects much easier.

Once loaded, the options screen will be displayed.  Options are chosen
by moving the joystick left or right to highlight your required
choice, and pressing fire.  Each of the six levels must be completed
in order of difficulty, so the street level will be the only one
available at first.  In addition, the shop can be checked out, or you
can practice the race sequence against one other opponent.


JOYSTICK CONTROL

We have included two methods of control and the J key is used to
change from one to the other once the game has loaded.  The default
mode is the first.

Control System One
Pushing the FIRE BUTTON increases your speed by one point, and hold
down the F.B will maintain that speed.  So, to get a constant speed of
three points, push the F.B three times, holding it down on the third.
The player can turn in steps of 45 degrees by moving the joystick in
the required direction.  Moving the joystick in the opposite direction
to the one that you are travelling in will cause the bike/skateboard
to stop.

Control System Two
Moving the joystick in any direction increases your speed by one point
in that direction, and holding it in that position keeps the speed at
that value.  Acceleration is achieved by continually tapping the
joystick in a set direction.  Releasing the joystick completely will
decelerate the bike/skateboard slowly.  Whilst moving it in the
opposite direction to which you are travelling causes the
bike/skateboard to brake rapidly.  The player can turn in steps of 45
degrees by turning the joystick during normal motion.  A 90 degree
turn is possible by releasing the joystick and moving to a new
position.

Keyboard Controls
    M     - Toggle music on/off
    J     - Toggle between joystick modes one and two
    P     - Pause
SPACE BAR - Display status screen


ENERGY

Sixteen energy units are provided at the start of the game.  One
energy unit is lost when the player crashes, if he falls in the water,
or if a cigarette is collected.  Any energy left at the end of a level
is carried over to the next.  The entire game ends if the energy is
reduced to zero.


TIMER

The timer value begins at 350 at the start of each level, and
diminshes constantly during the game.  Additional time bonuses of 300
are added whenever a stopwatch is collected.  If the timer reaches
zero on any level, the spirit will attack you, draining all your
energy, giving you just a short time to find a stopwatch before you
run out of energy.  If a level is completed with time in hand, it will
be converted to a points bonus.


LITTER

Paper, bottles and cans are collected during each level, and should be
placed in the bins.  Up to ten pieces can be collected at once, which
are deposited in bins when the player touches or goes behind a bin.
The total percentage of litter collected will be displayed each time
litter is dropped into a dustbin, and a level cannot be completed
until at least 75% has been put in the bins.  Fifty points are awarded
for each item of litter deposited.


MONEY

Money, in the form of one, five, ten and twenty dollar bills, as well
as one dollar coins, can be collected from set positions on each
level.  Extra money will also appear after performing a succesful
trick/spin.  The money can be used in the shop before starting each
level.


HOPPING

Small obstacles, can be hopped over by pressing the FIRE BUTTON when
travelling at speed 4.  Hopping also allows the player to move up onto
the pavements without crashing into the kerb.  The hop will last
longer if a spin is performed at the same time, which makes it
possible to hop over wide obstacles and gaps.


TRICKS

A spin can be performed by pressing the FIRE BUTTON and turning
through 360 degrees before landing.  If the player is facing a
different direction on landing they will crash, otherwise money will
appear which can then be collected.  As you win money for the
performance of tricks, the money dotted around the level will begin to
disappear, saving you the trouble of going hunting for it.


RAMPS

Ramps can be jumped at speed 3 or 4 and will give 500 points each
time.  Tricks can also be performed by spinning around once or twice
before landing.


BONUSES

Bonus items can be collected during each level, giving one energy unit
as well as 50, 100 or 200 points depending on the bonus collected.
Different types of bonuses are found on each level:

Street        - Fruit
Park          - Burgers, Chocolate
Building Site - Tools
Chinatown     - Cakes, Ice-cream
Canal         - Fruit
Boardwalk     - Cakes, Ice-cream

Hidden bonuses are dotted around the levels, giving you extra points,
time or energy.


TASKS

There is a special task associated with each level.  The task item
must be collected and delivered to the correct destination further
down the level.  Bonus points are awarded on the successful completion
of each level.  The different items for each level are as follows :-

Street        - Parcel
Park          - Fish Food
Building Site - Newspaper
Chinatown     - Chopsticks
Canal         - Tub of Maggots
Boardwalk     - Bucket and Spade

Well leave you to discover their destinations.  10,000 points are
awarded when each task has been completed.


MUGGER

A mugger appears on the each level, running down the screen.  If the
player touches a mugger, he crashes and loses all his money.


DAMAGE

If the player rides over glass, splinters, nails etc. damage is caused
to the wheels of the bike or skateboard.  The players top speed is
then limited to speed 3 instead of 4.  Wheels return to normal if a
puncture outfit is collected from the level, or if the outfit or new
wheels are purchased from the shop after finishing the level.  Also,
wheels gradually wear down from one level to the next, making
acceleration slower each time.  Maximum acceleration is restored when
new wheels are purchased from the shop.


SHOP

The shop can be selected between levels, on the first selection
screen.  As you start the game with no cash it is not worth visiting
the shop until you have completed one of the levels.  When in the shop
move the joystick LEFT or RIGHT to highlight the required item(s).
The following items can be bought:-

ITEM                  PRICE    FUNCTION

RACE

The full race can only be selected after all the other levels have
been successfully completed.  The race is against two opponents, one
slow and one fast.  No bonuses, timer or energy loss function on the
race level.  As you cross the finishing line, a message will report
your finishing position, and if you win the race you will be presented
with a trophy at the end of the game.  100,000 points are awarded for
finishing third, 200,000 for second and 300,000 for first.
