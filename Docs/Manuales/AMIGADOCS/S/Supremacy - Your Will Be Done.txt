PAGE 2; WHAT IS SUPREMACY:

SUPREMACY IS A SINGLE PLAYER STRATEGY SIMULATION GAME THAT OFFERS YOU THE
CHANCE TO BATTLE FOR ECONOMIC AND MILITARY DOMINATION IN FOUR PLANET SYSTEMS.
AS A COMMANDER,YOU ARE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING RESOURCES,PURCHASING
EQUIPMENT,GOVERNING PEOPLE,OVERSEEING MINING AND FARMING OPERATIONS,DEVOLPING
MILITARY STRATEGIES,TRAINING TROOPS,PLANNING CAMPAIGNS AND DIRECTING BATTLES.

FOUR ALIEN COMMANDERS,ONE IN EACH PLANET SYSTEM,SEEK TO DESTROY YOU, YOUR
ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO CRUSH ALL FOUR OPPONENTS BY CONQUERING THEIR BASES,THEREBY
PROTECTING YOUR HOME UNIVERSE FROM THE THREAT OF INVASION.STRATEGIC SKILLS ARE
CALLED UPONFOR-BOTH AS COMMANDER-IN CHIEF AND AS A DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC
POLICIES.MORAL DECSIONS ALSO HAVE TO BE TAKEN;FOR INSTANCE ARE YOU PREPARED TO
STARVE YOUR PEOPLE TO DEATH,TAX THEM TOTALLY OUT OF POCKET AND SACRIFICE THEM
WITHOUT MERCY IN ORDER TO HOLD POWER? OR DO YOU SEE YOURSELF AS A BENEFACTOR
WHO CARES FOR THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF YOUR SUBJECTS?

MASTERING THE TASK:

SUPREMACY IS AN INVOLVED GAME-SUCCESS IS UNLIKELY TO COME WITHOUT PRACTISE AND
A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTROL METHODS.MAKE FULL USE OF THE SAVE GAME
FACILITY;THE MORE DIFFICULT PLANET SYSTEMS TAKE A LOT OF COMPLETING.AND ITS
WORTH SAVING YOUR POSITION REGULAARLY IN CASE THE ENEMY FORCES MAKE RAPID AND
SUDDEN GAINS.THE CHANCE TO GO BACK TO A POSITION AND TRY ANOTHER STRATEGY IS
THE ONLY ADVANTAGE YOU HAVE OVER LIFE IN THE REAL WORLD.USE IT WHILE YOU LEARN
THE SKILLS OF GALACTIC DOMINATION.

USING THIS GUIDE:

THIS DOCUMAENTATION CONTAINS ALL THE INFO YOU NEED TO MASTER SUPREMACY.READ THE
GAME OBJECTIVES(PAGE 5) AND USE THE QUICK GUIDE CARD TO GET GOING IF YOU DONT
LIKE FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND A MANUAL BEFORE STARTING PLAY,DIP INTO THE
GLOSSARY(PAGE 12)FOR MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CRAFT AND EQUIPMENT THAT
YOU WILL ENCOUNTER IN THE GAME,READ KNOW THINE ENEMIES(PAGE 7)FOR INFO ON YOUR
ALIEN FOES AND THEIR STYLES OF PLAY.THEN RETURN TO THE MANUAL WHEN YOU NEED
MORE DETAILED INFO.

IF YOU PREFER THE METHODICAL APPROACH,FOLLOW THE QUICK START TOUR(PAGE 19)-IT
GUIDES YOU STEP-BY-STEP THROUGH THE FIRST STAGES OF LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR
A STABLE EMPIRE IN THE HITOTSU PLANET SYSTEM.
-------------------------PAGES 3 AND 4  --------------------------------------

THE CONTROL SECTION WHICH BEGINS ON PAGE 48 OF THIS MANUAL,EXPLAINS IN DETAIL
HOW TO MANIPULATE THE CURSOR DRIVEN CONTROL SCREENS.THE MOISSION BACKGROUND
CHAPTER(PAGE 82)OFFERS ADVICE AND TIPS ON DEVOLPING A STRATEGY,THE MANAGING
RESOURCES SECTION(PAGE 87) WILL HELP YOU DEVOLP A SOUND ECONOMY,AND THE
SUPREMACY QUESTIONS ANSWERED(PAGE 91)WILL BE A USEFUL SOURCE OF HELP IF YOU
NEED TO DO SOME TROUBLE SHOOTING,FINALLY,THE INDEX WILL HELP YOU FIND SOME
INFO.

THE HISTORY OF EPSILON:

THE ONLY SURE WAY TO CONSILIDATE YOUR POSITION AS A DESPOT-AN ABSOLUTE RULER-IS
TO RULE ABSOLUTELY.YOUR FAMILY HAS SPENT GENERATIONS ENSURING THAT THE RULE OF
THE DYNASTY MARK IS UNASSAILABLE IN THE EPSILON GALAXY. A NEW THREAT TO THE
STABILITY OF YOUR RULE HAS RECENTLY ARISEN,REALITY IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS...

RESEARCH SCIENTISTS WORKING ON NEW INTER-PLANETARY DRIVE SYSTEMS FOR YOUR CRAFT
MADE A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF SPACE-WITH WORRYING
CONSEQUENCES.IN PURSUIT OF A HYPERDRIVE MECHANISM THAT WOULD ALLOW SHIPS TO
TAKE  DIMENSIONAL SHORTCUTS ON THE ROUTE FROM A-TO-B,SCIENTISTS DISCOVERED
ENTIRE NEW DIMENSIONS,FOUR NEW DIMENSIONS,IN FACT-HITOTSUFUTATSU,MITTSU AND
YOTTSU EACH CLOAKED IN A DIFFERENT REALITY AND CONTAINING 6,14,30 BARREN
PLANETS.FOUR NEW PLANET SYSTEMS.

A FEW EXPLORATORY FORAYS REVEALED THAT THESE PLANET SYSTEMS APPEARED TO BE
BUFFER ZONES THAT ACT AS AN UNHIBITED MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN YOUR UNIVERSE AND
ALIEN DIMENSIONS THAT LIE BEYOND THEM.EACH PLANET SYSTEM CAN BE ACCESSED
DIRECTLY FROM STARBASE,THE PLANET AT THE HEART OF EPSILON,YOUR SOLAR
SYSTEM-ACTIVATING THE HYPERDRIVE SYSTEM ON STARBASE AND SETTING THE APPROPRIATE
CO-ORDINATES CAUSED STARBASE TO APPEAR AT THE EDGE OF ONE OF THE BUFFER PLANET
SYSTEMS.
DURING AN EXPLORATORY FORAY INTO HITOTSU,THE 6 PLANET SYSTEM A SUDDEN CHANGE
WAS NOTICED-ANOTHER PLANET HAD MATERIALISED.RAPIDLY ACTIVATED SCANNING STYSTEMS
REVEALED THAT THERE WAS NOW EIGHT PLANETS IN THE SYSTEM STARBASE,THE 6 ARID
PLANETS THAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE,AND THE NEW ARRIVAL-WHICH SHOWED ALL THE
SIGNS OF HARBOURING SENTIENT LIFE.
JUMPING BACK THROUGH THE HYPERDRIVE PORTAL TO YOUR OWN REALITY TO CONSIDER THIS
NEW DEVOLPMENT,YOU DECIDED TO PAY A VISIT TO THE OTHER THREE UNIVERSES-AND
FOUND THAT THE PLANET IN EACH OF THEM HAD INCRESED BY ONE. IT LOOKED LIKE
SOMEONE ELSE FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE HAD JUST MADE THE SAME DISCOVERY AS YOU AND
WAS NOW ENTERING THE FOUR NEW PLANET SYSTEMS.
THEN YOU DECIDED TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE HITOTSU SYSTEM;CO-ORDINATES WERE
SET ON THE HYPERDRIVE PLANT,THE ACTIVATE SWITCH THROWN-AND THE TRANSITION WAS
MADE WITHOUT ANY ENERGY CONSUMPTION.STARBASE TRANSCENDED THE DIMENSIONAL
BARRIERS AND HAD BECOME A PERMANENT PART OF HITOTSU,A SYSTEM THAT NOW CONTAINED
8 PLANETS.
A WORRYING PROSPECT INDEED-THIS PERMANENT LINK BETWEEN HITOTSU AND EPSILON
OPENED YOU TO THE THREAT OF ATTACK.FEARING THE WORST YOU HURRIDLY SET THE
CO-ORDINATES FOR FUTATSU,MITTSU AND YOTTSU-AND DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE
PERMANENTLY LINKED TO YOU HOME UNIVERSE.
FOUR ALIEN DIMENSIONS ARE NOW LINKED TO EPSILON VIA FOUR PLANET SYSTEM.YOUR
ABSOLUTE RULE MIGHT SOON BE UNDER THREAT FROM FOUR ALIEN CIVILISATIONS THAT
COULD USE THE BARREN PLANETS IN EACH OF THE NEW SYSTEMS TO STOCKPILE ARMS AND
EQUIPMENT BEFORE MOUNTING A DEVASTING ATTACK ON EPSILON THROUGH THE PERMANTLY
OPEN PORTAL THAT STARBASE HAS NOW BECOME.A WORRYING PROSPECT INDEED-BUT WHAT
CAN BE DONE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF YOUR HARD WON EMPIRE?
VAPOURISING STARBASE MIGHT END THE LINK-BUT IT IS TOO IMPORTANT A RESOURCE IN
THE EPSILON SYSTEM TO CAST OFF CASUALLY.AND THERE IS NO CERTAINTY THAT
DESTROYING STARBASE WOULD PREVENT THE ALIENS INVADING EPSILON.BESIDES,
ABANDONING STARBASE WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF WEAKNESS,IF NOT DEFEAT,AND YOUR
PEOPLE MIGHT SEE SUCH AN ACTION AS A SIGN YOU HAVE LOST YOUR CAPACITY FOR
ABSOLUTE RULE. A REVOLUTION MIGHT BE SPARKED OFF BY SUCH A DRASTIC ACTION-AND
THAT REVOLUTION WOULD TAKE PLACE SHORTLY SFTER YOU HAD DESTROYED YOUR PRIME
DEFENSIVE RESOURCE.
NO,THERE IS ONLY ONE COURSE OF ACTION-TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE AND DO UNTO THE
FOUR ALIEN CIVILISATIONS WHAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY DO UNTO YOU,ONLY DO IT
FIRST,AND DO IT QUICKLY.
WHILE APPROPRIATE MILITARY PREPARATIONS WERE PUT UNDERWAY,DIPLOMATIC TEAMS WERE
DESPATCHED TO THE ALIEN PLANETS HITOTSU,FUTATSU,MITTSU AND YOTTSU.BASIC
NON-AGGRESSION PACTS WERE AGREED, A FEW SPIES LEFT BEGHIND(ONCE THE CONCEPT OF
AMBASSADOR AND DIPLOMATIC MISSION HAD BEEN EXPLAINED TO THE ALIENS)AND AN
UNEASY PEACE INITIATED.WELL,AT LEAST THE TREATIES HAVE BROUGHT YOU SOME
TIME,TIME THAT CAN BE USED TO GET READY.
ARMAMENT MANUFACTURING PLANTS ARE WORKING FLAT OUT PRODUCING CRAFT AND
EQUIPMENT.YOU HAVE EXAMINED ALL THE OPTIONS.NOW ITS TIME TO GO ON THE
OFFENSIVE.....
-------------------------------PAGES 5 AND 6-----------------------------------

THE GAME OBJECTIVES:

YOU ARE THE COMMANDER AND SUPREME LEADER OF EPSILON,A UNIVERSE LOCATED AT THE
VERY EDGE OF SPACE.SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INTO A NEW DIMENSION-BUSTING HYPERDRIVE
HAS A RATHER UNFORTUNATE SIDE-EFFECT..YOUR STARBASE IS NOW PERMANENTLY LINKED
TO AND PART OF FOUR BARREN PLANET SYSTEMS,HITOTSU,FUTATSU,MITTSU AND
YOTTSU.EACH OF THE FOUR PLANET SYSTEMS ACTS AS A BUFFER ZONE AND IS LINKED TO
ONE OF THE FOUR NEW DIMENSIONS THAT ARE POPULATED BY ALIEN CIVILISATIONS.
CLEARLY THIS SITUATION INTRODUCES AN UNWELCOME INSTABILITY INTO YOUR LIFE AS
COMMANDER OF EPSILON.AND NEW DIMENSIONS WHICH,WITHOUT DOUBT,HARBOUR ALIEN RACES
JUST AS EAGER TO CONQUER YOUR HOME SYSTEM,EPSILON.
YOUR INVESTIGATIONS HAVE ESTABLISHED FOUR ALIEN RACES,LIKE YOUR OWN PEOPLE,ARE
ORGANISED UNDER A DICTORIAL SYSTEM OF GOVERMENT.YOR OPPONENTS,WOTOK,SMINE,KRART
AND RORN HAVE ESTABLISHED BASES IN THE BUFFER PLANET SYSTEMS WHICH ARE NOW KNOW
AS HITOTSU,FUTATSU,MITTSU AND YOTTSU RESPECTIVELY.
YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO BECOME SUPREMEM RULER OF THE FOUR PLANET SYSTEMS,ONLY WHEN
ALL FOUR SYSTEMS ARE TOTALLY UNDER YOUR CONTROL CAN YOU FEEL SAFE FROM THE
THREAT OF ALIEN ATTACK.
AND ONCE YOU HAVE CONTROL OF THE PLANET SYSTEM,YOU CAMN CONCENTRATE ON AMASSING
TROOPS AND RESOURCES THERE,READY FOR AN INVASION OF THE ALIEN DIMENSION THAT
LIES BEYOND...BUT SUCH PLANS ARE OF THE FUTURE,AND ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF
SUPREMACY 1.THE FIRST PRIORITY IS SECURING THE SAFETY OF EPSILON.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:

SUPREMACY OFFERS FOUR CAMPAIGNS:THE BATTLES FOR CONTROL OF HITOTSU,FUTATSU,
MITTSU AND YOTTSU.VICTORY IN EACH CAMPAIGN IS YOUR IF YOU GAIN CONTROL OF THE
ALIEN BASE LOCATED AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE PLANET SYSTEM TO
STARBASE;CONVERSELY,VICTORY FALLS TO THE ALIEN COMMANDER IF HE CAN WREST
STARBASE FROM YOUR GRASP.
THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT SET ON A CAMPAIGN-THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES UNTIL YOU QUIT
THE MISSION OR ONE SIDE WINS.ONCE A CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN STARTED YOU CANNOT
INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM ELSEWHERE,BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TOSHIP CRAFT
AND MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM EPSILON TO HELP YOUR WAR EFFORT.NATURALLY,SUCH
EQUIPMENT HAS TO BE PAID FOR,AND IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE INTER-DIMENSIONAL
EQUILIBRIUM,APPROPRIATE RESOURCES MAY ALSO HAVE TO BE SHIPPED BACK TO EPSILON
IN EXCHANGE FOR EQUIPMENT.
FOOD,FUEL,ENERGY,CREDITS,MINERALS AND PEOPLE ARE PRESENT ON STARBASE WHEN A
CAMPAIGN BEGINS AND ARE THE ECONOMIC RESOURCES THAT NEED TO BE MANAGED WITH
CARE IF YOU ARE TO SUCCEED.NEUTRAL PLANETS CAN BE COLONISED AND ENEMY PLANETS
MAY BE CONQUERED.REMEMBER,WHEN A PLANET IS UNDER YOUR CONTROL,YOU CAN EXTRACT
RESOURCES THAT ARE USEFUL TO THE WAR EFFORT.

CHOOSING A PLANET SYSTEM:

THE FOUR MISSIONS CAN BE ATTEMPTD IN ANY ORDER YOU CHOOSE,AND AN INDIVIDUAL
MISSION CAN BE ATTEMPTED AS MANY TIMES AS YOU LIKE(ALTHOUGH THE START
CONDITIONS VARY SLIGHTLY EACH TIME).
HITOTSU CONTAINS 8 PLANETS AND YOU ARE UP AGAINST A FAIRLY INEPT ALIEN
COMMANDER.FUTATSU CONTAINS 16 PLANETS AND YOU COMPETE AGAINST AN ALIEN LIFE
FORM THAT IS RATHER MORE EXPERIENCED AT GOVERMENT AND THE STRATEGIES OF
WAR.MITTSU CONTAINS 32 PLANETS AND YOU FIGHT A HIGHLY EXPERIENCED OPPONENT WHO
IS WELL VERSED IN THE SKILLS OF GOVERMENT AND MILITARY STRATEGY.
OBVIOUSLY THE MORE PLANETS THERE ARE IN A SYSTEM,THE MORE COMPLEX THE TASK OF
MANAGING RESOURCES AND DEPLOYING YOUR MILITARY FORCES BECOMES.
THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE IS PRESENTED BY YOTTSU,ANOTHER 32 PLANET SYSTEM.THE
CREATURE YOU CHALLENGE THERE IS REMARKABLY SOPHISTICATED AT THE ARTS OF WAR AND
GOVERMENT-YOU WILL FIND HIM IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERTHROW UNLESS YOU HAVE TRAINED
YOURSELF THOROUGHLY IN THE OTHER ARENAS FIRST.
WHEN YOU FIRST ENTER A PLANET SYSTEM A PLANET SYSTEM,STARBASE IS A FUNCTIONAL
COLONY-BUT THE RESOURCES YOU FIND ON STARBASE ARE LIMITED,AND YOU DO NOT HAVE
AN ARMY.YOUR OPPONENT HOWEVER,HAS BEEN BUSY,ANTICIPATING THE START OF
HOSTILITIES.YOUR FIRST OBJECTIVE MUST BE TO ACCESS THE TASK THAT LIES
AHEAD.THEN YOU HAVE TO DEVOLP YOUR OWN STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS.
THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO DEVELOP YOUR SKILLS AS A PLAYER OF SUPREMACY IS IN
THIS MANUAL.ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE CONTROL SYSTEM,SERIOUS PLAY CAN BEGIN.

----------------------------PAGE 7--------------------------------------------

KNOW THINE ENEMY:

AFTER THE INTRODUCTORY SEQUENCE TO SUPREMACY,YOU ARE PRESENTED WITH A SCREEN
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CHOOSE YOUR OPPONENT.YOUR INTELLIGENCE SOURCES HAVE MANAGED
TO PIECE TOGETHER SOME BASIC BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS OF THE FOUR ALIEN DICTATORS
WHO AWAIT YOU IN THE PLANET SYSTEMS OF HITOTSU,FUTATSU,MITTSU AND YOTTSU,AND AT
A GREAT PERSONAL RISK,YOUR SPIES HAVE MANAGED TO CAPTURE A LIKENESS OF YOUR
OPPONENTS.
VERY LITTLE DETAIL,HOWEVER,IS AVAILABLE ON THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE
FOUR-RORN.YOU WOULD BE WISE TO LEARN HOW TO GET THE BETTER OF WOTOK,SMINE AND
KRART BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO CHALLENGE---RORN---.

-----------------------------PAGE 8-------------------------------------------

WOTOK:

LEADER OF THE STRANGE MONKEY LIKE RACE,WOTOK LOOKS LIKE A GREEN GORILLA AND
BEHAVES RATHER LIKE A STUPID AND ANGRY CHILD.BLESSED WITH VERY LITTLE IN THE
WAY OF INTELLIGENCE,WOTOK APPARENTLY BECAME LEADER OF HIS RACE AS A RESULT OF
HIS IMMENSE PHYSICAL STRENGTH.HE HAS A FAINT UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES OF
GOVERMENT,AND IS TO STUPID TO RETAIN AND USE ADVISERS,WHOM HE SEES AS POTENTIAL
RIVALS.WOTOK HAS NO TIME FOR DIPLOMATS OR SPIES WHOM HE VIEWS WITH
MACHIAVELLIAN SCHEMERS,PERMANANTLY UP TO NO GOOD.
WOTOKS PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO WIN EVERY FIGHT HE HAS EVER
HAD,WHICH IS WHY HE HAS RISEN TO THE TOP OF THE PILE IN HIS SIMIAN
UNIVERSE,WHERE PERSONAL COMBAT SKILLS ARE HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM.PERSONAL
DISPUTES,LIKE THE COMPETITION FOR LEADERSHIP,ARE RESOLVED BY RITUAL ONE TO ONE
COMBAT IN WOTOK`S WORLD-A SOCIAL SYSTEM THAT HAS RATHER SKEWED THE EFFECTS OF
EVOLUTION TOWARDS PHYSICAL RATHER THAN MENTAL PROWESS.
WOTOK HAS COME TO BELIEVE THAT HE IS A SUPERB STRATEGIST AND ONE OF THE BEST
MILITARY COMMANDERS IN THE HISTORY OF CREATION.AND NO-ONE IN HIS HOME UNIVERSE
IS GOING TO ADVISE HIM OTHERWISE.FORTUNATELY FOR YOU HE IS WRONG.
THE CHALLENGE WOTOK PRESENTS IS NOT GREAT,HIS ATTACK STRATEGIES ARE
SIMPLISTIC-BECAUSE OF HIS AVERSION TO TAKING ADVICE,HE WONT LISTEN TO SPIES.SO
HE DOES`NT TARGET YOUR RESOURCE RICH COLONIES BUT INVADES AT RANDOM.
AND HIS LACK OF BRAIN POWER MEANS THAT IT TAKES HIM A WHILE TO COME TO THE
MEDIOCRE DECISIONS THAT HE MAKES.TAKE YOUR TIME WHEN YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR THE
HITOTSU SYSTEM-USE IT AS A TRAINING GROUND IN WHICH TO DEVELOP THE SKILLS YOU
WILL NEED FOR THE MORE PROFICIENT OPPONENTS THAT AWAIT YOU.....

--------------------------PAGE 9----------------------------------------------

SMINE:

IN THE FUTATSU SYSTEM YOU MEET A VERY STRANGE GROUP OF CREATURES INDEED,UNDER
THE COMMAND OF A VERY STRANGE LEADER,IN THE EVOLUTIONARY RACE SMINES PEOPLE
BECAME THE DOMINANT SPECIES IN THEIR UNIVERSE BY DEVELOPING A POWERFUL
TELEPATHIC CAPABILITY,TO COMPENSATE FOR THIER LACK OF PHYSICAL
STRENGTH.THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO SMINES FOREFATHERS FOUND THEY COMMUNICATE WITH
ONE ANOTHER ACROSS GREAT DISTANCES BY USING THIER TELEPATHIC TENDRILS.
OVER THE MILLENNIA,THIS TELEPATHICSKILL WAS DEVELOPED TO THE STAGE WHERE SMINES
SPECIES ACHIEVED A MELTA-LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS-RATHER THAN BEING A RACE OF
INDIVIDUAL CREATURES,THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY ONE COMPLEX ORGANISM.
SMINE DOES NOT USE SPIES-HE DOESNT NEED TO,AFTER ALL,HE IS AT THE FOCAL POINT
OF A VAST ORGANIC NEURAL NETWORK,AND TO FIND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING
ELSEWHERE,ALL THE SMINE HAS TO DO IS SEND ONE OF HIS SUBJECTS THERE AND THEN
ESTABLISH A TELEPATHIC CONTACT.
WHILE THIS EVOLUTIONARY QUIRK COULD HAVE SET SMINES PEOPLE ON A COURSE FOR A
GALACTIC DOMINATION,SO FAR THEY HAVE FAILED TO REALISE THE POTENTIAL.SMINE IS
SMART,BUT NOT THAT SMART.AND HE IS CONTINUALLY DISTRACTED BY THE TELEPATHIC
TRAFFIC,FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO FOCUS HIS CONCENTRATION.
SMINE USES A SPLATTER TECHNIQUE FOR ATTACK,FORMING TELEPATHIC LINKS WITH HIS
PLATOONS AND USING THEM FOR INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING AS WELL AS FOR COMBAT. THE
DILATION OF PURPOSE,COMBINED WITH SMINES CEREBRAL RATHER THAN PHYSICAL
NATURE,MEANS HE IS NOT DIFFICULT TO BEAT.VICTORY CAN BE YOURS,PROVIDING YOU
KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU,ESTABLISH A STRONG GARRISON ON IMPORTANT COLONIES AND
BUILD UP STRENGTH WHILE SMINE RUSHES AROUND THE FUTATSU SYSTEM.

---------------------------PAGE10-------------------------------------------

KRART:

KRARTS REPTILLIAN PEOPLE BECAME THE DOMINANT SPECIES IN THEIR UNIVERSE BY A
COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND RAW CUNNING WHICH THEY EVOLVED OUT OF
NECESSITY-SHORTLY AFTER LEARNING TO WALK.KRARTS DISTANT ANCESTORS HAD TO FIND A
WAY OF PROTECTING THEIR EGGS FROM HUNGRY MEMBERS OF OTHER SPECIES.
BY DEVELOPING A SOCIAL SYSTEM THAT REVOLVED ROUND SHARED TASKS AND THE
DELEGATION OF DUTIES,KRARTS FOREFATHERS FOLLOWED A PATH THAT PARALLES THE ONE
TRODDEN BY THE HUMAN RACE AS IT SCRABBLED TO DOMINANCE ON THE PLANET EARTH.
KRART COMES FROM A CULTURE WHICH ENCOURAGES INDIVIDUALS TO SPECIALISE IN TASKS
FOR WHICH THEY ARE BEST SUITED.MORE THAN HAPPY TO SURROUND HIMSELF WITH
SPECIALIST ADVISERS,KRART BECAM LEADER OF HIS PEOPLE FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON:HE
IS AN INDIVIDUAL BEST QUALIFIED TO LEAD THEM.
UNLIKE SMINE OR WOTOK,WHO ARE OBSESSED WITH RACIAL PURITY AND THE DOMINANCE OF
THEIR OWN SPECIES,KRART IS PREPARED TO USE AND REWARD ANY CREATURE WHO CAN HELP
HIM FURTHER HIS AIMS.HIS EMPIRE HOLDS SWAY OVER NON-REPLTILLIAN SPECIES,MEMBERS
OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AFFAIRS.
KRART APPLIES THE SKILLS OF HIS INDIVIDUALS TO BEST EFFECT;HIS SOLDIERS ARE THE
BEST FIGHTERS;KRARTS SPIES ALL HAVE NATURAL TALENT FOR COVERT OPERATIONS;AND
HIS MILITARY,ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC ADVISERS ARE THE BEST IN HIS UNIVERSE.
KRART APPLIES HIS INTELLIGENCE AND PHYSICAL MIGHT TO GOOD EFFECT,AND HIS
READINESS TO ACCEPT GOOD ADVICE AND ACT UPON GOOD INTELLIGENCE MEANS THAT HE IS
A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT. HE ATTACKS SELECTIVELY,TARGETING THE PLANETS THAT ARE
MOST USEFUL TO YOU BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST USEFUL TO HIM SHOULD HE CONQUER
THEM.THE BATTLE FOR THE MITTSU SYSTEM WILL NOT BE EASEY.

---------------------------PAGE 11-------------------------------------------

RORN:

LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT RORN,HIS PEOPLE OR THE HISTORY OF HIS UNIVERSE-PARTLY
BECAUSE OF HIS UNCANNY ABILITY TO ROOT OUT AND EXECUTE SPIES,AND PARTLY BECUASE
HIS ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS HIDDEN BEHIND WHAT IS,IN EFFECT,AN IMMENSLY POWERFUL
CLOAKING DEVICE.
A FEW SPIES MANAGED TO PENETRATE RORNS BASE IN THE YOTTSU SYSTEM,AND THE
SKETCHY REPORTS THEY MANAGED TO FILE IN THE HOURS BEFORE THEY WERE DISCOVERED
INDICATE THAT RORN IS AN AWESOME BEING,`BEING`,RATHER THAN CREATURE,FOR IT IS
NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR WETHER RORN SHOULD BE DESCRIBED AS `MORTAL` IN THE SENSE OF
THE WORD-THERE ARE STRONG INDICATIONS THAT HE IS SOME KIND OF TRANS-DIMENSIONAL
BEING,WHAT THE ANCIENTS MIGHT HAVE CALLED `A GOD`.
RORN APPEARS TO HAVE FEW OF THE QUALITIES NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SENTIENT
LIFE FORMS THAT HAVE PROGRESSED UP THE EVOLUTIONARY LADDER,RATHER,HE WOULD
APPEAR TO BE THE PERSONIFICATION OF AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT:EVIL.
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT RORN IS THE MOST POWERFUL ENTITY YET ENCOUNTERED-HE
HAS ACHIEVED VIRTUAL PERFECTION IN BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT,AND HIS
PEOPLE ARE CAST IN THE SAME MOULD,FOR RORN,DOMINATION IS A NATURAL
PROGRESSION-A MATTER OF TIME RATHER THAN A MATTER OF CHANCE OR SKILL.HIS RISE
TO POWER HAS BEEN UNSTOPPABLE,AND HE ALREADY HOLDS SWAY OVER MANY PLANET
SYSTEMS,HIS MILITARY STRENGTH IS IMMENSE,AND HIS SENSE OF STRATEGY PUTS ALL
KNOWN THEORISTS FIRMLY IN THE SHADE.KRART IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BEAT,BUT A BABE
IN ARMS COMPARED TO RORN.
IF YOU CAN WIN CONTROL OF THE YOTTSU SYSTEM,THEN YOU HAVE TRULY MASTERED HE ART
OF SUPREMACY....

----------------------------PAGE 12------------------------------------------

CRAFT: CARGO CRUISER.

THIS IS THE CRAFT YOU SHOULD USE WHEN YOU SET UP A TRUCKING OPERATION TO MOVE
RESOURCES AROUND A PLANET SYSTEM.IT CAN CARRY A PAYLOAD OF 2250 TONS AND 1850
CIVILIANS.IT HAS A LONG RANGE-ITS FUEL TANKS CAN HOLD 1250 TONS OF FUEL.
IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT,A GOOD TACTIC IS TO BUY A CARGO CRUISER AND USE IT AS THE
BACKUP SHIP FOR THE ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR.FILL THE CARGO CRUISER WITH PEOPLE AND
RESOURCES AND SEND IT TO THE PLANET THAT THE ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR IS
FORMATTING-AS SOON AS A COLONY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED,LAND THE CARGO
CRUISER,UNLOAD EVERYTHING AND THEN SCRAP IT TO RECLAIM SOME RESOURCES.YOUVE
JUST PROVIDED YOUR NEW COLONY WITH AN INSTANT STARTER PACK.

SOLAR SATELLITE GENERATOR:

AN AUTOMATIC NUCLEAR-POWERED DEVICE THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE A CREW OR FUEL.IN THE
MITTSU AND YOTTSU SYSTEMS,ENERGY IS REQUIRED AS A PART PAYMENT FOR PURCHASES
MADE ON THE BUY SCREENS.IT IS WORTH BUYING SEVERAL SOLAR SATELLITES EARLY IN
THE GAME AND LAUNCHING THEM INTO ORBIT AROUND STARBASE SO THAT YOU CAN BE SURE
OF FUNDING PURCHASES.MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LAST ONE SOLAR SATELLITE IN ORBIT
AROUND EACH PLANET YOU HAVE PLACED A MINING STATION OR HORTICULTURAL STATION.
THE YEILD FROM A SOLAR SATELLITE IS GREATLY INCREASED IF IT IS PLACED IN ORBIT
AROUND A DESERT PLANET.
-----------------------------PAGE 13------------------------------------------

BATTLE CRUISER:
YOU NEED BATTLE CRUISERS TO MOVE YOUR PLATOONS FROM PLANET TO PLANET-AND YOU
ARE LIKELY TO NEED QUITE A FEW AS THE GAMNE PROGRESSES,BECAUSE EACH BATTLE
CRUISER CAN ONLY TRANSPORT 4 PLATOONS AT A TIME.
A BATTLE CRUISER CAN ONLY BE USED TO CARRY A SMALL QUANTITY OF CARGO-600
TONS,BY REMEMBERING TO LOAD CARGO FOR A TRIP YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE TO DELIVER
PLATOONS,OR BY STOPPING OFF TO LOAD CARGO ON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO PICK UP
FRESH PLATOONS FROM STARBASE,YOU CAN SOMETIMES SAVE YOURSELF A TRIP WITH A
CARGO CRUISER.
UP TO 4500 PASSENGERS CAN BE CARRIED ON A BATTLE CRUISER,IN ADDITION TO
PLATOONS AND CARGO WHICH MAKES IT THE IDEAL CRAFT FOR MOVING PEOPLE AROUND.DONT
FORGET THAT YOU CAN ALSO USE CRAFT TO PUT PEOPLE IN CRYOGENIC STORAGE IN TIMES
OF ECONOMIC CRISIS,OR TO SHIP PEOPLE OFF ONE OF YOUR PLANETS THAT IS ABOUT TO
BE CONQUERED BY THE ENEMY.

ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR:

A VERY EXPENSIVE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT-ITS PRICE REFLECTS ITS SOPHISTIICATION.AN
AUTOMATIC,NUCLEAR-POWERED DEVICE,THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE A CREW OR FUEL,THE
ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR TURNS LIFELESS,UNFORMATTED PLANETS INTO SEED COLONIES.
ONCE ALL THE PLANETS IN A SYSTEM HAVE BEEN FORMATTED,REMEMBER TO SCRAP YOUR
ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR AND RECLAIM SOME OF THE RESOURCES YOU PAID FOR IT,AND DONT
LEAVE IT LYING ON THE SURFACE OF A PLANET-IF THE ENEMY CAPTURES THAT PLANET,HE
WILL SCRAP YOUR ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR AND YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY DEARLY FOR ANOTHER
ONE.
---------------------------PAGE 14--------------------------------------------

MINING STATION:

CAPABLE OF MINING MINERALS AND FUEL FROM THE CORE OF A PLANET,THIS REFINES THE
PRODUCTS OF EXCAVATION AND DELIVERS FUEL AND MINERALS INTO THE RESERVES OF THE
HOST COLONY.IT DRAWS ENERGY FROM THE COLONY`S RESERVES IN ORDER TO OPERATE.
A CREW OF 294 PEOPLE IS NEEDED FOR A MINING STATION.WITH A FUEL CAPACITY OF 750
TONS AND A PAYLOAD OF 950 TONS,IT CAN TRAVEL BETWEEN PLANETS AND CAN TRANSPORT
RESOURCES ON THE JOURNEY;THERE IS NO PASSENGER ACCOMADATION.
MINING STATIONS WORK COMPARITIVELY SLOWLY,SO IT IS WORTH ESTABLISHING AT LEAST
ONE ON  STARBASE AS SOON AS YOU CAN,THEN LOOK FOR A VOLCANIC PLANET ON WHICH TO
STATION FURTHER MINING UNITS-YEILD IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IF MINING
OPERATIONS ARE UNDERTAKEN ON VOLCANIC PLANETS.

HORTICULTURAL STATION:

USES HYDROPONIC AND CELL-CULTURES TO PRODUCE SUPPLIES OF FOOD FOR YOUR
PEOPLE,DRAWING ENERGY FROM THE COLONY`S RESERVES TO DO SO,YEILD IS MUCH
IMPROVED IF YOU LOCATE A HORTICULTURAL STATION ON THE SURFACE OF A TROPICAL
PLANET-FLORA AND FAUNA ARE USED TO INCREASE THE RATE OF PRODUCTION.
A CREW OF 175 PEOPLE IS REQUIRED TO OPERATE A HORTICULTURAL STATION,WHICH HAS A
CARGO PAYLOAD OS 950 TONS AND A FUEL CAPACITY OF 750 TONS. A FARMING ATATION
HAS TO TRAVEL BETWEEN PLANETS UNDER ITS OWN POWER,CARRYING RESOURCES AS CARGO
BUT NO PASSENGERS.
HORTICULTURAL STATIONS PRODUCE THE PRIME RESOURCE IN A PLANET SYSTM-WITHOUT
FOOD,LIFE CANNOT BE SUSTAINED SO IT IS WORTH AQUIRING SEVERAL HORTICULTURAL
STATIONS AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

MILITARY EQUIPMENT:

THREE WEAPON SYSTEMS AND FOUR GRADES OF BODY ARMOUR ARE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE
ON THE PLATOON MANAGEMENT SCREEN,WHILE THE TEMPTATION IS USUALLY TO GIVE YOUR
TROOPS THE VERY BEST EQUIPMENT WHEN YOU COMMISSION THEM INTO A PLATOON,THIS IS
NOT ALWAYS EXPEDIENT-YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE CASH TO HAND,OR YOU MAY HAVE TO
COMMISSION LESS PLATOONS THAN YOU WOULD LIKE TO IF YOU CHOOSE THE MOST
EXPENSIVE IT.
THE CHOOSE OF THE WEAPON SYSTEM AND BODY ARMOUR CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT
ON THE PERFORMANCE OF A PLATOON,AND UNLESS YOU ARE AWASH WITH CREDITS,YOU
SHOULD EXPERIMENT WITH OPTIONS TO DISCOVER THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OF
EQUIPPING YOUR MEN.

ARMOUR:

THE MOST BASIC SUIT-LITTLE MORE THAN YOUR TROOPER WAS BORN WITH! FOR A MERE 20
CREDITS PER MAN,THIS IS THE LEAST PROTECTIVE GARB THAT CAN BE PURCHASED.LOSSES
IN COMBAT ARE LIKELY TO BE QUITE HEAVY.

---------------------------PAGE 16--------------------------------------------

CARBON FIBRE ARMOUR: AFFORDS A REASONABLE DEGREE OF PROTECTION AGAINST LOW 
POWER WEAPONS AND CHEMICAL ATTACK.AND GIVES YOUR TROOPERS A SERIOUS ADVANTAGE
IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT,BUT DOES LITTLE TO REDUCE THE DEBILITATING EFFECTS OF
NUCLEAR FALL OUT.COST:100 CREDITS PER MAN.

SYNTHALLOY ARMOUR: GIVES COMPLETE PROTECTION AGAINST LOW-POWER WEAPONS,CHEMICAL
ATTACK AND NUCLEAR FALLOUT AND PROVIDES A REASONABLE DEFENCE AGAINST FIRE FROM
PLASMA AND LASER WEAPONS,RENDERS THE WEARER ALMOST INVINCIBLE IN HAND-TO-HAND
COMBAT. COST:200 CREDITS PER MAN.

---------------------------PAGE 17---------------------------------------------

PERSONAL FORCE FIELD: THE BEST PROTECTION THAT MONEY CAN BUY OR TECHNOLOGY CAN
PROVIDE.WHEN NEW,THIS SUIT MAKES THE WEARER IMPERVIOUS TO ALL FORMS OF
ATTACK,APART FROM LOCALKISED(OR DIRECT)NUCLEAR STRIKES.BATTLE CONDITIONS TEND
TO DEGRADE THIS SUIT HOWEVER,AND AFETR A WHILE ITS PROTECTIVE CAPACITY WILL
EQUAL THAT OF A SYNTHALLOY SUIT.

WEAPONS SYSTEM: RECOIL CANNON-THE GENERAL INFANTRYMAN`S WEAPON,EMPLOYS
SIMPLISTIC TECHNOLOGY TO HURL A SOLID PROJECTYLE WITH A REASONABLE DEGREE OF
ACCUARACY IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT IS POINTED.BASIC EQUIPMENT FOR A BASIC
PRICE:50 CREDITS A MAN.

---------------------------PAGE 18--------------------------------------------

SELF LOADING GAS CANNON: A MULTI-PURPOSE INFANTRY WEAPON THAT CAN BE USED AS A
RAPID-FIRE PLASMA CANNON,A HIGHLY ACCURATE SNIPERS RIFLE AND A GRENADE
LAUNCHER.CAPABLE OF ADAPTING ITSELF TO A WIDE RANGE OF AMMUNITION TYPES-SO
CAPTURED ENEMY MUNITIONS CAN BE RE-CYCLED. COST:120 CREDITS PER MAN.

NUCLEAR MORTAR: THE MOST POWERFUL INFANTRY ARMAMENT IN THE PLANET SYSTEM.CAN
HURL A VARIETY OF LARGE PROJECTYLES-FROM NUCLEAR GRENADES,THROUGH HIGH
EXPLOSIVE SHELLS TO ROCKS AND SCRAP METAL SHRAPNEL IF AMMO IS RUNNING LOW.CAN
BE USED AS A HAND-HELD OR TRADITIONAL MORTAR,AND DOES REQUIRE EXPLOSEIVE
PROPELLANT. COST:250 CREDITS PER MAN.

THE QUICK START TOUR:

IF YOU PLAN TO FOLLOW THIS TOUR AROUND SUPREMACYS CONTROL SYSTEM,MAKE SURE YOU
CHALLENGED WOTOK AFTER THE START-UP-SEQUENCE.
DURING PLAY YOU`LL NOTICE THAT THE TEN MAIN CONTROL ICONS THAT APPEAR ON THE
MAIN SCREEN ARE ALSO DOTTED AROUND ON THE OTHER CONTROL SCREENS IN SUPREMACY.
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS EXAMPLE GAME SEQUENCE,WE`LL RETURN TO THE MAIN SCREEN
BY CLICKING THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON,AND THEN ACCESS THE CONTROL ICONS,RATHER
THAN USE SHORT CUTS.THAT WAY,YOU`LL REGULARLY GET THE CHANCE TO CHECK INCOMING
MESSAGES(WITH PRACTISE,YOU`LL SOON TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE MORE DIRECT ROUTES
AROUND SUPREMACY)
WHILE YOUR DOING THINGS ON OTHER SCREENS,YOU`LL NOTICE THE `INCOMING
MESSAGE`FLASH THAT APPEARS EVERY SO OFTEN.ITS WORTH RETURNING TO THE MAIN
SCREEN PERIODICALLY TO CHECK MESSAGES-PROGRESS REPORTS ARE PROVIDED,AND RANDOM
EVENTS ARE ANNOUNCED THAT SOMETIMES DEMAND YOU TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION IN
RSPONSE.

---------------------------PAGE 20--------------------------------------------

ESTABLISHING A GOOD SOUND ECONOMY ON STARBASE:

ITS FIRST A GOOD IDEA TO BEGIN A GAME BY CONSOLIDATING YOUR POSITION ON
STARBASE.FIRST,LETS REVIEW THE POSITION YOU INHERITED AT THE START OF THE NEW
GAME.

CLICK ON THE GOVERMENT SCREEN ICON TO CALL UP THE GOVERMENT SCREEN.IF YOU
HAVENT MEDDLED WITH ANY CONTROLS SINCE THE STARTING THE NEW HITOTSU SYSTEM
GAME,STARBASE WILL BE THE CURRENT PLANET.

DETAILED DATA ON STARBASE IS NOW PRESENTED-READOUTS SHOW THE CURRENT STOCKS OF
FOOD,MINERALS AND FUEL AND THE LEVELS AND CREDITS THAT YOU HAVE IN RESERVE.THE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON STARBASE,THEIR MORALE AND THE CURRENT RATE OF POPULATION
GROWTH ARE ALSO SHOWN,ALONG WITH TAX RATE CURRENTLY IN FORCE.IF THE `SELECT A
PLANET` MESSAGE IS SHOWING,CLICK ON STARBASE`S NAME IN THE CENTRAL GRID TO MAKE
IT THE CURRENT PLANET.
THE TAX RATE CAN BE ADJUSTED BY CLICKING ON THE ARROWS NEXT TO THE
READOUT-ALTERING TAX RATE AFFECTS THE POPULATIONS MORALE AND RATE OF GROWTH AS
WELL AS HOW RAPIDLY YOU CAN RAISE MONEY FROM THE PEOPLE BY TAXATION. THE MORE
PEOPLE YOU HAVE ON A PLANET,THE MORE FOOD THEY CONSUME PER DAY,AND AT THE
MOMENT YOUR STOCKS ON STARBASE ARE FINITE-SO THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO BUY
YOURSELF A LITTLE TIME AND RAISE SOME EXTRA CASH INTO THE BARGAIN.SLOW DOWN THE
RATE OF POPULATION GROWTH BY RAISING THE TAX RATE BETWEEN 30% AND 40%.

--------------------------PAGE 21---------------------------------------------

RESOURCES:

CREDITS ARE NEEDED TO BUT WAPONS AND EQUIPMENT FOR YOUR SOLDIERS AND TO PAY FOR
CRAFT IMPORTED FROM YOUR HOME UNIVERSE,ALL SUCH TRANSACTIONS DEPLETE THE
TREASURY ON STARBASE,BUT FUNDS CAN BE MOVED FROM OTHER PLANETS UNDER YOUR
CONTROL TO THE COFFERS OF STARBASE BY CLICKING ON THE MOVE CASH ICON LOCATED
TOWARDS THE TOP LEFT OF THE GOVERMENT SCREEN(UNDER THE RENAME ICON)CREDITS ARE
RAISED BY TAXING PEOPLE.
FUEL IS CONSUMED BY MOST CRAFT AS THEY TRAVEL BETWEEN PLANETS,AND HAS TO BE
PUMPED INTO THEIR TANKS ON THE CARGO BAY SCREEN,FUEL IS CREATED BY MINING
STATIONS.
ENERGY IS CONSUMED BY MINING STATIONS AND HORTICULTURAL STATIONS WHEN THEY ARE
OPERATIONAL,AND MAY HAVE TO BE USED AS POART OF YOUR PAYMENT FOR CRAFT SOURCED
FROM YOUR HOME UNIVERSE,ENERGY IS CREATED BY SOLAR SATELLITE GENERATORS.
MINERALS MAY HAVE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO EPSILON AS PART OF YOUR PAYMENT FOR
CRAFT,MINERALS ARE CREATED BY MINING STATIONS.
PEOPLE ARE VERY USEFUL-YOU CAN RISE MONEY  BY TAXING THEM,USE THEM TO CREW
CRAFT,AND YOU CAN FIGHT WARS BY DRAFTING THEM INTO YOUR ARMY.PROVIDING THEIR
MORALE IS HIGH ENOUGH,POPLE WILL MULTIPLY NATURALLY AS A RESULT OF THE FORCES
OF NATURE-TAX THEM TO HIGH OR STARVE THEM,AND THEY WONT BREED!!

A POPULATION ON THE SURFACE OF A PLANET HAS TO EAT TO SURVIVE,AS THE SAYING
GOES:WHILE FOOD GROWS ON TREES...TREES ONLY GROW IN A HORTICULTURAL STATION....

------------------------PAGE 22-----------------------------------------------

SETTING UP A HORTICULTURAL STATION:

BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ON STARBASE ARE CONSUMING FOOD,THEY WILL EVENTUALLY STARVE
UNLESS YOU SET UP A HORTICULTURAL STATION TO REPLENISH FOOD STOCKS.

CLICK ON THE BUY ICON TO CALL UP A CATALOGUE OF ITEMS YOU CAN BUY,FLIP THROUGH
THE PAGES OF THE ON-SCREEN CATALOGUE BY CLICKING ON THE LEFT OR RIGHT ARROWS
UNTIL YOU FIND THE HORTICULTURAL STATION.
WHEN THE ITEM YOU WANT IS ON SCREEN,CLICKING ON `BUY`MAKES THE
PURCHASE,PROVIDING YOU CAN AFFIRD IT.
EVERYTHING COSTS MONEY,DEPENDING ON WHICH OF THE FOUR SYSTEMS YOU HAVE SET OUT
TO CONQUER,YOU MAY ALSO NEED TO HAVE ENERGY,OR SUFFICIENT ENERGY AND MINERALS
TO MAKE A PURCHASE.THE INFO PANEL THAT APPEARS AS PART OF EACH PAGE IN THE
CATALOGUE SHOWS THE PRICE IN CREDITS AND THE QUANTITY OF RESOURCES REQUIRED TO
MAKE A PURCHASE,AS WELL AS THE FUNDS AND RESOURCES YOU HAVE AVAILABLE.
YOU CAN ONLY BUY THINGS ON STARBASE,AND CAN ONLY PAY WITH CRDITS,ENERGY OR
MINERALS THAT ARE IN THE STORES ON STARBASE.
BUY A HORTICULTURAL STATION,THIS WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO CHANGE ITS
NAME FROM THE -DEFAULT- `FARMING 1`TO CONFIRM THE PURCHASE AND USE THE DEFAULT
NAME(AT THIS STAGE PRESSING `ESC` ABORTS PURCHASE)NOTICE HOW YOUR NEW
HORTICULTURAL STATION HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO A DOCKING BAY ON STARBASE,NOW

THE TOP LEFT SHOW WHAT,IF ANYTHING,IS CURRENTLY IN THE THREE DOCKING BAYS ON
STARBASE,FARMING 1 SHOULD BE THE ONLY CRAFT IN A DOCKING BAY ON STARBASE,AND AS
SUCH,IS AUTOMATICALLY SELECTED AS THE `CURRENT SHIP`WHEN YOU ACCESS THE CARGO
BAY SCREEN.IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE DOCKING BAY OCCUPIED,BEFORE STARTING CARGO
OPERATIONS YOU NEED TO SELECT A SHIP AS THE CURRENT SHIP BY CLICKING IN ITS
NAME.
YOU`LL NOTICE THAT A PICTURE OF FARMING 1 APPEARS IN A WINDOW TO THE MIDDLE
LEFT OF THE SCREEN,AND THE RELEVANT DATA APPEARS IN THE SUMMARY WINDOWS AT THE
TOP CENTRE,YOU`RE NOW IN A POSITION TO CREW FARMING 1,FUEL IT AND LOAD CARGO IF
YOU WANT TO.
WE ARE GOING TO USE FARMING 1 TO PRODUCE FOOD FOR THE PEOPLE HERE ON
STARBASE-WHICH IS THE ONLY PALANET YOU CONTROL AT PRESENT.THERES NO NEED TO
FILL FARMING 1`S FUEL TANKS OR LOAD CARGO AS ITS NOT GOING TO BE SENT
OFF-PLANET.TURN THE PAGE TO FIND OUT HOW TO COMMISSION FARMING 1...

POPULATION OF STARBASE(SHOWN IN THE CIVILIANS WINDOW IN THE DATABANK) DECREASES
BY 175-THIS IS THE NUMBER OF CREW REQUIRED TO CREW A HORTICULTURAL
STATION.SHIPS CAN ONLY BE CREWED BY PEOPLE FROM STARBASE;YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO CREW AND USE A NEW CRAFT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE ON STARBASE TO DO
SO.SIMILARLY,IF A CRAFT IS TO BE MOVED OFF STARBASE AND SENT ON A JOURNEY TO
ONE OF YOUR COLONIES,FUEL WILL NEED TO BE LOADED AS YOU WILL SEE LATER ON IN
THIS TOUR.

A HORTICULTURAL STATION HAS TO BE ON THE SURFACE OF A PLANET BEFORE IT CAN
START CREATING FOOD FOR YOUR PEOPLE,SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO MOVE YOUR NEW
ACQUISITION OUT ONTO THE PLANETS SURFACE ABD GET IT WORKING...PRESS RIGHT MOUSE

IN THE FOOD STORE DISPLAY IS CHANGING-IT INCREASES AS YOUR NEW HORTI-STATION
DELIVERS A BATCH OF FOOD INTO STORE:AND DECREASES AS THE PEOPLE REMOVE THEIR
DAYS RATIONS FROM THE STOCKPILE.
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT YOUR POPULATION IS`NT GOING TO STARVE TO DEATH,YOU NEED
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE`NT EATING MORE FOOD PER DAYTHAT IS BEING
PRODUCED-A LONG TERM STRATEGY MAY INVOLVE COMMISSIONING EXTRA HORTI-STATIONS OR
LIMITING THE RATE AT WHICH THE POPULATION GROWS(TO COPE WITH FOOD DEFECIT IN
THE SHORT TERM,FOOD CAN BE SHIPPED IN FROM OTHER PLANTS UNDER YOUR CONTROL)
ALTERNATIVELY,THE NUMBER OF MOUTHS TO FEED CAN BE REDUCED BY DRAFTING PEOPLE
INTO THE ARMY OR PUTTING THEM INTO A CRYOGENIC STORAGE AS PASSENGERS ON BOARD A
SHIP).

ENERGY,FUEL AND MINERALS:

ENERGY LEVELS,LIKE STOCKS OF FUEL AND MINERALS,ALSO NEED TO BE MAINTAINED.
ENERGY IS CONSUMED BY DEVICES SUCH AS HORTI-STATIONS WHEN THEY ARE WORKING ON
THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET,AND FUEL IS NEEDED FOR TRAVEL BETWEEN PLANETS IN THE
SYSTEM.DEPENDING ON WHICH OF THE GAMES YOU PLAY,ENERGY AND OR MINERALS MAY BE
NEEDED TO COMPLETE PURCHASES ON THE BUY SCREEN.
FUEL AND MINERALS CAN BE EXTRACTED,SO THATS THE NEXT THING TO DO.THE PROCEDURE

BOOSTING ENERGY RESERVES:

ENERGY RESERVES ON A PLANET CAN BE BOOSTED BY SETTING UP A SOLAR SATELLITE
GENERATOR,AN AUTOMATIC DEVICE THAT BEAMS DOWN ENERGY ONCE IT HAS BEEN
ESTABLISHED IN ORBIT AROUND THE PLANET. SO LETS GET READY FOR FUTURE DEMANDS ON
ENERGY RESERVES AND PUT A SATELLITE INTO ORBIT AROUND STARBASE.

GO TO THE BUY SCREEN,FLIP THROUGH THE PAGES OF THE CATALOGUE,FIND THE SOLAR SAT
GENERATOR AND BUY ONE,SOLAR 1 AS IT WILL BE CALLED,DOESNT NEED A CREW OR
FUEL-SO THERE`S NO NEED TO VISIT THE CARGO BAY SCREEN,BUT A SOLAR SAT GEN DOES
NEED TO BE LAUNCHED INTO ORBIT AROUND STARBASE,BEFORE IT BECOMES OPERATIONAL,SO
YOU NEED TO ACCESS THE NAVIGATION SCREEN.CLICK RMB FOR MAIN SCREEN,THEN TURN

REVIEWING THE POSITION:

RETURN TO THE GOVERMENT SCREEN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS STILL GOING WELL WITH
YOUR COLONY ON STARBASE.TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO SIT BACK AND STUDY THE READOUTS
IN FRONT OF YOU.NOTICE HOW THE MORALE OF YOUR PEOPLE IS RISING,ALONG WITH THE
RATE OF POPULATION GROWTH.PEOPLE  PROSPER WHEN TAXES ARE LOW AND FOOD IS
PLENTIFUL.
WATCH THE GENTLE UPWARD CLIMB OF THE METERS THAT RECORD THE LEVEL OF STORED
ENERGY AND STOCKS OF FOOD,FUEL AND MINERALS.NOTICE HOW THE FUEL AND MINERALS
METERS MOVE STEADILY UP,WHILE THE FOOD DISPLAY INCREASES WITH THE ARRIVAL OF A
CONSIGNMENT OF FOOD FROM YOUR HORTI-STATION AND THEN DECREASES A LITTLE AS YOUR
PEOPLE REMOVE THEIR RATIONS FROM THE STORES.
INVESTING IN ALL THAT EQUIPMET IS CERTAINLY PAYING OFF....

HAVING UNDERPINNED THE ECONOMY OF STARBASE BY ENSURING THAT ENERGY,FOOD,FUEL
AND MINERALS ARE ALL BEING CREATED AND ADDED TO RESERVES,THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO
GIVE YOUR PEOPLE A BREAK FROM HEAVY TAXES AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO BREED.REDUCE
THE TAX TO 10% BY CLICKING ON THE DOWN ARROW NEXT TO THE DISPLAY THAT REVEALS
THE CURRENT TAXATION RATE.
LETS BUY ANOTHER SOLAR SATELLITE GENERATOR AND LAUNCH IT INTO ORBIT ABOVE

ENLISTING AN ARMY:

WHEN YOU FIRST ENTER A PLANET SYSTEM,YOU DONT HAVE AN ARMY-BUT YOU DO HAVE THE
CAPACITY TO DRAFT UP TO 24 PLATOONS,WHICH CAN EACH CONTAIN 200 TROOPS,DRAFTED
FROM THE CIVILIAN POPULATION ON STARBASE.
SOLDIERS CAN BE USED DEFENSIVELY AS WELL AS OFFENSIVELY AND ITS A GOOD IDEA TO
ESTABLISH A GARRISON ON STARBASE EARLY IN THE GAME.WE`LL RECRUIT FOUR PLATOONS
WITH THE INTENSION OF MOVING TWO TO THE NEW COLONY AND LEAVING TWO ON STARBASE
AS A GARRISON.

NOW CLICK ON THE PLATOON MANAGMENT ICON TO CALL UP THE PLATOON
MANAGEMENTSCREEN,THERE ARE THREE WINDOWS AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN-THE ONE ON
THE LEFT SHOWS THE IDENTIFYING NUMBER OF THE CURRENT PLATOON,THE ONE IN THE
MIDDLE LABELLED `TROOPS` SHOWS HOW MANY SOLDIERS ARE CURRENTLY IN THAT
PLATOON,AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SHOWS THE CURRENT CIVIALIAN POPULATION ON
STARBASE.`1ST` IS NOW SHOWING IN THE PLATOON IDENTITY WINDOW AT THE LEFT.CLICK
ON THE UP ARROW NEXT TO THE TROOPS WINDOW-IT IS CURRENTLY DISPLAYING `0` HOLD
THE MOUSE BUTTON DOWN AND RELEASE IT WHEN THE NUMBER IN THIS DRAFTING WINDOW
REACHES 200.
YOU`LL NOTICE THAT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION HAS DECREASED BY 200.SOLDIERS CANNOT
BE TAXED-SO THE REVENUE FROM THE STARBASE POPULATION PER UNIT OF TIME WILL
DECREASE UNTIL THE POPULATION IS REPLENISHED BY THE FORCES OF NATURE. ON THE
PLUS SIDE,SOLDIERS DO NOT CONSUME FOOD FROM YOUR STORES,SO DRAFTING CIVILIANS
TAKES THE PRESSURE OFF FOOD RESERVES.

-------------------------------PAGE 35----------------------------------------

THE MOMENT YOU DRAFT CIVILIANS INTO A PLATOON,THE GREEN SOLDIER AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE RIGHT SCREEN STARTS RUNNING-THIS INDICATES THAT THE ROOKIES ARE UNDER
GOING TRAINING. THE PERCENTAGE FIGURE AT THE FEET OF THIS RUNNING SOLDIER
REVEALS HOW WELL TRAINED THE RECRUITS ARE,AND INDICATES THE RANK OF THEIR
COMMANDING OFFICER.THE FIGHTING ABILITIES OF A PLATOON ARE INCREASED IN
PROPORTION TO THE LEVEL OF TRAINING THE MEN RECIEVE BEFORE BEING COMMISSIONED.
CLICK ONCE ON THE UP ARROW NEXT TO THE WINDOW THAT IS SHOWING `1ST`TO SELECT
THE `2ND` PLATOON,THEN ASSIGN MEN FROM THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY CLICKING AND
HOLDING THE UP ARROW NEXT TO THE DRAFTING WINDOW UNTIL IT DISPLAYS `200`.THE
2ND PLATOON IS NOW IN TRAINING.
REPEAT THE PROCESS FOR THE 3RD AND 4TH PLATOONS,THEN CLICK THE RMB TO LEAVE
YOUR RECRUITS IN TRAINING AND RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU.

COLONISING OTHER PLANETS:

WHEN YOU ENTER A PLANET SYSTEM FOR THE FIRST TIME,ONLY TWO OF THE PLANETS CAN
SUPPORT SENTINENT LIFE;YOUR BASE AND THE ENEMY`S BASE AT THE OTHER OF THE
SYSTEM.ALL OTHER PLANETS ARE COMPLETELY BARREN-IF YOU MOVE THE PLANET CURSOR
UP AND DOWN THE SYSTEM MAPBY CLICKING ON THE UP/DOWN ARROWS TO THE RIGHT OF THE
CIRCULAR DISPLAY,YOU`LL NOTICE THAT THE PLANETS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SYSTEM
APPEAR LIFELESS,GREY WORLDS IN THE VIDEO WINDOW.(THE DOUBLE HEADED ARROW ALLOWS
YOU TO SLIDE THE CURSOR UP AND DOWN THE SYSTEM MAP-SEE PAGE 50)
IN ORDER TO EXPAND YOUR TERRITORY YOU NEED TO BUY AN ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR AND
DESPATCH IT TO ONE OF THE UNFORMATTED PLANETS. AFTER A WHILE THE ATMOSPHERE
PROCESSOR WILL RENDER A PLANET HABITABLE AND A SEED COLONY WILL AUTOMATICALLY
BE ESTABLISHED.YOUR NEW COLONY WILL START OUT WITH A FEW PEOPLE AND WILL HAVE
SOME RESOURCES IN ITS STORES.

BUYING AN ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR:

BY NOW YOU SHOULD HAVE THE MESSAGE THAT THE ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR IS AVAILABLE
FOR PURCHASE-UNTIL THE MESSAGE COMES IN,YOU WONT BE ABLE TO BUY ONE,SO YOU
MIGHT AS WELL RETURN TO THE GOVERMENT SCREEN FOR A WHILE AND REVIEW THE
SITUATION IN THE HITOTSU SYSTEM.

CLICK ON THE BUY ICON TO CALL UP THE CATALOGUE OF ITEMS YOU CAN BUY.FLIP
THROUGH TO FIND THE ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR,THEN CLICK ON `BUY` TO MAKE THE
PURCHASE,IF YOU CAN`T AFFORD IT,YOU MAY HAVE TO RETURN TO THE GOVERMENT SCREEN
AND RAMP UP THE TAX RATE FOR A WHILE TO RAISE FUNDS QUICKLY.

----------------------------PAGE 37------------------------------------------

THE ATMOSHERE PROCESSOR IS AN AUTOMATIC PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT IS DELIVERED TO
A DOCKING BAY ON STARBASE.IT CAN BE LAUNCHED IMMEDIATELY,SO LETS DO THAT
NEXT.UNLIKE ALL OTHER CRAFT THE ATMOS PROC IS CONTROLLED WITH ITS OWN ICON ON
THE MAIN SCREEN.
LETS START THE COLONISIATION PROGRAMME WITH THE PLANET NEAREST TO
STARBASE;CLICK ONCE ON THE UP ARROW THAT IS TO THE RIGHT OF THE SYSTEM MAP TO
MOVE THE PLANET CURSOR ONTO THE FIRST PLANET UP FROM THE STARBASE.THE VIDEO
WINDOW NOW SHOWS A BARREN PLANETSCAPE,AND `LIFELESS` APPEARS IN THE DISPLAY AT

CLICK ON THE PLANET FORMATTER ICON,AND THE MESSAGE WINDOW GIVES A READOUT ON
HOW LONG THE ATMOS PROC WILL TAKE TO DO ITS JOB.CLICK THE RMB OR PRESS `ENTER`
TO COMFIRM THE DEFAULT NAME,`PLANET 1` WHEN IT ARRIVES,THE ATMOS PROC BEGINS
WORK IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT FURTHER INTERVENTION ON YOUR PART.STAY ON THE MAIN
SCREEN AND WATCH THE VIDEO WINDOW.AFTER A WHILE YOU`LL NOTICE THAT WAVES OF
FIRE START SWEEPING ACROSS THE BARREN PLANETSCAPE,AND IF YOU LOOK IN THE SYSTEM
MAP YOU`LL NOTICE THAT THE DOT THAT REPRESENTS `PLANET 1` HAS TURNED WHITE TO
INDICATE THAT IT IS BEING FORMATTED.DONT WAIT AROUND FOR THE ATMOS PROC TO
FINISH ITS TASK-THERE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO.

COMMISSIONING SOLDIERS:

SUPREMACY IS PLAYED IN REAL TIME-WHILE YOU ARE BUSY ATTENDING TO ONE ASPECT OF
MANAGING YOUR CAMPAIGN,LIFE CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE PLANET SYSTEM.WHILE YOU
ARE BUYING AND DISPATCHING THE ATMOS PROC,YOUR TROOPS WERE HARD AT IT IN
MILITARY ACADEMY ON STARBASE.BY NOW,THE RAW RECRUITS SHOULD BE WELL ON THEIR
WAY TO BEING PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS.

CLICK ON THE PLATOON MANAGMENT ICON-ITS TIME TO EQUIP AND COMMISSION THE
TRAINEES.TWO LARGE PORTRAIT SCREENS TO THE LEFT OF THE PLATOON MANAGEMENT
SCREEN SHOW THE BODY ARMOUR AND WEAPON TYPE THAT ARE CURRENTLY
SELECTED-CLICKING ON THE LEFT/RIGHT ARROWS BELOW THESE WINDOWS CLYCLES THROUGH
THE OPTIONS.THE BETTER THE EQUIPMENT THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS-AND THE MORE MEN
YOU HAVE IN A PLATOON THE BIGGER THE TOTAL EQUIPMENT BILL WILL BE.YOU`LL NOTICE
THAT THE TOTAL COST OF EQUIPPING THE CURRENT PLATOON WITH THE CURRENT ARMOUR IS
SHOWN IN THE WINDOW ABOVE THE RUNNING MAN.
IN A REAL WAR,STRATEGIC DECISIONS HAVE TO BE TAKEN ABOUT HOW MANY MEN YOU WANT
IN A PLATOON,HOW MUCH TRAINING YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE BEFORE THEY ARE MOVED INTO
THE ARMY,AND HOW MUCH YOU CAN AFFORD WHEN IT COMES TO EQUIPPING THEM.A PLATOON
OF 200 MEN CAN COST BETWEEN 20,000 AND 109,000 CREDITS TO EQUIP WITH SUITS AND

DEFAULT NAME WILL BE `FARMING 5`.
YOU CAN ONLY RUN ONE ATMOS PROC AT A TIME-YOU CAN ONLY BUY ANOTHER ONE IF THE
ENEMY CAPTURES YOUR FIRST UNIT.
DURING THE COURSE OF PLAY,TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES WILL BE MADE BY YOUR 
SCIENTISTS AND NATURAL DISASTERS WILL OCCUR IN THE SYSTEM.BOTH CAN AFFECT THE
OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES OF THE CRAFT IN YOUR FLEET,OR AFFECT THE
SPECIFICATIONS OF CRAFT THAT WILL BE SHIPPED FROM EPSILON NEXT TIME YOU MAKE
APURCHASE.

WHAT DOES WHAT....:

THE ATNMOSPHERE PROCESSOR(ATMOS PROC) IS A TRULY SOPHIISTICATED PIECE OF
TECHNOLOGY,IT REQUIRES NO CREW,AND RUNS ON NUCLEAR ENERGY WHICH IT GENERATES
ITSELF.IF YOU SEND IT TO A NEUTRAL,UNFORMATTED PLANET THAT IS INCAPABLE OF
SUPPORTING LIFE,THE ATMOS PROC CAN CREATE POPULATION-FRIENDLY CONDITIONS ON THE
PLANET SURFACE.A NEWLY FORMATTED PLANET WILL ALSO BE SEEDED WITH A QUANTITY OF
FOOD,MINERALS,FUEL,ENERGY AND PEOPLE AS WELL AS THE BASIC INSTALLATIONS SUCH AS
DOCKING BAYS NEEDED TO RUN A COLONY,FOR MORE DETAILS,SEE THE PLANET FORMATTING
DESCRIPTION ON PAGE 66.

--------------------------------PAGE 62---------------------------------------

A :SOLAR SATELLITE GENERATOR(SOL SAT GEN):, LIKE THE ATMOS PROC,IS NUCLEAR
POWERED AND RUNS AUTOMATICALLY.WHEN IT IS ORBITTING A PLANET IT GENERATES
ENERGY WHICH IS BEAMED DOWN TO THE PLANET SURFACE AND PLACED IN STORAGE.

A :BATTLE CRUISER: CAN ONLY CARRY LIMITED AMOUNTS OF CARGO AND A LARGE NUMBER
OF CIVIALIAN PASSENGERS,BUT ITS PRIME PURPOSE IS MOVING PLATOONS.UP TO FOUR
PLATOONS CAN BE ACCOMADATED IN ITS ON-BOARD BARRACKS.AT THE START OF A
GAME,BATTLE CRUISERS REQUIRE FUEL TO TRAVEL BETWEEN PLANETS.

A :HORTICULTURAL STATION(HORTI-STAT):,LIKE A :MINING STATION:HAS TO BE CREWED,
PLACED ON THE SURFACE OF A PLANET AND ACTIVATED BEFORE IT SERVES ITS PURPOSE.AS
MIGHT BE EXPECTED,AN OPERATIONAL HORTI-STAT CREATES FOOD WHICH IS PASSED INTO
THE HOSTS PLANETS STORES,WHILE A MINING STATION CREATES MINERALS AND FUEL.THESE
RESOURCE-GENERATING UNITS CAN TRAVEL BETWEEN PLANETS,PROVIDING YOU SUPPLY THEM
WITH FUEL,AND THEY CAN CARRY SMALL AMOUNTS OF CARGO ON THE JOURNEY.

A :CARGO CRUISER: IS WELL SUITED TO DEEP SPACE OPERATIONS,IT REQUIRES A CREW
AND FUEL TO BECOME OPERATIONAL,AND CAN LUG LARGE QUANTITIES OF
PEOPLE,FUEL,ENERGY MINERALS AND FOOD BETWEEN PLANETS.AT THE START OF THE
GAME,CARGO CRUISERS REQUIRE FUEL TO TRAVEL BETWEEN PLANETS.

FURTHER DETAILS ON THE ATTRIBUTES AND USES OF EACH OF THE SIX CRAFT APPEAR IN
THE GLOSSARY ON PAGE 12.

ORBIT AND TRAVEL TO ANOTHER PLANET ASSUMING ORBIT ON TRAVEL;LAND FROM ORBIT AND
ENTER A VACANT DOCKING BAY;OR TERMINATE SPACE TRAVEL IMMEDIATELY AND BEGIN
ORBITTING THE NEAREST PLANET.

AT THE TOP LEFT,YOU ARE SHOWN THE NAME OF THE CURRENT PLANET AND THE NAMES OF
ANY CRAFT THAT ARE IN THE THREE DOCKING BAYS ON THE PLANET.TO LAUNCH A SHIP
FROM THE DOCKING BAY,CLICK ON ITS NAME TO ALERT THE CAPTAIN.
THE NAMES OF ALL THE CRAFT IN YOUR FLEET APPEAR IN THE 32 CELL GRID AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.TO ISSUE A COMMAND TO THE CAPTAIN OF ONE OF YOUR CRAFT
THAT IS NOT IN THE DOCKING BAY OF CURRENT PLANET TO WHICH YOU ISSUE
ORDERS-PROVIDING IT IS AVAILABLE FOR SERVICE.THE CENTRAL READOUT WILL INFORM
YOU IF THE SHIP IS AWAITING A CREW,HAS INSUFFICIENT FUEL TO UNDERTAKE THE
VOYAGE YOU HAVE CHOSEN FOR IT,OR IS SITTING ON THE SURFACE OF A PLANET AND
CANNOT BE LAUNCHED.YOU MAY HAVE TO MOVE OTHER CONTROL SCREENS TO REMEDY THESE
PROBLEMS,AND RETURN HERE TO RE-ISSUE YOUR ORDERS.
WHEN YOU HAVE ALERTED A CAPTAIN BY CLICKING ON THE NAME OF THE SHIP HE
COMMANDS,DETAILS OF HIS CRAFT APPEAR IN THE CENTRAL WINDOW,AND IN THE HEADING
PANEL ONCE YOU HAVE ISSUED YOUR ORDER.

--------------------------------PAGE 66---------------------------------------
THIS WAS JUST A DESCRIBTION OF PLANET FORMATTING ALREADY DISCUSSED SO I SKIPPED
IT...NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE WAS MISSED..IT HAD ALL BEEN MENTIONED PREVIOUS.

--------------------------------PAGE 67----------------------------------------
PLANET TYPES:

VOLCANIC:

HORTI-STATS AND SOL SAT GEN WORK HERE,BUT THE REAL GAINS ARE MADE IF YOU SET UP
MINING OPERATIONS, A BASIC MINING STATION PRODUCES 5 TIMES THE YIELD OF
MINERALS AND 3 TIMES THE YIELD OF FUEL ON A VOLCANIC PLANET AS IT DOES ON ANY
OTHER PLANET TYPE.THOSE YIELDS MAY BE FURTHER INCREASED BY TECNOLOGICAL BREAK
THROUGHS.

DESERT FARMING:

FARMING AND MINING OPERATIONS PROCEED AT NORMAL BASIC RATES, BUT THE ENERGY  
YIELD FROM ORBITTING SOL SAT GEN`S IS MUCH INCREASED OWING TO THE THIN
ATMOSPHERE THAT CLOAKS DESERT PLANETS-VERY LITTLE ENERGY IS LOST WHEN IT IS
BEAMED DOWN TO THE PLANETS CAPACITOR STORAGE DEVICES.

TROPICAL:

NORMAL BASIC YIELDS ARE OBTAINED FROM MINING AND SOLAR SATELLITES BUT AS MIGHT
BE EXPECTED YOU GET SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOOD FROM A HORTI-STAT WHEN IT IS
INSTALLED ON A TROPICAL PLANET AS IT UTILISES SOME OF THE LOCAL FLORA AND FAUNA
IN THE PRODUCTION OF  FOOD,YIELDS FROM HORTI-STATS MAY BE FURTHER INCREASED BY
TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS.

METROPOLIS:

STARBASE IS A METROPOLIS PLANET-THESE PLANETS ARE GOOD LITTLE EARNERS-THE
REVENUE PER UNIT OF TIME YOU RECIEVE FROM SETTING A GIVEN TAX RATE ON A GIVEN
SIZE OF POPULATION IS MUCH HIGHER ON A METROPOLIS PLANET THAN ON ANY OTHER
PLANET TYPE.

--------------------------------PAGE 68----------------------------------------

PLATOON MANAGEMENT:

YOU NOW KNOW HOW TO ENLIST,COMMISSION AND ARM YOUR PLATOONS, YOU CAN HAVE UP TO
24 PLATOONS,WHICH ARE IDENTIFIED BY NUMERIC NAMES,AND CAN BE COMPOSED OF
BETWEEN 1-200 SOLDIERS.
IF A PLATOON IS WIPED OUT IN A BATTLE,THEN ITS NUMBET BECOMES AVAILABLE AGAIN
BACK ON STARBASE,AND NEW RECRUITS CAN BE DRAFTED IN.IF,HOWEVER, A PLATOON IS
DIMINISHING IN STRENGTH AND YOU WISH TO ASSIGN EXTRA MEN TO IT,YOU HAVE NO
OPTION BUT TO BRING IT BACK TO STARBASE IN A BATTLE CRUISER,DECOMMISSION
IT,RECRUIT NEW MEN,TRAIN AND EQUIP THEM BEFORE RE-COMMISSIONING THE PLATOON
ONCE MORE.
THIS SCREEN CAN ALSO BE USED TO REVIEW THE STATUS OF THE PLATOONS YOU HAVE
SCATTERED AROUND THE SYSTEM.

--------------------------------PAGE 69----------------------------------------

DRAFTING TROOPS:

TO ENLIST CIVILIANS,YOU FIRST NEED TO SELECT A VACANT PLATOON NUMBER-CLICKING
THE UP/DOWN ARROW NEXT TO THE PLATOON WINDOW CYCLES THROUGH THE PLATOONS,AND
THE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS CURRENTLY IN EACH PLATOON APPEARS IN THE TROOPS WINDOW
TO THE RIGHT,TO TRABSFER CIVILIANS INTO THE PLATOON THAT IS SELECTED AND
AVAILABLE FRO RECRUITMENT,CLICK ON THE UP OF THE UP/DOWN ARROW NEXT TO THE
DRAFTING WINDOW. AT ANY STAGE,RIGHT UP UNTIL A PLATOON HAS BEEN
COMMISSIONED,YOU CAN MOVE MEN IN OR OUT OF IT.
WHEN CIVILIANS ARE DRAFTED,THEIR TRAINING BEGINS AUTOMATICALLY,THE GREEN
SOLDIER IN THE WINDOW TO THE BOTTOM RIGHT OF THE SCREEN BEGINS TO RUN,AND A
PERCENTAGE FIGURE STARTS TO INCREMENT.THE LONGER YOU LEAVE A PLATOON IN
TRAINING,THE HIGHER THE PERCENTAGE,UNTIL IT FIANLLY HITS 100% WHEN THE RECRUITS
HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO A LEVEL EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF THEIR LEADER,A FIVE STAR
GENERAL,TRAINING TAKES TIME,HOWEVER,AND WHILE YOU CAN LEAVE THE ROOKIES TO GET
ON WITH THE BUSINESS ON OTHER SCREENS,THE PRESSURES OF WAR MAY MEAN YOU HAVE TO
TAKE STRATEGIC DECISIONS ABOUT HOW MUCH TRAINING TO OFFER YOUR NEW RECRUITS.

--------------------------------PAGE 70----------------------------------------

COMMISSIONING PLATOONS:

PROVIDING YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS,CLICKING ON THE COMMISSION ICON EQUIPS THE
CURRENTLY SELECTED PLATOON WITH THE CURRENT SELECTION OF BODY ARMOUR AND
WEAPONARY,AND THE PLATOON BECOMES AVAILABLE FOR ACTIVE SERVIVE AT THE LEVEL OF
TRAINING IT HAD REACHED WHEN IT WAS COMMISSIONED.

DECOMMISSIONING PLATOONS:

IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR MIND-OR HAVE BROUGHT A DEPLETED PLATOON BACK TO
STARBASE IN ORDER TO BOOST ITS NUMBERS OR RE-EQUIP,YOU MUST FIRST DECOMMISSION
IT BY CLICKING ON THE DECOMMISSION ICON.THIS HAS A PENALTY IN THAT YOU CAN`T
SELL WEAPONS BACK INTO THE STORES,AND NEW RECRUITS SERIOUSLY DILUTE THE
TRAINING LEVEL OF THE HARDENED SQUAD.SOMETIMES,ITS SIMPLER TO LET A PLATOON GET
WIPED OUT,RATHER THAN BRING THE BOYS HOME.

--------------------------------PAGE 71----------------------------------------

CARGO BAY:

EACH PLANET HAS THREE DOCKING BAYS,WHICH ALL INCOMING CRAFT EXCEPT THE ATMOS
PROC USE AS LANDING AND LAUNCHING PLATFORMS,WHEN YOU BUY A NEW CRAFT,IT CAN
ONLY BE SHIPPED FROM YOUR HOME SYSTEM EPSILON INTO A VACANT DOCKING BAY ON
STARBASE.
AS A BRAND NEW BATTLE CRUISER,HORTI-STAT,MINING STATION OR CARGO CRUISER NEEDS
TO BE CREWED WITH CIVILIANS BEFORE IT CAN BE USED-AND FUEL HAS TO BE LOADED
FROM STARBASE STORES IF IT IS TO JOURNEY TO ANOTHER PLANET.CRAFT THAT ARE UP
AND RUNNING MAY NEED TO HAVE CARGO OR PASSENGERS LOADED OR UNLOADED AND
ADDITIONAL FUEL MAY HAVE TO BE TAKEN ON BOARD OR TRANSFERRED FROM A CARGO`S
HOLD TO ITS FUEL TANKS FOR PARTICULARLY LONG JOURNEYS.
ALL THESE OPERATIONS CAN TAKE PLACE IN THE CARGO BAY,WHICH IS CONTROLLED FROM
THIS SCREEN-PROVIDING OF COURSE THAT THE CURRENT PLANET HAS SUFFICIENT
RESOURCES IN ITS STORES FOR YOU TO DRAW UPON.

DOCKING BAY OPERATIONS:

THE MAIN DATA PANEL REVEALS DATA ABOUT THE SHIP YOU ARE WORKING ON IN THE CARGO
BAY,AND IS UPDATED AS YOU MOVE STORES AND PEOPLE AROUND.
THE NAME OF THE CURRENT PLANET,TOGETHER WITH THE OCCUPANTS OF ITS DOCKING BAY
APPEARS IN THE INFO PANEL AT THE TOP LEFT OF THE SCREEN.TO BEGIN CARGO
OPERATIONS ON A CRAFT,CLICK ON ITS NAME TO MAKE IT THE CURRENT CRAFT UNLESS IT
IS THE ONLY SHIP IN THE PLANETS DOCKING BAYS,IN WHICH CASE IT IS AUTOMATICLLY
SELECTED AS THE CURRENT SHIP FOR CARGO BAY OPERATIONS.

--------------------------------PAGE 72---------------------------------------

LOADING AND UNLOADING:

THE CURRENT SHIP APPEARS,TOGETHER WITH ITS CLASS DETAILS,IN THE CENTRAL CONTROL
PANEL.IF IT HAS PASSENGER-CARRYING CAPACITY,CLICKING THE UP/DOWN ARROWS IN THE
PASSENGER EMBARKATION ICON ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE TAKEN ON BOARD FROM THE CURRENT
PLANETS POPULATION,OR OFFLOADED TO JOIN ACTIVITIES ON THE PLANET,SIMILARLY IF
THE CRAFT NEEDS IT TO TRAVEL THROUGH SPACE,FUEL CAN BE PUMPED INTO THE CRAFTS
TANKS FROM THE CURRENT PLANETS STORES,OR SIPHONED BACK INTO STOCK.

CLICKING ON THE CREW ICON:

REPESENTED BY A CAPTAINS HAT-ALLOWS THE FULL COMPLEMENT OF CREW TO BE RECRUITED
FROM THE EXPERIENCED POOL OF SPACE FLYERS IN THE POPULATION,PROVIDING THERE ARE
ENOUGH CIVILIANS IN THE POPULATION OF THE CURRENT PLANET.

CLICKING ON THE AUTO-LOAD ICON ALLOWS ALL THE CARGO ON BOARD TO BE MOVED INTO
THE PLANETS STORES-FUEL IN THE TANKS IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE CARGO FOR THE
PURPOSES OF THIS ICON.

AND ITS POSSIBLE TO DECOMMISSION A SHIP,SELLING IT OFF AS SCRAP, YOU DONT GET A
BRILL PRICE-AS THE VALUE WINDOW IN THE MAIN DATA PANEL REVEALS-BUT YOU MAY NEED
TO MAKE ROOM IN YOUR FLEET ROSTER FOR A DIFFERENT CRAFT,YOU MAY  HAVE CAPTURED
AN ENEMY CRAFT WHICH YOU MAY WANT TO TURN INTO CREDITS,OR YOU MAY NEED THE
MINERALS.

--------------------------------PAGE 73----------------------------------------

THE STORES DISPLAY:

THE CONTENTS OF THE CURRENT PLANETS STORES AND OF THE CURRENT CRAQFTS CARGO
HOLD ARE DISPLAYED IN THE STORES PANEL.THE VERTICAL GREEN BAR REPRESENTS
RESOURCES HELD ON THE PLANET.WHILE THE RED BARS  REPRESENT RESOURCES THAT ARE
IN THE CARGO HOLD OF THE CURRENTLY-SELECTED CRAFT.EACH GREEN BLOCK IN THE BAR
READOUT REPRESENTS 250 UNITS;EACH RED BLOCK REPRESENTS 25 UNITS.A NUMERIC
READOUT,IN CORRESPONDING GREEN AND RED WINDOWS,GIVES A MORE ACCURATE INDICATION
OF WHATS WHERE.
CARGO CAN BE LOADED AND UNLOADED MANUALLY,BY CLICKING AND HOLDING ON THE RED
BUTTONS TO MOVE RESOURCES ONTO THE SHIP OR CLICKING AND HOLDING THE GREEN
BUTTONS TO MOVE THEM INTO STORES.

--------------------------------PAGE 74----------------------------------------

PLANET SURFACE:

AT ANY ONE TIME,A MAXIMUM OF 9 CRAFT CAN BE LOCATED ON A GIVEN PLANET-THERE ARE
THREE SPACES IN THE DOCKING BAYS,AND SIX PLATFORMS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET
ITSELF.
IN ORDER TO LAND FROM ORBIT(OR BEFORE YOU CAN BUY A CRAFT ON STARBASE)THERE HAS
TO BE A VACANT DOCKING BAY AVAILABLE TO RECIEVE IT.THIS MAY MEAN LAUNCHING A
CRAFT AND PARKING IT IN ORBIT-THERES UNLIMITED ROOM IN THE SPACE LANES-OR IT
MAY MEAN TRANSFERRING SOMETHING FROM A DOCKING BAY OUT ONTO THE SURFACE OF THE
PLANET TO MAKE ROOM.
REMEMBER:HORTI AND MINING STATIONS ONLY PRODUCE RESOURCES WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN
MOVED OUT ON THE SURFACE OF A PLANET AND ACTIVATED.
THE PLANET SURFACE SCREEN ALLOWS YOU TO MOVE CRAFT BETWEEN THE 6 PLATFORMS ON
THE PLANET AND THE 3 DOCKING BAYS.TO MOVE CRAFT OUT,CLICK ON ITS NAME IN THE
DOCKING BAY PANEL..TO MOVE IT BACK INTO A VACANT DOCKING BAY,CLICK ON THE
VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE CRAFT THAT APPEARS WHEN IT OCCUPIES A SURFACE
PLATFORM.
AND TO TURN ON A MINING OR HORTI-STATION,SIMPLY CLICK ONCE ON THE ON/OFF TOGGLE
SWITCH...YOU MAY NEED TO CHECK ALL YOUR MINING AND HORTI-STATIONS AFTER A
COSMIC STORM OR ENERGY FAILURE-THEY HAVE A NASTY HABIT OF SWITCHING THEMSELVES
OFF AND GOING UNNOTICED UNTIL STORES HAVE DROPPED DANGEROUSLY LOW.

--------------------------------PAGE 75---------------------------------------

COMBAT CONTROL:

THIS IS THE SCREEN YOU NEED TO ACCESS ON STARBASE ONCE YOU HAVE TRAINED AND
EQUIPPED SOME PLATOONS AND BOUGHT AND COMMISSIONED A BATTLE CRUISER.ITS THE
ONLY WAY TO GET COMBAT UNITS OFF YOUR BASE AND ON THEIR WAY TO GARRISON A
COLONY OR ATTACK AN ENEMY PLANET,AS A GAME PROGRESSES,THIS SCREEN IS USED TO
DEPLY FORCES.
AND THIS IS THE ONLY CONTROL SCREEN THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ACCESS A PLANET THAT IS
CURRENTLY UNDER THE ENEMY`S CONTROL PROVIDING YOU HAVE LANDED A BATTLE CRUISER
ON AN ENEMY PLANET,IT IS POSSIBLE TO GO TO THE MAIN SCREEN,SELECT THAT PLANET
AS THE CURRENT PLANET AND USE THE COMBAT CONTROL ICON TO CALL UP THIS SCREEN
FOR THE PLANET YOU ARE ABOUT TO ATTACK.
PLATOONS ARE DISPLAYED AS PAIRS OF NUMBERS;THE FIRST NUMBER IS THE IDENTIFYING
PLATOON NUMBER;THE SECOND NUMBER REVEALS HOW MANY SOLDIERS ARE CURRENTLY IN
THAT PLATOON.

USING THE DOCKING BAYS:

YOU CAN LAND UP TO THREE BATTLE CRUISERS AT ANY ONE TIME(AND IN CASE YOUR
WONDERING,THEY BLAST THEIR WAY IN,VAPOURISING ANY CRAFT THE ENEMY MAY HAVE
PARKED IN HIS DOCKING BAYS)ONCE YOU HACE LANDED A BATTLE CRUISER,CLICK ON ITS
NAME TO SELECT IT AS THE CURRENT SHIP FOR COMBAT CONTROL OPERATIONS,AND
CONTENTS OF ITS PLATOON ACCOMMODATION APPEAR IN THE STATUS WINDOW TO THE RIGHT
OF THE THREE DICKING BAY WINDOWS.

--------------------------------PAGE 76---------------------------------------

THE PLANET SURFACE:

IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE(BUT NOT NECESSARILY ADVISABLE)TO MOVE 24 PLATOONS ONTO A
SINGLE PLANET-THERES CERTAINLY ROOM ON THE PLANET SURFACE.CLICK ON THE
IDENTIFYING NUMBER-PAIR OF A PLATOON IN THE BATTLE CRUISER CONTENTS WINDOW TO
MOVE IT ONTO THE PLANET,AND THE NUMER-PAIR APPEARS IN THE LARGE GRID.TO EMBARK
A TROOP,MAKE SURE THERES ROOM IN THE CURRENT BATTLE CRUISER,THEN CLICK ON ITS
NUMBER-PAIR IN THE LARGE GRID TO MOVE IT ABOARD THE SHIP.

THE COLOUR OF WAR:

GREEN IDENTIFIES YOUR FORCES AND RED IS THE ENEMY`S COLOUR,WHEN YOU FIRST
ACCESS THE COMBAT CONTROL SCREEN.THE VIDEO WINDOW AT THE TOP RIGHT OF THE
SCREEN SHOWS A SHORT ANIMATED SEQUENCE OF A SOLDIER PLANTING A FLAG IN THE
GROUND,IF THIS TAKES PLACE AGAINST A GREEN BACKDROP,THEN THE CURRENT PLANET IS
UNDER YOUR CONTROL,IF IN RED THE ENEMY HAS CONTROL.
THE MOMENT AFTER YOU LAND FORCES,A GREEN VERTICAL BAR READOUT APPEARS IN THE
CENTRE OF THE SCREEN;THE RED AND GREEN BARS REVEAL THE COMPARITIVE MILITARY
STRENGTH OF THE OPPOSING ARMIES.CLICKING ON THE AUTO SCALE BUTTON LOCATED
BETWEEN THESE TWO BARS ALLOWS YOU TAKE A MORE DETAILED VIEW OF THE DIFFERENCE
IN FIGHTING STRENGTH-THE STRENGTH OF THE LARGER FORCE IS DISPLAYED AS A FULL
BAR AND THE BAR REPRESENTING THE SMALLER FORCE IS SCALED TO PROPORTION,A
NUMERIC VALUE FOR THE SCALING FACTOR APPEARS IN A WINDOW TO THE RIGHT.

--------------------------------PAGE 77---------------------------------------

BATTLE THEN COMMENCES,AND NUMERIC READOUT OF YOUR MILITARY STRENGTH AND THAT OF
THE ENEMY`S SHOW THE MIGHT OF THE TWO FORCES,ANITHER READOUT,REVEALING HOW MANY
SOLDIERS REMAIN ON EACH SIDE OF THE BATTLE LINES.AS COMBAT BEGINS,THE VIDEO
WINDOW SHOWS SCENES FROM THE CONFLICT-CLICK ON IT AT ANY TIME TO SEE THE NEXT
SEQUENCE.
FINALLY AT THE END OF THE BATTLE THE VIDEO WINDOW WILL REPEAT THE CLIP OF THE
SOLDIER TRIUMPHANTLY PLANTING HIS FLAG...IS IT GREEN...OR IS IT RED?

ALTERING AGGRESSION:

APART FROM STRATEGIC DECISIONS-BEATING A HASTY RETREAT OR SHIPPING IN MORE
PLATOONS-YOU CAN AFFECT THE WAY THE BATTLE PROGRESSES BY ADJUSTING THE
AGGRESSION FACTOR OF YOUR SOLDIERS.CLICKING ON THE UP/DOWN ARROW IN THIS ICON
ALLOWS THE AGGRESSION FACTOR WITH WHICH YOUR SOLDIERS FIGHT TO BE ALTERED.
INCREASING AGGRESSION RAISES YOUR MILITARY STRENGTH,BUT YOU LOOSE TROOPS MORE
RAPIDLY IF THE BOYS ARE FIGHTING AGGRESSIVELY.THE BIGGER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
YOUR OVERALL MILITARY STRENGTH AND THE ENEMY`S.THE MORE QUICKLY THE BATTLE IS
OVER.RAISING AGGRESSION INCREASES YOUR OVERALL STRENGTH,BUT USE THE CONTROL
WISELY-WHEN YOU ALREADY OUTNUMBER THE ENEMY FORCE`S AND WANT A SPEEDY
CONCLUSION TO THE BATTLE SO YOU CAN MOVE THE PLATOONS INVOLVED TO ANOTHER
COMBAT ZONE.INCREASING AGGRESSION WHEN THE CONTEST IS QUITE CLOSE OR WHEN THE
ENEMY OUTNUMBERS YOU COULD HAVE DISASTROUS RESULTS.FOR ADVICE ON MILITARY
STRATEGY,SEE MISSION BACKGROUND SECTION ON PAGE 82.

--------------------------------PAGE 78---------------------------------------

SPYING:

A COMPREHENSIVE SPY NETWORK IS AUTOMATICALLY MAINTAINED FOR YOUR BENEFIT-SPIES
ARE AT WORK ON EVERY HABITABLE PLANET IN THE SYSTEM,AND CAN BE PAID TO PROVIDE
USEFUL INTELLIGENCE THAT SHOULD HELP YOU PLAN CAMPAIGNS AND JUDGE YOUR MILITARY
PRIORITIES.

MOVE THE PLANET CURSOR IN THE SYSTEM MAP UNTIL IT IS RESTING OVER THE ENEMY
PLANET ON WHICH YOU WANT SOME INFO--YOU`LL NOTICE THAT THE VIDEO WINDOW IS`NT
OFFERING MUCH...NOW CLICK ON THE SPYING ICON--A PRICE LIST FOR INFO ABOUT THE
ENEMY PLANET APPEARS IN THE MESSAGE WINDOW.
CLICK ON `EVERYTHING`IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO GET A FULL RUN-DOWN,OR BE SELECTIVE
IF YOU ARE SHORT OF CREDITS OR HAVE A SPECIFIC PLAN FOR RAIDING ENEMY
PLANETS-YOU MIGHT BE IN THE NEED OF PEOPLE,PERHAPS,AND BE LOOKING FOR AN ENEMY
PLANET WITH A HEALTHY POPULATION THAT YOU CAN `KIDNAP` AND SHIP BACK TO ONE OF
YOUR COLONIES.
REMEMBER THE ENEMY IS MANAGING HIS COLONIES ACTIVELY,SO SPY INFO CAN QUICKLY GO
OUT OF DATE-ITS WORTH PAYING SPIES FOR INFO THAT YOU CAN USE TO BUILD UP A
GENERAL PICTURE OF YOUR ENEMIES ACTIVITIES.BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETURN TO THE
SPY ICON AND COLLECT UP TO DATE DATA BEFORE MOUNTING AN ATTACK.

--------------------------------PAGES 79/80/81---------------------------------

THESE PAGES WERE  ALL ABOUT GAME SAVING AND LOADING...NO MORE INFO WAS HERE,
THATS ALREADY HAD BEEN GIVEN...SO HAVE PASSED IT OVER.SEE THE INDEX FOR PAGES
CONTAINING THIS INFO...

--------------------------------PAGE 82----------------------------------------

MISSION BACKGROUND SECTION:

YOUR ULTIMATE AIM IS TO INVADE THE ENEMIES BASE AND DEFEAT HIM ON HIS OWN
GROUND-CLEARLY THIS INVOLVES ESTABLISHING AND DEPLOYING AN ARMY.APART FROM THE
RECRUITING TROOPS FROM THE STARBASE POPULATION,PUTTING THEM INTO TRAINING AND
PURCHASING WEAPONS FOR THEM,YOU WILL NEED TO EVOLVE AN OVERALL MILITARY
STRATEGY.AND THAT STRATEGY WILL NEED TO BE MODIFIED ACCORDING TO WHICH PLANET
SYSTEM YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR AND WHAT STAGE THE OVERALL THE OVERALL CONFLICT HAS
REACHED.REMEMBER,A GOOD MILITARY COMMANDER REACTS TO DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD.
TROOPS CAN BE DEPLOYED TO GARRISON YOUR COLONIES,PROTECTING THEM FROM ENEMY
INVASION,OR THEY MAY BE LAUNCHED INTO OFFENSIVE ACTIONS TO ATTEMPT TO WIN
CONTROL OF PLANETS WHICH YOUR OPPONENT HAS COLONISED.VALUABLE RESOURCES GAINED
BY CONQUERING ENEMY COLONIES-AND YOU MAY WELL DISCOVER FULLY-FUNCTIONAL CRAFT
EITHER ON THE PLANET SURFACE OR IN ORBIT AROUND A DEFEATED PLANET,REMEMBER TO
LOOK FOR THEM!
YOU MAY CHOOSE TO CONCENTRATE ON LAUNCHING ALL OUT ATTACK AS SOON AS YOU
CAN,SENDING WAVE AFTER WAVE OF BATTLE CRUISERS TO THE ENEMY BASE IN THE HOPE OF
DEFEATING HIM BEFORE HE CAN BECOME ESTABLISHED.ALTERNATIVELY,YOU COULD EXPAND
YOUR PLANETARY EMPIRE GRADUALLY,COLONISING PLANETS ONE BY ONE AND CONSOLIDATING
YOUR POSITION BEFORE YOU MOVE FORCES AND EQUIPMENT DEEPER INTO THE CURRENT
PLANET SYSTEM.
OBVIOUSLY THE TASK OF MANAGING RESOURCES AND DEPLOYING 24 PLATOONS IS MUCH MORE
COMPLICATED IN THE 32 PLANET SYSTEM..MITTSU AND YOTTSU THAN IT IS IN THE 8
PLANET SYSTEM HITOTSU OR IN THE 16 PLANET SYSTEM OF FUTATSU,BUT THERE ARE A
COUPLE OF BASIC APPROACHES WHICH CAN BE MODIFIED IN THE LIGHT OF EXPERIENCE.

YOU COULD CHOOSE TO ESTABLISH STARBASE AS A VIABLE,SELF SUPPORTING COLONY,PUT
AS MANY TROOPS AS YOU CAN INTO TRAINING,AND THEN BUY AN ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR
AND SEND IT ON A  THE PLANET HOPPING JOURNEY TOWARDS THE ENEMY BASE.ONE
STRATEGY INVOLVES `RAIDING`SUCH NEWLY FORMED COLONIES FOR RESOURCES AND
SHIPPING THEM BACK TO STARBASE.LEAVING ABANDONED PLANETS IN YOUR WAKE.
ITS WELL WORTH ESTABLISHING A MININGCOLONY ON THE FIRST VOLCANIC PLANET YOU
ENCOUNTER AND A FARMING COLONY ON THE FIRST TROPICAL PLANET YOU
FORMAT,THOUGH,AS THESE RESOURCES ARE VITAL AND THE YIELDS FROM MINING STATIONS
AND HORTICULTURAL STATIONS ARE MUCH IMPROVED IF THEY ARE LOCATED ON A N
APPROPRIATE PLANET.
SOMETIMES ITS WORTH ESTABLISHING A STRONG GARRISON IN THE MIDDLE OF A GROUP OF
ENEMY CONTROLLED PLANETS,THEN

--------------------------------PAGE 83---------------------------------------

USING THE PLANET AS A BASE TO MOUNT LOCALISED ATTACKS ON THE PLANETS UNDER
ENEMY CONTROL OR FOR THE FINAL PUSH AGAINST THE ENEMYS BASE.
AND IN THE FINAL STAGES OF A GAME,IF THE VICTORY SEEMS WITHIN YOUR GRASP,YOU
COULD MOUNT A BLITZKREIG ATTACK ON THE ENEMYS STARBASE BY ABANDONING ANY
ATTEMPT TO PROTECT YOUR OWN COLONIES AND THROWING ALL AVAILABLE PLATOONS INTO
WHAT YOU HOPE WILL BE THE FINAL BATTLE.
ONLY EXPERIENCE GAINED IN THE THEATRE OF WAR WILL HELP YOU FORMULATE WINNING
STRATEGIES.

TRAINING AND DEPLOYING TROOPS:

WHEN YOU PUT NEW RECRUITS INTO TRAINING ON STARBASE,IT TAKES TIME FOR THEIR
SKILL LEVEL TO BUILD UP.IDEALLY,YOU MIGHT WANT TO DRAFT THE MAXIMUM OF MEN INTO
A NEW PLATOON AND LEAVE THEM TRAINING UNTIL THEIR COMMANDER ACHIEVES THE RANK
OF A 5 STAR GENERAL-WHEN THE MEN WILL HAVE ACHIEVED A TRAINING LEVEL OF 100%
IF YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME AND AMASSED A VAST STORE OF CREDITS,THEN GOING FOR
THE VERY BEST IN TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT WILL PAY DIVIDENDS.IN THE HEAT OF
WAR,HOWEVER,YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF MAKING COMPROMISES.
AOMETIMES IT IS VITAL YOU COMMISSION A NEW PLATOON IMMEDIATELY,RATHER THAN
WAITING UNTIL THE TROOPS REACH A TRAINING LEVEL OF 100%,AND THERE WILL BE TIMES
WHEN YOU CAN`T AFFORD TO COMMISSION A PLATOON OF 200 MEN AND EQUIP THEM WITH
THE VERY BEST EQUIPMENT.THIS MIGHT MEAN PURCHASING LESS EXPENSIVE KIT,OR
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TROOPS IN THE PLATOON BEFORE IT IS COMMISSIONED.LEARNING
HOW TO MAKE THE BEST STRATEGIC DECISIONS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IS PART OF THE
KEY TO SUCCESS AS A MILITARY COMMANDER.
THE STRATEGY YOU ADOPT IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF COMMANDING AN ARMY.EVERY
TIME A PLATOON WINS A BATTLE THE CALIBRE OF THE TROOPS-THEIR TRAINING LEVEL AND
EXPERIENCE LEVELS INCREASES BY 7% AND IT IS WORTH GIVING YOUR TROOPS COMBAT
EXPERIENCE AS SOON AS YOU CAN. CAREFUL USE OF THE AGGRESSION AS SOON AS YOU
CAN,CAREFUL USE OF THE AGGRESSION CONTROL ON THE COMBAT SCREEN CAN ALSO PAY
DIVIDENDS.

--------------------------------PAGE 83---------------------------------------
THE REST OF THE PAGES..ARE REALLY A POINT OF LEARNING BY ACTUALLY PLAYING THE
GAME...JUST PUT IN TO FILL THE DAMN BOOK AND MAKE IT ANNOYING TO THE GUYS WHO
TYPE IT IN..I HAVE READ IT..AND AS I SAID ITS ONLY REALLY BATTLE SITUATIONS
THAT YOU WILL COME UP AGAINST ANYWAY...SO ENJOY THE GAME...AND GIVE ME THE EASY

STILL 200 LINES OF DOX TO READ FROM HERE....BUSY LAD AINT I.....
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPREMACY QUESTIONS:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`MY PEOPLE ARE STARVING WHAT CAN I DO?`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
IF YOU WANT TO ABANDON THE POPULATION,THEN SET THE TAX RATE AT 100% SO YOU CAN
DERIVE MAXIMUM REVENUE FROM THE PEOPLE BEFORE THEY ALL DIE OF STARVATION.
ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU WANT TO PRESERVE THE POPULATION ON THE PLANET,THEN YOU
NEED TO MOVE FOOD FROM ANOTHER PLANET OR SET UP A HORTI-STATION TO MAKE THE
COLONY SELF SUFFICIENT.
IN THE SHORT TERM,TO GAIN TEMPORARY RESPITE WHILE YOU MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE
LONG TERM,YOU CAN PUT PEOPLE INTO CRYGENIC STORAGE ON BOARD A SHIP BY MOVING A
CARGO CRUISER OR BATTLE CRUISER INTO A DOCKING BAY ON THE PLANET AND USING THE
PASSENGER ICON TO LOAD PASSENGERS ABOARD.IF THE FOOD SHORTAGE OCCURS ON
STARBASE YOU CAN DRAFT SOME PEOPLE INTO YOUR ARMY,USING THE PLATOON MANAGEMENT
SCREEN.
PEOPLE IN CRYOGENIC STORAGE OR IN THE ARMY DO CONSUME FOOD FROM YOUR
RESERVES.CARGO CRUSIERS CAN ACCOMODATE UO TO 1850 CIVILIANS,WHILE BATTLE
CRUISERS CAN UP TO 4500 PASSENGERS.
OR YOU COULD MOVE PEOPLE TO ANOTHER PLANET WHICH HAS A PLENTIFUL SUPPLY OF
FOOD.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`I SENT A SOLAR SATELLITE GENERATOR TO MY PLANET,BUT IT DOESNT SEEM TO BE
GENERATING ENERGY....WHATS WRONG?`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SOLAR SATELLITES ONLY WORK WHEN THEY ARE IN ORBIT,GO TO THE NAVIGATION
SCREEN,CLICK ON THE NAME OF YOUR `ROGUE`SATELLITE AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IS
ORBIT.LAUNCH IT AGAIN IF YOU LANDED IT BY MISTAKE.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`ALL THE PLANETS IN THE SYSTEM ARE NOW FORMATTED....WHAT SHOULD I DO?`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
MOVE YOUR ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR INTO THE DOCKING BAY AND THEN SCRAP IT-ITS OF NO
FURTHER USE,AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL CLAIM ITS SCRAP VALUE,THEN USE THE GOVERMENT
SCREEN TO SEND THE CASH RAISED BACK TO BASE.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THERES A POPULATION OF ZERO ON A PLANET I OWN,BUT I WANT PEOPLE THERE.WHAT
SHOULD I DO?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
FIRST,CHECK THAT THE PLANET CAN SUPPORT HUMAN LIFE.SOMETIMES PLANETS ARE
RENDERED POISONOUS AS A RESULT OF A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION-AN INCOMING MESSAGE WILL
HAVE ADVISED YOU OF THE FACT--ITS POINTLESS MOVING PEOPLE ONTO A PLANET THAT
WILL KILL THEM!!
THEN USE CARGO CRUISERS OR BATTLE CRUISERS TO SHIP PEOPLE IN FROM ANOTHER
PLANET.YOU MAY WANT TO MOVE SOME FOOD INTO THE DEPOPULATED PLANETS RESERVES
BEFORE MOVING THE NEW INHABITANTS,AND YOU MAY DECIDE TO BUY HORTI-STATION(S)
FOR THE NEW PLANET.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THE POPULATION OF ONE OF PLANETS HAS REACHED 30,000 AND DOESNT APPEAR TO BE
GROWING ...WHY?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THE COLONISTS HAVE DEVELOPED EVERY AVAILABLE INCH OF THAT PLANETS SURFACE,AND
THE COLONY CANNOT EXPAND FURTHER.YOU COULD ALWAYS MOVE PEOPLE TO ANOTHER
PLANET,THEREBY MAKING SPACE....


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THERE IS A NEGATIVE NUMBER AGAINST`RATE OF POPULATION` ON ONE OF MY
PLANETS...WHY?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOUR PEOPLE ARE STARVING,OR RECOVERING FROM A FOOD
SHORTAGE.MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ENOUGH FOOD-AND YOU COULD CONSIDER TRYING TO RAISE
THEIR MORALE BY LOWERING THE TAX RATE.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
WHY CAN`T I LAUNCH MY ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
USE THE MAIN SCREEN-NOT THE NAVIGATION SCREEN.THE ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR HAS ITS
OWN CONTROL ICON;SELECT THE UNFORMATTED PLANET YOU WANT TO FORMAT BY MOVING THE
PLANET CURSOR OVER IT IN THE SYSTEM MAP.THEN CLICK ON THE ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR
ICON.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
EVEN THOUGH I HAVE FILLED THE TANKS OF ONE OF MY CRAFT,WHEN I TRY TO SEND IT TO
A PLANET AT THE OTHER END IF THE SYSTEM,I CAN`T-THE NAVIGATION SCREEN TELLS ME
THERE`S `INSUFFICENT FUEL`....WHAT SHOULD I DO?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK THE JOURNEY.STOPPING OFF AT A PLANET THAT YOU
CONTROL,TO FUEL,IF THERE ISNT MUCH FUEL ON THE PLANET YOU USE AS A STAGING
POST,YOU COULD LOAD FUEL INTO THE CARGO HOLD OF THE CRAFT,LAND,UNLOAD IT INTO
THE PLANETS RESERVES AND THEN REFILL THE TANKS AGAIN.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
WHATS THE POINT OF RENAMING PLANETS AND CRAFT?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
ITS USEFUL,AND CAN HELP YOU KEEP TRACK OF THINGS.
IF YOU CAPTURE A PLANET FROM BEHIND THE ENEMY,YOU MIGHT FIND THAT HE HAS LEFT A
CRAFT BEHIND.THE ENEMY USES NAMES THAT ARE MENINGLESS TO YOU-SO YOU MAY FIND IT
HELPFUL TO RENAME A CAPTURED CRAFT ACCORDING TO THE DEFAULT NAMING SCHEME THAT
CALLS HORTICULTURAL STATIONS`FARMING 1`,`FARMING 2` AND SO ON,THE ENEMY
ASSSIGNS STRANGE NAMES TO THE PLANETS HE CONQUERS,WHICH YOU MIGHT WANT TO
CHANGE FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE.
AND ITS EASY TO LOSE TRACK OF PLANETS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES,PARTICULARLY IF YOU
ARE PLAYING IN ONE OF THE LARGER SYSTEMS.ITS WORTH USING MEANINGFUL NAMES THAT
HELP YOU IDENTIFY THE ATTRIBUTES OF YOUR COLONISED PLANETS,FOR INSTANCE,YOU
COULD MAKE BEST USE OF YOUR HORTI-STAT BY ESTABLISHING THEM ON A TROPICAL
PLANET-CALLING IT `FARM` WOULD REMIND YOU THAT YOU ARE USING THAT PLANET TO
PRODUCE FOOD.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I WANT TO BUY SOMETHING,BUT HAVENT ENOUGH CREDITS...WHAT CAN I DO?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GO TO THE GOVERMENT SCREEN AND CLICK ON THE ICON THAT SENDS ALL THE CASH ON
YOUR COLONIES BACK TO STARBASE.IF YOU STILL HAVENT GOT ENOUGH CASH,YOU ARE
EITHER GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE TAX REVENUES RAISE ENOUGH CASH TO FUND
YOUR PURCHASE,OR,IF YOU ARE BUYING WEAPONS OR BODY SUITS,SELECT A CHEAPER
OPTION.
YOU CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU HAVE TO WAIT BY INCREASING THE TAX
RATE-RAISE IT UP TO 100% IF YOU BARE IN A REAL HURRY,BUT RE,MEMBER TO REDUCE IT
AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE RAISED THE CREDITS YOU NEED,OR THE POPULATIONS MORALE AND
RATE OF GROWTH WILL START FAILING.
YOU GET THE BEST TAX FROM POPULATION ON METROPOLIS PLANETS(LIKE STARBASE)SO
KEEP THE POPULATION HIGH ON AT LEAST ONE OF YOUR METROPOLIS PLANETS.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I`VE BOUGHT 9 CRAFT,PARKED 6 ON THE SURFACE,AND THREE ARE STILL IN THE DOCKING
BAY.TROUBLE IS,I WANT TO BUY ANOTHER CRAFT,BUT I HAVENT GOT ENOUGH FUEL TO SEND
ONE OF THE SHIPS IN THE THREE DOCKING BAYS INTO ORBIT...WHAT CAN I DO?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
OOOPS!,WELL YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THE CARGO BAY AND SCRAP ONE OF THOSE
SHIPS IN THE DOCKING BAYS,THERES NO ALTERNATIVE,THEN IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO
BUY A MINING STATION TO PROVIDE YOU WITH FUEL.
AS A SHORT TERM SOLUTION,IF YOU LOADED FUEL INTO THE TANKS OR CARGO HOLD OF ONE
OF THE SHIPS YOU MOVED OUT ONTO THE PLANET SURFACE EARLIER,GO TO THE PLANET
SURFACE SCREEN AND MOVE THE CRAFT INTO THE NEWLY-VACANT DOCKING BAY,FROM
THERE,YOU CAN UNLOAD THE FUEL FROM A SHIPS TANKS OR CARGO HOLD BACK INTO
STARBASE`S RESERVES,THEN GO BACK TO THE PLANET SURFACE SCREEN AND MOVE THE
EMPTY SHIP BACK INTO A DOCKING BAY.
REPEAT THIS PROCESS FOR ANY CRAFT ON THE SURFACE THAT YOU INTEND TO LEAVE
THERE.YOU MIGHT FIND THIS RAISES ENOUGH FUEL TO LAUNCH A SHIP OR TWO INTO ORBIT
AROUND STARBASE,THEREBY FREEING YOUR DOCKING BAYS.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I HAVE`NT GOT ENOUGH MINERALS OR ENERGY TO MAKE A PURCHASE - WHAT CAN I DO?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
MINERALS,FUEL AND ENERGY CAN ONLY BE MOVED AROUND A PLANET SYSTEM AS CARGO IN
THE HOLD OF ONE OF YOUR CRAFT.IF YOU ARE PLAYING IN A PLANET SYSTEM WHERE
MINERALS AND ENERGY ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE A PURCHASE,THEN THEY ARE TAKEN FROM
RESERVES ON STARBASE,O.EITHER MOVE MINERALS AND ENERGY FROM YOUR COLONIES TO
STARBASE,OR SET UP A MINING STATION AND SOME SOL SAT GEN RESOURCES FROM
STARBASE ITSELF.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
ALL MY HORTI AND MINING STATIONS SEEMED TO HAVE STOPPED WORKING.....WHY?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
IT MAY SEEM THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF ENERGY,WHICH THEY CONSUME AS THEY PRODUCE
RESOURCES.LAUNCH A SOL SAT GEN INTO ORBIT AROUND THE PLANET ON WHICH YOUR
STATIONS ARE PLACED,THEN GO TO THE PLANET SURFACE SCREEN AND CLICK THE ON/OFF
TOGGLE SWITCHES TO ACTIVATE YOUR EQUIPMWNT,ALTERNATIVELY AN ELECTROMAGNETIC
STORM MAY HAVE SWEPT ACROSS THE GALAXY-THE MESSAGE WINDOW WILL HAVE INFORMED
YOU OF THE FACT,SO TOGGLE THE RESOURCE GENERATING EQUIPMENT BACK ON.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I`VE FORGOTTEN WHERE ONE OF MY CRAFT IS LOCATED..HOW CAN I FIND WHERE IT IS?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GO TO THE NAVIGATION SCREEN AND CLICK ON ITS NAME IN THE CENTRAL GRID THAT
SHOWS THE FLEET ROSTER-THE MESSAGE DISPLAY WILL GIVE YOU THE CURRENT LOCATION
OF THE CRAFT.

RIGHT NOW ITS THE...COR BLIMEY..WHERES THE NEXT SET OF DOX TO BE TYPED IN...OH
