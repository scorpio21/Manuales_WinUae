PUNCHES AND KICKS
The three basic punches are:
Light Punch (Jab)      Very quick, but does little damage.
Medium Punch (Strong)  Produces a fair amount of damage.
Hard Punch (Fierce)    Can create a large amount of damage.

The three basic kicks are:
Light Kick (Short)     The kick is very quick, but does very little
                       damage.
Medium Kick (Forward)  This kick is strong and fairly quick.
Hard Kick (Roundhouse) This kick is powerful, but very slow.

Note: To change controls use the OPTION MODE.

CLOSE ATTACKS
These are special techniques only used when two fighters are right next to each other. They fall into two basic categories: THROWS and HOLDS.
THROWS allow you to grab an opponent and throw them across the room. Some fighters can execute throws in mid-air. E.g.: Ryu could grab Ken and throw him over his shoulder. For the Shoulder throw, Ryu must push forward against Ken and then you must press the fire button.
HOLDS allow you to grab an opponent and repeatedly smash them. E.g.: Blanka could bite Guile on the head. To do the Head Bite, Blanka must push forward against Guile and then press the fire button.
Each character's individual close attack  characteristics are listed against their character profiles. How to effectively use them is down to your skill and judgment.

SPECIAL MOVES
Each character's own special moves and techniques are listed in The Character Profile section of this manual. These explain how best you can use them.
Special moves are very powerful, and therefore very difficult to learn. It may take weeks of practice to use them effectively. Practice hard and don't give up, you're bound to succeed.
An example diagram for Ryu's Fire Ball follows. The arrows indicate the required movements. If you are unsure of what the arrows mean please refer to the movement diagram.
Example: FIRE BALL
Using the controls, press  |    \    -->  in one continuous motion
                          \|/   _\|
and press any punch button.

THE TOURNAMENT COMMENCES
Eight of the world's greatest street fighters have been gathered together to see which of them has the strength, skill and courage to challenge the mysterious Grand Masters.
Each fighter has the power to earn the title of World Warrior but which one is up to you. Select GAME START on the title screen and select your champion for the tournament. When the tournament commences, your fighter has to travel the world to meet one of the seven other challengers.
When the match begins, its down to you and your skill to defeat your opponent. Every time you hit him, his energy meter will decrease. Send your opponents energy meter totally red and he will be out for the count. Win two out of three bouts to win.

USING THE V.S. BATTLE
The V.S. Battle allows two players to compete and automatically keep track of the results. When the Title Screen appears, move the controls up or down to move the marker next to 1 or 2 player and press Fire Button. On the next screen, each player can view each character's results. When each player has selected their character, press the Fire Button to continue to the next screen.
Two options are displayed: HANDICAP and STAGE SELECT. Player one can move the joystick/keyboard up or down to highlight either option.
HANDICAP - When the HANDICAP option is highlighted, both players can press left or right to select an attack level which determines the level of damage a player's kicks and punches will do. The higher the attack level, the greater the damage.
This option allows two players of different skills to contest an even match.
STAGE SELECT - Upon highlighting this option, Player One can start the match location by moving the joystick/keyboard left or right.
After all the selections have been made, Player One can start the match by pressing the Fire button. The first player to win two bouts wins. When a match is finished, a screen displays each player's record against each character. At this time, Player One can press Fire to continue, quit or erase the record. To continue, both players return to the Player Selection Screen and repeat the process.
The Option Mode allows you to modify certain parts of the game. When the title screen appears, press the joystick/keyboard up or down to move the marker next to Option Mode and press the Fire button. When the next screen appears, move the joystick/keyboard up or down to highlight the option you wish to change.
DIFFICULTY - This option changes the difficulty of the computer opponent. Push the joystick/keyboard left or right to select the option. At level 0 the computer controlled opponents are easy to beat and at level 7 they become very difficult. The difficulty level also determines if you will see an ending upon completion of the game.
TIME LIMIT - This option allows you to turn the Time Limit ON/OFF. Move the joystick/keyboard left/right to highlight either ON/OFF. If you select ON, the fighters will have 99 seconds to knock each other out. If you select OFF, the fight will continues until one player is knocked out.
KEYBOARD CONTROLS - All keys are user definable/redefinable. I.e.: A=up, B=down, etc..
To exit the Option Mode with your new settings simply press the Fire button.
To become a true street fighter requires patience, practice and dedication. Here are a number of hints to help you to survive your first few matches:
1. Back Defence and Defence Crouch positions are used to block
   attacks.
2. Wait for your opponent to make a mistake and then attack.
3. Use your Special Moves as little as possible. They will often
   leave you vulnerable to attack.
4. A Fireball nullifies a Fireball.
5. To make your opponent dizzy will require at least three hits.
   When your opponent becomes dizzy, inflict as much damage as
   possible.
6. Practice using all of the characters. You will learn quickly their
   strengths and weakness in battle.
7. Use Back Defence and Defensive Crouch positions to block
   Special Moves, but be prepared to lose a little energy.
8. Set the difficulty level in the Option Mode to 0 to learn how
   to use your punches and kicks.
9. In the V.S. Battle Mode,knock your opponent out with a
   Special Move to earn a special K.O..
