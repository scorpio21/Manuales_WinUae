CALLING ALL BURNERS.........

WANTED

The Meanest, Fastest Burners on the Globe

We're not just talking about a race here, we're talking the race. The
ultimate trial of man and machine. Not a cross-country but a
cross-continent by whatever route gets you through.

Forget your BMX, we're talking serious bikes. Bikes that can handle the hot
and the cold. Machines that can take the rough and the smooth, and we don't
mean dirt tracks.

And what about you-mind getting your leathers dirty? Perhaps even playing
dirty? Know how to use a nitro injection? Is it first place or nothing? If
so,  read on...

The ultimate challenge-to burn rubber in the hot dust of Africa, the
mystical green of Asia, the concrete jungles of American, the wide open
spaces of Europe..

If you've got what it takes-Hang On and make those suckers spit your dust.
