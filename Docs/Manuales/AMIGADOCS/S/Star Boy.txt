Introduction

Your name is Star Boy.
Your task should you accept it is to rid your home planet of
all bombs that have been planted by the a evil task master from 
the north. His reason is to rid all stars because he feels they
are too happy looking.

Armed to the teeth with only your stars, you set out on your
adventure of freedom.

Good Luck Star Boy, You`ll need it!!

The Game

Before each world you are presented with a flying stage.
This is based on a timer. When the percentage reaches 100
the level will be complete. Each time you are hit, a
percentage is taken off. If the percentage reaches 0 then
you will loose a life.

Controls

Up - Fly up
Down - Fly down
Right - Fly right
Left - Fly left
Fire - Fire a star straight ahead

The objective of each level is to make it to the exit in one
piece. Some levels may involve disarming bombs along the way
and will not let you exit until this is done. The number to
be disarmed is indicated along the score panel. Up against
you a various enemies. These can be disposed of by throwing
stars at them. Watch out though as some of the larger
enemies cannot be destroyed!!!

To help you in your quest are teleporters. Once walked into,
transport you to another area on the level. Also you will
come across doors. These can be open and closed by walking
over different colour switches on the floor. Pink coloured
switches will open the doors, and yellow will close. You
will know if you have activated a switch due to the creaking
sound.

If you loose all your lives the game is over and it's back
