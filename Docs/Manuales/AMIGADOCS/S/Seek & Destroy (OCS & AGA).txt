 OKAY LISTEN UP! I'ME ONLY GOING TO BRIEF YOU PEOPLE ONCE SO PAY ATTENTION!


 Your mission - To take control of the Apache helicopter and fly into enemy 
 territory. Take out the designated targets and return to home base. Your 
 missions will be varied. Some may involve rescue attempts. They should all be
 completed with surgical precision. There is no margin for error and the
 slightest hesitation will prove fatal. I don't need to remind you that each
 mission briefing is highly classified and top secret. Now get to it!


 LOADING INSTRUCTIONS   


 Place disk 1 in your internal drive and disk 2 into an external drive (if
 connected). Enable your Amiga as ususal and Seek & Destroy will now start 
 loading. Any additional disks will be requested as and when they are needed
 during the game.
 Once you have viewed the title, credits and high score table screens, press
 fire on your joystick or press left mouse button to go to the options screen.
 

 OPTIONS


 This screen allows you to choose from five options. To select an option, use
 your joystick to move the pointer up and down the list and press fire to
 either activate the option or cycle through the various possible settings.
 The current option will be highlighted White.

 
 START THE GAME

 
 Select this only when you are happy with the settings of all the subsequent
 options on this screen. This will then take you into the game and load in
 phase 1 of mission 01 - Operation Heatwave.

 
 CONTROLS


 Pressing fire will toggle between joystick or mouse control. Try out both to
 decide which one you prefer. The mouse or joysticks should be connected to
 the usual ports (consult your amiga manual for further information if
 required) (this is for lamers only !!!).


 SENSITIVITY


 This option only applies if you have chosen mouse control. Each time you
 press fire the option will cycle through three available settings - low (L),
 medium (M), and high (H). The default setting is low, which means that larger
 movements are required to make the helicopter respond. At the other end of
 the scale, the high setting only requires very small movements to move the 
 helicopter. As you would expect, medium offers a response level set between
 low and high. (say what ??? duh!)


 BRIEFINGS


 Turning off the mission briefings will speed up access to the missions.
 However, only experienced players who already know all of the mission
 objectives should use this option.


 ONE PLAYER / TWO PLAYER


 One player is the default setting. In two player mode, player two must use a
 joystick regardless of player one's controls. Player one will fly the
 helicopter as normal, but player two will be in charge of three of the
 weapons - the chain gun, plus interceptor and air to ground missiles.

 To change between the weapons, player two must press the number keys 1 - 3
 (either numbers from keypad or above the QWERTY keys). Note that in a one
 player game, the additional weapons are accessed via the function keys. See
 the 'Weapons & re-supplying' section for more details.

 Once you are happy with the options you have chosen, select Start Game to
 begin.

 1. APACHE HELICOPTER - This is the helicopter you control with your mouse
 or joystick.

 2. SCORE - This shows the current score. If you get enough points, you will
 appear on the high score table at the end.

 3. REMAINING HELICOPTERS - The helicopter symbol is followed by a number.
 This indicates the number of helicopters remaining and it includes the
 current one (so if the number is 01 you are currently using the last
 available helicopter).

 4. REMAINING FUEL - Fuel is used up gradually. The segmented bar starts off
 full (each segment is orange). It reduces from right to left and will
 eventually run out. You have to locate and collect more fuel else the 
 helicopter will fall out of the sky and crash!

 5. SHIELDS - The shield will help to protect the helicopter from enemy
 missiles and bullets. A full shield is represented by white segments.These
 will change to yellow as they deplete from right to left. You can replenish
 the shield by locating and collecting shield boosters.

 6. MOUSE CENTERING - If player one is using a mouse, this diagram will help
 them to re-centre the helicopter. A small dot will indicate the current
 direction the mouse is moving within the square.

 7. SCANNER - This is essential for finding your mission objectives and
 returning to base when you have succeeded. Your helicopter is always located
 in the centre of the scanner. Both your helicopter and your home base are
 represented in black. Stationary enemy targets are represented in yellow and
 moving targets are red.

 8. CURRENT WEAPON - This shows your current weapon, and the amount left where 
 applicable. In a two player game this will alternate between player one and
 player two's current weapon selections.

 Other features found on the main screen include the enemy buildings, tanks,
 soldiers, helicopters etc.


 WEAPONS


 You can change weapons by pressing function keys 1 - 6. The weapons available
 at the start are as follows.

 F1 - CHAIN GUN

 This weapon has unlimited ammuntion. In a one player game, player one flies
 and shoots by pressing fire in the direction you are flying. In a two player
 game, player two can shoot this gun in any direction by using their joystick
 and pressing fire.

 F2 - ROCKET

 The Folding Fin Aerial Rocket (FFAR) is a general purpose missile for both
 air to air and air to ground attack. As it has no internal guidance system,
 care must be taken with the aim before firing. This is the default weapon
 when you start your mission.

 F3 - INTERCEPTOR

 This missile is strictly an air to air weapon. When selected, a yellow
 diamond will appear in front of the helicopter. It will home in when an
 airborn target is available and pressing fire will then launch the AIM.

 F4 - AIR TO GROUND MISSILE

 A red square will appear in front of the helicopter. Whenever player one
 flies close to any ground targets (soldiers, vehicles, buildings) the square
 will lock onto the nearest target. Player two should then press fire to
 launch the AGM. It will then home in on the target.

 F5 - AIR STRIKE

 Air based support is available by request during a mission. Calling for an
 air strike will send out an alert and in seconds support fighters will
 deliver an air strike at the location where the player requested it. Pilots
 are warned to vacate the area as soon as possible after requesting a strike
 to avoid being annihilated themselves.

 F6 - NAPALM

 Napalm bombs are dropped on ground based enemy targets in the direction the
 helicopter is flying. As with other non-guided weapons, careful attention 
 should be made to aiming before the bombs are used.

 NB: In a two player game, player two selects the chain gun with the number 1
 key, the air to air missiles with number 2, and the air to ground missiles
 with number 3. These weapons cannot be selected (via the function keys) or 
 fired by player one during a two player game.

 
 RE-SUPPLYING


 During most missions you will hear and see warnings related to lack of fuel,
 ammunition or low shields. If you hear a warning siren have a look at your 
 shield status in the bottom left corner of the main screen or your fuel in
 the top right. When you run out of missiles you will hear  "re-load" when you
 try firing.

 To re-supply your shields or fuel you must locate the relevant pick ups.
 These are left around after a building or other enemy target has been
 destroyed. You must come to a stop directly above the pick up and then press
 the curser down key on the keyboard to reduce the helicopters altitude. When
 it is low enough you will hear a click and appropriate snatch of speech (if
 your machine has enough memory). Press the cursor up key to return to the
 normal altitude where it is safe to start flying around again.

 Note that landing back at your home base at the end of a mission also
 requires you to press the cursor down key to reduce altitude when hovering
 over the landing pad.

 To re-load a weapon, you only have to fly over the missiles to pick them up.
 You DON'T have to lower your altitude first.


 ADDITIONAL CONTROLS


 SPACEBAR (Mapping System)

 A helpful map can be brought up on screen by pressing the spacebar at any
 point during a mission. The yellow arrow represents the current position and 
 direction of the helicopter. The 'base' and 'target' markings of your home
 base and enemy targets.

 F9 (Auto Zoom On Scanner)

 The scanner can increase its magnification and zoom in when an enemy target
 comes into range. F9 toggles the auto zoom feature on and off.

 P (Pause)

 Pressing P will pause the game action. To resume press P again. You can also
 abort the current game and return to the start by pressing the escape (ESC)
 key whilst the game is paused.

    
 M (Mouse Control) OR J (Joystick Control)

 If you change your mind during a mission about your preferred control device,
 just press M or J to switch to mouse or joystick control.



                         MISSION HINTS AND TIPS
   
 +++ TOP SECRET +++ TOP SECRET +++ TOP SECRET +++ TOP SECRET +++ TOP SECRET+++  
  
    
 Beginners are recommended to try playing with a joystick first to learn how
 to control the Apache.

 If a large enemy helicopter threat is apparent when you take off, pilots are 
 encouraged to take out a minimum of 60% before continuing with their mission
 objectives. This should avoid constant air attacks whilst you attempt to
 execute the mission successfully.

 Ensure that you don't move forwards or backwards when landing, else you might
 explode on contact with terra firma (ground, twonk!). If you attempt a
 landing in enemy territory, take out any airborn threats first.

 Don't waste AGM's on buildings or soldiers. Try and conserve weapons if you
 can, and remember to collect weapon ammunition when it becomes available.

 Solitary tanks and rocket launchers are best attacked from a distance with
 AGM's. Fly in a wide radius around the targets keeping them just on screen,
 then launch your missiles.

 If you encounter multiple tanks lined up in a row, fly away and select napalm
 bombs then fly in a straight line towards them and drop the bombs.

 Rescuing P.O.W. missions requires extra care. You must take out all the enemy
 installations or aircraft before attempting to land and collect the hostages
 if you are to avoid being attacked whilst you are vulnerable on the ground.

 Keep moving to out manoeuvere enemy missiles. Remember that a still target is
 a sitting target!
