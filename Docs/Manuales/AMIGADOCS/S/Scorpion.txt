you have picked a certain something up!

Hints on Playing the Game.

Whatever you do don't go swimming, the water seems to be pretty polluted.
Not at all good for your health.

Experiment with the Pick-ups as each has its own good and/or bad points.

Use 'big jump' to reach otherwise unobtainable heights and also to jump
down from walkways to the ground below.

Avoid taking damage. Trying to walk through things is a costly way of
killing them.

And remember: Practice makes perfect, almost!
