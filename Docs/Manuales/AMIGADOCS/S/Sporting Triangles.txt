NOTES ON THE VARIOUS ROUNDS

STANDARD QUESTION ROUND

THERE ARE 4 STANDARD QUESTION ROUNDS,EACH PLAYER,IN TURN,IS ASKED A 
QUESTION OF THE CATEGORY DECIDED BY THE COLOUR SEGMENT ON WHICH THE PUCK
RESTS.THE PLAYER HAS THE INDICATED AMOUNT OF TIME TO THINK OF AN ANSWER AND
SAY IT OUT LOUD TO THE OTHER PLAYERS.IF THE ANSWER IS UNKNOWN OR CANNOT BE
GUESSED THEN THE "GIVE UP" OPTION CAN BE USED.THIS DISPLAYS THE CORRECT
ANSWER AND THEN MOVES PLAY TO THE NEXT PLAYER.
THE "ANSWER" OPTION DISPLAYS THE CORRECT ANSWER AND ASKS THE PLAYER "WERE
YOU CORRECT"?.HE SHOULD SELECT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE BY MOVING THE 
HIGHLIGHT BAR OVER THE "YES" OR "NO" BOXES AND PRESSING FIRE.TWO POINTS ARE
AWARDED FOR A CORRECT ANSWER.PLAY RETURNS TO THE CONTESTANT SCREEN FOR THE
NEXT PLAYER TO TAKE HIS TURN.

THE HIT FOR SIX QUESTION ROUND

IN THIS ROUND THE PLAYER IS PRESENTED WITH A CLUE TO THE IDENTITY OF A 
SPORTING PERSONALITY,EVENT OR VENUE AND A SELECTION OF 7 POSSIBLE ANSWERS
SIX POINTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR A CORRECT ANSWER ON THE FIRST GUESS.IF THE
GUESS IS INCORRECT OR THE TIME ALLOWED IS EXCEEDED THEN A NEW CLUE IS SHOWN
AND THE POSSIBLE SCORE DECREASES BY ONE POINT.THIS PROCESS CONTINUES UNTIL
THE PLAYER ANSWERS CORRECTLY OR THE SCORE VALUE BECOMES ZERO.ON A CORRECT
ANSWER THE POINTS SCORED ARE ADDED TO THE PLAYERS SCORE AND PLAY MOVES ON 
TO THE NEXT PLAYER.IN THE CASE OF ZERO POINTS VALUE,THE CORRECT ANSWER IS
SHOWN AND THEN PLAY PASSES TO THE NEXT PLAYER.

THE JIGSAW PICTURE QUESTION ROUND

THIS ROUND WORKS IN A SIMILAR WAY TO THE HIT FOR SIX QUESTION ROUND.IT HAS
THE SAME SEVEN POSSIBLE ANSWERS BUT THIS TIME THE CLUE IS A JIGSAW PICTURE
IN THE UPPER RIGHT PORTION OF THE SCREEN.THE PICTURE IS UNCOVERED STEP BY
STEP,THE AVAILABLE POINTS DECREASING BY ONE WITH EACH GUESS.WE HAVE ALSO
INCLUDED ONE WRITTEN CLUE PER PICTURE,AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN.

THE BUZZER KEYS ONLY BECOME ACTIVE WHEN THE QUESTION IS COMPLETELY SHOWN ON
THE SCREEN.WHEN A BUZZER IS PRESSED THE 2 OTHER BUZZERS ARE DISABLED,THE
SOUND OF THAT BUZZER IS HEARD AND THE SCREEN BORDER FLASHES IN THE COLOUR
OF THE PLAYER WHO HAS BUZZED.THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS THEN DISPLAYED
AND THE CONTESTANT IS ASKED "WERE YOU CORRECT?" ANSWERING "YES" ADDS TWO
POINTS TO HIS SCORE AND THE NEXT QUESTION IS ASKED.HOWEVER,A WRONG ANSWER
LEADS TO THE DEDUCTION OF ONE POINT,TO DISCOURAGE GUESSING!.THERE ARE SIX
QUICK FIRE QUESTIONS IN THE ROUND.
