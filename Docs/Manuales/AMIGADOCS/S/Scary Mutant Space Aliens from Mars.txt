NOTE: Another ooooold doc, but as its our policy to bring you as many
docs as possible, here it is!


SECTION 1 - SETTING UP

CREATING A SAVE DISK
To create a save disk, you must first format a disk that you will use
to save your position.  Name your disk 'SMSA Save Disk'.

SECTION 2 - HOW TO PLAY

PLAYING THE GAME
After loading the game, you will see the SMSA play screen.  It
consists of the following: a picture area, a zone box, an object
picture box, the quick-click command area and the command and text
window.

THE PICTURE AREA
This box contains a picture of your current location.  Since some of
the rooms look like others, you might see some of the pictures more
than once.  But don't worry...there are enough pictures on disk to
keep you entertained.

THE ZONE BOX
This box displays a picture that you are currently on, with the name
under it.

THE SMSA BOX
A picture of the last moveable object that you have examined appears
in this box.

THE QUICK-CLICK COMMAND AREA
Each square here performs the command labelled.  Simply click on the
appropriate box.

THE COMMAND WINDOW
The command window is where the commands you type appear.  This is
also where the room and object descriptions are displayed when you
enter a room or examine an object.  Valid commands can be broken up
into the following four groups:

DIRECTION COMMANDS
Direction commands allow you to move from one location to another.
These commands are based on a compass systen.  Valid commands are
NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHEAST and
SOUTHWEST.
Examples of direction commands:  WEST, GO NORTH, NE

INVENTORY COMMANDS
In order to play the game you must pick up, use and drop objects.
To pick up an object, the command is: TAKE <object> where <object> is
the name of the object you want to pick up.  Alternatively you may use
the words: GET, GRAB, PICK UP, OBTAIN, PROCURE, etc.  You may also
TAKE ALL or TAKE ALL EXCEPT/BUT <object>.

To drop an object, you type: DROP <object> where <object> is the name
of the object you want to drop.  Alternatively, you may use the words:
DISCARD, CHUCK, DUMP, JETTISON, etc.  You may also DROP ALL or DROP
ALL EXCEPT/BUT <object>.

Some examples of objects in the game are:  BELT, GREEN CARD, CHEESE,
TRANSMITTER.
Examples of inventory control commands:  TAKE BOOK, DROP THE BOTTLE OF
WINE, GET ALL EXCEPT THE GREEN CARD, DROP EVERYTHING BUT THE EGG.

OBJECT CONTROL COMMANDS
Not only is it important to get and drop objects, but it's also
important to use them at the right place and time.  An example of a
place to use an object would be a locked door.  You must unlock it
before you can enter.  You would type:  UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY.  Not all
the objects have uses in the game.  Other examples of object control
commands include:  PUT LASER GUN IN BOX, ATTACK ALIEN WITH BAT, GIVE
ROPE TO BUG, GET BAGEL WITH ROPE.

OTHER COMMANDS
Like object control commands, these are for you to figure out, and are
not directly related to moveable objects.
Examples of other commands include:  JUMP TO BRANCH, KICK THE WALL,
OPEN THE DOOR, SCREAM, MOVE THE DESK, TOUCH THE WALL.

SECTION 3 - SPECIAL COMMANDS
The following is a list of special commands and features.

COMMAND HISTORY
Pressing the UP or DOWN ARROW KEYS will cycle through the last 20
commands that you entered.  Once the command appears, it may be
editted before pressing RETURN.  The DELETE key deletes the character
to the left of the cursor and pressing BACKSPACE will erase the
command line.

EXAMINE
Use the examine command to get a description of most things.  You can
examine objects, people, landmarks, etc.  The syntax is:  EXAMINE
<object>.  Other examples include:  LOOK UNDER THE BED, VIEW IN THE
DRAWER.

HELP
Each planet has a helpful paragraph of text that gives you hints on
what to do on the planet.  To view this text, type HELP or press the
HELP key.

INSTANT MAPS
Maps may be purchased during the game.  Once you have a map, you can
see it by pressing F8.  If you have more than one map, press F8 again
to see the next one.  Press ESC to exit.

INVENTORY
To check what you're carrying, type:  INVENTORY or I or INV.

LOAD
To load a game that you have saved on your SMSA Save Disk, type:
LOAD.
The program will then prompt you for which saved game (1-5) to load.

MACROS
A macro is a user-defined command that can be executed with the push
of a button.  For example, instead of typing in ATTACK THE ALIEN WITH
THE BAT, you could assign it to a function key and simply press the
key to perform the command.  The f2, F3, F4 and F5 function keys may
be assigned a macro.  To assign a macro type: Fn 'macro' where n is
the function key number (2, 3, 4 or 5) and macro is the command that
you want to assign.  Examples:  F3 'take all', F4 'kill the monster',
F2 'examine the table with the magnifying glass'.  Remember: to use
the macros, simply press the corresponding function key.  To see a
list of your current macros, type: MACROS.

There are six predefined macros: F1 - Quit, F6 - Load, F7 - Save, F8 -
Map Mode, F9 - Edit Last Command, F10 - Repeat Last Command.

READ
Read gives you information on an object if there is some writing on
it.  To read something, type: READ <object>.

RESTART
To begin a game over (and lose your current position), type: RESTART.

ROOM
The ROOM command gives you important information about the current
room including any objects that can be taken.  To get a room
description, type: ROOM or (L).  Note that you will get an automatic
room description when you enter a room.

SAVE
To save your current 'position' to the disk, type: SAVE.  You will
then be prompted for the save file number (1-5).

QUIT
If you want to end the game, type: QUIT.  You may want to save your
position first so that you can continue later.

WAIT
Until you type a command, no time passes in the game (except when
fighting).  If you want time to pass in the game, type: WAIT or (Z).
For example, if you are waiting for an alien to enter the room so that
you can tickle him until he chants the secret password, you can keep
on typing WAIT until he enters the room.

SOUND
You may turn off the sound by entering: SOUND OFF.  To turn it back
on, type: SOUND ON.
