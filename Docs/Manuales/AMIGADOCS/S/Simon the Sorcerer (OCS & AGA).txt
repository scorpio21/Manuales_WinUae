                          SIMON THE SORCERER
                          ------------------


 IT OFTEN HELPS TO START WITH SOME SORT OF INTRODUCTION SO HERE WE GO....

 IT ALL STARTED ON SIMON 12TH BIRTHDAY.HE WAS HAVING A PARTY,NOT A MODERN RAVE
 PARTY THAT TWELVE YEAR OLDS HAVE THESE DAYS,BUT A QUIET ENGLISH AFFAIR WITH
 JELLY AND ICE CREAM,PIN-THE-TAIL ON GRANDMA AND A MAGICIAN CALLED MARVELO.
 HE SPECIALISED IN PULLING RABBITS OUT OF A HAT AND MAKING SEEMINGLY ENDLESS
 QUANTITIES OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED HANKERCHIEFS APPEAR FROM HIS MOUTH.

 SIMON TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN POINTING OUT HOW THESE TRICKS WERE DONE TO
 HIS AWESTRUCK FRIENDS AND EVENTUALLY HAD TO BE PHYSICALLY RESTRAINED BY
 HIS FATHER TO PREVENT MARVELO THE MAGICIAN BECOMING MARVELO THE MURDERER

 WHEN BLOWING OUT THE CANDLES TIME CAME,SIMON WISHED FOR A GAME BOY FROM 
 HIS GRANDPARENTS AND FOR HIS OLDER BROTHER TO FALL DOWN SOMETHING PRETTY
 DEEP AND SPIKY.HE WAS SURPRISED WHEN LATER WHEN THE DOORBELL RANG ,AND
 UPON OPENING THE DOOR,HE DISCOVERED A SMALL,SCRUFFY LOOKING DOG WRAPPED
 UP IN SHINY PAPER.AFTER UNSUCCESSFULLY TRYING TO INSTALL HIS FRIENDS 
 TETRIS CART,HE WAS PERSUADED THAT IT WAS NOT A GAMEBOY AFTER ALL.

 THE DOG(HE CALLED IT CHIPPY)HAD A STRANGE BOOK IN ITS MOUTH THAT NO-ONE 
 COUOLD READ.HIS PARENTS HADN`T THE HEART TO TELL THE YOUNG BOY THAT THE 
 DOG WASN`T FOR HIM AND THAT THEY HAD NO IDEA FROM WHERE OR WHOM IT CAME.
 IT WAS,AFTER ALL,A NEW TARGET FOR THE BOYISH SADISM FOUND IN ALL YOUNG-
 STERS.THE FAMILY ADOPTED THE DOG AND THE BOOK WAS DUMPED IN THE LOFT 
 AND LONG FORGOTTEN.......
  

  UNTIL NOW....



                           GETTING STARTED

                          ------------

 THERE ARE TWO MAIN METHODS OF INSTALLING GAMES ONTO YOUR HARD-DRIVE

 METHOD 1
 --------

 THIS METHOD IS REALLY CLEVER AND FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW A LOT ABOUT COMPUTERS
 WE SUGGEST YOU TRY THIS WAY FIRST

 1.REMOVE THE DISKS FROM THE BOX AND FLUSH THEM DOWN THE TOILET

 2.GO AND BUY ANOTHER SET OF DISKS AND REPEAT THE PROCESS


 METHOD 2
 --------

 THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS.ANYONE WITH 
 HALF A BRAIN CELL SHOULD`NT REALLY NEED TO READ THIS SECTION.

 1.START UP YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM.THIS OFTEN INVOLVES PRESSING A BIG BUTTON
   LABELLED ~ON~

 2.INSERT DISK 1 INTO YOUR FLOPPYDRIVE. NB THERE MAYBE DIFFICULT HAND-TO-EYE 
   CO-ORDINATION REQUIRED HERE.

                      ---------------

                            ?

                    STARTING TO PLAY
                    ----------------


 THE FIRST THING YOU DHOULD OBSERVE HAPPENING IS CREDITS.WE RECOMMEND THAT
 YOU WATCH THESE AS THEY MAY PROVIDE VITAL CLUES TO THE GAME(THAT JUST COZ
 WE`RE A BUNCH OF ATTENTION SEEKERS).IF YOU CAN`T BEAR TO WATCH ALL OF THEM

 LEFT OFF.THIS CAN ALSO BE SKIPPED BY PRESSING THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.


                    PLAYING THE GAME
                    ----------------

 AS WILL BECOME APPARENT,YOUR GOAL IS TO RESCUE CALYPSO THE WIZARD WHO HAS
 THE POWER TO RETURN YOU TO YOUR OWN WORLD.YOU TAKE ON THE ROLE OF SIMON,A
 YOUNG BOY SUDDENLY THRUST INTO THE UNIVERSE OF FANTASY AND MAGIC...
  THAT`S ABOUT ALL WE CAN SAY WITHOUT RUINING THE STORY.DON`T WORRY,ALL
 THINGS WILL BECOME CLEAR TO YOU AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE GAME.


                    MOVING ABOUT
                    ------------

 IN ORDER TO MOVE SIMON ABOUT THE SCREEN YOU SIMPLY NEED TO HIGHLIGHT TO 
 HIGH LIGHT THE ~WALK TO~ ICON BY CLICKING ON IT AND THEN CLICKING ON THE
 AREA YOU WISH SIMON TO MOVE TO.HE WILL WALK TO THAT POINT AS NEAR AS HE
 GET TO IT.


                    SCREEN
                    ------

 ~WALK TO~ IS THE DEFAULT VERB WHEN THE PIONTER IS OVER THE SCREEN WINDOW
 ~LOOK AT~ IS THE DEFAULT VERB WHEN THE PIONTER IS OVER THE INVENTORY.

                   
                    DOING STUFF
                    -----------

 ALL THE OTHER VERBS ENABLE SIMON TO PERFORM A VARIETY OF ACTIONS ON A VARIETY
 OF THINGS.

 YOU WILL NOTICE THAT BY MOVING THE POINTER OVER CERTAIN AREAS THE SCREEN ID
 BAR WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS UNDER THE POINTER.SIMON CAN ONLY INTERACT WITH
 OBJECTS IDENTIFIED BY THE POINTER

 FORM THE ACTION.EITHER SOMETHING HAPPENS OR SIMON TELLS YOU THE RESULT OF
 HIS  ACTIONS.

 OBJECTS USUALLY NEEDS TO BE SELECTED IN ORDER TO MAKE SOMETING HAPPEN.AFTER
 THE FIRST OBJECT IS SELECTED A PROMPTING INSTRUCTION (IN THIS CASE
 ~WITH WHAT~) APPEARS IN THE ID BAR.ANOTHER OBJECT MUST THEN BE SELECTED TO
 COMPLETE THE ACTION

 CLICKING TWICE ON THE AREA OF THE SCREEN WITH NO OBJECTS IN OR COMPLETEING
 AN ACTION RETURNS YOU TO THE DEFAULT VERB.

                      -----------------

 SOME TIMES SIMON HAS TO INITIATE A CONVERSATION BY HIMSELF AND SOMETIMES
 PEOPLE START TALKING TO HIM.WHAT THE PERSON SAYS APPEARS ON THE SCREEN NEXT
 TO THEM.SIMON IS USUALLY GIVEN A LIST OF CHOICES ,OVERLAYING THE VERB BANK
 AND IVENTORY WITH THE LIST TO CHOOSE FROM.

 THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES UNTIL A PERSON SELECTS A QUIT OPTION FROM THE 
 QUIT OPTION E.G "I DON`T REALLY WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ANY MORE"

 INCLUDED A MAP FEATURE IN THE GAME.SIMON RECIEVES A MAGIC MAP AT THE START
 OF THE GAME.THIS CAN BE USED TO JUMP INSTANTLY TO THE IMPORTANT POINTS IN
 THE GAME ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED.

 CERTAIN KEY LOCATIONS.BY SELECTING THE~USE ~MAP IT IS POSSIBLE TO JUMP
 STRAIGHT TO THESE LOCATIONS BY CLICKING ON THEM WITH THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON
 IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT THE MAP THEN CLICK ON THE COMPASS IN THE
 BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF THE GAME.

 TRAPPED THEN THE MAP CANNOT BE USED AS A MEANS OF ESCAPE.
