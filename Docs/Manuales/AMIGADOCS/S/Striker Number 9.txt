  In Striker, you are a young, gifted player who is desperately trying
 to impress the coach to get into the team.  You'll get three exercises
 each week-do well and you'll earn your chances.  Each chance is an
 opportunity to score a goal in the match.

 LOADING
 -------

  Joystick connection: Amiga - attach the joystick to the mouse port.

  Insert disk and turn your computer on.  On the title screen move the
 joystick left/right to select the language.  Press fire when ready.
 Press "S" on the keyboard to toggle between music and sound effects
 (Atari ST only).

 4 CONE DASH
 -----------

  Run around the outside of the cones as fast as you can.  Time counts
 but don't knock any over! Moving the joystick quickly left/right moves
 the player faster, press fire to turn.

 6 CONE WEAVE
 ------------

  Run in and out of the cones after the ball, don't knock them over and
 keep an eye on the clock.  Player moves in the direction of the joystick.

 HURDLES
 -------

  Left/right on the joystick moves the player.  Fire to jump, speed is 
 the key.

 STAMINA
 -------

  Two laps of the track.  Left/right on the joystick, the faster you go
 the quicker you'll run.

 FREE KICKS
 ----------

  A cross appears on the screen.  Alter the swerve marker by moving the
 joystick up or down, then press fire when you think you've got it right.
 You must score a certain number of goals before your time runs out.

 OVERHEAD KICKS
 --------------

  Another player will lob the ball to you; move left/right with the 
 joystick and then press fire to launch into a spectacular overhead kick
 {or you will fall flat on your face?}.  You must score a certain number
 of goals before time runs out.

 BALL CONTROL
 ------------

  Move the joystick left/right to move your player to head the ball 
 forward.  Keep bouncing the ball on your head and move across the track
 How quickly can you do it? Can you keep it up?

 MAN-ON
 ------

  Left/right on the joystick to "rotate" your player - press fire to pass
 the ball.  The players around you will slowly move towards you.  If you
 pass the ball to them, they will stop for a while.  Keep them away - if a
 player reaches you, your time is up!

 PASSING
 -------

  You must pass the ball to other players while someone attempts to 
 tackle you.  Your player will move in the direction of the joystick
 press fire to pass the ball to your colleague.  He will pass the ball
 back to you automatically.  How long can you keep possession?

 PENALTIES
 ---------

  10 attempts - how many will you score? Press fire and a target site
 appears.  Move it using the joystick, press fire and the ball will be
 blasted at the goal.  Watch out! The longer you take to aim your shot
 the less power it will have.

 THROW INS
 ---------

  How far can you throw the ball? Left/right on the joystick gets you
 moving faster, hold fire down when you reach the white line, a gauge
 will appear showing the angle of flight.  Release the fire button to
 hurtle the ball forward.  Your best throw {from three attempts} counts!

 VOLLEY PRACTISE
 ---------------

  A player will throw the ball at you.  You must get to the ball and
 blast it into the net.  A certain number of goals must be scored in a
 limited amount of time.  Your player moves in the direction of the
 joystick, press fire to shoot!

 CHANCE
 ------

  At the end of the week you can try your luck at the chance screen 
 you might win some chances.

 THE MATCH
 ---------

  If you have at least one chance, the match will start.  Your player
 will move in the direction of the joystick.  If you have the ball,
 hold fire and a guage/arrow will appear.  Move the joystick to direct
 your shot.  Release fire to whack the ball.  If you don't have the ball 
 - but a fellow team mate does - press fire to call for the ball to be
 passed to you!  Each "chance" lasts until the ball is cleared from the
 danger area, is saved or a goal is scored!
