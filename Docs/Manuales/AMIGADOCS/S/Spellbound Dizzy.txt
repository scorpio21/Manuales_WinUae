			    SPELLBOUND DIZZY

 Trouble's afoot for Dizzy in his BIGGEST and BEST adventure yet! Meet
 Dizzy's magical chum THEO, the wizard with a plethora of POWERFUL POTIONS!
 Dozy,Dylan,Dora,Daisy and Grand Dizzy - the YOLK FOLK are all here too and
 they're in HOT WATER this time! Help Dizzy SAVE THIER SHEELS before they
 end up HARD BOILED!

 Dizzy's been visiting his local friendly Wizard Theo. Now Theo, who may a
 dab hand in the waving of wands area, is not much cop at filing-things-away
 neatly department and he's left his book of really powerful spells lying
 around his laboratory. What's more, the book has been left open at the page
 headed "A really, Really Powerful Spell" (That shouldnt be read out loud).
 Whether Dizzy actually read the heading is not known yet but - yikes! -he
 said the speel and its caused a catastrophe: Dizzy's spirited all his Yolk
 Folk friends and Wizard Theo into the underworld! Cripes! There's only one
 course of action open to the brave little hero: read the spell again and
 spirit himself into the underworld to save his rotund group of pals!
