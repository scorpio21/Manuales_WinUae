THE DOX TO SPECIAL FORCES
      
INTRODUCTION
------------
SPECIAL FORCES IS A STRATEGIC ACTION PACKED SIMULATION OF A MODERN ELITE
RAPID DEPLOYMENT COMBAT FORCE. YOU CONTROL A PLATOON OF 8 PICKED SOLDIERS
AS THEY ARE SENT TO TROUBLE SPOTS AROUND THE GLOBE, WITH THE BRIEF TO GO
IN, SECURE OBJECTIVES, AND LEAVE THE AREA AS QUICKLY AND EFEECIENTLY AS
POSSIBLE.
EACH MISSION INVOLVES UP TO 4 TEAM MEMBERS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO
ALWAYS HAVE CONTROL OF EVERY MAN, SO YOUR SQUAD PERFORM THEIR OWN TASKS TO
THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY, WHILE YOU TAKEOVER DIRECT CONTROL AT ANY
CRICTICAL TIME. BUT YOUR ALSO ISSUING ORDERS ON A STRATEGIC LEVEL,
ANALYSING THE DATA AVAILABLE AND UTILISING EACH MEMBERS PERSONAL RESOURCES.
NO HOLDS BARRED SHOOT-EM-UPS ARE FOR WOULD BE RAMBOS. THIS IS REALITY, AND
YOUR MOST POWERFUL WEAPON IS YOUR BRAIN.
YOUR TACTICS SPELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VICTORY AND DEFEAT. YOU`R THE
GUIDING SPIRIT OF THE SPECIAL FORCES MISSION TROOP.

FORT BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINA
--------------------------
ALREADY 97% AT 1000 HOURS. 20 PACES AWAY FROM THE 12 FOOT WALL. ITS A HEAT
HAZED BLUR.
THE 8 MEN EYE EACH OTHER. THE GLINT OF THE CUTTING EDGE IN THEIR EYES. AN
1800 METRE HOP SKIP JUMP OVER 28 OBSTACLES FOR THESE GUYS;DEFEAT IS NOT AN
OPTION.
AN AURA OF COMPETENCE SHROUDS THE GLISTENING BODIES, AN AURA THAT IS AT
ONCE RE-ASSURING AND INTIMADATING, EMANATING FROM MEN WHO WILL ADMIT NO
LIMITS AS TO WHAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE. THEY KNOW THEY ARE THE ELITE FORCES OF
THEIR COUNTRY.
HAND PICKED FROM VARIOUS REGIMENTS, THESE MEN ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED TO
FORM THEIR OWN SPECIAL FORCE, AN ELITE TEAM PREPARED TO ACT AT A MOMENTS
NOTICE; SUCCESS BOOSTS POLITICIANS STANDINGS; DISCOVERY PROMPTS DENIALS.
THE SLOW CRESCENDO OF A BLACKHAWK APPROACHING AT LOW LEVEL SENDS ADRENALIN
COURSING THROUGH THE VIENS. IT TURNS  HEADS, THE DRY THROAT ANTICIAPTION
SPREADING AS EACH MAN THINKS AHEAD. 12 HOURS FROM NOW I`LL BE BRIEFED,
ARMED AND READY.
OUTNUMBERED AND ALONE......

LOADING
-------
THE TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT HAS COMPLETE INFO ABOUT LOADING THE SIMULATION AND
INSTALLATION ONTO HD.
ONCE THE SIMULATION HAS LOADED YOU WILL BE ASKED TO INSERT A ROSTER
DISK.(FORMAT A BLANK DISK AND CALL IT ROSTER..)

CONTROLLING THE SIM
-------------------
THE CONTROL INTERFACE ON GENERAL SELECTION/MISSION PLANNING SCREENS WILL
SUPPORT MOUSE,JOYSTICK AND KEYBOARD INPUT. WHEN A MISSION HAS BEGUN YOU
MUST USE A KOYSTICK OR KEYBOARD TO CONTROL YOUR TEAM MEMBERS.

THE MAIN MENU
-------------
WHEN THE SIMULATION HAS LOADED THE MAIN MENU WILL APPEAR, ON THE LEFT HAND
SIDE OF THE SCREEN ARE 5 OPTIONS, WHICH WILL NOT BECOME SELECTABLE UNTIL
YOU HAVE INSERTED A ROSTER DISK AND PRESSED FIRE.
ANY BLANK, FORMATTED DISK CAN BE USED AS A ROSTER DISK, FOR FURTHER DETAILS
OF HOW TO PREPARE A ROSTER DISK, CONSULT THE TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT.

THE ROSTER SCREEN
-----------------
YOU CAN CREATE AND KEEP RECORDS OF UP TO 8 DIFFERENT SPECIAL FORCES
SQUADRONS ON EACH ROSTER DISK. EACH SQUADRON IS GIVEN A NAME, AND ONE WILL
BE HIGHLIGHTED WHEN THE ROSTER SCREEN APPEARS. SELECT THE SQUADRON YOU WISH
TO CONTROL, OR CREATE A NEW ONE IF ITS YOUR FIRST RUN OF THE GAME.
TO CREATE A NEW SQUADRON PRESS THE `ESC` KEY ON THE KEYBOARD. THE
HIGHLIGHTED NAME WILL BE ERASED AND YOU SHOULD ENTER YOUR NEW SQUADRONS
NAME VIA THE KEYBOARD. PRESS THE `RETURN KEY` OR FIRE BUTTON TO ACCEPT THE
NEW SQUADRON. BE WARNED, CREATEING A NEW SQUADRON AUTOMATICALLY ERASES THE
PREVIOUS SQUADRONS RECORD.
THE ROSTER SCREEN ALSO HOWS THE POINTS AWARDED TO EACH SQUADRON, THE
MISSIONS ATTEMPTED, AND ITS CURRENT
STATUS(ACT-ACTIVE,RTD-RETIRED,MIA-MISSING IN ACTION). IF YOU HAVE CREATED
MORE THAN ONE ROSTER DISK, AND WISH TO SWITCH BETWEEN THEM VIA THE ROSTER
SCREEN YOU MAY DO SO BY INSERTING THE NEW ROSTER DISK, MOVING THE ON SCREEN
POINTER OVER THE `DIR` ICON ON THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN AND THEN PRESSING
THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON OR JOYSTICK FIRE BUTTON(THIS METHOD OF SELECTING AN
OPTION IS REFERRED TO THROUGH OUT THIS HANDBOOK AS `CLICKING ON` AN ICON.
THE SQUADRON NAMES STORED ON THE NEW ROSTER WILL APPEAR. WHEN YOU HAVE
SELECTED A SQUADRON YOU WILL BE RETURNED TO THE MAIN MENU. THE FIRST ICON
ON THE LEFT OF THE SCREEN, `DIFF LEVEL` WILL NO LONGER BE SHADED. THIS
SHOWS THAT IT IS NOW SELECTABLE. YOU SHOULD CLICK ON IT TO SET THE LEVEL
DIFFICULTY AT WHICH YOU WISH TO ATTEMPT YOUR FIRST MISSION.

OPERATION DIFFICULTY LEVEL
--------------------------
YOU MUST SELECT 1 OF 4 LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY FOR THE OPERATION YOU ARE GOING
TO UNDERTAKE.
LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY ARE SELECTED BY CLICKING ON 1 OF THE 4 ICONS AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. CONSCRIPT-REGULAR-VETERAN OR ELITE. THE LEVEL
CURRENTLY SELECTED IS HIGHLIGHTED. YOU MAY VIEW THE TEXT REPRODUCED BELOW
BY MOVING THE ON SCREEN POINTER VIA MOUSE,JOYSTICK OR KEYBOARD OVER ONE OF
THE OPTIONS. CLICK ON AN OPTION TO SELECT IT.

CONSCRIPT
---------
YOUR MEN HAVE ADVANCED EQUIPMENT. YOUR MISSION TARGETS ARE MAPPED WHEN YOU
BEGIN THE MISSION, THE ENEMY ARE POORLY TRAINED AND BADLY MOTIVATED. THEY
REACT SLOWLY AND INEFFECIENTLY. THEY ALSO HAVE OLDER,OBSOLETE WEAPONS.

REGULAR
-------
YOUR TEAM HAVE MODERN WEAPONS. YOUR MISSION OBJECTIVES ARE GIVEN USING A
GRID REFERENCE SYSTEM. THE ENEMY ARE PROPERLY TRAINED BUT INEXPERIENCED.
THEY HAVE GOOD REACTIONS IN TRAINING BUT MAY HESITATE OR FREEZE IN COMBAT.
THEY HAVE OLDER EQUIPMENT BUT ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT.

VETERAN
-------
YOUR MEN HAVE ADVANCED EQUIPMENT. MISSION OBJECTIVES ARE NOT SHOWN ON YOUR
MAPS. THE ENEMY ARE EXPERIENCED SOLDIERS. MANY HAVE FOUGHT IN PREVIOUS
CAMPAIGNS AND ARE HIGHLY SKILLED. THEY HAVE MODERN EQUIPMENT AND KNOW HOW
TO USE IT.

ELITE
-----
YOUR MEN HAVE ADVANCED EQUIPMENT. MISSION OBJECTIVES ARE NOT SHOWN ON YOUR
MAPS. MISSIONS MUST OFTEN BE COMPLETED WITHIN SET TIME LIMITS. THE ENEMY
ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED AND EXPERIENCED COMBAT VETERANS. ARMED WITH LATEST
WEAPONS, THEY WONT HESITATE TO SHOOT!.

FIRST TIME SQUADRON LEADERS ARE ADVISED TO SELECT CONSCRIPT LEVEL OF
DIFFICULTY FOR THEIR FIRST ASSIGNMENT AND REGULAR FOR THE SECOND. THIS
ALLOWS YOU TO DEVELOP A FEEL FOR THE SIMULATION GRADUALLY AND TO EXPERIENCE
COMBAT WITHOUT COMING UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE FROM THE ENEMY.
THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL SELECTED WILL HAVE A BEARING ON THE NUMBER OF POINTS
AND MEDALS AWARDED ON ITS COMPLETION, TO REFLECT THE DANGER YOU FACE AT
HIGHER LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY.
WHEN YOU HAVE SELECTED A DIFFICULTY LEVEL YOU WILL BE RETURNED TO THE MAIN
MENU. `DIFF LEVEL` WILL NOW BE SHADED, BUT `SELECT MISSION` WILL BE
SELECTABLE. YOU SHOULD DO SO.

SELECT MISSION
--------------
THE 16 MISSIONS AVAILABLE TO EACH SQUADRON ARE SET IN 1 OF 4 AREAS OF THE
WORLD. DEFINED BY THE CLIMATE FOUND IN THAT AREA;TROPICS,DESERT,ARTIC OR
TEMPERATE.
EACH MISSION VARIES GREATLY ACCORDING TO THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY SELECTED.
AS DOES THE AMOUNT OF INFO GIVEN TO YOU AT THE MISSION BRIEFING STAGE.
SQUADRONS MAY PERFORM 1 MISSION AT, FOR EXAMPLE, `REGULAR` DIFFICULTY LEVEL
AND ANOTHER AT `ELITE`, BUT CANNOT REPEAT A PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED AT A
DIFFERENT LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY. IF A SQUADRON MEMBER BECOMES `MIA` DURING A
MISSION YOU MAY ALSO ATTEMPT A RESCUE AT A LATER STAGE.
ALTHOUGH EACH OF THE 16 MISSIONS CAN BE PERFORMED IN ANY ORDER, YOU WILL
FIND THE SIMULATION AT ITS MOST REWARDING IF THE MISSIONS ARE PLAYED
THROUGH FROM THE FIRST TROPICS MISSION TO THE FINAL TEMPERATE MISSION IN
SEQUENCE.
IF YOU DO SO A STORY WILL UNFOLD AND YOUR ACTIONS DURING A MISSION WILL
AFFECT THE BRIEFING GIVEN FOR A SUBSEQUENT MISSION.
THE MISSION BRIEFING DOCUMENTS ARE FILED IN 1 OF THE 4 DRAWERS YOU WILL SEE
ON THE `MISSION SELECT` SCREEN.

TO OPEN A DRAWER SIMPLY CLICK ON IT. CLICK ON THE FRONT OF A DRAWER AGAIN
TO CLOSE IT. 4 FILES WILL BE FOUND IN EACH DRAWER. TO SELECT A FILE,CLICK
ON IT. THE NAME OF THE MISSION WILL APPEAR.

TROPICS              ARTIC              DESERT             TEMPERATE

1. RESCUE A POW    1. SABOTAGE         1. EGG NESTS       1. FUEL DUMPS
2. CROP FIRE       2. ALPHA DOC`S      2. TANK BUSTING    2. SCUD BUSTING
3. DIARY 1991      3. SUB ATTACK       3. SUPPLY LINES    3. THE COMPLEX
4. ASSASSINATION   4. WIPE OUT         4. BLACK BOX       4. POWER CUT

WHEN THE MISSION APPEARS, CLICK ON IT AGAIN TO RECEIVE THE MISSION
BRIEFING.
THE MISSION BRIEFING USUALLY CONTAINS 3 PAGES OF NOTES. THE 1ST TWO
PAGES GIVE A WRITTEN BRIEF FOR THE MISSION, WHICH SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY,
AND THE 3RD PAGE SHOWS A RECCO PHOTOGRAPH OF THE MISSION AREA. WHEN YOU
START A MISSION YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE MAP WHICH YOU TAKE ITH YOU. TO
TURN THE PAGES IN THE MISSION BRIEFING FILE, CLICK ONE OF THE ARROWS IN THE
LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER OF EACH PAGE. ONE ARROW TURNS THE PAGES FORWARDS
AND THE OTHER BACKWARDS.

MISSION CONDITIONS
------------------
EACH MISSION HAS A CLEARLY DEFINED OBJECTIVE, WHICH MUST BE ACHIEVED FOR
SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE MISSION HOWEVER, IN SOME CASES MISSIONS MUST
BE COMPLETED ACCORDING TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, OR `RULES OF ENGAGEMENT`
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT OUTLINE THE RANGE OF ENEMY EQUIPMENT AND FORCES YOUR
TEAM CAN AND CANNOT DESTROY. SPECIAL FORCES SQUADS ARE OFTEN USED IN TIMES
OF CONVENTIONAL WARFARE, WHEN ONE STATE HAS DECLARED WAR ON ANOTHER, AND
KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAR IS PUBLIC.HOWEVER, THE ACTIVITIES OF AN ELITE SPECIAL
FORCES SQUADRON ARE MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN THEY ARE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT PUBLIC
KNOWLEDGE, ENABLING POLITICIANS TO DENY INVOLVEMENT IN THE AFFAIR.
DURING STEALTH MISSIONS, YOUR TEAM MUST TRY NOT TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES AT
ALL. WHEN AN OPERATION IS UNDERTAKEN IN THE CONTEXT OF A LIMITED OR
CONVENTIONAL WAR IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE ENEMY ARE NOT ABLE TO REPORT THAT
A SPECIFIC SPECIAL FORCES SQUADRON CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK.
SUCH KNOWLEDGE WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PREPARE FOR FUTURE ATTACKS. OFTEN YOU
WILL BE SOFTENING TARGETS TO PREPARE FOR THE MOVEMENT OF OTHER FORCES IN
THE AREA.

DURING A MISSION BRIEFING, NOTE WETHER A MISSION IS CONVENTIONAL, LIMITED
OR STEALTH ENGAGEMENT.

YOU WILL ALSO BE INFORMED AS TO WETHER YOUR `DROP POINTS` ARE `PRE-SET` OR
`SELECTABLE` YOU WILL BE TAKEN TO THE AREA OF OPERATIONS BY
HELICOPTER,WHICH WILL, IF DROP POINTS ARE SELECTABLE, DROP ANY MAN AT ANY
POINT DECIDED BY YOU. IF THEY ARE PRE-SET, THE MEN WILL BE DROPPED AT THE
PRE-SET POINT.

THE LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER OF EACH PAGE OF THE MISSION BRIEFING ARE 2
ICONS. `EXIT` AND `SELECT` WILL RETURN YOU TO THE MISSION SELECTION SCREEN
TO SELECT AN ALTERNATIVE MISSION. IF YOU ARE READY TO ATTEMPT THE MISSION
FOR WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN BRIEFED, CLICK ON `SELECT` YOU WILL BE RETURNED TO
THE MISSION SELECTION SCREEN. YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CLICK ON EXIT ICON TO
RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU.

THE SELECT MISSION OPTION WILL BE AVAILABLE, IF YOU WISH TO RETURN TO
SELECT AN ALTERNATIVE MISSION OR TO CHECK YOUR MISSION BRIEFING. IF YOU ARE
HAPPY WITH THE MISSION YOU HAVE SELECTED, CHOOSE THE `SELECT SQUAD` OPTION.

DURING A MISSION. A SQUAD MEMBERS FITNESS ALSO HAS A DIRECT BEARING ON THE
WEIGHT LOAD HE IS ABLE TO CARRY DURING A MISSION. THE FITTER HE IS, THE
MORE EQUIPMENT HE CAN TAKE WITH HIM.

WHEN THE SQUADRON SELECTION SCREEN FIRST APPEARS, SGT MIKE KOLOWSKYS
DETAILS WILL BE SHOWN ON THE CLIBOARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. HE IS
THE SOLDIER STANDING AT THE LEFT HAND EDGE OF THE UPPER SCREEN. CLICKING ON
ANOTHER ON OF THE 8 OPERATIVES WILL BRING HIM TO THE STANDING POSITION AND
WILL DISPLAY HIS DETAILS.
DURING A MISSION TEAM MEMBERS ARE KNOWN BY ONE OF FOUR
CODENAMES;-SHARK-TIGER-COBRA AND-EAGLE-. YOU ASSIGN A CODENAME TO EACH MAN
YOU WISH TO TAKE ON A MISSION. TO ASSIGN HIM A CODENAME, AND HENCE SELECT
HIM FOR THE FORTHCOMING MISSION, CLICK ON A CODENAME WHEN HIS DETAILS ARE
DISPLAYED(THE MAN STANDING UP) HE WILL BE TAGGED WITH THE FIRST LETTER OF
HIS ASSIGNED CODENAME AND IS NOW PART OF THE TEAM. HE WILL REMAIN STANDING
UP UNTIL DESELECTED.

WHEN YOU HAVE SELECTED ALL THE MEMBERS OF YOUR TEAM AND ASSIGNED THEM EACH
WITH A CODENAME. SELECT THE `EXIT` ICON TO RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU. THE
OPTION TO `SELECT WEAPONS` WILL NOW BE AVAILABLE.

TO THE LEFT OF THE SCREEN IS A MONITOR SHOWING VARIOUS DETAILS ABOUT YOUR
TEAM AND ICONS FOR YOU TO SELECT IN ARMING YOUR TEAM. TO THE RIGHT IS THE
KIT BAG TO BE LOADED. IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER OF THE SCREEN YOU WILL
SEE 4 SYMBOLS REPRESENTING THE CODENAMES OF YOUR TEAM MEMBERS
-COBRA-SHARK-TIGER-EAGLE.

BELOW EACH SYMBOL YOU WILL SEE THAT MAN`S MAXIMUM LOAD RATING, IN KILOS.
YOUR MEN CAN ONLY CARRY EQUIPMENT THAT WEIGHS EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN THEIR
MAXIMUM LOAD RATING. THIS IS DETERMINED BY PHYSICAL FITNESS.

AS YOU ASSIGN WEAPONS TO EACH MAN, THE WEIGHT HE IS TO CARRY WILL BE SHOWN
JUST BELOW HIS MAXIMUM LOAD RATING.

THERE ARE 8 DIFFERENT WEAPONS FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE, SHOWN ON THE RIGHT OF
THE SCREEN JUST ABOVE THE KIT BAG. THEY ARE...
BROWNING PISTOL\STERLING MACHINE PISTOL\LEE ENFIELD RIFLE\GRENADES\L.A.W
ROCKETS\LASER TARGET DESIGNATORS\REMOTE EXPLOSIVES AND AN ENGAGER MACHINE
RIFLE. THEY CAN BE BE COMBINED IN ANY ARANGEMENT FOR EACH TEAM MEMBER,
PROVIDED THAT HIS MAXIMUM LOAD RATING IS NOT EXCEEDED.

YOU CAN EITHER CHOOSE ONE OF THREE STANDARD AUTO-LOADS, OR ALTERNATIVELY
LOAD WITH YOUR OWN CUSTOMISED SELECTION OF WEAPONS.

SELECTING WEAPONS
-----------------
EACH TEAM MEMBER CAN CARRY 5 DIFFERENT WEAPONS FROM THE CHOSE OF THE ABOVE
8 NAMED..THEY CAN BE COBINED IN ANY ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH TEAM MEMBER,
PROVIDED THAT HIS MAXIMUM LOAD IS NOT EXCEEDED. THE WEAPONS EACH HAVE
DIFFERENT HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS, AND CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN USING
GRENADES OR L.A.W ROCKETS, AS THEY MUST BE DISCHARGED AT SUFFICIENT
DISTANCE FROM THE TARGET TO ALLOW THEM TO BECOME ACTIVE BEFORE REACHING THE
TARGET.
TO USE THE WEAPON CURRENTLY ACTIVE(AS SHOWN IN THE BOX AT THE BASE OF THE
SCREEN) PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON. IT WILL CAUSE FIRE ARMS TO BE DIS-CHARGED,
OR GRENADES TO BE THROWN, IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CROSS HAIRS. IF THE
CURRENT WEAPON IS EXPLOSIVES OR AN LTD IT WILL BE PRIMED AND SET AT THE
POINT WHICH THE TEAM MEMBER IS STANDING.
TO CHANGE THE WEAPON,PRESS [PLUS SIGN] OR [MINUS] KEYS. PLEASE NOTE THAT A
TEAM MEMBER MUST BE UNDER DIRECT CONTROL BEFORE YOU CAN CHANGE HIS ACTIVE
WEAPON. IF THE TEAM MEMBER IS UNDER COMPUTER CONTROL PRESSING
[PLUS\OR=MINUS] KEYS WILL HAVE NO EFFECT.
WHEN YOU PRESS THE [PLUS] OR [MINUS] KEYS THE WEAPONS WILL BECOME ACTIVE IN
TURN AS YOU STEP THROUGH THEM.HOWEVER, EACH WEAPON ALSO HAS A `HOT` KEY TO
ALLOW INSTANT ACCESS. THEY ARE;

H......SELECT HAND GUN
A......SELECT AUTOMATIC WEAPON/S
       [THIS WILL SELECT ANY AUTOMATIC WEAPON/S YOU HAVE CHOSEN. IF BOTH
       AUTOMATIC WEAPONS ARE BEING CARRIED THEN PRESSING THIS KEY A SECOND
       TIME WILL TOGGLE BETWEEN THEM.]
R......SELECT RIFLE/S
       [THIS WILL SELECT ANY RIFLE/S YOU HAVE CHOSEN. IF BOTH RIFLES ARE
       BEING CARRIED THEN PRESSING THIS KEY A SECOND TIME WILL TOGGLE
       BETWEEN THEM.]
X......SELECT EXPLOSIVES
D......SELECT L.T.D
L......SELECT L.A.W ROCKETS
G......SELECT GRENADES

AUTO LOADING
------------
TO AUTO-LOAD A SINGLE TEAM MEMBER HIGHLIGHT HIS CODENAME SYMBOL. THEN
SELECT ICONS `1` `2` OR `3` IMMEDIATELY TO THE RIGHT OF AUTO ARM. HE WILL
BE LOADED WITH YOUR CHOSEN STANDARD LOAD. TO AUTO LOAD THE NEXT TEAM MEMBER
REPEAT THE PROCESS. ALTERNATIVELY, ALL TEAM MEMBERS CAN BE IMMEDIATELY
AUTO-ARMED WITH THE SAME STANDARD LOAD BY SELECTING ICONS `1` `2` OR `3`
IMMEDIATELY RIGHT TO THE `ARM ALL` ICON.

CREATING YOUR OWN BAGS
----------------------
CLICK ON A WEAPON AND THE MOUSE POINTER TURNS INTO THE SELECTED WEAPON. A
DESCRIPTION OF THE WEAPON YOU HAVE PICKED UP WILL APPEAR IN THE MESSAGE
WINDOW. TAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF THE WEAPON WEIGHT. YOU CAN NOW INCREASE[PLUS
KEY] OR DECREASE [MINUS KEY] THE AMOUNT OF AMMO AS REQUIRED. BY CLICKING ON
THE KEYS AS MENTIONED. TAKE NOTE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF MAGAZINES/WEAPONS
ALLOWED FOR EACH WEAPON TYPE, AND THE WEIGHT OF THE AMMO. IF YOU EXCEED
EITHER THE NUMBER OF ROUNDS ALLOWED OR THE MAXIMUM LOAD RATING FOR THAT
OPERATIVE YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO PLACE THAT WEAPON IN THE KIT BAG. WHEN
YOU HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE THE SELECTED WEAPON AND HAVE SET THE AMOUNT OF
AMMO, SIMPLY MOVE THE WEAPON OVER AN EMPTY BAG SLOT AND CLICK.

YOU CAN ALSO ARM EACH TEAM MEMBER WITH THE SAME CUSTOM PICKED BAG. IF, FOR
EXAMPLE. YOU MAKE A BAG FOR SHARK, BY SELECTING THE NEXT TEAM MEMBER AND
THEN SELECTING `COPY BAG` OPTION, YOU MAY DUPLICATE SHARK`S BAG FOR THE
NEXT TEAM MEMBER.

THE `DEL` OPTION WILL DELETE EVERY ITEM IN THE CURRENT BAG DISPLAYED.

WHEN YOU HAVE ARMED EACH TEAM MEMBER WITH ITS REQUIRED WEAPONARY, YOU ARE
READY FOR COMBAT. SELECT THE `EXIT` ICON TO RETURN TO MAIN MENU.

SELECT `ENTER WARZONE` ICON.....THERE`S NO TURNING BACK!!!

ENTERING THE WARZONE
--------------------
YOUR TEAM ARE FLOWN TO THE MISSION AREA BY HELICOPTER. THE EXACT POINT AT
WHICH THEY ARE DROPPED OFF IS OFTEN YOUR DECISION, OCCASIONALLY DROP POINTS
ARE PRE-SET, WHEN ADVANCE INTELLIGENCE HAS INDICATED THAT ONLY LIMITED SAFE
DROP POINTS ARE AVAILABLE. PRE-SET DROP POINTS SHOULD ALWAYS AFFORD YOUR
TEAM A MARGIN OF SAFETY IN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES OF THE OPERATION.

SELECTING DROP-POINTS
---------------------
AS SOON AS YOU SELECT TO ENTER THE WARZONE YOU WILL VIEW THE MAP OF THE
AREA. AS EACH MAP IS DIFFERENT, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO GIVE YOU MORE THAN A
GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE ENVIROMENT YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER.. ENEMY REACTIONS
AND CONCENTRATIONS OF TROOPS VARY BY SCENARIO AND BY DIFFICULTY LEVEL
CHOSEN.

YOU ARE ADVISED TO SPEND SOME TIME STUDYING THE MAP OF THE AREA. THE
LIKLIHOOD OF SUCCESS OF A MISSION USUALLY DEPENDS ON CAREFULLY SELECTED
DROP-POINTS. YOUR DROP POINTS ARE ALSO USED AS PICK-UP POINTS. THE
HELICOPTER WILL RETURN TO A POINT AT WHICH IT PREVIOUSLY DROPPED OFF A TEAM
MEMBER,EXCEPT IN EXTRORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE BUILDINGS,ROADS,RIVERS AND ANY BRIDGES ON THE MAP ARE EASILY
IDENTIFIABLE. FOR EACH MISSION, A BRIEF OVERVIEW IS PROVIDED. YOU SHOULD OF
COURSE TAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF THE HINTS GIVEN DURING THE MISSION BRIEFING.
INSTALLATIONS DESCRIBED IN THE BRIEFING WILL USUALLY BE EASILY IDENTIFIABLE
FROM THAT DESCRIPTION.

YOU WILL BE INVITED TO SELECT THE DROP-POINT FOR YOUR FIRST TEAM MEMBER,
USUALLY `SHARK`. FIND THE CROSS HAIR POINTER ON THE MAP. YOU CAN MOVE THE
CROSSHAIRS VIA JOYSTICK(THE RECOMMENDED METHOD OF CONTROL) OR KEYBOARD. THE
CROSS HAIRS WILL MOVE QUICKER IF YOU PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON WHILE MOVING THE
JOYSTICK. AS THE CROSSHAIRS MOVE YOU WILL SEE RED DOTS APPEAR ON THE
SCREEN. THESE RED DOTS REPRESENT THE LAST KNOWN POSITION OF ENEMY TROOPS,
AS SEEN BY INFRA RED SPY SATELLITES MONITORING THE AREA.

WHEN CONBSIDERING THE BEST POSITION FOR DROP POINTS YOU SHOULD PAY SPECIAL
ATTENTION TO THE POSITION OF ENEMY TROOPS. EACH BUILDING OR INSTALLATION IS
LIKELY TO SHOW A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF TROOPS. TROOP BARRACKS, THE ENEMY
HQ, KEY JUNCTIONS SUCH AS BRIDGES OR CROSSROADS AND ANY SPECIFICALLY NAMED
TARGETS ARE LIKELY TO BE HEAVILY GUARDED. SELECTING DROP POINTS IMMEDIATELY
ADJACENT TO SUCH FEATURES IS UNWISE, PARTUCLARLY DURING STEALTH MISSIONS.

DO NOT ASSUME THAT YOUR TEAM MEMBERS NEED BE DROPPED NEAR EACH OTHER OR
NEAR SPECIFIC TARGETS. IF THE ENEMY ARE WELL DRILLED, YOU WILL ALMOST
CERTAINLY NEED TO CAUSE A DIVERSION AWAY FROM THE CENTRAL TARGET. OFTEN,
ONLY  ONE TEAM MEMBER WILL REACH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE. OTHERS WILL BE
DRAWING ATTENTION AWAY FROM HIM.

THE BEST OPTION IS OFTEN TO DROP TROOPS AWAY FROM INSTALLATIONS, BUT NEAR
ENOUGH TO REACH THE INSTALLATION QUICKLY, AND RETURN TO THE DROP POINT FOR
PICK-UP QUICKLY. DO NOT EXPECT YOUR MISSION TO BE EASY. YOU WILL LEARN THE
APPROPRIATE TACTICS FOR EACH MISSION AS YOU PLAY IT.

NOTE THAT EACH TEAM MEMBER NEED NOT RETURN TO HIS SPECIFIC DROP POINT TO BE
PICKED UP. ANY TEAM MEMBER CAN BE PICKED UP FROM ANY OTHER MEMBERS DROP
POINT.
TO SELECT A DROP POINT SIMPLY POSITION THE CROSS HAIR AND PRESS THE SPACE
BAR. EACH TEAM MEMBER CAN BE ASSIGNED A DIFFERENT DROP POINT, BUT YOUR TEAM
MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE WORKING IN PAIRS OR AS A TEAM OF FOUR. ALTHOUGH A
TEAM OF FOUR IS MORE EASILY SPOTTED BY THE ENEMY, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO
COVER EACH OTHER DURING THE MISSION.


WHEN YOU HAVE SELECTED A DROP-POINT FOR THE FIRST TEAM MEMBER, YOU WILL BE
INVITED TO REPEAT THE PROCESS FOR THE OTHERS. IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT
THE DROP POINT AFTER ASSIGNING IT, SIMPLY CONTINUE THROUGH THE CYCLE UNTIL
YOU RETURN TO THE TEAM MEMBER WHOSE DROP POINT YOU WISH TO CHANGE, AND THEN
RE-ASSIGN IT.
WHEN YOU ARE HAPPY WITH YOUR DROP POINTS PRESS `ESC` TO CONTINUE. YOUR VIEW
WILL CHANGE TO THE DETAILED WARZONE VIEW, CENTRED ON YOUR FIRST TEAM
MEMBER.

END.........
