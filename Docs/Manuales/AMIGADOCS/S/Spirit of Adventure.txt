                      SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE - CODES

  2 - 5 - 7 = World
  4 -14 - 7 = Continent
  3 - 2 -10 = Adoration
  1 - 4 -10 = Monastery
  2 - 6 -10 = Community
  1 -10 -11 = Important
  2 -12 -11 = Manual
  4 - 9 - 7 = Gods
  2 - 1 - 9 = Settle (I think??)


        You'll see how this works when you load the game. These aren't ALL
the codes, but since you get three tries, you'd be pretty stiff if you
don't get in.
