                               ================

                This game contains moving pattern backgrounds
              and short strobe sequences that could effect some
                                 epileptics.
         
              To turn the backgrounds off, press SPACEBAR at the

                           HOW TO PLAY SNAPPERAZZI
                           =======================

   Snap  the  three N.T.T's on section 1 of each planet, then go underground to
 collect  pizza  ingredients  or  Fizzy  Chewits  to get a spaceship.  When the
 screen  flashes white you have collected enough.  In space, snap the 3 N.T.T's
 again then find a Domino's Pizza hut or Fizzy Chewits shop to end the level.
 
 HEALTH :
 --------
         The N.T.T's do not like being snapped by the likes of Snapperazzi.  On
 each of the seven planet's, they have different weapons to fend off our hero -
 including  poison kisses, laser guns and corgi dogs.  Each time Snapperazzi is
 hit  he  loses  a  health point.  When all his health is gone he loses a life.
 Pick up first aid boxes for extra health points.
 
 FILM :
 ------
       Snapperazzi  cannot take photo's until he has film.  Each roll gives him
 five shots.
 
 CASH :
 ------
      If  Snazzi  runs  out of cash he loses a life, so keep snapping the minor
 celebs - silver and gold stars - as you play.  Pick up jewels and treasure for
 extra money.

 SHOPS AND BILLS :
 -----------------
                 Shops take Snazzi's money faster than he earns it so stay away
 from them.  Bills are the same, only worse.
 
 BADDIES :
 ---------
          As  well  as  the major N.T.T's, each planet is populated by baddies,
 which  take  away  money  or  health.   You can't snap baddies because they're
 nobodies, so just try to avoid them.
 
 MULTI PLAYER MODE :
 -------------------
                    Up  to  5  can  play  at  once.  Enter names and set a time
 limit.   Each  player will play for the full time limit, Even if they lose all
 their  lives  and  start  again.   Cash is banked at the end of each level.  A
 league table at the end shows who did best.
 
 MYSTERY SQUARES :
 -----------------
                 If  the  screen  flashes yellow, you have hit a mystery square
 and  earnt  R#R 2,000.   CASH...  At R#R 30,000 cash you get an extra life - and the
 screen flashes green.

                               HAPPY SNAPPING.

                        Newsman from the Planet Dirt!


                         Snazzi, who can jump and run
                          Wants a job upon The SUN,
                        But are you up to it, they say
                       We sell four million every day,
                        We only want the best and, son
                      You'll have to prove you're No 1.


                          The editor said listen up
                         Snapperazzi, you young pup,
                       I need a man who beats the rest
                  Who knows which treasure chests are best,
                        A snapper who will stay around
                   When guys in bow ties shake the ground,
                          Snapperazzi are you brave
                       Enough to snap beyond the grave?


                      And can you prove beyond all doubt
                       Extra terrestrial life's about,
                        And expose every kind of sting
                       And from a dungeon snap a king,
                      And can you make the readers gasp
                      By snapping fairies in the grass,
                        And make a smile from a frown
                     And prove the world is upside down?
                         Do all this, then come to me
                        And we'll talk about a salary.


                          To earn a Sun certificate
                         In photographic dirty work,
                          Snazz must roam the galaxy
                          And snap the major N.T.T's
                          Capture them on celluloid
                       On seven worlds across the void.


                        At the start of every planet,
                       He's got to snap three N.T.T's,
                        Then make his way underground
                   Where food and fizzy chewits are found,
                         Eat them up to reach the sky
                       Coz pizza bits can make you fly.


                    When you've scoffed enough you'll know
                      Then upwards you must boldly go, 
                    And you'll find, if you read the stars
                        Those N.T.T's again, in cars!


                         Snap the N.T.T's once more,
                       And find the end of level door,
                          On 1, 3, 5, and 7 you're,
                          Looking for a pizza store.
                         On 2, 4, 6, you have to pop,
                          Into a fizzy chewits shop.


                         As well as the main N.T.T's
                      There's hundred pound celebrities,
                      In terms of fame they're equal to
                       Ann Robinson on points of view.


                          Minor celebrities in gold
                    Are worth five hundred pound all told,
                        and represent the sort of fame
                Of that bloke on newsround, (whats his name).


                         Pick up first aid boxes for
                      Extra health points on your score,
                     Lose all your health and lose a life
                     Lose your lives and it's goodnight.


                        Touch the post, open the eye,
                      Start back there for another try.


                   Each roll of film gives you five shots,
                     So pick em up coz you'll need lot's.
                   Be sure to snap up jewels and treasure,
                       Cash gives Snapperazzi pleasure.


                       Touch a clock and it transforms
                          Into a bloke in a uniform,
                       The Pan - Galactic Police thingy
                   Can flatten Snazz because he's springy.
                       When flat, repeatedly press fire
                       To re-inflate snazz like a tyre.


                          Sadly Snazzi likes to dash
                         Into shops to blow his cash,
                     Stay out of them, you can't afford a
                        Compulsive shopping disorder.


                       Even worse than shops are bills
                      Avoid them like they make you ill,
                      'Coz they do.  And when your dosh 
                      Is gone you lose a life, oh gosh.


                      Our hero's well - equipped you see
                          To invade peoples privacy,
                     Those N.T.T's would hardly think E's
                     Creeping behind them on his pinkies,
                       Snazzi, as his friends know him,
                        Has a propeller when he swims.

                        Our hero would like to decamp!
                    The zombies look like horrid bleeders,
