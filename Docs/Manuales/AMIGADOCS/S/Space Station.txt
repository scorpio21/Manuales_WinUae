                          SPACE STATION DOCS

Welcome to Space Station, a multiple-level platform game that uses the AMIGA's
colour graphics to the full. The game features many devices to help you find
your way around the hugh complex. There are over 100 screens to explore, so
many hours of enjoyment can be had trying to complete your mission. Every
screen can be safely negotiated--so if you get stuck--think and then try again.
How far can you get through,and will you be able to escape?
Best wishes and good luck from The Paradox Programming Team.

connect a midi-compatable synthesiser to the midi-out port of the computer.
