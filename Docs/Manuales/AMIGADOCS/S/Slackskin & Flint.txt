THE GAME

Collect the number of eggs shown below your score at the top of the screen.

When  one player collects their quota of eggs the vortex will appear.  Jump
into the top of the vortex to travel to next level.

The  Player  who  triggers  the  Vortex  gets  to  keep  any power ups they
currently hold.

Contact  with enemies and spikes will result in the loss of a life, as will
falling though the bottom of the screen or staying underwater for too long,
(the player will flash blue when air is needed).

When  enemies  die  they leave behind various objects.  As players build up
their scores objects will also fall from the sky.
