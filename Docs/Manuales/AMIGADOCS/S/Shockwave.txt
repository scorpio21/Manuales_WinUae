BACKGROUND STORY:

THE YEAR IS 2167 AD. YOU COMMAND A PRISON OUTPOST WHICH ALSO ACTS AS A TERMINAL
FOR TRANSPORTING DANGEROUS AND SUBVERSIVE CRIMINALS TO A MAXIMUM SECURITY
PRISON COLONY, THE MOON. OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS YOU HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY
RESPONSIBLE OR SENDING OVER 1000 PEOPLE INTO EXILE.

TIME PASSED AND EVERYONE WAS HAPPY WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT, EXCEPT THE COLONIALS,
AS TIME WENT BY THEY INREASED IN STRENGHT AND RSOLVE, BUILDING SMALL SPACE
CRAFT IN ORDER TO WREAK THEIR REVENGE. SOON THEY WERE ABLE TO ATTACK AND
OVERCOME FOUR SPACE STATIONS ORBITING THE EARTH, FROM WHERE THEY PLANNED THEIR
FINAL ATTACK ON EARTH ITSELF.
THE AUTHORITIES, IN THEIR ULTIMATE WISDOM,DECIDED THE COLONIALS WOULD
DEFINATELY ATTACK ONE OF THE MAIN CITIES, AND THUS CONCENTRATED THEIR DEFENCE
AROUND THEM, INEVITABLY THE COLONIALS THOUGHT YOU WOULD MAKE AN IDEAL FIRST
TARGET.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SURVIVE FOR TEN ATTACK WAVES BEFORE REINFORCEMENTS
ARRIVE.....

MAIN CHOICE SCREEN:

MOVE THE CURSOR OVER THE DESIRED DOOR AND PRESS FIRE.
GOING TO THE CONTROL ROOM ENABLES YOU TO BUY FACILITIES FOR EACH OF YOUR
SECTORS, VIEW THE ENEMY MOVEMENTS AND CHOOSE WHICH SECTOR TO DEFEND.
GOING TO THE DOCKING BAY WILL SEND YOU OUT ON THE MISSION YOU HAVE CHOSEN IN
THE CONTROL ROOM, REMEMBER TO ARM YOUR CRAFT BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!
THE ARMOURY IS WERE YOU STOCK UP YOUR CRAFT WITH AS MANY WEAPONS AS YOU CAN
CARRY.

RIGHT IN FRONT OF YER IS A SCREEN DESCRIBED AS:

CONTROL SCREEN:SHOWN AS A RADAR TYPE SCREEN..WITH VARIOUS ATTACHMETS AROUND IT.

SECTOR 1) TOP RIGHT IS A MOUNTANIOUS AREA WHICH IS PROBALY THE MOST VALUABLE
SECTOR DUE TO THE VAST AMOUNTS OF PLATINUM BENEATH THE SURFACE. (THIS IS SHOWN
ON THE RADAR SCREEN---TOP RIGHT, AND NOT TOP RIGHT OF THE ACTUAL PICTURE.)OF
COURSE YOU NEED THE MINING UNITS TO GET TO THIS. ONCE YOU HAVE MINED THE
PLUTANIUM YOU EXPORT IT TO NEIGHBOURING SETTLEMENTS FOR CASH. EACH MINE BRINGS
IN 10,000 CREDITS EACH GAME TURN, WHICH YOU CAN THEN BUY MORE MINES, OIL RIGS,
FACTORIES OR ARMY UNITS.

SECTOR 2) TOP LEFT OF THE RADAR SCREEN(NOT THE ACTUAL PICTURE) WE HAVE THE SEA,
BENEATH WHICH IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF OIL, MINES ARENT SUCH A HOT IDEA HERE, SO I
GUESS IT WOULD BE BEST TO BUY UP OIL RIGS INSTEAD. EACH RIG SUPPLIES YOU WITH
ONE UNIT OF FUEL PER GAME TURN.

SECTOR 3) BOTTOM LEFT OF THE RADAR SCREEN (GET THE IDEA NOW)...IS THE FOREST
SECTOR. WHEN YOU BUY AN ARMY UNIT THEY WILL BE BASED WITHIN THIS SECTOR. YOUR
ARMIES ARE USED AS A FRONT LINE DEFENCE AGAINST THE ENEMY. THE MORE YOU HAVE,
THE SLOWER THE ENEMY ADVANCE.

SECTOR 4)BOTTOM RIGHT OF THE RADAR SCREEN..THE LANDSCAPE BECOMES BARREN,
RAPIDLY TURNING INTO DESERT. IN THIS AREA YOU BUILD YOUR FACTORYS WHICH DEVOLP
ALL YOUR WEAPON SYSTEMS, THE AMOUNT OF FACTORIES YOU HAVE DETERMINES THE SPEED
AT WHICH THE WEAPONS BECOME AVAILABLE. IF A SECTOR IS 50% OR MORE OVER-RUN BY
THE ENEMY YOU WILL START TO LOSE THE FACILITIES YOU HAVE DEVOLPED THERE.

BUILDING UP YOUR INCOME:

SECTOR 5) EACH GAME TURN YOU GAIN 10,000 CREDITS FOR EACH MINE YOU OWN. TO MOVE
FORWARD ONE GAME TURN CLICK ON WAIT. NOTICE THAT YOUR TOTAL CASH HAS INCREASED.

BUYING FACILITIES:

SECTOR 6)
IN EACH CORNER OF THE SCREEN ARE ILLUSTRATIONS,OF THE FACILITIES
CONTAINED IN EACH SECTOR, BY CLICKING ON ONE OF THESE A WINDOW APPEARS IN THE
CENTRE OF THE SCREEN DISPLAYING THE PRICE OF THE CORRESPONDING FACILITY. SIMPLY
CLICK IN THE WINDOW TO BUY, OR ON THE ILLUSTRATION TO EXIT. OBVIIOUSLY YOU NEED
ENOUGH CASH, THE TOTAL OF WHICH IS DISPLAYED AT THE TOP CENTRE OF THE SCREEN.
THE NUMBER IN THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER OF THE ILLUSTRATION SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF
FACILITIES YOU HAVE IN THAT SECTOR, AND THE PERCENTAGE NUMBER INDICATES HOW
OVER-RUN THAT SECTOR IS.

CHOOSING A SECTOR:

SECTOR 7) SHOWN AS A GAUGE TO THE LEFT OF THE ACTUAL SCREEN

BY CLICKING ON ONE OF THE SEGMENTS IN A SECTOR YOU WILL NOTICE A SHADED AREA
EXTENDS FROM THE CENTRE TO THE SELECTED SEGMENT. THE SECOND COLUMN (SECTOR 8
WHICH IS THE NEXT GAUGE TO SECTOR 7)SHOWS YOU HOW MUCH FUEL YOU WILL USE ON A
SELECTED MISSION.

WEAPON SCREEN:

THE SPEED AT WHICH YOUR FACTORIES DEVOLP WEAPONS DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF
FACTORIES YOU HAVE, IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE FACTORY IT WILL BE A LONG TIME BEFORE
THE SECOND WEAPON IS REVEALED. EVEN IF YOU HAVE MAXIMUM FACTORIES THIS DOES NOT
MEAN THAT ALL THE WEAPONS WILL APPEAR IMMEDIATELY, THEY STILL TAKE TIME TO
DEVOLP.
TO ARM YOUR SHIP SIMPLY CLICK ON THE WEAPON IN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE SCREEN.
YOU CAN ONLY CHOOSE ONE WEAPON OUT OF EACH COLMN, IE YOU CAN`T CARRY TWO TYPES
OF CANNON. THE LAST WEAPON YOU CLICK ON IN EACH COLMN IS THE ONE YOU WILL USE.

LASERS:

THE LASERS ARE THE STANDARD WEAPON WHICH CAN BE UPGRADED FROM THE TWIN LASER TO
THE POWERFUL `QUADRUPLE` LASER.

CANNON:

AN ALTERNATIVE TO USING LASERS. STARTING OFF WITH THE STANDARD CANNON, THE
HIGHER CALIBRE SHOT LAUNCH, UP TO ARMOUR PIERCING SHELLS.

ROCKETS:

DO NOT HOME IN ON A TARGET BUT ANYTHING THAT GETS IN THEIR WAY IS DESTROYED.
THEY ARE NOT VERY ACCURATE BUT ARE A HANDY AUXILIARY PIECE OF WEAPONARY.
STARTING WITH SINGLE ROCKETS, UPGRADEABLE TO DOUBLE ROCKETS AND THEN THE
`SHOCKWAVE`. THE `SHGOCKWAVE` EMITS SUB SONIC WAVES THAT SHAKE ANY CRAFT IN
THEIR PATH TO PIECES, ALTHOUGH POWERFUL, THE SHOCKWAVE HAS A DELAYED EFFECT.

MISSILES:

HOMING MISSILES WILL LOCK-IN ON ONE ENEMY CRAFT AND UNLESS OUT-MANOUVERED,
DESTRI IT, THE NEXT STEP UP, `SMART MISSILES` SPLIT UP AND HOME IN THREE
DIFFERENT ENEMY CRAFT, AND FINALLY THE `FLASH` BOMBS DESTROY ALL VISIBLE ENEMY
CRAFT. THOUGH NOT THEIR MISSILES.

BOMBS:

THE FIRST OF THE THREE TYPES OF BOMB ARE THE `SKIMMER BOMBS`, THESE ARE FIRED
IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR CROSS HAIRS BUT DROP DUE TO GRAVITY. THEY ARE IDEAL
AUXILLARY FIREPOWER WITH LASERS OR CANNON, SECOND IS THE `SMART BOMB` THIS
DESTROYS ALL VISIBLE ENEMIES AND MISSILES, FINALY WE HAVE THE `WARHEAD`. IF YOU
USE THIS WEAPON IT WILL DESTROY ALL FACILITIES YOU HAVE BUILT UP THERE. WITH
THIS IN MIND IT IS PROBALY BEST TO USE THIS AS A LAST RESORT.

THE ACCESSORIES, POSITIONED TO THE RIGHT OF THE SHIP ARE SHEILDS,INFRA RED AND
CLOCK. CLICKING ON SHEILDS WILL TOP UP YOUR SHEILDS TO SIX, BUT DONT USE THEM
AS IT TAKES TIME FOR YOUR FACTORIES TO REPLENISH THEM.
INFRA RED MAKES NIGHT FLYING EASIER, ENABLING YOU TO THE ENEMY MORE CLEARLY.
THE CLOAKING DEVICE STOPS THE ENEMY BEING ABLE TO `LOCK IN` ON YOUR CRAFT. AS
WITH LIFE, ALL GOOD THINGS COME TO AN END, SO BE READY TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION,
WHEN YOUR CLOAK RUNS OUT.
