AIM OF THE GAME.
The object of the game is to travel through the catacombs of ASTAROTH"S
DOMAIN until you come to the final showdown with the lady herself. to be
able to destroy ASTAROTH in the final battle you will have to collect all
nine of the "MIND POWERS"that are placed throughout the caves.Along the
way you will need these powers to help you destroy ASTAROTH"S minions and
her three guardians of the soul,these take form of a sphinx,a three headed
hydra and a maralith demon (a multiarmed,half-human,half-serpent
creature).If you do not defeat these creatures you will not have enough
power to even enter ASTAROTH"S chamber and therefore be unable to complete
the game.

Once you have battled through the cataciombs you can enter ASTAROTH"S
chamber to enter into a final "BATTLE OF THE MINDS".In this battle the aim
is to push back ASTAROTH"S mind power (depicted by a red energy beam) using
all the powers of your own mind (depicted as a blue energy beam) this is
achieved by waggling your joystick left and right as fast as possible.If
you have collected all nine mind powers throughout the game and you are
fast enough then it just possible to win.

If you win this battle then ASTAROTH is destroyed and banned to the
ethereal plane for eternity and victory is yours(in otherwords you win.)

found,they are held in large bell jars and are scattered in the far corners

creature their position above, they will drop onto it in order to try and
kill or devour it.

variety,they swoop down from the ceiling and attack ferociously with their

the mind and if they come into contact with ozymandias he will lose a large

certain rooms.when they sense the presence of a human being they realease a
vile secretion from their mouths upon the victim below.
