MINIMUM HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: Amiga 500, color monitor, joystick, 3 1/2
inch disk drive.

BACKUP INFORMATION: A special data format was used on the disks in order to
accommodate such a large program.  This means that you cannot make backup
copies of your master disks using standard disk copying procedures or
utilities.  You may order a set of backup disks directly from Miles
Computing, Inc.

Send $7.50 along with the order form included in this package to receive a
complete set of backup disks.  Then, in case something happens to your
originals, you will have the backups to use while the originals are being
repaired.  See the Warranty Information card for disk repair procedures.

STARTING AQUANAUT
When your AMiga requests the Workbench disk, insert Diskum Oneum in drive
df0:. The game will automatically load into memory.

	                    	1

THE MAP GRID
The game starts up with a question regarding the depth reading on the
enclosed map of Yendor Isles.  Find the longitude and latitude marking on
the edge of the map and locate the position in the map that the liens
cross.  Type the depth sounding at that location, then press Enter.  If
your selection is correct, you will then begin the game.  If an error has
been made, you will be given another chance.  After failing twice, you will
be returned to the desktop.

GAME PLAY
After the map grid screen and the introductory credits and animation, you
are given two choices:

	F1 START THE GAME
	F2 OPTIONS

Press the F1 key to begin the game.  You will then be presented with three
choices:

	F1 SECTION 1
	F2 SECTION 2
	F3 SECTION 3

At this time, you can only access Section 1, so press F1.  You will be
prompted to:
	
	INSERT DISC 1
	THEN PRESS F1

Since Disk 1 is currently in the drive, press F1 and the game will begin.

Section 1: ENCOUNTER AT SHARK REEF
The first section takes place in shallow water int he vicinity of the enemy
ship.  You use the joystick to swim in any of the eight directions (N, NE,
E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).  The joystick fire button is used to fire you weapon.
 The F3 key will pause the action.  Pressing the fire button resumes
action.  The information section of the window keeps track of game play
status.

    ! so be careful under there.                                    !
    !---------------------------------------------------------------!

Game points are scored by killing jellyfish, swordfish, sharks, or
exploding mines.  Each successful hit is worth 10 points.  You can get
additional lives by swimming close to the mermaids.  Supply tanks need to be
blown open to pick up their contents.  The inventory window shows your
active object.  In order to change the active object, use the F1 key to
move backwards through the list and F2 to move forward.  Pressing the SPACE
BAR activates the current object selected.  For instance, to use the
Booster, press the F1 and F2 keys to display the word BOOSTER in the
inventory window, then press the space bar and the booster will propel you
quickly though the water.

At the end of the first section, the screen will display an image of a disk
with the number 2 as a label.  Eject disk one and insert Disk 2 into the
drive, then press the fire button to continue.

Section 2: THE LABYRINTH OF THE ABYSS
Section 2 takes place in an underwater labyrinth.  Game play continues as
described above.  You must destroy or avoid all enemies and collect
necessary objects in order to continue.  If you die in this section, you
will be returned to the

	F1 START THE GAME
	F2 OPTIONS

screen.  You may now choose Options to save your current status to the
disk.  

	F1 LOAD ACCESS CODE
	F2 SAVE ACCESS CODE

Press F2 to save your access code.  Then, the next time you play the game,
you can begin in Section 2 by choosing OPTIONS, then pressing F1 at the
LOAD ACCESS CODE choice.  Then begin the game normally, but press F2 to
start the game when you reach the 
	
	F1 SECTION 1
	F2 SECTION 2
	F3 SECTION 3

screen.  You will be prompted to:

	INSERT DISC 2
	THEN PRESS F1

                                3

Insert Disk 2 in the drive, press F1 and the game will begin in Section 2. 
After completing Section 2, you may again save your access code in order to
go directly to Section 3 the next time you play.

Section 3: RESCUE FROM ATLANTIS
In this section, you are no longer in the water, but in a sunken city.  You
still control your movement with the joystick, and fire your weapon with
the fire button.  Joystick movement in SE and SW direction will cause you
to duck and roll.  The NE and NW direction raises your weapon to fire up at
an angle (this can only be done when you are stationary), while N will
allow you to enter doorways.  There are more objects to collect and use,
and some will allow you to travel to other hidden levels of the city. 
Strategy is very important (along with a really quick trigger finger).

Dear Bill:

I've must about finished gathering the data on our project.  You know, it
keeps getting more confusing all the time.  When you first let me in on
this I never expected it to grow to this magnitude.

First, a few quick facts.  I've got my first group ready for the dive. 
Mission is set for 0600 tomorrow.  Can't determine completion at this time.
 Too little data.

Now, you and I know this is just a preliminary report.  Lot of loose ends
yet, but for the record I'm just going to take it from the top.  Form the
first suspicions and reports.  God knows I could do a more thorough
treatise, but for field data it ain't half bad.

						Report of Octo 17, 23

The Aquanaut group has been brought together to research and act upon many
unexplained events occurring in the waters off of the Yendor Isles located
near the equator, about 300 miles off the coast of West Afrika.  The
islands themselves are sparsely inhabited by a native population consisting
of both farmers and fishermen.  Most of the activity has occurred in or
around an area known as Shark Reef (so-named for a large fin-shaped rock). 
This reef is densely populated with white sharks, swordfish, jellyfish, and
other smaller tropical fish.  This, alone, is enough to merit notice due to
the fact that the water in these areas is normally much too cold (the
current flows up from the South Atlantic and brings with it the lower
temperatures) to support tropical fish of these sort (though the swordfish
is found in cooler waters).

Of the unusual findings in the area, we count

1. A dead shark on the south beach of the westermost isle (13427 on our
map).  This shark was reported by a farmer, and we were able to do both a
visual inspection and, later, a full autopsy.  As

                                4

the shark has no natural enemies, and had suffered no more than the usual
number of minor injuries, it was not immediately obvious what it had died
of.  Also, dead sharks rarely, if ever, are beached after they die since
the others of his clan are more than ready to devour the helpless fish. 
The autopsy also found no normal cause of death.  And as the shark was
determined to be quite young, death of natural causes was ruled out. Upon
inspection of the bodily fluids, however, we came up with high traces of
iridium; a metal found primarily in meteorites.

                                5

2. Word War II era mine.  This was washed up on the shore of island 13425. 
We were able to defuse the mine and study it closely.  And though made of
identical structure and materials as those built back in the last century,
this had obviously been recently constructed.  The metal showed little sign
of age, and the weapon was fully operational.

3. Footprints.  Near the water by the mine discovery point, we found
footprints.  Unfortunately we were unable to make plaster casts in time
before the water washed them away.  Somewhat resembling a brown bear's
print shape, the depth of the impres-

                                6

sion would correspond to a body weight of approximately 250-280 pounds. 
There appeared to be a sticky residue at the base of the print, but again,
we were only able to get a quick photo before they were washed away.

Additional information has been gathered secondhand from other sources. 
Though not considered necessarily reliable, we include these 'eye witness
accounts' to complete our record, and will indeed follow up on the
information if further credence is lent to either of these accounts.

1. A Captain H. J. Austin has seen a half-woman, half-fish creature
swimming in the local waters.  He claims that he has seen such a "mermaid"
on several occasions, most often accompanied by one or more porpoises.  It
is very likely that it was also a porpoise, perhaps with some seaweed in
in its mouth.

2.  As you can see from the accompanying newspaper article, printed one
month ago in a London tabloid, a crew on a fishing boat trolling near here,
claim to have seen a large, orange, "fish man" caught in their nets.  Soon
thereafter, the water began to "boil" and the occupant "burned" a

large hole in the net and escaped.  Even though there is a consensus of
opinion, the fact that they later threw the net overboard severely
undermines their claim.

I have left the most devastating event for the last.  The most unusual, and
yet most inconceivable, report to date is that of a "falling sun" plunging
into the sea nearby.  Our Crete-based radar did pick up a faint signal over
the Mediterranean on the night in question, and continued to track the
craft

				9

while we scrambled 4 fighters out to investigate.  We had all 5 on screen
and were in constant radio contact with our men.  But suddenly, when they
were no more than a mile from the target, they completely dropped off the
screen.  Disappeared.  We have found no trace of them on the ground and no
reports from the area of any downed flights.  it is as if they were
disintegrated somehow.  We tracked the faint blip to this location, when it
dropped below our radar range.  Our best guess is that it plunged into the
sea.  We have been making aerial observations in the area, but have yet to
pick up an affirmative sighting.

As I said, we are set to send a squadron of our finest Aquanauts down in
the morning.  Don't know what we'll find, don't quite know what we're
looking for.  Say a prayer for us, Bill.

Sent the squad down at 0600.  Had readings on them for close to three
hours.  Appear to have entered some underground caves and the signals are
very faint.

I'm afraid we've lost at least some of the men.  Or they've gone so far
down we can't trace them.

Definitely lost some.  Have received their lifeforce zero readings.

Believe we only have one signal left to hang on to.  Hope he makes it back
alive.  Still don't quite know what we're up against.

Looks like our lead man is coming up.  Yes, he's come up.  Looks badly
injured, but alive.  Got to go now.  Will send details later.

				             Report of Octo 19, 23

Bill
What a night.  Stayed up with Rick T.  Had to throw together a quick
operating table and do what we could for him.  He wouldn't stop talking
about what he saw down there.  Must have known it was coming.  We lost him
early this morning.  We're transcribing the disks now through the
omniwriter.

				12

Number one priority is to step up our operation.  What we know now leads me
to believe that time is of the essence.  Sorting out the facts from the
delirium might take all day, but daybreak tomorrow we go for another
assault.  From what I can discern, we need a completely new approach.  I
mean, we were wiped out down there.  We just can't send in a group and
expect them to sneak by, the security is just too good.  I'm afraid we're
looking at sending in one man at a time.

We've got a good idea of the kind of supplies we need, and we can drop them
off so our miniaturization circuitry won't be overloaded.

And we just got a fix on their ship.

Well, I've obviously got to slow down and back up a bit.  I've heard so
much during the night that it's hard for me not to jump the gun here and
assume you know as much.  Wish I knew even more, but I expect that will
come.

Bottom line -- we're regrouping.  We've got a new set of Aquanauts flying
ot from the Afrikan coast.  Our flagship is still anchored about four miles
southeast of island 13425.  Our target (at least out initial target) is 0°
20 minutes due south of the 

				13

island.  And that initial target is, as far as we can tell, a partially
submerged alien ship.  We've got the aerial shot here of a shadow of
something floating on the surface (though the object itself is invisible
and heavily shielded by a supermagnetic field) and our analyses tell us it
is not from this planet.  It must have flown in, though it appears to be a
sea-based vessel now.  Not a hundred yards from this thing there are five
or six visible canisters that are showing a heavy radiation content.  The
canisters are slowly floating away from the ship which may be to our
advantage in the

				14

long run.  Now, comparing this thing's coordinates with the information
Rick gave us last night, it appears that this thing has moved right over
the top of the entrance to the labyrinth they discovered.  And it doesn't
look like we're going to be sneaking by this one; or want to.

I'll be sending some excerpts of the transcripts in just a bit, but the
overall scenario is pretty grim.  Once the squad made it past the ravenous
sharks and swordfish (not to mention the unusually poisonous jellyfish),
they discovered an underground labyrinth.  They could negotiate it okay,
but some of the passages were blocked so it was a good thing they had some
dynamite with them.  Seems the whole thing is loaded with deadly obstacles,
both living and natural.  And once Rick got through, it was even worse. 
Well, here's what seems to be the most important sections of the
transcripts.

Transcripts Octo 18-19, 23.  Rick Travers, Aquanaut.
Deceased Octo 19, 0527 hours

There's not much time.  There's not much time.  Listen very carefully to
what I say.  Get this down.  Get this all down.

There's a labyrinth of death down there.  It is filled with weird forms of
life.  Some of the

				15

strangest things you ever saw.  Couldn't be from this earth.  Each one a
deadly trap.  Bring dynamite.  Collect anything we may have dropped.  Could
help out.  Shoot to kill or stay out of the way.  Some of our guys emptied
their tanks when they knew they were goners.  Should be some extra air
trapped in there still.  You've got to make it all the way, but there isn't
enough room for even one man in some places.  The whole squad had no
chance.  Pretty soon we were shooting each other.

You've got to get further and further down.  Shoot to kill.  Surprise
attack.  Catch them asleep.  Outstare the green one.  Get out of there. 
Out of the mire and into the goop.

There's a city.  A city of gold.  A city below all this, buried for years
and years.  It's a prison.  It's alien infested.  Can't figure it out,
can't figure it.  I was shooting monsters.  They got Harley.  I got out.  I
came back.  Got to go down and find it all out.  Got to get them.  Shoot to
kill or stay out of the way.

That's it.  I'll give you more data on the plan of attack later today.  We
go in tomorrow.

					Report 2 of Octo 19, 23

We are faced with danger we never anticipated when we began this
investigation.  We count 23 presumed dead, one verified death.  Rick T. was
killed by the application of a very small amount of poison to his skin. 
This poison does not appear to be of Earth origin and is absorbed through
the skin.  If he had been exposed to more than a fraction of an ounce he
would have been killed immediately.  There is no known antidote, and it
does not appear that we can come up with one quickly enough to be of any
use.

We have formulated a plan of action to deal with this menace as effectively
as we know how.  It would appear from Rick's comments that the city below
the ocean was at one time on the surface.  And that it is functioning as a
prison of some kind.  Taking this at face value, we've got to save a
captive population from these aliens.  We are obviously dealing with a very
powerful enemy, and if the ship is any indication, they appear to be
escalating the battle.  If we don't stop them here, it will be much more
difficult to contain a mobile attack force.  Indeed, if we fail here, I
would recommend the use of a deep-sunk fusion bomb to clear the area of all

				17

life forms.  This would have to be done in a timely fashion; I suggest that
operations be commenced to ready this eventuality.

Granted, this would negatively impact the continent of Afrika, parts of the
Mediterranean and Southwest Europe immediately, as well as upset the
balance of the great Atlantic, but I believe no other remedy would be
effective against our enemy.  Even a severely damaged earth would be
preferable to subjugation by a vicious alien race.

Here is our PLAN OF ACTION:
First, we will be sending only one man down at a time.  He will carry with
him his backpack blaster, enough superdeep oxymix to get to the next
breatherstop, and miscellaneous tools.  Though we can miniaturize certain
components for backpack storage, only so many can be stored at one time. 
To end this, we will continue with drops of storage containers that can be
blasted open by the divers to retrieve the materials inside necessary to
continue the quest.

One severe drawback to this mission is the fact that we now have only one
fully operable backpack/breather system.  All others were lost with the
first squad.  Our workaround for this problem isn't optimum, but it is the
best we can do.

We have one board our main ship, stationed about

				18

3.5 miles (below line-of-sight horizon boundaries) east of the operation, a
few solar gliders, and the experimental supercold-radon matter transporter.
And though the powers of this particular machine are limited, we believe it
will be absolutely essential for the success of this project.

We plan to land our first man near the shore of the nearby island,
hopefully escaping detection.  From here he will be dropped off by
high-speed boat at a safe distance from the alien ship.  The first arm of
the attack centers around destroying that ship.  The main enemies during
this phase are the jellyfish, swordfish, and sharks.  Our weaponry should
make mincemeat out of anything making trouble.

In the event of the death of our active Aquanaut during the Shark Reef
stage, the closest solar glider will pull the body out of the water with an
electronic/magnetic life rod, quickly exchange equipment with the next
ready Aquanaut and launch him back into the water at the same coordinates. 
Both of our breatherstops will be submerged, so we can't refill the tanks
in the solar gliders, but with luck we will save time that way.

In the last leg of the first arm of the attack, the diver will get a plasma
bomb in order to blow up the ship.  Attaching it to the ship might be
tricky, and he may only get one chance, but hope-

				19

fully a weak spot will be found.  He will also have a transmitter for
detonation.  The plasma bomb blast should be somewhat contained, but the
immediate area will definitely contain fatal shock waves.  If he makes it
through, that should open the labyrinth.

Here it gets a little trickier.  We know we are up against some kind of
alien guardians in this maze of rocks.  Not only that, but the area is
rather unstable, so we can expect some rockslides and the possibility of
minor lava flow activity

				20

(after all, we are getting pretty deep at this point).  From what we could
decipher from Rick's report, some of the things down there can withstand
our blaster fire.  The best thing is to try to avoid them.  Most of them
appear to be organic creatures, though they are definitely of alien origin.
 With enough firepower, brains, and perseverance we just could make it
through.  But in case we lose a man here, the replacement is much more
delicate.

The plan is to bring in our ship to closer quarters (since their ship will
have been destroyed) and closely monitor the Aquanaut's coordinates with
the supercold-radon matter transporter so that in the event of a death, we
should be able to swap his body with that of a man in the transport chamber
up here.  Although this machine hasn't been tested in an environment such
as this, we feel it is our only hope.  We are praying that some of the
first squad cut down on the dangers and left us some usable oxymix down
there.  Because it's a long way to the city.

I'm afraid the date we have about the city itself is sketchy at best.  it
will also be the most difficult of the obstacles to pass.  Our strategy is
based on conjecture and interpretation.  We found an electronic item in
Rick T.'s pocket, though it was too late to ask about it.  Our computer
team has

				21

determined that it is made of Earth materials and appears to be some type
of interpreter.  We are now trying to disassemble the code in hopes of
discovering more information about the city and its defenses.

Our hope is that at least one of our Aquanauts makes it into the city. 
There he will have to defend himself and collect as much information he
can.  We will continue to use the transporter to keep going.  Hopefully,
the captive population can be found and freed, perhaps aiding in the
overthrow of the Alien rulers themselves.  There has to be a way to
penetrate the computer network to discover more information.  Our lack of
information will be our downfall.  From what we can ascertain, the enemy is
heavily armed.  One of our strategies is to use their own weapons against
them.

We are using the last remnants of our Aquanaut force.  May it be enough for
our success.  I look forward to writing the post-operation report, if you
know what I mean.

We must conserve our energy use in order to power the supercold-radon
matter transporter adequately.  To that end, we are entering a
communications blackout period.

Bill, pray for our success.  Pray hard.

CAUTION: The area around 10 degrees 58' S 9 degrees 48' E has not been
completely explored and has shown inconsistant sounding readings, sometimes
as high as 5500 fathoms.  This would make it the deepest known area in the
Atlantic.  Extreme caution should be used when diving in the area.
