IMPORTANT:  

ARENA NOW SUPPORTS JOYSTICK CONTROL.  THE EQUIVALENT OF THE ENERGY KEYS IS
RAPID LEFT AND RIGHT MOVEMENT OF THE JOYSTICK.  THE JUMP KEY IS THE FIRE
BUTTON.


STARTING A NEW PLAY:
IF YOU HAVE JUST LOADED ARENA AND THE SELECTION SCREEN HAS APPEARED, THEN YOU
ARE READY TO SELECT EITHER "NEW" (START A NEW GAME) OR "LOAD" ( LOAD A
PREVIOUSLY SAVED GAME) AS REQUIRED.  PLEASE REFER TO THE APPROPRIATE SECTION
OF THIS MANUAL FOR FURTHER GUIDANCE.  THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO VALID ICONS WHEN
THE GAME IS FIRST LOADED FORM DISK.  ON RETURNING FROM ONE OF THESE OPTIONS
YOU WILL NOW BE IN POSITION TO PROCEED AND SELECT YOUR FIRST EVENT.

HOW TO SELECT AN EVENT:
TO SELECT AN EVENT YOU SHOULD SIMPLY POINT THE MOUSE POINTER AT THE EVENT
REQUIRED AND DOUBLE CLICK EITHER OF THE MOUSE BUTTONS.  THE EVENTS WHICH HAVE
BEEN COMPLETED ARE EDGE WITH A RED RECTANGLE AND CANNOT BE SELECTED, THOSE
WHICH ARE AVAILBE TO COMPETE IN ARE EDGED IN A BLUE RECTANGLE.  YOU MAY SELECT
THE EVENTS IN ANY ORDER YOU WISH.

KEYBOARD TECHNIQUE:

THE KEYBOARD IS THE WAY TO PLAY ARENA.  THERE ARE THREE KEY GROUPS TO LEARN. 
SPEED OR STRENGHT CAN BE BUILT UP BY "POUNDING" TWO GROUPS OF KEYS
ALTERNATELY, FROM NOW ON REFERED TO AS THE "ENERGY KEYS".  THE GROUPS ARE ANY
OF [A],[S],[Z],[X], FOR THE LEFT SIDE AND ANY OF [;],['],[.],[/] FOR THE RIGHT
SIDE.  THE PROGRAMONLY COUNTS IN ALTERNATE PAIRS SO WATCH YOUR CO-ORDINATION
TO MAINTAIN A RIGHT-LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT SEQUENCE.  TO TRIGGER A JUMP, THROW, VAULT
OR PUT, THE SPACE BAR HAS TO BE HIT.  FROM HERE ON THE SPACE BAR WILL BE
REFERED TO AS THE "JUMP KEY".  THE RECORD LEVEL OF POWER AND/OR SPEED WILL BE
SHOWN ON THE POWER SLIDE IN THE TOP LEFT HAND CORNER OF ALL DISPLAYS.  IT WILL
SHOW LEVELS RANGING FROM 0 TO 9.
FEATURES GENERAL TO ALL EVENTS:

THERE ARE TWO ICONS IN THE TOP CORNER OF THE SCREEN, THEY ARE "QUIT EVENT" AND
"PAUSE".  IF YOU POSITION THE MOUSE POINTER IN THE "QUIT EVENT" ICON AND
DOUBLE CLICK EITHER MOUSE BUTTON, THE EVENT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED AND
ALL SCORES TO DATE FOR THAT EVENT WILL BE DELETED FROM THE SCORE TABLE.  ALL
THE COMPLETED EVENTS WILL RETAIN THEIR SCORES AND STATUS.  DOUBLE CLICKING THE
"PAUSE" ICON WILL SUSPEND THE EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM AND THE SCREEN WILL
FADE.  ARENA CAN BE RESTARED BY AGAIN POINTING INTO THE PAUSE ICON AND DOUBLE
CLICKING EITHER OF THE MOUSE BUTTONS.

TAKING YOUR TURN:

EACH PLAYER WILL TAKE HIS OF HER TURN IN ROTATION.  IF YOU HAVE BEEN
ELIMANATED FROM AN EVENT YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED ANOTHER TURN.  FOR EXAMPLE IF
YOU HAVE HAD THREE ATTEMPTS AT A HEIGHT IN THE HIGH JUMP AND FAILED EACH TIME,
YOU WILL BE ELIMANTED FROM THE EVENT AND THE POINTS SCORED FOR YOUR HIGHEST
CLEARANCE WILL BE RECORDED.  WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN YOUR NAME WILL BE
HIGHLIGHTED IN RED ON THE EVENT SCOREBOARD.  THE COMPUTER WILL ALERT YOU WITH
A BEEP.  YOU "TELL" THE COMPUTER YOU ARE READY TO START WITH A DOUBLE CLICK ON
EITHER MOUSE BUTTONS.  THE COMPUTER WILL REGISTER THIS WITH A BEEP AND A FLASH
OF THE SCREEN.  YOU ARE NOW COMPETING AND SHOULD BE READY ON THE KEYBOARED. 
UNTIL YOU HAVE DONE THIS THE DISPLAY REMAINS STATIC.

THE PROGRESS BAR:

WHERE AN EVENT REQUIRES THE PLAYER TO "RUN UP TO" THE JUMP OR THROW AREA, IT
IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SHOW THE WHOLE "RUN UP" DUE TO THE SCALE AND SIZE OF THE
GRAPHICS USED.  WE USE THE PROGRESS BAR TO PLOT THE PLAYER'S PROGRESS DOWN THE
RUNWAY TO THE TARGET AREA.  THIS APPEARS AT THE TOP LEFT OF EACH DISPLAY.  AS
THE PLAYER MOVES DOWN THE RUNWAY, A RED BAR WILL BE PLOTTED ABOVE THE SCALE
ICON.  THIS TARGET AREA IS MARKED BY A SMALL RED RECTANGLE.

THE OBJECT FLIGHT GRAPH:

WHEN WE ARE TRACKING AN OBJECT SUCH AS A JAVELIN OR SHOT THROUGH TH AIR, OR,
IN A JUMPING EVENT THE PLAYER, WE OFFER FEEDBACK ON THE PROGRESS OF THE OBJECT
ON THE OBJECT FLIGHT GRAPH.  THIS APPEARS ABOVE THE PROGRESS BAR AND WILL BE
"INKED IN" AS THE OBJECT OR PLAYER FLIES THROUGH THE AIR.

HUNDRED METRES:

EACH PLAYER WILL TAKE ONE TURN AND ONE TURN ONLY TO REGISTER A TIME.
YOU WILL START THIS EVENT ON THE BLOCKS.  YOU WILL MOVE AUTOMATICALLY INTO
"GET READY" POSITION ON THE INSRTRUCTIONS OF THE STARTER.  HE WILL RAISE THE
GUN READY  TO START THE EVENT AND RESET ALL STOP WATCHES.  AT THIS POINT, IF
YOU TOUCH THE KEYBOARD BEFORE THE STARTER'S GUN HAS GONE OFF YOU WILL RECORD A
FALSE START.  TWO FALSE STARTS AND YOU WILL BE ELMINATED FROM THE EVENT WITH
NO SCORE.  THE EVENT IS GEARED FOR MAXIMUM SPEED ON THE ENERGY KEYS THROUGHOUT
THE RUN.  YOU CAN DIVE FOR THE TAPE BY PRESSING THE JUMP KEY BUT BEWARE, IF
YOU DO THIS MORE THAT A FEW STRIDES FROM THE FINISH LINE YOU WILL ACTUALLY
LOSE MOMENTUM AND COME TO A HALT.  IT NEEDS TO BE TIMED ACCURATELY.
THE SCOREBOARD WILL SHOW YOUR TIME AND POINTS AWARDED AS SO:
NAME        PTS.          TIME
JAN         702           11.52

LONG JUMP, SHOT PUT AND JAVELIN:

IN EACH OF THESE EVENTS YOU WILL BE ALLOWED SIX ATTEMPTS TO RECORD A BEST
SCORE.  TURNS ARE AGAIN IN ROTATION ORDER WITH PLAY COMMENCING IN THE USUAL
WAY.  THE EVENT SCOREBOARD WILL BE DISPLAYED AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AS SO:
NAME        PTS.          DIST.      JUMPS TO GO
JOHN        604           5.98        4

THE SCOREBOARD WILL SHOW YOUR BEST ATTEMPT TO DATE, THE POINT VALUE FOR THAT
JUMP/THROW YOU HAVE REMAINING.

LONG JUMP:

YOU ARE ALLOWED 6 ATTEMPTS TO RECORD A GOOD JUMP.  YOU USE THE ENERGY KEYS TO
PICK UP SPEED ON THE RUNWAY.  AS YOU APPROACH THE BOARD KEEPING AN EYE ON THE
PROGRESS BAR, YOU NEED TO REACH MAXIMUM SPEED.  YOU MUST BE READY TO TIME YOUR
JUMP; THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE BOARD THE BETTER CHANCE YOU HAVE.  HITTING THE
JUMP KEY WILL MOVE YOU INTO JUMP SEQUENCE INSTANTLY AND SHOULD BE TIMED TO
COINCIDE WITH YOUR ARRIVAL ON THE BOARD.  DURING THE JUMP SEQUENCE THE USE OF
THE ENERGY KEYS NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED RIGHT UP TO THE POINT OF LANDING.  YOU
WILL LOSE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF DISTANCE IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP THE ENERGY
KEYS RATE THROUGH TO THE POINT WHERE YOU HIT THE SAND.

SHOT PUT:

AGAIN YOU WILL BE ALLOWED SIX ATTEMPTS TO RECORD A BEST.  YOU COMMENCE THIS
EVENT STANDING AT THE BACK OF THE CIRCLE.  YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP POWER AS YOU
GO INTO THE HOP POSITION, YOU THEN HOP ACROSS THE CIRCL.  AS YOU MOVE ACROSS
THE CIRCLE HITTING THE JUMP KEY STARTS THE PUT.  YOU NEED TO LEAVE THIS AS
LATE AS POSSIBLE TO RECORD THE MAXIMUM DISTANCE.  YOU CAN HOWEVER FOUL THE
CIRCLE BY TOUCHING THE EDGE.  DURING ALL THIS YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE RATE ON
THE ENERGY KEYS.  AS YOU START TO PUT THE SHOT ANOTHER STRIKE ON THE JUMP KEY
IS REQUIRED TO RELEASE THE SHOT, THIS SHOULD BE DONE TO COINCIDE WITH THE ARM
EXTENDING TO RELEASE THE SHOT, THE LATER YOU CAN LEAVE THIS THE MORE EFFECT IT
WILL HAVE.  ONCE THE SHOT IS IN FLIGHT THE ENERGY KEYS RATE HAS TO BE KEPT UP
TO MAINTAIN THE OPTIMUM FLIGHT PATH.

JAVELIN:

TURNS AND NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS AS ABOVE.  THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN THE JAVENLI
EVENT IS SPEED ON THE RUNWAY, USING THE ENERGY KEYS, AND STARTING THE THROW AT
THE LAST POSSIBLE SECOND USING THE JUMP KEY.  YOU HAVE TO AVOID THE FOWL THROW
BY NOT TRANSGRESSING THE END OF THE RUNWAY.  YOU MUST KEEP UP THE ENERGY KEYS
RATE DURING THE THROW.  AGAIN FURTHER DISTANCE MAY BE GAINDED BY "HELPING" THE
JAVELIN ALONG DURING ITS FLIGHT USING THE ENERGY KEYS.

HIGH JUMP AND POLE VAULT:

SET HEIGHT:

IN BOTH THESE EVENTS YOU WILL BE ALLOWED UP TO 6 TURNS AT NEW HEIGHTS CHOSEN
EACH TIME BY YOU. THIS IS DONE BY MEANS OF THE SET HEIGHT ICONS.  THIS WILL BE
OFFERED TO YOU AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND AFTER EACH SUCCESSFUL JUMP. 
SHOULD YOU FAIL AT A PARTICULAR HEIGHT YOU WILL BE ALLOWED THREE AND ONLY
THREE ATTEMPTS.  AFTER A FAIL YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE HEIGHT YOU ARE ATTEMPTING,
YOU MUST CLEAR YOUR CHOOSEN HEIGHT TO PROGRESS IN THE EVENT.  YOU MAY HOWEVER,
CHOOSE ANY HEIGHT YOU WISH FOR YOUR FIRST ATTEMPT.  WHEN YOU HAVE COMPLETED A
JUMP SUCCESSFULLYM YOU MAY INCREASE THE HEIGHT BY ANY AMOUNT YOU WISH AT YOUR
NEXT TURN.  THE BAR CAN BE MOVED UP AND DOWN BY POINTING AT THE UP AND DOWN
ARROWS AND PRESSING THE LEFT HAND MOUSE BUTTON.  WHEN THE HEIGHT IS AT THE
DESIRED LEVEL, POINT AT THE OK BUTTON AND PRESS THE LEFT HAND MOUSE BUTTON. 
YOU WILL NOW BE TAKEN TO START YOUR NEXT ATTEMPT.
THE SCOREBOARD WILL SHOW UNDER THE TRYS COLUMN THE ATTEMPTS YOU HAVE HAD AT A
PARTICULAR HEIGHT, INDICATING EACH ATTEMPT WITH A 9 FOR FAILURE TO CLEAR, AND
A 0 WHERE NO ATTEMPT HAS YET BEEN MADE.  THE POINTS VALUE REFLECTS THE BEST
CLEARANC TO DATE.  AS WITH ALL EVENTS THE SCOREBOARD WILL BE SHOWN AT THE HEAD
OF EACH SCREEN AND FOR THE HIGH JUMP AND POLE VAULT IT LOOKS LIKE.
NAME       PTS.    JUMPS       ATTEMPTS
                              MTRS     TRYS
COLIN      817      4          4.13     9 9 0

HIGHJUMP

AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED IN THE SET HEIGHT PARAGRAPH ABOVE, IF YOU FAIL AT A
PARTICULAR HEIGHT YOU REMAIN LOCKED IN TO THAT HEIGHT UNTIL YOU HAVE CLEARED
IT AND THEN YOU MAY PROGRESS TO A NEW HEIGHT, BUT REMEMBER, YOU ARE ONLY
ALLOWED THREE ATTEMPTS AT EACH HEIGHT AND THREE FAILURES MEANS YOU GO OUT OF
THE EVENT.
THE GAME PLAY OF THIS EVENT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE LONG JUMP.  YOU ACCELERATE
ACROSS THE RUNWAY KEEPING AN EYE ON THE PROGRESS BAR USING THE ENERGY KEYS. 
AS YOU APPROACH THE TAKE-OFF AREA YOU NEED TO ACCELERATE AND THEN TIME YOUR
JUMP TO TAKE PLACE BETWEEN THE LEFT AND RIGHT UPRIGHTS.  TO DO THIS, YOU NEED
TO START THE JUMP BY HITTING THE JUMP KEY A SHORT DISTANCE BEFORE THE JUMP
ITSELF, WE HELPED A LITTLE BY PROVIDING MARKERS ON THE RUNWAY.  YOU MUST
MAINTAIN YOUR KEY RATE ON THE ENERGY KEYS UNTIL YOU ARE WELL CLEAR OF THE BAR.

POLE VAULT:

THE POLE VAULT IS IDENTICAL TO THE HIGH JUMP EVENT IN THE NUMBER OF JUMPS,
NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS AND THE SETTING BAR HEIGHTS.  THERE ARE RUNWAY MARKERS
PROVIDED AND THE JUMP KEY SHOULD BE HIT TO START THE VAULT.  WE GIVE YOU
CONSIDERABLE LEE-WAY IN STARTION YOUR VAULT.  IF YOU TIME THE JUMP KEY
CORRECLTY THE COMPUTER WILL"FLASH" THE SCREEN AND THE VAULT WILL START AT THE
CORRECT LOCATION.  AS YOU REACH THE TOP OF YOUR FLIGHT UOU MUST HIT THE JUMP
KEY AGAIN T RELEASE THE POLE.  THE CRITICAL TECHNIQUES IN THE EVENT ARE TO
ACCELERATE INTO THE TAKE-OFF AREA AND THEN KEEP MOMENTUM UP ON THE ENERGY KEYS
UNTIL YOU HAVE CLEARED THE BAR AND YOU ARE DROPPING TO THE MAT.
