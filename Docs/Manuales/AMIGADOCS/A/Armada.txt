                ========================================





 PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS
 ====================
 After loading the program set up the game by answering the questions (for
 your first game you could try giving the answers in brackets):

 
 #   Do you want to restore a saved game: ( N )

     Answer Y only if you have played before and have saved off a partially
     completed game.

 #   Do you wish to play with the trial fleets: ( Y )

     Answer Y if you wish to get used to the game with small fleets on both
     sides. If this option is chosen only the four English squadrons
     commanded by Howard, Drake, Hawkins and Frobisher, and the Spanish
     squadrons commanded by Medina Sidonia, Flores, Mendoza and Moncada are
     used.

 #   Do you wish to play the two day sea battle: ( Y )

     Again, this is just to get used to your new role as Admiral of the
     fleet. The full game runs for five simulated days, this option reduces
     it to two days and one night.
 
 #   Do you want a human to play Lord Howard: ( Y for Howard, N for Medina
     Sidonia )

     Answering Y means that a human player will be expected to enter orders
     for the English Fleet, otherwise the computer will take control.
     Similarly for Medina Sidonia.
     The Armada is an excellent game for two humans to play, or alternatively
     both sides can be controlled by the computer, by way of a demonstration.

 #   View all the English signalling: ( Y for English, N for Spanish )

     If you are playing one of the admirals then all the signals sent to you
     will be displayed. If you answer Y to this questiom all the signals
     between all of the ships in the fleet will also be shown as they
     arrive. This is a bit of a cheat but answer Y in your first few games
     to get the feel of how orders interpreted. Similarly for Spanish
     signalling.

 #   Do you want to be able to see what is going on other than from your own
     eyes: ( Y )

     When it is your turn to make orders a perspective view will be shown,
     with your flagship at the centre in the bottom of the screen. This
     option is another cheat but allows you to look from other captian's
     ships, and also from any town or coastal feature. Answer Y for your
     first few games, but when you get used to the concepts answer N.

 #   Show the cannons firing: ( Y )

     Answer Y to see the guns smoke and the cannon balls crash or splash.

 #   Change the historical orders: ( N )

     Answer N until you wish to change the scenario from the start by
     setting up different initial orders. Answering Y does not delete the
     existing initial orders, but new ones entered replace them.

 #   Save off the game automatically every three hours: ( Y )

     The Armada game will take quite a few hours to play through, if you
     wish to ensure no disaster will mean going right back to the start then
     type Y for this option. The game data will then be saved off every
     three simulated hours.



 THE ROLE OF ADMIRAL
 ===================
 As admiral, either Howard or Medina Sidonia, you only play the role of that
 one man. All the other captains and crew are played by the computer.

 A fleet is divided into squadrons, each of between 4 and 25 ships, and
 there are 8 English and 9 Spanish squadrons. The squadrons are all under
 the command of one leader and orders to the leader can often be taken as
 orders to the whole squadron.

 As admiral, you have a squadron of your own, and also of cause a ship of
 your own, the flagship. The detailed control of both your ship and your
 squadron is in the hands of the flagship's captain.

 The captain makes the decisions on how to sail the ship, as admiral your
 main concern is the big picture, low level decisions are left with your
 minions. If your captain's decisions clash with your own orders, he will ask
 your permission to do what he would prefer. Alternatively you can take the
 helm and steer the ship yourself.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Appedix B gives a detailed account of all the orders that can be given,   |
| which are entered in English. The fleets have their initial historical    |
| orders, so there is no need to go overboard with the orders to get things |
| going.                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|



 ENTERING ORDERS
 ===============
 Whenever orders can be entered, the admiral will be asked whether they are
 ready. As well as entering orders to subordinates there are a number of
 other options:


   ORDER:              MEANING:
   ------              --------

   X (or Escape):      I do not want to enter any more orders.

   Quit                Abandon the game altegther.

   Save                Save off a partially completed game, but carry on
                       with this one.

   Pause               Freeze the action, the admiral needs a break!

   Points              Gives the current points count of both sides.

   <ship or squadron   This will give some details of the ship, or the 
   commander's name>   latest battle report from the squadron commander.

   Look <direction>    You can look North, South, East or West from your
                       flagship, and from any other ship, town or coastal
                       feature if you made that option available.

   for example:        LOOK NORTH
                       LOOK EAST FROM THE REVENGE
                       LOOK W FROM PORTSMOUTH
                       LOOK S FROM DRAKE
                       LOOK E FROM THE-NEEDLES

   Helm                Taking the helm will give you direct control over the
                       steering of the ship. Normally this is done by the
                       Captain.

   Cabin               Returns the helm to the Captain. You can give orders
                       and recieve messages from your cabin, but the
                       steering of the ship is left up to the Captain.

   Sleep for <n>       If you wish to take no involvement in the running of
   hours               the fleet, perhaps through one of the simulated
                       night's, then you can retire for a given number of
                       hours.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Appendix B gives a full list of orders, but simple ones work, for        |
| example:                                                                 |
|--------------------| CAPTAIN SAIL TO PORTLAND-ISLE                       |
                     |                                                     |
                     | CAPTAIN ATTACK THE ENEMY 1 MILE SOUTH OF YOU        |
                     |-----------------------------------------------------|

 Experiment to get some idea of the power of your command. If a red error
 statement appears at the bottom of the screen, type a key before correcting
 the mistake. If you have typed something the English language parser cannot
 recognise, there is no need to type it again, the cursor will be placed
 where the problem was noted and you can correct it. Enter an order by
 pressing the Return key.



 THE GRAPHICS
 ============
 The ships of either fleet can be recognised by their shape, the colour of
 their sails, and the paintwork down their sides.


 ENGLISH SHIPS:
 --------------

 All have light blue colouring in their sails, and red paintwork.

   Galleon             Sleek and fast, three masts

   Carrack             Large and high out the water, three masts

   Pinnace             Small and low, two masts

   Large and small     A variety of sizes with two or three masts
   Merchants


 SPANISH SHIPS:
 --------------

 All have light purple colouring in their sails, and deeper purple paintwork.

   Galleon             Warships, but high in water, four masts

   Carrack             Converted merchantmen, large with four masts

   Galleass            Powerful, with oars and three masts

   Zabra               Small, low and fast, with two masts

   Large and small     A variety of sizes
   Merchants



 THE TELESCOPE
 =============
 To help identify the view you can use your telescope (the mouse cursor) to
 pick out details. Clicking on any point of interest will tell you what it
 is. Clicking on top of the order paper should it be covering the bottom of
 the screen will remove it for you.

 <k>     Whenever this symbol appears in the bottom right hand corner of the
         screen the program is waiting for you to press a key, press the
         left mouse button, or wait for a time-out.


 ENTERING NAMES
 --------------
 To enter the name of a ship, town or coastal feature that is made up of
 several words it is necessary to hypenate them. For example, enter
 The Needles as The-Needles, and similary for Plymouth-Sound,
 San-Felipe-Santiago, Whitsand-Bay, and so on. Note that you only need enter
 enough letters to uniquely identify the name, so Whitsand-Bay can be
 entered simply as Whitsand.



 THE SIMULATION
 ==============
 As you get into the battle, you will probably want to know more about the
 full scope of the simulation. Reading one of the books in Appendix A will
 give you a lot more insight into how things have been programmed.

 Probably the most important thing about sea warfare, which is different
 from land battles, is that ship's captains are given far more control over
 their own actions than, say, a regiment of infantry, and in many cases act
 as a law unto themselves. The implications of this are that they will make
 decisions which are not completely in sync with your orders, and when a
 battle does start you will find it very difficult to control the movements
 of ships that are engaged.


   the armada program takes the following things into account:


 WEATHER:
 --------
 The wind strength and direction is shown on the compass in the top left
 hand corner of the screen. The wind will vary in strength from zero to force
 nine on the Beaufort scale. When the strengthis around force six, most
 captains will consider the weather as more dangerous than the enemy and
 attempt to take shelter or escape out at sea.
 However, if the wind is around force five 5, and blowing the ship towards
 the shore, a captain will again take it out of danger rather than fight the
 enemy. The red arrow on the compass will point towards the direction from
 which the wind is coming.

 Land that gives shelter to some areas of sea is taken into account,
 particulary in the main harbours at Plymouth, Weynouth, Portsmouth, Poole
 and around the Isle of Wight.

 The winds are not randomly generated but match typical summer conditions in
 the Channel. These are that there is usually a West wind, at its peak during
 mi afternoon, slackening off during the evening and coming down from the
 North during the night. The wind is at its most calm in early morning, just
 as it changes from being a light offshore Northerly wind to a Westerly of
 slightly greater strength. Also day and night are based on accurate timings
 for dusk and dawn. The sun goes down around 9 pm, and returns around 5 am.


 TYPES OF SHIPS:
 ---------------
 The English fleet consists of galleons, carracks, pinnaces, and large and
 small merchant ships. All sail fairly well, the carrack being the most
 cumbersome and the galleons the most capable. Pinnaces are very small and
 cannot take much punishment. None have oars so can only sail with some wind.

 The Spanish fleet consists of galleons, carracks, galleasses, zabras and
 large and small merchant ships. Apart from the zabras, which are small and
 fast, all are less capable sailers than their English counterparts. The
 galleons are the largest and most powerful.

 The galleasses are unique in that they have oars, so can both move with no
 wind and also move, slowly, directly into the wind. They also have some guns
 pointing directly foward.

 All ships have a compliment made up of officers, sailors and soldiers. The
 different qualities of the crews are taken into account. Most English
 captains and crew were very competent sailors, as were some Spanish, but
 many people on the Armada were drafted from the army and knew little of
 sailing.


 FIGHTING TACTICS, CULVERINS, CANNONS AND SMALL ARMS:
 ----------------------------------------------------
 Three fighting tactics can be specified: long range, short range and
 grappling.

 At long range only the culverins are effective (a culverine is a ship's gun
 firing a less heavy ball than a cannon but over a greater distance). The
 effective range of a cannon is little more than half that of a culverine.
 The Spanish ships were mostly equipped with cannons, with the English having
 an advantage in the greater number of calverines.

 Grappling means going alongside the enemy, and attempting to storm and
 capture the ship with soldiers.

 Only when ships are very close were small arms effective.

 Ships can fight at night, but only when they are very close. Normally the
 captains will try to disengage as it gets dark.


 FOULING, DRIFTING, GROUNDING AND WRECKS:
 ----------------------------------------
 Ships sometimes foul on each other, getting their rigging, anchors or
 whatever entangled, and will have to unfoul before they can sail on
 properly. In strong winds a ship may be blown aground, or wrecked on cliffs
 or rocks.


 BATTLE DAMAGE AND REPAIRS:
 --------------------------
 Gunfire can shoot away sails, masts and crew, it can also bash lumps out of
 the hull and knock out cannons and culverins. In 1588 cannons and culverins
 fired solid balls, not explosives, so only the force of impact caused
 damage. There was no resulting explosion or fire.

 Of caurse, as guns are knocked out, crew killed, and sails and masts blown
 away the effectiveness of the ship will decrease proportionately.

 If all the masts of a ship are blown away, but the crew is still capable,
 they will try to erect what is called a jury rig (a temporary makeshift
 mast) to give the ship some ability to sail. Also if any mast has all its
 sails blown away, the crew will try to replace some of them.

 The effectiveness of the guns of this age is a subject of some debate, and
 it would be fair to say in this game the guns are given perhaps a more
 generous firepower than was probably the case.

 The English guns were better mounted than most of the Spanish ones, and
 could be fired more often. Also some of the Spanish gun crews were drafted
 from artillery crews of the army, so had no experience of guns at sea.


 TRANSFERRING CREW:
 ------------------
 If necessary all the officers (including yourself as admiral), or some
 sailors or soldiers can be transferred from one ship to another, perhaps to
 make up losses or to evacuate a badly damaged ship.


 EMBARKING AND DISEMBARKING SOLDIERS:
 ------------------------------------
 The crux of any invasion is the landing of troops to capture key areas of
 the country. Soldiers can be disembarked (landed) on any bit of coastline
 where there is a beach or grass banks, or landed at docks. However the
 weather conditions must be right for a landing to take place on an exposed
 beach.

 Similarly infantry can be embarked from any port, beach or grass bank,
 again as long as the weather is fine.


 FIGHTING ON SHORE:
 ------------------
 There are coastal forts and castles which the English have manned with
 soldiers and culverins. There are also several thousand English militia
 (volunteers) defending some important towns.

 Infantry landed from ships are assumed to be under the control of a
 commander in touch with the squadron's commander that they were landed from,
 and are ordered as one force through the squadron commander.


 RIGGING:
 --------
 Three different sailing rigs can be set. If the ship is at anchor the sails
 will be furled up and not visible. Normally full sails will be set, which
 gives the maximum speed, but in range of the enemy battle sails may be set,
 which slows the speed but offers less of a target and less damage will be
 done to the riggings by enemy gunfire.
 
 You will see when battle sails are set as the main sails on the fore and
 main masts of the ship will be raised.


 FEATURES NOT PRESENT IN ARMADA:
 -------------------------------
 The simulation does not take into account some aspects of sea warfare,
 notably tides, towing, fireships, sailing up rivers, and lightening ships to
 sail them after they have grounded. Nor does the simulation include the
 possibility of capturing an enemy ship and manning it with your own crew to
 fight on your side (captured ships are simply scuttled, after taking the
 crew prisoner).

 The land fighting is kept fairly simple, with all forces kept as either
 infantry or fixed shore batteries. That is, there are no cavalry forces, and
 no movable land artillery.

 There is no option for the Admiral to go ashore.


 
 WINNING
 =======
 The Spanish win if they capture a main town and some docks, and also keep a
 seaway clear for at least 3 miles out to sea. They can also win if they
 significantly defeat the English at sea. The English win if they stop the
 Spanish winning.

 The ports that can be used to secure a victory are:

 PLYMOUTH, WEYMOUTH, POOLE, PORTSMOUTH, and GOSPORT.

 If the Isle of White is chosen as a target the Spanish must secure one of
 the small docks at Cowes or Yarmouth, and also capture Carisbrook Castle.

 Each ship has a certain points value, based on its size, armaments, crew,
 and similar information. Forts, castles and infantry also have their own
 points value. If the invasion fails the winner is decided by a comparison of
 the total points values lost by each side.

    APPENDIX B


 GIVING ORDERS IN ENGLISH
 ========================
 All orders are typed in English and parsed to see how much sense they make.
 They almost all take the form:


 < TO WHO >  < WHEN TO START >  < WHAT TO DO >  < FOR HOW LONG >


 The easiest way to control a fleet is to order the squadrons to keep
 formation, and then you only have to order the squadron leaders what to do,
 and not a mass of 70 ships or more.

 As a general military rule it makes sense to order a ship through its
 squadron commander, because then no confusion can arise by you ordering the
 ship to do something and the squadron leader, unaware of this, ordering it
 to do something else. The ship will follow your orders in preference (as
 long as it gets them) but the squadron commander might get upset because he
 was relying on a ship doing something only to find it was ordered elsewhere.

 In the examples DRAKE, HAWKINS and FROBISHER are English squadron
 commanders, OQUENDO is a Spanish squadron commander, DRAKE'S own ship is the
 REVENGE, and the BEAR and the LION are other ships. Ordering DRAKE is
 identical to ordering THE REVENGE, the names of all the squadron leaders are
 added as options. The historical leaders names can be used to help clarify
 that the order is to a squadron leader.

 All orders are preceded with the word CAPTAIN, or the word SIGNAL.
 Basically you signal other squadron's and ships but order your own captain
 directly.

 Whether an order is passed down to subordinate ships depends largely on its
 context. For example:

   SIGNAL DRAKE TO ADOPT SHORT RANGE TACTICS

 implies that all his squadron should adopt these tactics, but

   SIGNAL DRAKE TO TRANSFERE 1/3 OF YOUR CREW TO THE ARK

 obviously implies it is just Drake's own ship.

 Assuming you want to sail some ships to Plymouth, the following examples
 show who will go.

 Only the flagship:

   CAPTAIN TURN OFF THE STERN LAMPS

   CAPTAIN ORDER OUR SHIP TO SAIL TO PLYMOUTH

 The flagship, your own squadron if it is following in formation, and all
 other squadrons if they are stationed relative to the flagship (in other
 words, possibly the entire fleet):

   CAPTAIN SAIL TO PLYMOUTH

 Another squadron leaders ship only:

   SIGNAL DRAKE TO TURN OFF HIS STERN LAMPS

   SIGNAL DRAKE, ORDER YOUR SHIP TO SAIL TO PLYMOUTH

 Another leader's ship, and all ships sailing in formation behind it:

   SIGNAL DRAKE SAIL TO PLYMOUTH

 Several other squadrons:

   SIGNAL DRAKE, HAWKINS AND FROBISHER TO SAIL TO PLYMOUTH

 Several named ships in a squadron:

   SIGNAL DRAKE, ORDER THE HOPE TO SAIL TO PLYMOUTH

 Several unspecified ships in a squadron:

   SIGNAL DRAKE, ORDER 4 SHIPS TO SAIL TO PLYMOUTH

 Several individual ships operating on their own:

   SIGNAL THE BEAR AND THE LION TO SAIL TO PLYMOUTH

 All squadrons leaders and their ships, regardless of whether they are
 stationed relative to the flagship:

   SIGNAL ALL SQUADRONS TO SAIL TO PLYMOUTH

 Infantry disembarked by a squadron:

   SIGNAL OQUENDO ORDER YOUR INFANTRY TO MOVE TO PLYMOUTH

 Infantry disembarked by the flagship's squadron:

   CAPTAIN ORDER MY INFANTRY TO MOVE TO PLYMOUTH


 The Formats show how to word the orders, the words in brackets are optional.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 SETTING SAILS
 -------------
 To go at full speed set full sails, but it might be sensible to set the
 slower but less vunerable rig known as battle sails if within range of enemy
 artillery. You can leave the setting of the sails to your Captain.

 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  SET SAILS

 For example:

   CAPTAIN SET BATTLE SAILS

 or:

   CAPTAIN SET FULL SAILS


 SAILING AND MOVING
 ------------------
 Ships and land forces can be moved around relative to the positions of
 other ships, towns, the flagship, and basically any definable point.

 In 1588 there was no way of calculating longitude, and latitude
 calculations were only accurate to around 30 miles or so, so when a ship was
 near a coastline it navigated using what was called caping (steering between
 capes).

 When specifying a position either a named location can be used, or a
 relative distance and direction from a named location. A named location can
 be a ship, town, port, coastal feature bay, or perhaps simply THE FLAGSHIP.

 All ships within a squadron will normally be ordered to sail in some
 formation (see the diagrams of the formations and the station numbers), and
 the squadron itself placed at a position relative to the flagship. In this
 case the ships and squadrons need be given no further movement orders (which
 is the purpose of a formation) but will follow the flagship as long as it
 has its stern lamps ON.

 The stern lamps of the squadron leaders are all ON at the start of the
 game.

 If no station number is given to a ship, it will assume the number it
 started off with still applies.

 If the flagship wishes not to lead the fleet but go on some individual
 task, say to attack an enemy on its own, it must turn its own stern lamps
 OFF. It would be sensible to order the rest of your squadron to, for
 example, hove-to, rarther than leave them puzzled as to what to do.


   Some technical (see the Landlubbers guide in Appendix F):


      Anchor        drop anchor and stay put

      Hove-to       reduce sail and just drift

      Dock          put into port


 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  SAIL TO A  < VIA B >

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  SAIL ALONGSIDE SHIP

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  ANCHOR  < AT A >

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  HOVE TO  < AT A >

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  DOCK AT PORT

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  FOLLOW IN FORMATION AT STATION N

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  STATION YOUR SHIP/SQUADRON DISTANCE DIRECTION OF THE
   FLAGSHIP

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  TURN ON/OFF THE STERN LAMPS

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  SAIL IN FORMATION


 For Example:

   SIGNAL DRAKE TO ANCHOR AT TOR-BAY

   SIGNAL DRAKE TO HOVE-TO

   SIGNAL HAWKINS TO DOCK AT POOLE

   SIGNAL DRAKE TO SAIL TO 1 MILE SOUTH OF PLYMOUTH

   SIGNAL FROBISHER TO SAIL TO 3 MILES SOUTH OF PORTSMOUTH VIA THE-NEEDLES

   SIGNAL HAWKINS, ORDER THE BEAR AND THE LION TO SAIL FOR PORTSMOUTH

   CAPTAIN MOVE ALONGSIDE THE REVENGE

   SIGNAL THE BEAR TO SAIL TO THE REVENGE

 And moving land forces....

   SIGNAL OQUENDO, ORDER YOUR INFANTRY TO MOVE TO PLYMOUTH

 And in formation....

   CAPTAIN SAIL IN DOUBLE LINE ASTERN FORMATION

   SIGNAL HAWKINS TO SAIL IN DOUBLE CRESCENT FORMATION

   SIGNAL DRAKE AT 2 AM TOMARROW STATION YOUR SQUADRON 1 MILE SOUTH OF THE
   FLAGSHIP

   SIGNAL THE BEAR, STATION YOUR SHIP 1 MILE SOUTH OF THE FLAGSHIP

   CAPTAIN TURN ON THE STERN LAMPS

   CAPTAIN TURN OFF THE STERN LAMPS


 Engaging
 --------
 If a fleet is being led into battle, it is going to engage as a matter of
 course, but if a separate action or a land battle is required, then engage
 orders will need to be given.

 Engaging can take three styles:

   SHADOWING   following but out of range (not really engaging!)

   ATTACK      attack the enemy where they are to obtain control of that
               piece of land or sea

   CHASE       attack the enemy and go after them if they move

 Enemy ships were not usually recongnisable individually, but can be
 specified by their type (galleon, carrack, zabra, galleass, merchant and so
 on).

 In most cases the attack will be carried out according to the tactics
 specified by the adopt tactics order.

 To direct an attack:

 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  ATTACK  < AN ENEMY FORCE >  < WHERE >

 For example:

   CAPTAIN ATTACK THE SPANISH GALLEONS TO YOUR NORTHEAST

   SIGNAL DRAKE TO ATTACK THE ENEMY 2 MILES SOUTH OF PLYMOUTH

   CAPTAIN ATTACK THE SPANISH GALLEASS 1 MILE NORTH OF THE REVENGE

   SIGNAL ALL SQUADRONS TO CHASE THE SPANISH TO THE SOUTHEAST

   CAPTAIN, SHADOW THE ENEMY TO THE SOUTHEAST


 Disengaging
 -----------
 To call off a fight, perhaps as it is getting dark (to avoid total
 confusion) or to regroup. It is often useful to give a disengage order to
 extract some ships from a fight, before giving them more detailed orders of
 what you want them to do from then on. Alternatively the fight can be
 abandoned altogether.

 Also, although most ship captains have the sense to do it anyway, an order
 can be given to find shelter, or escape to the open sea, from a strong storm
 or hurricane. A battle cannot take place in very high winds, as by far the
 greatest danger to ships and life is from being blown onto cliffs or rocks,
 or sunk.

 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  DISENGAGE  < DURATION >

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  ABANDON THE BATTLE

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  ESCAPE FROM THE STORM

 For example:

   SIGNAL DRAKE TO DISENGAGE

   SIGNAL THE REVENGE TO DISENGAGE

   SIGNAL ALL SQUADRONS, AT 3 30 PM DISENGAGE FOR 5 HOURS

   CAPTAIN AT 2 30 PM ORDER MY SHIP TO DISENGAGE

   SIGNAL ALL SQUADRONS TO ABANDON THE BATTLE

 And to find shelter:

   SIGNAL ALL SQUADRONS TO ESCAPE FROM THE STORM


 Defend
 ------
 A special defend order is possible, both for land forces, but also for
 ships when the purpose is to defend a particular patch of water.
 Normally defending water is not a particularly useful job, except where it
 is, say, the entrance to a harbour. Troops or ships given a defend order
 will not normally go after any enemy they beat off.

 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  DEFEND WHERE  < DURATION >

 For example:

   SIGNAL OQUENDO, ORDER YOUR INFANTRY TO DEFEND PLYMOUTH

   SIGNAL DRAKE, DEFEND 1 MILE SOUTH OF PLYMOUTH FOR 3 HOURS


 Changing tactics
 ----------------
 These are three tactical options: long range, short range and grappling.
 Changing tactics does not order any ship to attack but simply to adopt
 these tactics in future.

   Long range     shell the enemy but keep out of short range

   Short range    shell the enemy at any range, close if possible, but do
                  not make contact

   Grappling      shell the enemy at any range and attempt to grapple and
                  board

 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  ADOPT TACTICS

 For example:

   CAPTAIN ADOPT LONG RANGE TACTICS

   SIGNAL DRAKE, AT 2 30 PM TODAY ADOPT SHORT RANGE TACTICS

   SIGNAL HAWKINS TO ADOPT GRAPPLING TACTICS


 Patrolling
 ----------
 A ship, squadron or fleet can patrol a piece of sea with three distinct
 purposes.

   Patrol         try to locate enemy and report anything in sight. If a
                  fleet is sighted the patrolling ships will shadow it if
                  they can, but will not engage.

   Blockade       try to stop any enemy getting through the specified line,
                  or to the specified port.

   Clear Seaway   try to keep a safe passage in and out of a port.

 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  PATROL FROM A TO B  < DURATION >

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  PATROL PORT  < DURATION >

 For example:

   SIGNAL DRAKE TO BLOCKADE PORTSMOUTH

   SIGNAL HAWKINS TO PATROL FROM PLYMOUTH TO 3 MILES SOUTH OF WHITSAND-BAY

   SIGNAL HAWKINS TO CLEAR THE SEAWAY AT POOLE

   SIGNAL DRAKE TO BLOCKADE FROM THE-NEEDLES TO 1 MILE EAST OF PORTLAND-BILL
   FOR 18 HOURS


 Surrender
 ---------
 An unlikely order, but ships can be ordered to give up the fight.

 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  SURRENDER

 For example:

   SIGNAL DRAKE ORDER THE BEAR TO SURRENDER

   SIGNAL HAWKINS TO SURRENDER


 Transferring troops
 -------------------
 The headquarters, officers, soldiers and crew of any ship can be moved
 around, possibly to make up crew that has suffered a lot of casualties, or
 to embark troops (pick up) or to disembark them (put down) at any bay or
 port.

 If tranferring a crew from one ship to another it would be sensible to move
 alongside it first. Also there must be room for everybody on the ship, so be
 careful of transferring too much, especially onto a pinnace or zabra.

 Most ships are made up of officers, soldiers and crew, land forces of only
 officers and soldiers. A flagship also includes the headquarters. When
 transferring troops all or any fraction of them can be specified.

 When picking up soldiers, say after an unsuccessful invasion attempt or
 picking up reinforcements, the word ANY can be used to tell the captain to
 pick up as many as he can carry, regardless of whose command they are in.

 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  < DIS >EMBARK TROOPS  < AT LANDING PLACES >

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  TRANSFER TROOPS/CREW TO SHIP

 For example:

   SIGNAL DRAKE, DISEMBARK YOUR INFANTRY

   SIGNAL DRAKE, ORDER THE LION AND THE BEAR, AT 5 AM DISEMBARK YOUR
   INFANTRY AT POOLE

   SIGNAL THE BEAR TO EMBARK ANY INFANTRY AT POOLE

   SIGNAL THE BEAR TO TRANSFER 1/2 OF ITS CREW TO THE REVENGE

   CAPTAIN TRANSFER 1/3 OF THE CREW AND ALL OF THE SOLDIERS TO THE BEAR

 And to forces on land:

   CAPTAIN ORDER MY INFANTRY TO EMBARK AT POOLE

   SIGNAL DRAKE ORDER YOUR INFANTRY TO EMBARK AT WHITSAND-BAY

   SIGNAL OQUENDO, DISEMBARK YOUR INFANTRY 1 MILE WEST OF BOURNEMOUTH


 Battle reports
 --------------
 To get information on the state of ships and casualties, battle reports can
 be requested. The time delay in getting them will ensure, though, that most
 of them will be out of date before they arrive.

 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  SEND ME YOUR BATTLE REPORT

 For example:

   SIGNAL ALL SQUADRONS, SEND ME YOUR BATTLE REPORTS

   SIGNAL THE BEAR, SEND ME YOUR BATTLE REPORT

   CAPTAIN AT 3 30 PM SEND ME YOUR BATTLE REPORT


 Supporting and reassigning ships between squadrons
 --------------------------------------------------
 A squadron can be ordered to give or take support from another. It can also
 be ordered to reassign one of its own command to another. When a squadron is
 supporting another it will go to its aid, if it can, when a request is made.

 If an order to give support is sent to one squadron, remember to send the
 equivalent take support to the other.

 These orders can only be given to squadron commanders.

 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  GIVE/TAKE SUPPORT FROM SQUADRONS

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  STOP GIVING/TAKING SUPPORT FROM SQUADRONS

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  STOP GIVING/TAKING SUPPORT

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  ASSIGN SHIPS TO SQUADRON

 For example:

   SIGNAL DRAKE TO ASSIGN THE BEAR AND THE LION TO HAWKINS

   SIGNAL DRAKE AND FROBISHER TO GIVE SUPPORT TO HAWKINS

   SIGNAL HAWKINS TO TAKE SUPPORT FROM FROBISHER

   SIGNAL HAWKINS TO STOP GIVING SUPPORT

   SIGNAL HAWKINS TO STOP TAKING SUPPORT FROM DRAKE AND FROBISHER

   SIGNAL HAWKINS TO TRANSFER THE BEAR TO MY SQUADRON

   CAPTAIN ASSIGN THE BEAR AND THE LION TO HAWKINS


 Loss of the fleet or a squadron's flagship
 ------------------------------------------
 If a ship commanding a squadron gets lost, sunk, disabled or captured , the
 remaining ships can either be assigned to another squadron, or one of them
 can be promoted to take command.

 Normally the vice-flagship of the squadron would be given command.

 If the admiral wishes to change the command hierarchy before a squadron
 flagship is lost, he must relieve the first commander before appointing his
 successor.

 If the fleet flagship is in danger, normally the admiral will try to
 transfer to another ship before it's too late. If not, command of the fleet
 will be lost, although the squadrons will keep foghting.

 Format:

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  ASSUME COMMAND OF EX-LEADERS SQUADRON

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  RELIEVE COMMAND OF YOUR SQUADRON TO NEW LEADER

   TO WHO  < WHEN >  TAKE ORDERS NOW FROM SQUADRON LEADER

 For example:

   SIGNAL THE BEAR TO ASSUME COMMAND OF FROBISHERS SQUADRON

   SIGNAL FROBISHER TO RELIEVE COMMAND OF YOUR SQUADRON TO THE BEAR

 And to an individual ship:

   SIGNAL THE LION TO TAKE ORDERS FROM DRAKE



 COMBINATIONS OF ORDERS
 ======================
 Orders of different types,may be combined to achive desired objectives, as
 in the following two examples.


 To change flagships
 -------------------
 Assume the Ark is the current flagship and it is being followed by the Bear
 , in station 2:

   SIGNAL THE BEAR TO MOVE ALONGSIDE THE ARK

   CAPTAIN MOVE ALONGSIDE THE BEAR

   CAPTAIN TRANSFER THE HQ TO THE BEAR

 Then (after the tranfer has taken place)

   CAPTAIN TURN ON THE STERN LAMPS

   SIGNAL THE ARK TO TAKE ORDERS FROM THE BEAR

   SIGNAL THE ARK TO FOLLOW IN THE ASTERN FORMATION AT STATION 2

 An order to all squadron leaders of the change of flagship will be sent
 automatically by the new captain.


 Capturing a fort
 ----------------
 Oquendo is a Spanish squadron commander: the plan is to land infantry on a
 beach near to the fort to attack it after the fort has been bombarded from
 the sea.

   SIGNAL OQUENDO, DISEMBARK YOUR INFANTRY AT TOR-BAY

   SIGNAL OQUENDO, AT 3 30 PM ORDER YOUR INFANTRY TO ATTACK THE FORT 1 MILE
   SOUTHWEST OF PLYMOUTH

   SIGNAL OQUENDO, AT 1 PM ATTACK THE FORT 1 MILE SOUTHWEST OF PLYMOUTH FOR
   2 HOURS 30 MINS

 Dependind on the success of the venture.....

   SIGNAL OQUENDO ORDER YOUR INFANTRY TO EMBARK AT CAWSAND-BAY

 or.....

   SIGNAL OQUENDO ORDER YOUR INFANTRY TO DEFEND 1 MILE SOUTHWEST OF PLYMOUTH



    APPENDIX C


 THE FORMATIONS
 ==============
 A squadron can be ordered to form one of a given number of formations, so
 orders need only be given to the squadron flagship as all the rest will
 follow suit. This makes control of a huge fleet so much easier, and both
 fleets start off with all ships in formations, and are given initial station
 numbers.

 The diagrams below shows a squadron of four to fourteen ships, with the
 appropriate station numbers, but they can of caurse be any size. The
 flagship can be that of the admiral's or of any squadron leader.

    APPENDIX D


 THE FLEETS
 ==========
 The English Fleet, based in Plymouth, starts having just worked its way to
 the west of the Armada. The ships in each squadron are listed after the
 leader, the vice-flagship of each squadron coming second in the list.

 In both fleets the tiny ships, those less than 100 English tons, or 150
 Spanish tons, are not considered to be of any military significance, other
 than in the carring of messages and supplies, and are not explicity
 represented in the game. The exceptions to this are the three English
 pinnaces the Moon, Advice and Charles, which are represented as they were
 Queen's ships and these ships (the first four English squadrons) did most of
 the fighting.

 A Spanish carrack is taken here to be a converted merchantman with castles
 built either end of the ship. A Spanish galleon was fairly similar to an
 English carrack in terms of size and sailing performance (or lack of it!).
 The guns figure is simply a total of all culverins, cannons, demi-culverins,
 minions and sakers (both very small weapons) and other artillery of the
 time. The figures are simplified into culverins and cannons for the
 simulation.

 The soldiers can be used for three purposes, providing small arms fire,
 fighting with enemy ships trying to board, or landing and fighting ashore.
 The sailors can only be used to sail the ship, but will defend against being
 boarded.

 The ship's weight, given in tons, is a dubious figure based on anything but
 the ships actual weight, but is used to calculate its relative size and
 ability to withstand damage. To further confuse the issue a Spanish ton is
 very approximately five eighths of an English ton (very approximately as
 even the sailors at the time do not seem to have taken the measure too
 seriously).

 Where a leader has a particulary wordy name, the shortened form used in the
 game (and no doubt in reality) is given in brackets. Some Spanish ships have
 particulary flowery names and these must be referred to with hyphens joining
 the words.
