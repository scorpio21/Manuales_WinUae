When you have got onto the main game then it will say press Q when you have
entered the number required for the transpondant, so you enter the number
stated above for the required destination. The four letters for each city
are the airports which you type in on the first screen.
I hope this has helped you all out. This game was a complete bastard to work
out and we spent 4 hours trying to see whether there was any way of removing
the codes but since this is part of the game it would destroy it so they had
to be left in.
