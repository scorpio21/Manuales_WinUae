			      Artura

Look back through the dark mirror of the seasons to the time when the
eagles deserted this land of Albion to the ravaging of the Saxons.  Look
back to an age of bloody war and mysterious magickes.

You are Artura, son of the Pendragon.  To stem the tide of invaders you
must unite the Chieftains of the warring tribes of Albion under your
leadership as High King. To do this you need to gain possession of the
sacred Treasures of Albion, hidden where the eagles came.

Only Merdyn, your adviser and friend, knows the exact location of the lost
Treasures.  But he has vanished, and four play is suspected.  Your only
clue to the dark mystery is that Morgause, your evil half sister, has
kidnapped Nimue, Merdyn's beautiful apprentice.  You must fight your way
through Morgause's dun to rescue her.

The maze that surrounds Morgause's stronghold was specifically built to
repel intruders.  Complete with deadly traps and one-way passages leading
nowhere, it houses a seemingly endless stream of wierd and wonderful
minions, including powerful warriors, ghouls, spiders, even giant rats. 
Nevertheless, you must find a path through the dangerous dungeon to rescue
the enchantress imprisoned therein.

Hidden in the dark passages you will find the shattered pieces of the six
Rune Stones, which were stolen by Morgause and subsequently destroyed by
her evil touch.  Used separately or in combination, these will enable you
to ride the mystical wheel of Cerriddwen, as did Kings of old.

Only by finding all of the Runes can you hope to rescue Nimue, and return
to Camelod to fulfill your destiny...

HELP FOR THE HERO

Travelers before you have brought back valuable information as to the
layout of Morgause's maze.  By compiling all available data we have been
able to construct maps of all four Levels (Level 1 being the nearest the
Earth's surface, and the one where your quest begins), which are as
reliable as possible, under the circumstances.

However, be advised that these maps were constructed from information
gleaned before Morgause had gained her present level of magical power. 
Since no traveler has returned from her dungeons in many years, it is
certain that her cunning brain has derived new traps and tricks, which of
course were impossible to document.

Also the present location of food stores and the broken rune stones is also
knowledge that is beyond our ancient mapmakers.

If it will add to the challenge of the game for you, you may of course put
away the map we have provided, and painstakingly construct one of your own.

On the other hand, if you're more of a warrior than a strategist, and you
need even more of a guide than that provided by the map, seers have gazed
through the mists to provide a guide to the locations of food stores and
the shattered pieces of the Rune stones.

To see the vision of the seers, turn to the last page of this document.

Be brave, be strong,
be cunning... be victorious,
and take your predestined
place as High King!

THE SEERS' VISION

Note: The following information is for those warriors who do NOT find the
strategy aspects of games either interesting or fun.  DO NOT use this
information if you enjoy mapping and puzzle solving, because it will take
away some of your enjoyment of the game.

LOCATION OF FOOD STORES

Locations correspond to grids on the maps of each Level.  The first number
represents the vertical destination, and the second the horizontal.
