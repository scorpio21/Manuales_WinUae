Version 1.0 Notes


Running the programs

Access to all programs is now accomplished via ICONS.  To access the ICONS,
select the "Age_of_Sail" disk ICON from Workbench.


A group of ICONS will appear, and you may choose the program to run by
double-clicking one of them.  Alternately, you may still choose to run
all but Shipbuilder and Orders from the main program.

Single disk users:  In order to avoid disk swapping enter the following
in CLI or ED your Workbench 1.2:s/startup-sequence file as follows:

Copy "Workbench 1.2:c/run" ram:<RETURN KEY>
Assign C: ram:<RETURN KEY>

Again, work ONLY with a backup copy of Workbench and Age_of_Sail!

Hard Disk usage: We recommend creating a drawer dh0:AOS.
Edit your df0:s/startup-sequence as follows:
Assign Age_of_Sail: dh0:AOS<RET>

Extra ram users: We recommend either typing this in from CLI or editing
your df0:s/startup-sequence as follows:

Copy Age_of_Sail: ram:<RET>
Assign Age_of_Sail: ram:<RET>

Starting Play.

Before starting play make sure that each player assigns men to cannon, sail,
etc.  You may not see the other ships on the visual screen until after the
first game turn.

Select MAIN with the mouse. When the screen appears, select the ORDERS
program and assign your men, etc.  When finished, the MAIN program will
reload.  Select the GAME program from the menu and run as many "turns"
as you desire.  The MAIN program will reload, and then you may select the
ORDERS program. Repeat the game/orders program selection until there is
a victor.

Uploading

When Uploading to Compuserve Information Service (CIS)
specify that the file is to be BINARY.  Send each ship
separately into its own file.  This will ensure adequate
storage (8K is allowed by CIS) and prevent formatting
characters from being inserted by CIS.

When uploading to any service or BBS ensure that the host computer does not
insert a carriage return after each line.

A carriage return will corrupt the ship file making it useless. All files
must be received by the host AS IS.


Age of Sail Disk


The Age_of_Sail disk may (and should be backed up).

CAUTION: ship files in the Age of Sail: main directory will be changed by
the program!!!

While in the Workbench screen do the following:

      1. Click the Age_of_Sail icon once.
      2. Select the "Rename" option from the Workbench menu.
      3. When the requester comes up change the name of the
         backup from "Copy of Age_of_Sail" to "Age_of_Sail".
      4. All modules in the game look for "Age_of_Sail.0  [4m

Manual Changes

Pg 13  Change the method to entering side and squadron as follows:

Enter side:F<RET> <-note capital F
Enter Squadron:1<RET>

Pg 26  You may now ignore this warning.  Bug fixed during Beta Testing.

Pg 36  There is no longer an Optimum crew assignment for the steering
       and sailing detail.  The more men assigned the more efficient
       the crew will be in carrying out orders.  A good crew size would
       be 25% of the total possible men carried.


Helpful Hints


     1.  When Tacking the ship it is possible to run out of momentum before
         tacking through the wind, and being unable to turn, or accelerate.
         This is because the crew is attempting to follow orders.  You have
         two alternatives:
         
        a)  assign more men to carry out orders
        b)  assign fewer men and let the wind take her.

     2.  To play a scenario you must move it to the main directory of
         Age_of_Sail:.  There are two ways to do this:

Note:  a Treasure Chest is the same thing as a drawer (ie a systems drawer).

ICON:
Open the scenarios Treasure Chest and the desired scenario
Treasure Chest (ie Battle!).
For each Icon:
    1. Click on each Icon
    2. Select Duplicate from the Workbench menu.
    3. Move the copy of Icon to the main directory (the same drawer as the
       programs reside in).
    4. Rename (Workbench menu) and delete the words Copy of from the title.
       CLI and the easier method:

Open the CLI
enter the following:
Copy Age_of_Sail:/scenarios/Battle!/#? Age_of_Sail:<RET>
Note that Battle! is the scenario you want copied.
then enter:
endcli<RET>
