        Boot side A, making sure that your joystick is plugged in first. The
   introductory  graphics  will appear, and continue until a key is pressed.
   When  you  press  a  key, the screen will clear and the opening menu will
   appear. Choose whether you will be playing with 1 or 2 drives and proceed
   from there.


   Y O U R   D R I V E R   C H A R A C T E R 
        In  Autoduel,  your  character is called a driver (since most of the
   time  will  be spent behind the wheel). Only 1 driver can be in play at a
   time.  If more than 1 person wants to play the game, each one will need a
   separate  disk  to  save  their own driver. The starting menu gives you 3
   options for your driver. If you have already played the game, you can:


   CONTINUE WITH CURRENT DRIVER,
        and use the driver already on your game disk,

   ACTIVATE AN OLD DRIVER
        saved  on  another  disk. If you activate an old driver, you will be
   given a chance to save the current driver onto a spare formatted disk,

   CREATE A NEW DRIVER.
        If  you  have  not  played - or if you want a new character - choose
   this option. You must do this when you play for the first time. To create
   your new driver, go thru the following steps:


   (1) CHOOSE A NAME AND TYPE IT IN.
        If  you  make a mistake, backspace and type over. The maximum length
   for a name is 16 letters.


   (2) CHOOSE YOUR ABILITIES.
        You  have  50  points  to  divide  between your 3 abilities (driver,
   marksmanship,  and  mechanic).  This will give your starting skills - but
   you  can improve them during play. The highest any of your skills can get
   is 99.


   DRIVING  SKILL  helps  in handling your car on the road and in the arena.
   The  better  your  skill,  the  better  your car will handle and the less
   likely  you  are to lose control and crash. Driving skill is increased by
   practice on the road, or by winning an arena event.

   MARKSMANSHIP SKILLS help you shoot accurately. The better your skill, the
   more  likely  you  are to hit your foes, and the more damage you will do.
   Marksmanship is increased by successful combat.

   MECHANIC  SKILL  is  used  to  salvage weapons and ammo from the cars you
   defeat  on  the highway and in the arena. The better your skill, the more
   likely  you  are  to find usable items. Salvaged ammo can be used in your
   own  car;  salvaged  weapons  and  parts can be sold at the salvage yard.


                                                          Autoduel    Page 2

   Mechanic  skill can only be increased by taking lessons at the garage, or
   by  successful  attempts at salvage. When you are finished, press "D" for
   "Done".  There are a few things about your driver that will always be the
   same when the game starts:

   ( 1 )   M O N E Y 
        Your driver will automatically start out with $2,000 in cash.


   ( 2 )   H E A L T H 
        This starts at 3 (perfect health). Injuries can reduce it to 2 or 1;
   a  health  of  0  means you're dead. Injuries can be cured at Gold Cross.
   Health can never be improved above 3 (although body armor will give extra
   protection, which is displayed on the screen as health).


   ( 3 )   P R E S T I G E 
        This  starts  at  0 - you're an unknown. Arena victories, successful
   courier runs, and certain other things can increase your prestige. Failed
   courier  jobs,  dishonesty,  and  certain  other things can decrease your
   prestige - but it never drops below 0.


                          G A M E   C O M M A N D S 

   DRIVING:  Your  car  is  controlled  by  the  joystick.  It will turn and
   accelerate in the direction you push the stick. If the stick is centered,
   the  car  will  slowly  decelerate.  If  the  stick  is  pulled  directly
   backwards, the car will brake quickly and then drive in reverse.

   GETTING  IN  AND OUT OF THE VEHICLE. The "G" key will allow the driver to
   leave  the  car.  Hitting "G" again will allow the driver to re-enter his
   car if near it. You cannot enter any car but your own.

   GUNNERY:  Weapons  are numbered from 1 to 0 (10) in the upper left corner
   of your car display screen. Each time you press the space bar, the active
   weapon  changes.  Set  your  active  weapon by pressing the corresponding
   number  on  the  keyboard.  Use  the  joystick button to fire your active
   weapon. If you hold it down, the weapon will fire repeatedly.

   STATUS:  There  are keyboard commands to let you check the status of your
   character.  These  are  provided so you don't have to write down personal
   information  on  each driver. They can be used at virtually any time once
   play begins; refering to them will suspend play, even during combat.

   CTRL-D  -  Driver status. Displays driver's skills, bank account, health,
   and body armor, and whether he has a clone at Gold Cross.

   CTRL-C  -  Car  status.  Displays  name, components, performance figures,
   current  damage,  and  current value of the active car. Also displays the
   driver's bankroll.

   CTRL-R  -  Roster  of cars. Displays names of all cars currently owned by
   the driver, and the city where each is stored.

   CTRL-T  -  Task  status. Displays a list of all courier jobs and salvaged
   weapons being carried in the active car.


                                                          Autoduel    Page 3

   CTRL-L - Location. Displays the location of the driver (by city, road, or
   arena contest) and the current date.

   CTRL-S - Sound. Toggles the game sound on or off.

   SPACEBAR  -  Continue.  Allows  player  to  escape  the normal delay time
   provided to allow a text message to be read.

   Q  -  Quit.  Save the game. When you restart the game, you will be in the
   truck  stop  of  your current city (if you are on the road) the last city
   you  were  in.  This  command  must  be  used  to  finish a play session.
   Otherwise, your driver will be dead the next time the disk is booted.


                        G E T T I N G   S T A R T E D 
        When you start the game, you don't have any possessions except $2000
   in cash. The first thing you should do is hike over to the truck stop and
   buy some body armor. Then you will want to earn some money. You don't yet
   have  enough money to buy a car, so you should head down to the arena for
   amateur night.



                     T R A V E L   A R O U N D   T O W N 
        When  you  are  in  a city or town, you can use the joystick to move
   around the streets and into the buildings. Each building has a door. When
   you  enter  the door, the town map will vanish and you will be greeted by
   the  inhabitants  of  the building. Each building will give you a menu of
   different possible actions.


   T H E   T R U C K   S T O P 
        The  truck  stop  is  "neutral  territory" - nobody fights there and
   anyone can rest or pick up rumors.


   ( 1 )   C A T C H   A   B U S   -   $ 1 0 0 
        If  you  need  to get to the next town and you don't have a car with
   you, this is the way to do it. A bus ride takes one day.


   ( 2 )   L I S T E N   F O R   R U M O R S 
        This takes no time and costs no money. Sometimes you will pick up an
   interesting piece of information. Of course, not all rumors are true. You
   will never hear more than 1 rumor per day in the same place.


   ( 3 )   G E T   B A T T E R I E S   C H A R G E D   -   $ 5 0 
        This  takes  no  time.  It  brings your car's power plant up to full
   charge.


   ( 4 )   G E T   A   R O O M   -   $ 1 0 / N I G H T 
   You  can  stay  for as long as you want; when the clerk asks you how many
   nights  you  will  be  staying, type in the number. Some clerks will take
   pity  on  a  driver who's broke and let them sleep in the lobby, but this
   can be risky.

        Body  armor  gives you 3 more damage points. Damaged armor cannot be
   repaired, so it has no trade-in value. If you are already wearing damaged
   body armor, it will be replaced with a new set.

        This  is  the huge, automated factory where new dueling vehicles are
   built. Assembly lines are only found in New York, Boston, and Pittsburgh.
   The  only  reason  to  visit here is to buy a new car, custom-tailored to
   your  specifications.  No driver can own more than 8 cars. If you already
   own 8 cars, you cannot visit the assembly line. If you enter the assembly
   line  by  mistake, you can leave by hitting a <CR> immediately when asked
   for the name of the car you want to build.


   T H E   S A L V A G E   Y A R D 
        This  a  large  lot  full  of  damaged  and wrecked cars, dismounted
   weapons, and piles of spare parts.


   ( 1 )   S E L L   A   C A R 
        You  must  have an active vehicle - you cannot sell a car unless you
   drive it into the lot. The salvage operator will make you an offer, which
   you are free to accept or decline.


   ( 2 )   S E L L   W E A P O N S   O F F   Y O U R   C A R 
        Again,  you  must  have an active vehicle. The operator will ask you
   which of its weapons you want to sell.


   ( 3 )   S E L L   S A L V A G E D   G O O D S 
        This is your chance to sell the weapons and other gear that you have
   salvaged  from  the  vehicles  you defeated on the road. You cannot mount
   salvaged weapons in your own car.


   T H E   W E A P O N   S H O P 
        This  is  a  showroom  featuring  the  latest in vehicle weapons and
   high-quality ammunition.


   ( 1 )   B U Y   W E A P O N S 
        The  prices  are the same as those charged at the assembly line, and
   the  shop  will  install the weapons at no extra charge. You cannot add a
   weapon unless your car has the space for it.


   ( 2 )   B U Y   A M M U N I T I O N 
        You  will  be  given  a list of the weapons in your car; you can buy
   ammo  for  any  or  all  of  them.  Each  weapon's magazine has a limited
   capacity of 20 rounds, and cannot be overfilled.


   T H E   G A R A G E 

   ( 1 )     R E C H A R G E     Y O U R     P O W E R     S U P P L Y    -

        This is the same service available at the truck stop.

        You  must  be  driving  a car to have it repaired. The mechanic will
   give  a  repair  estimate  for each component, and ask which one you want
   fixed.  Repair  cost  depends  on original cost and the amount of damage.
   Most  items  must  be  repaired completely or not at all. Tires cannot be
   repaired,  they must be replaced. Armor can be partially repaired, if you
   can't afford to fix it entirely.


   ( 3 )   S T O R E   Y O U R   A C T I V E   C A R 
        The  garage will store the car you're driving (leaving you on foot).
   The  fee  to  store a car is $50, but you don't have to pay until you get
   the car back.


   ( 4 )   T A K E   A   C A R   O U T   O F   S T O R A G E   -   $ 5 0 
        The garage attendant will give you a list of all your cars stored in
   the city; you can choose which one you want.

        Each course lasts 5 days; there is no limit to the number of courses
   you  can take. Each course may raise your mechanic skill by a few points.
   The higher your skill, the less likely it is to be improved by a course.

        You  must be in your car. This is a good chance to get the "feel" of
   a new vehicle, and to find out how the arena is laid out.


   ( 2 )   G E T   A   S C H E D U L E   O F   E V E N T S 
        This  will  tell  you  what  events  will happen on what day at that
   arena.  All  arena schedules are different. When the gatekeeper gives you
   the schedule, you will be asked if you wish to compete in the days event.
   There  is  no  penalty  for  declining.  Note  that  registering  for and

   agent  on  duty  may  turn  you  down if your prestige is too low; if the
   mission is thought to be too dangerous for your car; or if the payload is
   too  large  or  too  heavy  for the space or weight capacity of your car.
   Also, you cannot carry more than 3 payloads at the same time.

        This medical corporation has facilities in Boston and New York. Each
   Gold  Cross  office is a hospital. Also, you can order a clone - provided
   you  can afford one. This is a genetically accurate duplicate of your own
   body. Gold Cross can also store all your memories on a cassette, called a
   "braintape".  If  something  fatal  happens  to  you,  your clone will be
   activated  -  with  all  the skills you had at the time the braintape was
   made.


   ( 1 )   C R E A T E   A   C L O N E   -   $ 5 0 0 0 
        You can only have 1 clone at a time. Along with the clone, you get 1
   free  braintape storing your skills, personality, etc. If you are killed,
   your  clone will be activated in the city where it was created. The clone
   is  legally  "you", and still has your bank balance and prestige. It owns
   all your cars except for the one you were driving when you were killed.


   ( 2 )   U P D A T E   A   B R A I N T A P E   -   $ 3 0 0 0 
        You  must  already have a clone. When you update your braintape, you
   store  your  current  skills, rather than those you had when you made the
   original  clone.  You  do not have to be at the same Gold Cross office as
   your clone to do this.

        The  bar  will  probably  contain  a  seedy character who will buy a
   payload  from  you  -  at  a  fraction of its value. This is a quick, but
   crooked way to earn money. If you try it, your prestige will go down, and
   you may eventually run afoul of the law. You may also sell salvaged goods
   here.

        The  game is 5 card draw; house rules let you discard all 5 cards if
   you like, and an ace low straight is legal. If you can't make a hand, you
   lose your bet. If you make a good hand, you get the following payoff:


         Pair: 1 for 1 - you break even     Flush: 5 for 1
         Two Pair: 2 for 1                  Full House: 7 for 1
         Three of a kind: 3 for 1           Four of a kind: 25 for 1

        Also  known  as  "21".  The object is to draw cards until you get as
   close  to  a count of 21 as possible - without going over. Numbered cards
   count  face  value:  face  cards  count 10. An ace can count as 1 or 11 -
   whichever is better for you. The dealer must draw until the hand is above
   16,  or until it has gone over 21. The dealer wins ties. Any hand (dealer
   or player) wins if it gets 5 cards without busting, or if it gets a count
   of  exactly 21. Payoff is 2 for 1 on a normal win. If you get a blackjack
   -  that  is, if your first 2 cards add to 21 - you get 3 for 1 payoff. To
   leave  the  casino,  bet  0  on  either game, or press <CR> when asked to

   track  of time, a day at a time, as you play. Joe's Bar, the truck stops,
   Gold Cross, and the FBI are open 24 hours a day. All others are only open
   in  the daytime. Walking around town takes no time, but certain things do
   take time. Any of the following things will take a full day:

        Getting a clone made or a braintape updated at Gold Cross

        Building a car

        Having a car repaired

        Picking up a courier job

        Taking mechanic classes


        After  you  do  any  of  these  things,  you will find the shops are
   closed,  and you must get a night's sleep. A new day will start after you
   do any of the following things:


        Spend the night at the truck stop

        Take a bus to another town

        Heal injuries at Gold Cross

        Drive on the road a significant stretch of time

        When a new day starts, you are free to visit the shops again.

        Your  car's  weapons do a certain amount of damage whenever they hit
   an enemy car. The bigger the weapon, and the better the marksmanship, the
   more  damage  each  hit will do. Each weapon has a certain probability of
   hitting  the target, which is further modified by your marksmanship. When
   you  do  enough  damage to an enemy vehicle, it will crash or catch fire,
   and  you have defeated it. Unfortunately, your foes will be shooting back
   at  you all the while. Your combat screen will tell you exactly where you
   have  been  hit,  and  how much damage has been taken. Every component of
   your  car has a certain number of "Damage Points" (DP). This is a measure
   of  the  damage  that component can take and still function. For example,
   each point of armor has 1 DP. A flamethrower has 2 DP. Your driver's body
   has  3  DP, but if you wear body armor, you have 6 DP. When an enemy hits
   you,  the  first shots will wear away the armor on the side that has been
   hit.  When  the armor is gone, the next thing to be destroyed will be the
   weapon(s) on that side. Then (for attacks from the front) the power plant
   goes.  Then  you are hit. Attacks from the side may hit you, or the power
   plant, or the cargo, after they destroy the armor and weapons. Therefore,
   if  armor  on  one  side  is  badly damaged, turn that side away from the
   enemy.  Tires  will  be  hurt by mines and spikes, and sometimes by other
   attacks. Underbody armor is only affected by mines.

        When  you  enter  the assembly line, your first step is to name your
   new  car.  The  name should be different than any already in use, and may
   have  up to 16 letters. Look thru all the options for your car and select
   the  ones  you want. Line foremen will keep track of all these things for
   you  as  you  modify your car design, to make sure your car will work. If
   you  make  an  illegal  choice,  the  screen  will display question marks
   (?????)  in  the  appropriate field. For instance, if you select a weapon
   that  is too big for your car, the "spaces left" field will show question
   marks.  You can make an illegal selection, and then change other parts of

        PRICE  is  the  dollar cost of the body without armor, but including
   headlights,   trim,  seats,  doors,  instruments,  basic  target  system,
   heads-up windshield visual display, etc.

        WEIGHT  is the weight of the body and frame, which counts toward the
   total weight of the vehicle.

        MAXIMUM LOAD is the total weight (including the body and frame) this
   size vehicle can carry. Maximum load can be altered - see chassis.

        SPACES  is  the  number  of  spaces  available  in  the  vehicle for
   equipment, weapons, people, and cargo.

        The  chassis  can  be  strengthened to allow a vehicle to carry more
   weight, or lightened to save money.

   example,  putting  a  heavy chassis on a mid-sized car would increase the
   maximum load 10%: 4800 + 480 = 5280 lbs capacity. It would add 50% of the
   original  body  price  - another $300. Chassis strength does not affect a
   vehicles weight or interior space.

        Suspension  determines  a  vehicles  handling  class. The higher its
   handling  class,  the  better  it will steer and the easier it is to keep
   control.

        Light  suspension  is  standard.  Better  suspensions  add  cost  in
   relation  to  the  original body cost of the vehicle - a heavy suspension
   for  a  luxury  car  would  cost $1200 (150% of $800). Suspension adds no
   weight and space.

        AUTOMOBILE  HC  is the handling class for an automobile - subcompact
   thru luxury size.

        CARGO  VEHICLE HC is the handling class for a station wagon, pickup,
   or van. Cargo vehicles always have a lower handling class than cars. This
   is due to their higher center of gravity.

   lasers or accelerate, but all other systems still work.

        POWER  factors  are  used  to compute acceleration. A vehicles power
   must  be at least 1/3 its weight; that gives an acceleration of 5 mph. If
   its  power is at least 1/2 its weight, its acceleration is 10 mph. If its
   power is equal to (or greater than) its weight, it has an acceleration of
   15.

        All  weapons  have  a capacity of 20 shots, except lasers (which run
   off  the  power  plant)  and heavy rockets (which fire once). COST is the
   price  of  the  weapon. WEIGHT is the weight of the weapon. SPACES is the
   amount  of  space  the weapon takes up. DP is the amount of damage it can
   take  before  it  is destroyed. CP/R is the cost per round of ammunition.
   WP/R is the weight per round of ammunition.

        Your  vehicle  can  carry  armor  in 5 positions: front, back, left,
   right,  and  bottom.  You  can  put  different  amounts  of armor in each
   location,  but  the  cost per point is the same, no matter where it goes.
   The bigger the vehicle, the more its armor costs and weighs.

        Each  point  of  armor can take 1 hit - then it is destroyed. So, if
   you have 40 points of armor on the front of your car, it can take 40 hits
   before the weapons and interior are exposed.

        Each  round of ammunition is actually a burst of 4 slugs, making the
   potential  damage  from  a perfect hit quite devastating. Since the MG is
   commonly  used,  many of your foes will be using it also, and your chance
   to salvage ammo is better.


   F L A M E T H R O W E R 
        The  disadvantages  of  the flamethrower are its short range and its
   weight.  Add  to  this  the  fact that it often sets your kills on fire -
   making  salvage  impossible.  The fact remains that the FT is very deadly
   within  its  range.  For  obvious  reasons, a FT cannot be mounted to the
   front  of your car. A FT can be offensive as well as defensive. Each time
   the  FT  is fired, it leaves a smoke cloud - which blocks the enemys view
   of  you.  If  your enemy has a FT, try to stay in front (if you have rear
   mounted  weapons).  If  you  must  stay  behind,  keep  at  a  respectful
   distance.


   R O C K E T   L A U N C H E R 
        Larger,   heavier,  and  more  destructive  than  the  machine  gun,
   unfortunately, it is somewhat less accurate - a fast moving foe can dodge
   between your rockets.

   machine gun with the punch of a rocket launcher.

        This  weapon  can only be mounted to the front or back of a vehicle.
   Although  the  cost  and  weight  of  an  AT  gun  are very high, it is a
   tremendously effective weapon.


   L A S E R 
        Lasers  get  their  power from your vehicles power plant. This means
   you  never have to buy ammunition - and a battery charge is a lot cheaper
   than AT shells. A full battery will fire a laser 99 times.


   H E A V Y   R O C K E T 
        The  rocket is best used at close range, to make sure of a hit...but
   if it hits, it can destroy a foe in a single shot.


   M I N E D R O P P E R 
        This  is  why you need underbody armor. Mines can also destroy tires
   in  a  very  short order. They are especially effective against cyclists.
   However,  don't  be  so  careless as to back over your own mines. You may
   only locate a minedropper on the back of your car.

        The  sharp  metal spikes are deadly against most tires, but will not
   penetrate  solid tires. This also can only be mounted on the back of your
   car.

        A  purely  defensive  weapon,  the smokescreen hides you, so you can

        The  oil  jet  lays  down  a thin but slippery slick. It can only be

   may get stuck.

   S I D E 
        The  least  common  location.  Side  mounted weapons lead to unusual
   tactics  -  such as sitting still and letting the foe slide by you, right
   into  your  sights. Side weapons are more common in the arena than on the
   road  -  but  they  can  be  very useful for couriers, especially for the
   larger,  multi-gun  vehicles. Side mounting is good for secondary weapons
   (like MG's) than for your main AT gun or laser.

   all  of  your  opponents,  and  drive out under your own power. (When you
   defeat  your  last  foe, a trumpet will sound to signal your victory.) If
   you  see that you're losing, you can try to escape. This will reduce your

        To  enter,  you  must  enter  the  arena on foot, and have less than
