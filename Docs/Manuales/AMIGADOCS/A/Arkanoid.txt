TO START:

Amiga's internal disk drive.  When the workbench prompt appears, eject the
Kickstart Disk and insert your ARKANOID Disk.

workbench prompt.

If your  Amiga is already running you can start ARKANOID simply by holding
down the CTRL key and both Amiga keys at the same time with the ARKANOID
disk in the internal drive.  

The game will load automatically and go into DEMO mode.

press the F2 key for a two player game.  When the game starts, use the
mouse to move your Vaus under the Energy Ball.  You can reinforce your Vaus
by catching the spinning Power Capsules which drop from the top of the
screen.  Loosing your Energy Ball kills the Vaus so be careful!  Try to
clear as many levels as you can. GOOD LUCK!
     
KEYBOARD COMMANDS:  The SPACEBAR pauses and un-pauses the game.  NUMBER
keys 1-5 select the Energy Ball's starting speed.   A key will switch the
Audio off and on.  

Macintosh 512E, 512KE, PLUS, SE, and Mac II

BEFORE YOU START: To play ARKANOID, follow the same operations as you would
when running other programs on the Macintosh.  You must use a mouse to
control the Vaus.  If you are unfamiliar with using the mouse or loading
the program, please consult the Owner's Manual.

TO START: Because some games may leave traces of themselves in the
computer's memory, it is important to clear previously loaded programs
before you load the game.  You are able to load ARKANOIS from the Finder. 
However, to avoid any chances of previous programs interferring with your
game play, power up or restart your computer using the ARKANOID disk in the
internal drive.

TO PLAY THE GAME: Double-click on the ARKANOID icon.  The ARKANOID title
and screen will appear while the program is loading.  Press the 1 key to
start ARKANOID for one player or press the 2 key for a two player game. 
When the game starts, use the mouse to move your Vaus under the Energy
Ball.  You can reinforce your Vaus by catching the spinning Power Capsules
that drop from the top of the screen.  Losing your Energy Balls kills the
Vaus, so be careful!  Try to clear as many levels as you can.  GOOD LUCK!

KEYBOARD COMMANDS: The SPACEBAR pauses and un-pauses the game.  Press the T
key once to slow the energy ball.  If you want the ball to resume its
faster speed, press the T key again.  The A key will adjust the audio
level.  Holding the "fire button" while pressing 1 or 2 for a one or two
player game will cause the game to skip the opening animations.
