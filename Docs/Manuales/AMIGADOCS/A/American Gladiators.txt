                  AMERICAN GLADIATORS AMIGA INSTRUCTIONS

The following instructions pertain to the differences between the Amiga
game and the IBM instructions.


TO PLAY AMERICAN GLADIATORS YOU MUST UNPLUG THE MOUSE!


The Amiga version only uses the joysticks, with one joystick assigned to
either player.

        Player 1 Blue uses port 2 (a500)
        Player 2 Red  uses port 1 (a500)

The only keyboard key is spacebar used in the assault for picking up the
weapon.



Entering Your Name

Your name is entered using the joysticks on the Amiga by moving the
flashing block and pressing the fire button to select.



Eliminator

Handbike controls are a circular motion up, right, down, left, etc.

Cargo net controls are a figure of 8 up, right, left, down, ad infinitum.

                 AMERICAN GLADIATORS - INSTRUCTION MANUAL


                               INTRODUCTION

Survival of the Fittest

They're fit, they're tough and they have the hardest bodies in the country.
Now they're ready to pit their physical power against yours. Even if it's
only from the wrist down.

American Gladiators, an exciting television show, is now providing even
more excitement on your computer screen. A chance for you to compete
against the characters you have grown to love or hate.


Seven Sensational Events

They're here, all the events you have been waiting for. So try your hand
at the JOUST. Or climb the WALL. Swing into action with HUMAN CANNONBALL.
Stuff it and run in POWERBALL. Then blast'em into oblivion with ASSAULT.
Or smash and bash them in the new ATLASPHERE game. Finally - if you can
make it - encounter the greatest challenge of all: ELIMINATOR!

Each requires a different set of strength, strategy and timing. So, in
each event, your joystick or computer keyboard will perform slightly
differently. Because each game is different, it's important that you read
and understand the joystick specifics for each game.

THE ASSAULT

A frantic war of bazooked tennis balls and safety barricades. Target a spot
just above the gladiator while running for cover.

JOUST

A test of balance, stability and strength. Played with a seven-foot pugil
stick on a four-foot platform.

HUMAN CANNONBALL

Turn your body into a ball of solid human muscle and aim it at a gladiator
on a pedastal.

THE WALL

You get a 10-second lead in this ascent of a sheer 30-foot high wall. And
you're going to need it.

ATLASPHERE

The newest event in the American Gladiators competetion, it's the 60-second
aerobic version of the demolition derby. Smash or be smashed.

POWERBALL

Get teh regulation soccer balls into the containers, while the American
Gladiators try to get you.

ELIMINATOR

They call it "Eliminator" because there are actually eight seperate
obstacles which you'll either overcome - or be eliminated by.



                             KEYBOARD CONTROLS

If you don't want to use the joystick, you have the option of selecting
keyboard controls. To do this, make the appropriate selections, when you
load the program.

These are the default control keys for players 1 and 2:

                  HINTS AND TIPS FOR AMERICAN GLADIATORS

ASSAULT - Time your shots carefully. Tempt the gladiator to shoot, then,
as soon as he does, dodge back. Then run out and shoot.

JOUST - Remember the whirling overhead strike is just as effective as 3
jabs to the stomach. When you have your opponent down to half strength,
switch over to the offensive and keep rainign blows to the head, forcing him
back. Altough you will suffer a few bruises, you can now afford to trade
blows. Always fo for the draw rather than risk defeat. A draw is worth 5
pts., but a defeat gives you nothing but a grudge.

HUMAN CANNONBALL - This event is all down to personal judgement and
timing. No clues!

THE WALL - Try to get into a rythm of direction-button-direction and
keep the momentum up, as you scale the wall.

THE ATASPHERE = Gather a high momentum; then use that momentum to swep
across the area. Stop momentarily on each pad to collect your points. Do
not get involved in duels with your opponents, as you will be wasting
time.

POWERBALL - Keep away from your opponent. He will draw at least one
Gladiator away from you, as you make your run.

ELIMINATOR - I hope you've got a lot of stamina!
