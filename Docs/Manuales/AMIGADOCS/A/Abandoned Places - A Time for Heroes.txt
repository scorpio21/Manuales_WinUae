            ABANDONED PLACES - THE 23RD CRONICLE OF KALYNTHIA
            =================================================        
                                                                    
                                                                    
INTRODUCTION                                                        
============                                                        
                                                                      
Welcome to Abandoned Places - the first of a new series of Role Playing 
games set in the mythical land of Kalynthia. You must control the lives of 
the four heroes selected to fight the evil threatening Kalynthia as they
emerge from the rock that has been their prison for 900 years. Your quest
starts beneath the temple of Heaven's light and your first task will be to 
escape back to the surface of the land, hopefully arming yourself on the 
way. Once in the outside world the decision of where to go next is 
entirely yours. You have a whole world to explore including mountains, 
deserts, oceans and of course, cities. We suggest that the first thing you
do is to take a boat to the mainland and try to find someone in the cities
who can help you decide the direction your fate will take you.
                                                                    
Abandoned Places features a variety of different graphic styles. The many
dungeons (or inner world) uses a first person perspective 3D viewpoint 
that allows you to face up to monsters as you fight them, see your wizards
cast their spells and watch the many doors, chests and traps open up before
(and if youre unlucky, beneath) you. The outer world is shown from a 
"birds eye view" to allow you to select where and how you wish to go with 
ease and speed. Finally the cities and villages are depicted by 
individually drawn pictures and descriptions. All the action is controlled
with the mouse without having to resort to any tedious typing.

BEGINNING THE QUEST.                                                 
====================

All menu choices in Abandoned Places are made using the LEFT mouse button.

Before you first play the game you may like to watch the intro for some 
background information. We also suggest that it is a good idea to format a
number of disks ready to save your game. Disks must be formatted using 
this option and you may save once to each disk. Further saves will       
overwrite the previous position.                                   
                                                                    
The Continue Old Game option is used to reload a previously saved game
position. Click on the option then follow the on screen instructions.
                                                                    
Finally, to begin adventuring for the first time click on the Start New 
Game.                                                               
                                                                    
                                                                    
CHOOSING YOUR PARTY.                                                 
====================                                                 
                                                                    
Before starting your quest you first have to select the party of four
heroes. The party must contains two warriors, a cleric and a mage. Looking
at the screen you will see twelve portraits. The top line are all warriors.
The three in the bottom left are all Clerics and the rest Mages.       
                                                                    
To choose your hero first click on the window underneath the character 
class you wish to pick (it will depress into the screen) and then click 
on the portrait of the hero you require. It will now appear in their window
with their name printed below (you can delete the shown name and use one of
your own). If you want a different hero just click on the required portrait
and it will take the place of the currently chosen hero. NOTE : you will
not be allowed to choose the same hero twice or place a hero in an 
incorrect character class.                                          
                                                                    
When you are satisfied with your choice move onto to the next one and so on
until all four heroes have been chosen. Each hero does have different 
strengths and weaknesses but these will only become apparent when playing
the game. When you are happy with all your selections click on the button
at the bottom right of the selection panel and prepare for battle.
                                                                    
                                                                    
PLAYING THE GAME - THE INNER WORLD.                                   
===================================                                   
                                                                    
At the start, and often during the game, you will hve occasions to enter
one of the dungeons, towers etc.. that comprise the inner world of
Abandoned Places.                                          
                                                                    
                                                                    
3D WINDOW.                                                        
==========                                                        
                                                                    
This is the vioew seen by your characters as they travel the inner world.
It is here that you will see the attacks of fearsome monsters, the effects
of your spells and any items of treasure you may find.       
You may manipulate the 3D window in a number of ways. Using the left
button you may:                                                 
                                                                      
       * Pick up any items you see directly in front of you.
       * Use a selected item in a characters inventory i.e. a key on locks.
       * Press any buttons/levers etc.. located on doors or walls, some 
         of these will be bovious, some less so and even some invisible.
       * Drop an item on the ground by positioning the item in the lower 
         half of the 3D window and clicking to drop it.
       * Throw an item, same as dropping except you position the item 
         on the top half of the window before clicking.        
                                                                    
Using the right mouse button will allow you to move your party. Place your
cursor arrow on the right or left of the window to turn or the middle to 
continue straight ahead, but remember, some walls can be pure illusion.
                                                                    
                                                                    
CHARACTER PORTRAITS.                                                 
====================                                                 
                                                                    
The portraits of your heroes show the general state of their health. As 
they take damage you will see the portrait start to show diminishing 
health until death. Only the front two characters can use melee weapons
in combat, the back row are abl to cast spells or use missile weapons.
                                                                    
Your warriors will attack anything facing them or on either side, whereas
your specialists will only be able to attack the monster directly ahead 
of them.                                                               
                                                                    
Clicking with the left mouse button will change which characters 
statistics are shown on screen. The right button will change your arrow to 
a small TO sign, clicking again on another portrait will swap the positions
of those two characters in your party. This can be useful especially if
one of your warriors is near death and needs to be kept from harm. At times
(normally combat) a character's portrait will flash red with a number 
printed on it. This indicates that you have been hurt and the amount of 
damage taken.                                                        
                                                                    
The left hand bar indicates the character's remaining health points.
                                                                    
The right hand bar indicates the character's remaining spell/action 
points.                                                               
                                                                    
The segmented diamond below shows the direction each character is facing.
Normally this will be forward as represented by the highlighted diamond, 
however, you may well be attacked from more than one direction so clicking
on a different diamond using the left mouse button means you can fight in 
more than one direction simultaneously. Make sure if you use this option
that one character is not facing another so that you are fighting yourself
as it leads to an early death !!!                                   
                                                                    
The two boxes on either side of the directional indicator show what you 
are holding in each hand at that moment, generally Warriors will be 
carrying weapons and shields, whilst the Clerics and Mages will have 
torches or wands ready. Use the left mouse button to take or put an 
object into a hand. The right mouse button will use an object in the 
hand ie: it will swing a sword, eat some food, climb down a rope or 
light a torch etc.                                                 
                                                                    
You will find literally hundreds of items on your quest. Experimenting will
allow you to discern their uses.                                          
                                                                    
Once you have performed an action with a hand the appropriate box will 
become shaded meaning an action is being carried out. Some actions take 
longer than others; for instance hitting with an open hand is far quicker
than swinging a heavy Longsword. Whilst a box is shaded you will not be 
able to perform another action with that hand until it is coloured black
once more. NOTE: If you are using a weapon and the box turns red it means
that you have succesfully struck your foe.                            
                                                                    
                                                                    
SPELL/ACTION BOX.                                                 
=================                                                        
                                                                    
All selections on this menu are made with the left mouse button.
                                                                    
The numbers (1-4) in this section refer to which characters abilities you 
are looking at and correspond to the location of the portraits.       
                                                                    
The UP and DOWN arrows allow you to scroll the portraits once you have 
gained sufficient spells. Using the right mouse buttn scrolls the menu at
twice the speed.                                                        
                                                                    
The menu itself contains the list of spells that can be cast by the 
selected character and also the cost in spell points. On first starting the
game you will find that you have hardly any spells, don't worry, you will 
be given more as you gain experience.                                   
                                                                    
To cast a spell highlight the one you require and just click on it. If the
spell is to be cast on a character a glowing hand will appear. Move the 
hand over the character you wish to effect and click on the portrait.
This generally applies to the healing spells.                     
                                                                    
Some spells you cast such as LIGHT, STRENGTH, or MAGE SHIELD last for some 
time, to show that they are in operation an appropriate graphic will appear
in the top left panel of the screen. When it dissappears the spell has
ended.                                                               
                                                                    
Warriors also have some abilities on this menu although they are non 
magical but are operated in the same way. These are:                
                                                                    
Bandage : Allows the character to perform very minor healing. Useful at
          low level.                                                                                                               
Climb   : Allows the party to climb through openings in the ceiling of
          dungeons.                                                        
Pull    : Allows the character to pull something blocking the party's
          progress along the dungeon floor.                     
Push    : Opposite to pull.                                          
                                                                    
Used spell/action points will gradually be regained with the passing of 
time. Sleeping will greatly accelerate this process as will progressing 
to the next level of experience.                                          
                                                                    
                                                                    
THE BOOK OF THE WORLD.                                                 
======================                                                 
                                                                    
For much of the game this panel will do nothing, however, should you 
manage to find the fabled Book of the World your spellcasters will find 
certain dungeon maps located within. If so then this area will then 
become a localised map of your surrounding area.                     
                                                                    
                                                                    
MOVEMENT PAD.

An alternative way to move around is the use of this pad, use the left 
mouse button to select the required direction. The straight arrows will 
move your party and the curved arrows will turn them around. Movement can
also be accomplished through the use of the keyboard.

Here you can read any descriptions of objects picked up, dungeon 
descriptions, spells cast and character status etc.              
                                                                    
                                                                    
OPTIONS.                                                               
========                                                               
                                                                    
Use the right mouse button on this box to cycle through the available 
options. The left mouse button selects your choice.

            Just press a key or mouse button to resume.              
Zzzz      : The party will camp. Health and spell points will be regained
            but food will be depleted. You can only camp when the party is
            tired, also, any torches or spells you are using will probably
            run out.

FX        : Turns the sound effects on and the music off. Note that at 
            times in a dungeon it can be very useful to hear the sound
            effects, especially of nearby doors opening or your party 
            stepping on a concealed pressure plate.                     
                                                                    
                                                                    
INVENTORY.

clicking the left mouse button.                                   
                                                                    
                                                                    
CHARACTER STATISTICS.                                                 
=====================                                                     
                                                                    
The statistics make each of your characters different and will affect their
combat ability to a great extent.                                   
                                                                    
Name    : Your character's monika.
Class   : Your character's class.
Health  : Shows maximum character's health, followed by current health.
Magic   : Shows maximum character's magic , followed by current magic.
Armor   : Your protecion level. The higher the better.
Food    : Length of time remaining before you begin to starve.       
Carry   : Shows the weight of items carried. If the text is highlighted
          red you are carrying too much and will tire easily in combat
          making you character much slower.
Money   : The personal wealth of the character.
                                                                    
Clicking with the left button on the statistics window will bring up 
another page.                                                        
                                                                    
Level      : The attained level of the character.
Experience : Experience points gained. Your experience will increase as 
             characters perform actions relating to their class. For 
             instance, a warrior hitting a monster with his sword will gain
             experience for the blow, however, no-one else in the party 
             will gain epxerience for another's actions so make sure you
             use each member of the party to the best of their abilities
             otherwise you may find that when you really need to cast
             Ice Strike all your mage can muster is a Light spell.
                                                                    
Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, Constitution - these are all 
your character's natural skills.                                   
                                                                         
                                                                    
WEARING ITEMS.                                                        
==============                                                 
                                                                         
If you wish to wear an item just place it on the area of the body it is to 
worn and click. You may also place an item in a hand although you cant use
items from this section.                                                 
                                                                    
Placing GOLD over the pouch and clicking with the left mouse button will 
drop the gold into the pouch and so increase your wealth. Clicking on the
pouch with the left mouse button with no gold will allow you to take gold
out again and transfer it to another character. This would normally be
done if one character becomes heavily weighted down. To transfer gold enter
the amount using the pouches number pad and click on OK to continue. Enter
the amount of gold or silver you wish to transfer (Whole numbers represent 
goldm silver represents tenths). After entering the amount the gold will 
appear as an item which you must click on the recipient's pouch or 
inventory.                                                        
                                                                    
                                                                    
DUNGEON NOTE.                                                            
=============                                                        
                                                                    
You might notice that when you enter or leave a dungeon some items you are
carrying dissappear from your inventory. This is because certain items
notably keys, are specific to a particular dungeon or a quest has been
completed. This is deliberate and will not affect the game in any way.
                                                                    
                                                                    
PLAYING THE GAME - THE OUTER WORLD.                            
===================================                            
                                                                    
Hopefully, after not too long, you will find that you have made it to the 
outer world of Kalynthia. It is here that your travelling will take place.
                                                                    
One of the first things that you will notice is that the land features many
different types of terrain. This will affect your speed of travel and the 
possibility of being attacked ie: riding on a trail is a lot quicker and 
safer than walking over mountains. You will also find some types of 
landscape eg:rivers impassable unless you are able to use a different 
method of travelling.                                                    
                                                                    
The land itself is actually divided into several different states each 
with its own capital and leader. It is up to you to locate these leaders 
and if possible work with them. Who you help will dictate the course of 
your fate in Abandoned Places and the game will change for each. You will
need to pay to enter a number of cities so guard against oeverspending or
run the risk of being left wandering in the wilderness.       
                                                                    
Finally, the capital city of the world is KAL KALON and is ruled by the 
wise ones.                                                               
                                                                    
Whilst you journey through th land your party is depicted by an icon of a 
man with a pointer. You are located exactly at the end of the pointer. All
menu selection in the outer world can be made with any mouse button. A 
selected icon will be shaded dark to show that it has been selected.
                                                                    
At some point you will inevitably be attacked by wandering monsters. When 
this happens you will fight the encounter as though you were in a dungeon.
You must fight until either the party or all monsters have been slain.
When this occurs the warrior icon in the bottom right of the screen will 
change to a laurel wreath, select it to resume your travels.       
                                                                    
                                                                    
THE TRAVEL ICONS.                                                        
=================                                                        
                                                                    
MODES OF TRAVEL
---------------                                   
                                                                    
By Foot : The slowest means of travel available and almost the most likely
          to be attacked by wandering monsters.                     
                                                                    
By Horse: A lot quicker than walking and can take you almost anywhere.
                                                                    
By Ship : As you look down on Kalynthia you will see the many ships sailing
          from port to port. To catch a ride on one of these vssels move 
          your party icon to where a ship docks and then select the travel
          icon. The ship option should now be available. Once selected just
          wait and the ship will set sail. You cannot control the 
          destination of ships.                                          
By Air  : If you grow powerful enough you spellcasters may learn the FLY 
          spell. This is the fastest method of travel and cannot be 
          attacked by wandering monsters or impeded by the terrain. However
          you will not be able to enter any town or city unless your feet 
          are firmly on the ground.                                   
                                                                    
Once you have made your choice reselect the travel icon to continue your
journey, the picture in the bottom left of the screen will change to show
the current means of travel.                                          
                                                                    
                                                                    
CAMPING.                                                        
========                                                        
                                                                    
Camping takes place when night falls. If you are not tired you may have 
the option of walking on through the night although the chances of being 
attacked are greatly increased.                                          
                                                                    
Camp Fire : A cheery fire helps keep unwanted guests away.              
                                                                    
Set Guard : If your warriors are alive you may increase your protection
            by setting a watch.
