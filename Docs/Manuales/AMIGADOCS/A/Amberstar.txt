VIRUS WARNING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  original  AMBERSTAR  game discs we supply are guaranteed to be free of
virus  infections.  In order to avoid destruction of the program by a virus
you  should  switch  off  your  computer  and all equipment connected to it
(separate disc drive, monitor etc.) for at least 30 seconds before you load
the program.  Only in this way can you be certain that no virus is alive in
the  computer's  memory.   Thalion  Software  GmbH cannot accept any claims
under  the  warranty  if  any  part of the program or program data has been
destroyed or affected by a virus, a virus protector or other tools.

LOADING AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  AMBERSTAR program is supplied on three discs and includes this manual.
The  game also includes a map, a novel and a table of runes.  You will find
the  last  three  items at various locations when you play the game.  Leave
them  alone for now and only look at the card, the novel and the table of
runes when you actually discover them during your adventures.


You need approx. 2.5 MB (2,621,440 bytes) of memory available in the
disc partition onto which AMBERSTAR is installed. The installation rou-
tine creates a folder called AMBRSTAR in the selected partition and cop-
ies all the data and the program into it. And even when using a hard disc,
always remember: If you want to play the program again right from the be-
ginning, you must always install AMBERSTAR again.

- Switch on your computer and the hard disc.
- Place the original disc 1 of AMBERSTAR in the internal drive (A: or
  DF0:).
- Double click on the drive symbol A: or the disc icon of the AMBERSTAR 
  disc 1.
- Double click on the INSTALL program.
- Follow the on-screen instructions.

				> 9 <

LOADING FROM HARD DISC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open the partition into which you installed AMBERSTAR. Double click
on the folder AMBRSTAR to open it and then double click on the
AMBRSTAR program to run it.


				> 10 <

THE CHARACTER EDITOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each time you install AMBERSTAR on a hard disc or floppy disc the character
editor appears first.  Under the party ID (identification) at the right you
will  see  a poster of your herQ Below it is the icon panel and to the left
of it is a panel for entering the characteristics of the person in- volved.
You  can  set  up these characteristics and some details of the poster with
this character editor.  

				> 11 < 


The numeric keypad corresponds to the layout of the
keys in the icon panel:

[1] Characteristics are set by chance by using the dice. You can click on
    this icon as often as you wish.
[2] This makes the character female.
[3] This makes thecharacter male.
[4] Give your hero a name which can consist of up to 15 characters.
[7] Choose a portrait for your herQ
[9] Only click on this icon when all the data is just how you want it.

When you have exited from the character editor you cannot return to it
during a game even if you start the program again after saving your inter-
mediate situation. The character editor is only ever available the very
FIRST time a newly installed AMBERSTAR game is started.

				> 12 <

SCREEN LAYOUT, CONTROL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The screen is divided into five sections:  The party ID is at the top edge,
the  graphics  window  to the left below it, the display panels for special
items  and  magic  spells  are at the right and the monitor panel is at the
bottom right.

You  control the game with the mouse or the numeric keypad on the keyboard.
In the manual the two mouse buttons are abbreviated to LMB for for the Left
Mouse  Button  and RMB for the Right Mouse Button.  The numeric keys [1] to
[9]  correspond  to  the  functions  of the monitor panel which can also be
selected with the mouse.


THE PARTY ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~
For  each of the six characters in your party the party ID (identification)
has  a  picture with two bars and a special display to its right.  The name
of  the  person  appears  below  the  picture.  If the name is displayed in
bright  letters,  the  person is active.  The active character executes all


				> 13 <

the  actions - for example SPEAKING, SEARCHING.  The lefthand bar indicates
the  number  of  life  points remaining and the righthand bar indicates the
magic  spell  points,  i.e.   the person's capacity to perform as a wizard.
Special conditions for the person are shown above the two bars, such as for
example illness, madness or blindness.

The  active  person  can  be  changed  with  the LMB.  All characters whose
condition  makes  activity  impossible  cannot  be  selected.  Click on the
picture  of  the  character  required.   The keys [1] to [6] on the numeric
keypad also execute this function.

Whenever the party ID is accessible with the mouse pointer the first status
page of the character can be called with the RMB. The function keys [F1]
to [F6] call the second page of the relevant character.


DISPLAY PANELS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Items which give the party helpful information are displayed in the upper
of the two display panels, such as for example a compass or a clock.

				> 14 <

These items can be bought or found by the party during the adventure.
Temporary magic spells are shown as symbols on the magic spell display
panel.

CONTROL PANEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  set of icons for movements on a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional display
are  shown  here as required or, after switching with the RMB, action icons
are  shown.   Select one of the icons with the LMB.  The keys [1] to [9] on
the numeric keypad always correspond to the nine icons on the panel.

MOVEMENT ICONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Either  the  2-dimensional  or  3-dimensional  set  of  icons is available,
depending upon the location of the party as displayed.

				> 15 <

The directions available in the 2-dimensional set are as follows:

Numeric keypad 	Cursor block 	Icon	Direction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   [2]              \/		 \/	Back Without Turning.
   [3]				 :->	Turn 180 degrees right.

				> 18 <


ACTION ICONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Press  the  RMB on the control panel and the nine action icons will appear.
All  icons which cannot operate in the current situation or which cannot be
used  by  the  active character are shown with bright shading and cannot be
selected.   Unless  they  are  general  functions,  these only apply to the
active  character.   The layout of the numeric keys corresponds to the nine
icons.   On  the  screen the cursor always takes on the shape of the action
selected.   The  functions are as follows from bottom left (key [1]) to top
right (key [9]):

- Map drawer ([1] - Map). Only active in the 3-D mode.
  Automatically draws a map of the labyrinth where the party is
  located.

- Set battle formation ([2] - Figures). This allows you to change the
  members of your party for the next round of the battle.

				> 19 <

- Options ([3] - Disc). Special functions for saving/loading the game
  situation, switching music on/off and finishing the game. With the
  SAVE function you can also dismiss members from your party.

				> 20 <


- Enter/leave your means of transport ([4] - Horse). The active
  character enters or leaves a means of transport, for example a boat
  or a horse.

- Magic spells ([5] - Stars). If the active character has enough magic
  spell points, you can compose a magic spell.

- Camping ([6] - Tent). Only outside villages and towns. Your party
  makes camp for the night.

- Read/View/Search ([7] - Eye). The active character reads a sign,
  sees something or searches in something, and the result depends
  upon his abilities. On the 3-D display this feature always operates in
  the direction as seen by the party. On the 2-D display the cursor can
  be set to a panel around the figure. The RMB interrupts this function
  and the LMB executes it.

- Listening ([8] - Ear). The active character listens and the result
  again depends upon his abilities.

				> 21 <

- Speaking ([9] - Mouth). The active figure speaks to another
  character. On the 3-D display the figure is spoken to in the same
  panel. On the 2-D display the cursor can be placed within a radius of
  two panels around the figure involved. The RMB interrupts the
  function and the LMB executes it.


				> 22 <

THE GRAPHICS WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The name of the town at which the party is located is shown above the 
graphics window. In a labyrinth the display changes from a 2-dimensional
top view to a 3-dimensional view as seen by the party. The function 
selected from the function panel is shown by the cursor in the graphics
window. The directions can always be selected directly in the graphics 
window, even if the action panel is active. The cursor therefore also 
represents the active direction here but you do not need to first click
on the function in the movement panel.

				> 23 <


SET-UP DISPLAY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  you position the mouse pointer on one of the pictures of the members in
the  party  ID  and  press  the  RMB, you move to the first set-up display.
Below  the  party  ID you will see at the right the poster of the character
selected.   Below that is the icon panel and to the left is a panel showing
the characteristics of the person involved.  Poster:


				> 24< 


POSTER:

The  poster  gives  the  race,  sex,  age, class and name of the person and
details of their number of experience, life, magic spell and spell learning
points.   It also includes information about the amount of gold, the number
of  rations,  the  combat  value  and  the  defence  performance capability
involved.

Characteristics:

This  panel shows the attributes and abilities of the person involved.  The
value  at  the  left  always gives the current status of the character; the
right gives the normal maximum value, not the value assisted by magic.  The
righthand  column  gives you information about the languages the person can
speak and a report on his physical and mental condition (blindness, illness
etc.).

				> 25 <

Two icons are active in the icon panel. The numeric keypad corresponds
to the nine keys on the icon panel:

[7] Open the rucksack (second page of the set-up display)

[9] Exit from the set-up display

When  you open the rucksack with icon 7 you are moved to the second page of
the  set-up  screen.   Below  the  party  ID  you  now see at the right the
well-known  poster  and  a  new icon panel.  To the left of that there is a
text  panel  showing  all  the  actions  you  select  in  the  icon  panel,
information  about  the  equipment  being  carried  (at  the  left) and the
contents  of  the  rucksack  (at  the  centre).   Below the display for the
equipment  which  the  character is carrying is a display showing how heavy
this  equipment  and  luggage  is  and the maximum weight the character can
carry.

				> 26 <

The keys in the icon panel correspond to the numeric keys on the
keyboard. All functions refer to icons in the luggage or the equipment
being carried:

[1] Give something to another member of the party
[2] Give gold to another member of the party

				> 27 <

[3] Give rations to another member of the party
[4] Use it
[5] Collect gold from members of the party
[6] Look at it
[7] Open the first page of the set-up display
[8] Put it down
[9] Exit from the set-up display

If  an  item from the rucksack can also be carried by hand or on your body,
you  can get it by clicking first on the item and then on the relevant part
of  the  body.   If  an  item  is to be taken from the character's body and
placed  in  the rucksack, simply click the item on the relevant part of the
body.

				> 28 <

THE DRAWER
~~~~~~~~~~
Whenever the party is moving in a 3-D area a map of the area involved is
always drawn automatically as long as there is sufflcient light and the
active character is not blind. A section of the map is displayed below the
party ID at the left. To the right of that below the legend explaining
the 

				> 29 <

symbols you used on the map there are the nine icons with which you can
move the section of the map on the display and exit from the map if you
wish. The keys in the icon panel coincide with those on the numeric
keypad.

DIALOGUE
~~~~~~~~
If your party is on the same panel as another person (3-D) or the figure is
right  next  to another figure (2-D), you can ask questions of that person.
To  do  this,  select the dialogue icon and if necessary on the 2-D display
click with the mouth cursor on the person you wish to ask.

Brief dialogue:

Some people will not enter into a protracted discussion.  When you speak to
them,  just  a  single  text  window  appears showing the information these
people  are giving.  If the text covers more than one text window, the next
part  of  the text is displayed by pressing the LMB.  When all the text has

				> 30 <

been displayed you can scroll up and down through it with the mouse and can
close the text window again by pressing the RMB.

Long dialogue:

When  someone  is  in  a  longer  discussion, the dialogue display appears.
Below  the party ID the person involved, the gold and rations of the active
character  and  the icon panel are displayed to the right of the poster.  A
text  window appears at the left and may perhaps show a list of items which
can be used for certain actions.

The  icons  on the action panel match the numeric keypad.  All actions with
items always refer to the list of items displayed below the text window and
the person approached:

[1]  Offer
[2]  Pay gold

				> 31 <

[3]  Give rations
[4]  Show
[5]  Talk
[6]  Ask them to join the party
[7]  Give to a member of the party
[8]  Dispose of or reject
[9]  Exit from the dialog

				> 32 <


HOLDING CONVERSATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you select icon 5, a list of expressions appears.  The two arrows scroll
through  the  list if it exceeds one page of text.  Select an expression by
clicking on it with the LMB.  If the expression you require is not in the
list

				> 33 <

click on the mouth icon. A text windows appears into which you can type
an expression of up to 20 letters in length.

The charcters being spoken to will respond to the expression selected
or input.

But do not rely on the existing list of expressions. Certain key words
which occur in the reply can give you furtger valuable information 
about the person involved.

THE CAMP
~~~~~~~~
You can make camp at many places where your party can rest from the toil 
of adventure and where you can learn and practise magic spells.

				> 34 <

A  picture  of  the  camp  is shown below the party ID at the left.  To the
right  of this is a text panel to show information.  At the bottom right of
the  screen  is  a  set  of  icons for the camp and to the left of this are
spaces  for various objects, mainly the scrolls from which new magic spells
can be learned.

				> 35 <


The layout of the numeric keypad on the keyboard matches the icons on
the action panel:

[1] Let your party sleep for eight hours. All party members who have
    food rations in their luggage then regenerate around a tenth of their
    magic spell and life points, but only up to the maximum value for
    the appropriate figure.

[4] With this function a character can learn a magic spell from a scroll  y
    into one of the 12 panels to the left of the icon panel.              .

[7] The magic spells shown here can be used in the camp.

E9] Use this icon to break camp to continue your journey.

				> 36 <

MAGIC
~~~~~
We  differentiate  between  three types of magic spells - white magic, grey
magic  and black magic.  Each spell has a number of spell points and learn-
ing  points  which  the  character  wishing  to learn or use the spell must
possess.   Not  all  spells can be used at every location.  Each spell only
acts  upon  certain  figures  or objects.  The spells and their effects are
shown  in  the  tables.  The abbreviation SP denotes the required number of
spell points for using a spell and SL denotes the required number of points
for learning the spell.

The place where a spell can be used is as follows:

                          W = Wilderness 	T = Town
			  D = Dungeon           B = Battle
    			  C = Camp


				> 37 <


The target affected by the spell can be as follows:

     C = A character in the party
     P = The party itself
     M = A monster (during the battle)
     G = A group of monsters (during the battle)
     A = All monsters during the battle
     O = An object.
     S = Special spell.
     LP are the life points of a character.

The  tables  showing  the  white,  grey  and  black magic give you some im-
pression  of  the abilities of a competent wizard.  Naturally a wizard must
practice  his  spells  before  he can use them safely.  The table shows how
many  spell  learning  points  are  required.  If a character can control a
spell  he  can  use  it at the appropriate location (in the wilderness or a
town,  for example) or during a battle, by using the number of spell points
given.   

				> 44 <

Spells  are always directed at certain persons, groups or objects.
A  spell intended for a monster cannot be used against a member of your
party.

If  a  spell  is  to  be  directed at a character in your party, choose the
character with the LMB.  The RMB interrupts the spell.

But  also  non-wizards  can  use magic spells if they use an object charged
with  magical  energy.   You  do not need to practice with such objects be-
cause  the spell is always successful and does not cost the person involved
y  any  spell points.  When the magical energy of an object is exhausted it
de-composes.

If necessary, a text window will open during or after a magic spell, show-
ing the results.

				> 45 <

EVENTS
~~~~~~
Events  always  refer  to  the  active  character.   He carries out all the
specific  actions  and  is  therefore  also  responsible  for  the possible
consequences.   This  naturally  excludes  events  which  affect the entire
party.

Various  actions are possible for some events.  The icons required then ap-
pear  in the control window.  Actions which would be possible in theory but
which  cannot  be executed because certain conditions are not fulfilled are
shown  in  bright  shading  and cannot be selected.  For example, it is not
possible to disable a trap before it is discovered.


DOORS
~~~~~
Many  doors  can only be opened with the correct object.  If the attempt is
unsuccessful, this could release a trap.

				> 46 <

- Exit 
  You step back from the door.

- Open the lock
  A trap can be released if you attempt to open the lock.


				> 47 <

- Use an object
The objects in the rucksack of the active character are displayed.  The RMB
interrupts  the action and the LMB selects an object.  If the object is not
the right one to open the door, the action is interrupted.  If a passkey is
used,  the  door  opens  and  the passkey disappears.  It is particularly
unfortunate  if  the passkey snaps off.  Then the lock is always locked and
the passkey is useless.

- Detect a trap
  Examine a lock for hidden traps.

- Disable a trap
  Try to disable a trap once it has been discovered.

				> 48 <

DISCOVER OBJECTS AND TREASURES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When  checking  a  locked chest it is possible that you may set off a trap.
If  you  succeed  in  opening  the  chest  without setting off the trap the
contents  of  the chest are displayed in a window.  Most chests can also be
opened with a passkey.

- Exit
  You step back from the object.

- Open the lock
  A trap can be released by an attempt to open the lock.

- Use the object
  The active character can use a suitable object from his luggage to
  open chests.

- Discover a trap
  Examine a lock for hidden traps.

				> 49 <


- Disable a trap
  Once discovered, a trap can be disabled or also set off if the attempt is
  unsuccessful.

- Take the gold
  If you find gold in the chest, this function transfers it into your 
  luggage.

  Taking gold like this depends upon whether the members of the party
  are able to carry any further luggage at all. Use the LMB to choose the
  character to take the pieces of gold and indicate how many pieces
  should be transferred to his luggage. The RMB interrupts the action.

- Distribute the gold
  This distributes gold coins found in a chest as far as possible amongst
  the luggage of the various members of the party.

- Take an object
  Use the LMB to transfer an object from the chest into the luggage of a
  member of your party. The RMB interrupts the action.

				> 50 <

This  process  is only possible if there is enough room left in the luggage
of  the  relevant  character, the character can carry the additional weight
and his mental and physical state is such that he can accept the object.

TRAP DOORS
~~~~~~~~~~
Trap  doors  can be found in the floor or the ceiling of a room.  Using the
magic  "Levitation"  the  party can get through the trap door without harm.
Trap  doors  located  in  the ceiling of a room or a corridor can generally
only Y be overcome by using levitation.

TRAPS
~~~~~
Traps can affect all members of a party or just the active character alone.
The level of injury or damage varies.

				> 51 <

Traps can be found on chests, doors and trap doors. There are seven dif-
ferent types of traps:

- The simple trap		Affects the whole party.
- Poisoned needles		Affects the active character.
- Cloud of poisonous gas	Affects the entire party.
- Blinding flash		Affects the entire party.
- Cloud of paralysing gas	Affects the entire party.
- Petrifying gas		Affects the active character.
- Infection			Affects the active character.

A trap is always triggered by the active character.

				> 52 <


PUZZLEMOUTHS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many of the puzzlemouths welcome the party.  All of them expect to hear the
correct answer to their puzzles.  

				> 53 <

- Exit
  You retreat from the puzzlemouth.

- Answers
  If the person asking the question is not answered, you can select either
  words from the list, ask about new expressions not yet included on the
  list or can enter an expression of up to 20 characters via the keyboard.

- Question
  The puzzlemouth is patient. If you did not understand the puzzle it will
  repeat its question if you ask it to.

GUILDS AND TRADERS

				> 56 <


GUILD SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Join a guild
  The active character can join a guild if he is not already a member.
  He must have sufficient gold to do so and also have enough experience
  to 

				> 57 <

successfully pass the first examination for entry into the guild. He
must also be a member of a race allowed to enter the guild.


- Promotion

In order to be promoted to the next level in a guild to which he belongs
the active character must again have the required guantity of gold with
him and possess the corresponding number of experience points. Se-
lect the characteristic you wish to improve. You must allocate your
new points to one or more characteristics whereby naturally no char-
acteristic can be increased beyond the maximum value. The different
classes obtain the following points on entering the next level:

Warrior 	8 points

Ranger 		14 points

Monk 		10 points

Paladine 	10 points

Thief 1		6 points
Wizard (white/grey/black) 12 points

cific characteristic.

  naturally only if your party has enough gold.

Choose an item with the LMB. You can buy up to 99 units if the trader
has enough of the goods available and your party has sufficient gold.    
The price and the name of the goods will be displayed. The RMB in-       
terrupts the action.

counter to the luggage of a person if there is enough room in the lug-
gage and the character involved is able to accept the item.

				> 68 <
BATTLES
~~~~~~~
If the party encounters one or more monsters, we switch to combat mode.
You can decide whether you want to fight or flee. Fleeing is not always
successful and the monsters then have the advantage of the first strike
without the party being able to defend itself.

If  your party is invisible, the monster or horde of monsters cannot defend
itself  against  your  first strike.  An invisible party can naturally flee
without hindrance.

Various monsters with varying strengths will get in the way of your party.

In the tactical section of the battle the monsters are always displayed at
the top and the members of the party at the bottom.
Slow and fast mode

				> 69 <

- Slow and Fast mode.

The two icons ">" and ">>" represent the slow and the fast mode
which affect the battle as follows: If the slow mode is activated there
will be a pause between each move. Press the LMB after a move to
continue with the battle. In fast mode the battle will run automatically
after you have clicked on the OK icon.

				> 70 <

- Fleeing

An individual member of the party takes flight. A check is made to de-
termine whether he was successful. The character does not get any
new experience points. Only a figure from the back row of the battle
configuration can flee.

- Movement

If possible, a member of the party can change his position. When the  
last member of the party has been withdrawn to the back row of the    
battle configuration, the row of monsters moves forwards.             

- Attack

Close-combat weapons can only be used in the front row of the battle
and only against monsters located right next to or in front of the se-
lected person. The character involved must carry the correct ammuni-
tion for using long-distance weapons. All monsters in the battle can be
attacked with long-distance weapons.

The action is interrupted with the RMB. Use the LMB to select a 
character  and the monster to be attacked.


                                  71
- Parade

The selected character moves the parade position and helps to fend
off an attack by a monster.

- Use a magic spell

The RMB interrupts the action. Use the LMB to choose a character
from your party who is to use a magic spell in the next round of the
battle. When the type of spell has been selected, a window opens
showing all available spells of that type. The number after the spell
shows how often the character can use it before his spell points are
used up. The number for every spell listed is calculated from the
number of the spell points required for each spell in relation to the
number of spell points available to the active character. You can only
choose battle spells for which the character has achieved the required
minimum number of spell points.

After choosing the spell you indicate which member of the party or
which monster it should affect if the entire group is not to be affected.

				> 72 <

Spells which contain magic can be used by all members of the party of
the class involved in the object. A sword with a fireball spell can there-
fore only be used by Warriors, Paladines or other fighters who use a
sword. No spell points are used. When the magic in an object is ex-
hausted, the object will disappear.

The success of any magic not only depends upon the ability of the
character using it but also on the resistance of the defenders.

- OK

The setting is accepted and the next round of the battle can com-
mence.

The person whose values are to be modified can be selected by clicking
on it on the tactical panel.

Monsters which cannot reach a member of your party with their weapons
or magic spells are always in the "parade" function.

				> 73 <

Groups of monsters have a certain level of combat morale, i.e. the remain-
der of a group of four Kobolds with a morale level of 50% will attempt to
flee if two of the group are killed.

When the actions for all figures in the battle have been set, they are ex-
ecuted consecutively. All figures are in the parade position at the beginn-
ing of a round of the battle. If the opponent of a figure is no longer capable
of combat or has flown, the action is not executed and the figure returns
to the parade position.

Restrictions:

Stunning - Figures which are stunned are immobile and
           can only use magic.

Poisoning- Has no effect in the battle.

Petrified- The figure affected is dead.

            reduced by 50%.

Ageing    - Fast ageing has no effect upon the battle.

Death     - The relevant character no longer takes part
            in the battle.
 
Irritation -The figure affected can no longer use magic.
            The probability of success in the battle is
            reduced by 25%. The irritation disappears
            when the battle is completed.

Madness   - You cannot control the character affected in
            the party - he acts independently.

Sleep     - Figures at sleep do not take part in the
            battle. If injured, the relevant figure wake
            up. The restriction disappears when the
            battle is finished.

				> 75 <


Panic     - The figure affected attempts to flee. Panic
            disappears when the battle is over.

Blindness - The probability of success in the battle is
            decreased by 75%.

A Battle is over when :

- All members of a group are dead
- All members of a group have successfully taken flight
- All monsters are dead or have flown.

If members of your party survived, you can collect objects from the dead
monsters.

THE KEYS
~~~~~~~~
The nine numbers on the numeric keypad coincide in their function and
configuration with the nine icons on the movement and action panel.

The keys [1] to [6] on the panel determine the active character according
to the configuration in the party ID.

The function keys [F1] to [F6] open the second page of the set-up list for
the relevant character according to the configuration in the party ID.      
In 2-D representation the cursor block has the following functions:

                ^  - I am going to the North
                <  - I am going to the West

				TARBOS
				======

	THIS IS THE TALE OF TARBOS, GOD OF CHAOS, WHO DEVASTATED
	THE LANDS OF LYRAMION; OF HOW HE CAME TO BE. AND HOW 
  			HE CAME TO FALL....


Children
=========
A thousand years ago, tucked deep in the beautiful woods to the south-
east of Lyramion, there was a small village called Forkbrook. The
people who lived there were blond haired and good natured; they lived by
fishing and hunting and traded with the nearest town which lay two days
travel to the west.

In  this  village  lived  a small boy named Tar.  He was not like the other
village-  lagers.   His hair was as dark as raven feathers by night and his
temper  was even darker.  The other children often teased him and many were
the  times  he  Tar  came home, dirty and covered with bruises, seeking the
soft arms of his his mother and pressing his face into her long blond hair.
He  never cried.  His His mother comforted and loved him, but sometimes she
lay  awake at nigh- night when her husband was asleep and thought about her
strange son.

To  avoid  the  other children Tar often went into the woods alone, leaving
early in the morning when his chores were done and returning just before
the evening meal. His father often grumbled about his son's long absences
but knew in his heart that it spared the boy the cruelty of the other chil-
dren.

One  day  Tar  left especially early.  He felt filled with anticipation and
was  determined  to  go deeper into the woods than ever before, even though
his  father  had  warned  him that a heavy storm was coming.  He walked on,
through  hidden vales, crossing small tinkling brooks and using paths where
the  sun  seldom  reached  the leaf-strewn earth.  But he had seen all this
before and hurried on without really looking.

Finally he reached a clearing in the forest where he had never been before.
He felt the thrill of the unknown run through his body and looked up at the
darkening  sky.  On the other side of the clearing, almost invisible in the
deep  shadows,  was  a  bare  mound.  In the mound was a dark hole, the en-
trance  to  a  cave.  Tar slowly crossed the clearing.  He looked up at the
sky  again.   He would have to hurry if he didn't want to get soaked to the
bone.   But first he must explore this cave, which seemed to be calling him
in  a  voice  he  sensed and could almost hear.  Everything in the clearing
seemed to point at the dark cave entrance.  Everything was quiet, so as not
to  dis-  turb  what  was drawing Tar towards the inky black opening.  With
each  step  forward,  Tar  felt  less  in control, more a spectator than an
actual par- ticipant.

At  last he reached the entrance.  A spot of light grew larger, far back in
the depths of the cave.  Tar felt his feet take him forward again.  He
entered  the  cave.  The air inside was heavy.  The smell reminded Tar of
a dead fox he had once found, but this smell was a thousand times stronger.

The light grew brighter and bigger, flickering on the rough surface of the
cave wall. Tar could make out a large shape Iying on the floor ahead. He
didn't know what was producing the light. A distant sound reached his
ears, gradually growing louder. It sounded like water running over stones
but was somehow different.

His  feet  brought him to a standstill in front of the the large shape.  He
looked down.  It was a corpse.  The corpse of a bear.  It had not been dead
for  very  long  but was already starting to decompose.  Now the stench hit
Tar  with  it's  full  force  and  he drew back at the sight of the maggots
twist-  ing  and turning in the rotting flesh.  His feet wouldn't obey him,
not  even when the corpse started to move, started to lift itself, meat and
maggots  falling  from  it  to the floor.  It raised it's head until it was
level with Tar's own and opened it's eyes.  Tar saw life flickering deep in
the mouldering skull, an evil and unclean life.

The corpse breathed in deeply. For a short moment all was still. Then the 
corpse said ~Tarbos~, breathing out a cloud of rotten air into Tar's face.

Tar  regained  control  of  himself,  clutched his face, and stumbled back-
wards.   He could not breathe, could not see, tried to get the foul gas out
of  his lungs, gasping, choking.  He fell back and started crawling towards
the  entrance,  not seeing the corpse of the bear fall to the floor as if a
pup-  peteer  had  let go of the strings.  The flickering light faded away.
The mound started trembling as Tar crawled towards the light, dust and dirt
falling  on  him.   Then he was out- side.  He looked back, blinking, tears
streaming from his eyes.  The mound collapsed with a loud rumbling.  As the
dust settled, all that could be seen was a rough patch of earth.

Tar  coughed and wiped the tears from his face.  He spat, trying to get the
vile  taste  out of his mouth.  He sat still and wondered about what he was
feeling.   He  felt  as  if fire was running through his veins, and it felt
good.   His  head  was  clearer than it had ever been before.  He looked
around  and  saw  everything  anew, every leaf, every blade of grass, every
pebble  on the ground.  At the same time he felt ashamed and shocked, as if
someone had stripped away his body and exposed his naked spirit.

He stood up, spat a last time and looked at the sky. It was very dark now.
He ran towards his village, exhilarated, filled with a strange new power.

The sky was almost black when Tar came running out of the forest. He
stood still, smiling broadly. He wasn't even tired.

"What  are  you  laughing about, dirthead?", said a sneering voice from be-
hind  him.   Tar  turned  around.  It was Mank.  He was always teasing Tar,
call- ing him names, picking fights.  Mank was big for his age.  Tar looked
up  at  him, a cold look in his eyes, and said "Go scratch your flea-bites,
you  horse-faced  dog  turd."  Mank's  eyes  widened, then he smiled.  "So,
learned  some  new  words  from  your  Dad,  did you?" His smile broadened.
"Only, he isn't your Dad, you know.  Your real Dad was a forest pig".

Mank started laughing and some other children who had come to watch
laughed as well. Tar opened his mouth to reply, but then Mank pushed
him hard and he stumbled back and fell to the ground. "See? He can't
even walk properly!"

All the kids were standing around Tar now, laughing. Mank bent over him,
smiled and said "And do you know what your mother was, runt ?~ Tar felt
anger growing inside him, like a fire. "I'll tell you what your mother was."
Tar no longer knew what he was doing, he knew only anger and hate. Ev-
erything turned red. He raised his arm and put his hand on Mank's chest.

"She was..." But Mank never got any further. Tar felt something, some
power running through his arm, through his hand. And he felt something
move violently under his hand, in Mank's chest. It made a sound which
suddenly seemed very loud. Mank's eyes grew very wide. Everyone was
absolutely still, as if time were standing still.

Thunder rumbled. Tar looked closely at Mank's face, his hand still on his
chest. A small trickle of blood came out of the corner of Mank's mouth.
Then he fell back, an expression of surprise and fear on his face.

Everything started to move again, all at once. Children started screaming,
parents ran outside to see what was going on and talked in loud voices.
Only Tar still sat there, his arm raised, absolutely still. And Mank? Mank
was lying in the dirt, very still.

The villagers were moving towards Tar. He looked up at their angry faces.
Then the storm finally broke and it's full force was unleashed upon the for-
est and the village. The rain lashed down, the wind tore at the trees and
houses, flashes of lightning struck four trees at almost the same time and
deafening thunder drowned out every sound.

Tar was sitting on the bed in his parent's room, the storm raging outside.
His mother had told him to wait when she had pushed him in inside, his fa-
ther had only looked at him, angry and disgusted. Now he could hear
them talking outside. He didn't understand why everyone was so angry at
his son.

- "Mank shouldnt have pushed me, I gave him what he deserved. I did!"

He stood up and pressed his ear against the rough wood of the door. He
could just make out what his parents were saying. "We really tried, but
we knew when we found him. We should have left him in the woods."

His mother was crying. She managed to stop sobbing and then said "But
what can we do about it now?" Tar's father replied "The villagers want to
kill him. They think he's a demon." His mother started to sob even more
loudly. Tar felt his father move to comfort her, hold her, and heard his fa-
ther speak.

"Don't worry, my dear, I know something better. We'll take him to Latheoz.
He's a wizard, he'll know what to do"

As his father took him along the path leading north to the hills Tar looked
back at the village. He saw his mother but she didn't look at him. She had
still been crying when she had kissed him goodbye. She was surrounded
by the other villagers. They looked at him with angry faces, as if he was
something detestable. The children were hiding behind their mothers. He
wanted to look some more but his father pulled him around a bend in the
path. He never saw the village again.

				> 97 <

They camped that night. His father caught a rabbit and roasted it over the
fire. They ate in silence, then slept. Tar's father hadn't said a word to him
since they left.

They reached the house of Latheoz the next day. Latheoz was an old man
and was wearing a grey robe. He lived alone in a small stone house filled
with weird magical objects and a lot of large mysterious books. Tar's fa-
ther greeted him respectfully. The wizard grunted a little and asked why
they had come.

"It is because of him," Tar's father said and pointed at Tar, "He killed an-
other boy. We think by magic. Now the other people want to kill him -
they say he is a demon. I promised his mother, my wife, that I would bring
him to you.

Tar looked up at his father and asked: "Aren't you my father any more?~
His father looked down at him as if seeing him for the first time that day.
He kept looking for a while, not saying anything, then turned back to
Latheoz, who was also looking at Tar. The old man mumbled something,
stood up and rummaged around in a dark corner. After a while he came
back with a big crystal.

"Hold  this",  he  said to Tar.  Tar took the crystal in his hands.  He had
ex- pected a shock or a tingling feeling, but it felt just like a big piece
of stone.  Latheoz laid his old wrinkled hand on the crystal and closed his
eyes.   He  held  still  for  some time, then frowned, sweat forming on his
forehead.   With  a  sudden movement he jerked his hand away and opened his
eyes.  He stared at Tar, then looked at his father.

"Just a big black wall...", he mumbled, seemingly confused, then he came
to his senses and said "I advise you send him to the Seekers of Perilous
Knowledge. They might know what to do with him."They stared at each
other for a while, then Tar's father said " Very well. But how will he get
there?" - "I'll take him," said Latheoz,"I know some of the Seekers."

Tar had never seen anything like the lands through which Latheoz led him.
They had travelled through the foothills of the Bollgar range (Bollgar-


Berge) and were now walking along a steep trail towards a pass through
the mountains themselves. Latheoz didn't talk much but he didn't glare at
Tar either, although he sometimes had a curious glint in his eyes.

Tar could see that the journey was hard for the old man. Even so, Latheoz
rested only for short periods and never ate much. After two days travel
they came down into small rock valley. At it's centre stood a tall tower,
made entirely of cold stone.

"What's that?", asked Tar.

"That's the Tower of the Seekers," answered Latheoz.

"What do they seek?", asked Tar again.

"Perilous knowledge."

"Like moving dead things?"

Latheoz looked strangely at Tar. "Perhaps, yes."

Tar was more interested now. He stared at the tower.


Finally  they  stood  at  the  base  of the tower, after having crossed the
diffi- cult country surrounding it.  Latheoz seemed very tired.

"AIright, here you are. I'm going back now." - "Wait," Tar said, "Aren't
you coming in?" - Latheoz looked up at the tower and shivered. "No, I
don't want to go in there." - "But they won't know who brought me, or
why I'm here!", Tar exclaimed. - "Don't worry," said Latheoz with a weary
smile, "They know we're here."

Then Latheoz turned around and started walking back towards the moun-
tains. Tar looked at him as he grew smaller and smaller, then looked at the
double wooden doors at the bottom of the tower. He reached out to
knock, but before his hand touched the wood, the door opened and some-
one inside said: "Well? Are you going to stand outside all day or are you
coming in?"

Tar looked into the dark hall but couldn't see anything. He stepped inside.
The door closed behind him.

Tar was standing in a dark hall. A man dressed in a dark robe and holding
a torch gestured for him to follow. Tar followed him, up a winding stairway
then down a corridor. Finally he was pushed into a small room where a
bearded man, also clad in a dark robe, sat behind a large wooden desk.
The man gazed sternly at him. Tar felt a little uncomfortable under the
gaze but did not lower his eyes.

After a while the man said: "So Latheoz thinks you're fit to be a wizard."
He looked at his papers and wrote something down.

"What is your name?", he asked without looking up. "Tar." Tar replied.
The bearded man stared at him briefly as if he didn't believe him. Then he
wrote the name down.

"Very well," said the man, "You have some talent, so much is clear." Tar
didn't understand but said nothing. The man looked at him. "Do you have
any questions?" Tar thought intently, then asked "Am I a Seeker now?"
The man smiled and said: "Not yet. But with a little luck, you'll be a true
Seeker one day."

And so Tar joined the Seekers of Perilous Knowledge. The Seekers made
him work hard, but he had enough to eat and his bed was warm and dry.
They also taught him to read and write, and when they saw he learned
quickly, they gave him basic knowledge of Elementals and the Demonic
Realms. Tar absorbed everything they taught him with a speed that sur-
prised even the Seekers and he rose through the ranks faster than anyone
before. But he never made any friends.


                               II - Wizards

Well, Tar, you're doing your Master's test tomorrow. Do you think you'll
make it ?" Tar lifted his eyes from the roll of parchment he was
reading and looked into the eyes of the Master who had spoken to him.
He smiled slowly and said "Of course, Master Zanthi. I don't think there
will be any problem."

Master Zanthi laughed uneasily, having sensed the mocking tone. ~Ha!
You may be the youngest ever to attempt the Master's Trial, but don't over-
estimate yourself. Calling up a third level demon isn't something to be
taken lightly."

Tar smiled again and turned back to his studies.

- Old fool, he thought, the demons are eating out of my hand. And I
  have already called up a fourth level demon.

Then he wondered. Things were easy for him. He performed with ease 
those incantations which other seekers considered very difficult.

- They're all fools.

The next day Tar was called at dawn and brought before the council. The
twelve looked at him with stern eyes but Tar stood before them with no 
apparent fear or concern, even though he knew they all felt he was
too young.

Grandmaster Kantoun cleared his throat and spoke. "Brother Tar, you will 
now risk your very being in an attempt to invoke and control a Demon
of the third level, thus proving that you are worthy to be a master.
Do you wish to reconsider?" He looked Gravely at Tar who smiled as
he said "No, Grandmaster".

Kantuon continued to look at him, his expression unchanging. Then he
said: "I repeat, do you wish to reconsider?" Tar looked straight into the
Grandmaster's eyes without flinching and replied "No, Grandmaster."

Kantuon sighed and looked down at the scroll in his hands. A Very well,A
he said, "Go through that door." He pointed towards a door on Tar's right.
"We'll check your progress here."

Tar nodded, walked to the door and entered the Trial Room. It was small
and completely dark except for a tall black candle which cast its wildly
flickering light over the rough walls. Tar sat down and entered the trance
state. Without hesitation he sank down through the outer levels of the De-
monic Realms, casually fighting off the attacks and temptations of the
lesser demons. He stopped on the fifth level to do battle with a group of
demons who were trying to stop him.

After destroying them, he sank further to the fourth level. A demon of for-
midable size blocked his path and attacked him. Tar frowned and coun-

midable size blocked his path and attacked him. Tar frowned and coun-
ter attacked, knocking the demon over the horizon of the realm's non-
space. He waited patiently for the demon to return but it stayed away.

He sank to the third level, quickly sensing a powerful demon in his
vicinity. He honed in on it and bound it with his most powerful binding
spells. It struggled, tried to attack, but Tar simply squeezed his 
mental hand until the demon no longer resisted. He calmly held his grip.
The twelve would soon sense his control of the demon and he would return
a Master.

A giant hand came up from below, grabbed him, enclosing him completely, 
then drew him down. Tars binding spell was broken.

- "Hellfire, a second level demon?

He didnt resist, sensing it was useless, but waited. He felt how he
entered the second level and was thrilled.

He was deeper than he had ever been before. But still he was going down,
and soon he felt himself sinking out of the second level, crossing the final
barrier. The realization of what was happening shocked him.

- Only a Demon Lord could do this!

Then the giant hand opened, exposing him to the first level. He sensed the
huge power which had drawn him down, the immense entity which was
dwarfing his puny human form. He felt fear grow inside him but his curios-
ity was greater.

"Who are you?", he demanded silently. If the Demon Lord gave his name,
he could be called again.

- If I get out of here.

The King of Hell changed his appearance of pure chaos and took on a
shape which could be comprehended by the human senses. A smile
crossed the huge face.

"Greetings, Tarbos. I am Thornahuun. I am your father," said the King
with a thunderous sound which filled the space completely. Tar was
speechless.

- Tarbos ... The cave ... My father? Preposterous!

The Demon King's smile broadened. "Goodbye, Tarbos. We shall meet
again." Tar felt himself being propelled upwards, faster and faster. He
screamed: "Wait, Thornahuun! Come back!" But all that he heard from
the Demon Lord as he sped up through the nine levels was great laughter.

Tar was screaming as he came out of his trance. The Twelve came into the
room and surrounded him.

"Tar, what happened?", they asked. "We sensed you controlling the third
level demon when you suddenly disappeared. Where..."

Tar regained control over himself. He stood up without answering,
brushed off their helping hands and looked at Kantuon who gazed calmly
back at him. The other Masters fell quiet. Kantuon spoke: "I don't know
what happened to you down there, Tar, but you demonstrated your wor-
thiness. You are now a Master of the Seekers of Perilous Knowledge."

Tar nodded, completely calm now. But under his calmness burned great
anger and ambition.

Tar sat in his small room and closed the huge book of scrolls he had been
studying with an angry thud. None of the normal tomes contained the
knowledge he needed. He had to invoke Thornahuun and bind him,
forcing him to tell the truth. He thought once more about the mound and
the corpse of the bear, about his parents who had found him, about the
Demon Lord who had called him Tarbos. How else could he have known
that name if he hadn't been the force behind the gruesome messenger in
the mound?

Tar pounded the great book of power with his fist. Useless. It contained
power of which most men only dreamed, yet it wasn't enough to summon
a King of Hell. He needed older, deeper scrolls filled with greater power.

Tar walked to Kantuon's study and knocked on the wooden door."Come
in," came the Grandmaster's voice from inside. Tar entered. Kantuon
wasn't alone. In a wide chair next to his large desk sat a young woman,
not much younger than Tar. Tar hesitated, surprised. Kantuon noticed his
reaction and said "Ah, yes. Tar, this is my niece, Princess Mylneh. Mylneh,
this is Tar."

Mylneh extended her hand. Tar kissed it. She smiled at him. Then Tar
looked at Kantuon, raising his eyebrows. "Princess?", he asked. "Hm,
yes." Kantuon seemed a little embarrassed. "It isn't very well known, but
King Marakahn is my brother. I'd appreciate it if you would keep it to your-
self.

Tar smiled. "Of course, Grandmaster." Kantuon looked at a stack of pa-
pers on his desk. "Meanwhile, perhaps you might like to show Mylneh
around the tower. She will be staying for a while and sadly I haven't got
much time at the moment." Tar hesitated, thinking about his original pur-
pose, then smiled at Mylneh. "Of course, Grandmaster. Your Highness?"

He held out his arm to the princess. "Oh silly, call me Mylneh," she said,
laughing, and took his arm. They walked out of the room. Kantuon
watched them, then sighed and went back to his work.

"I'm surprised at your manners, Tar," Mylneh said as they walked through
the larger chambers towards the centre of the tower. Tar feigned shock.
"Have I insulted you in some way, Milady ?" She laughed. ~Call me Myl-
neh! No, I would have thought that someone who lived in a tower away
from everything wouldn't know how what a girl looked like, let alone how
to speak to one."

Tar smiled. ~Well, Mylneh, our education does not only concern itself with
dark things and you would be surprised at the kind of temptations one
has to resist when dealing with the darker sides of magic."

They walked up the stairs towards the top of the tower. Tar felt pleased by
her interest in him. Out of the corner of his eye he looked at her long,
chestnut brown hair and her dark blue eyes. Her face and body weren't as
perfect as those of the demons who had tried to seduce him, but she was
warm and real, and Mylneh seemed genuinely kind and not out to destroy
him, which was a nice change.

As they came to the top, Mylneh gasped at the incredible sight of the Boll-
gar  mountain  range  all  around  her.   Tar  stood next to her.  It was a
magnifi-  cent  view,  he  had to admit.  Everywhere one looked one saw the
stark, un- compromising beauty of the mountains.  Mylneh looked at him, her
eyes sparkling, laughing.  "It's wonderful!", she exclaimed.  "Yes, it is,"
said  Tar.   "But  you're  not looking at the mountains!  You're looking at
me!" she said, feigned annoyance on her face.

"Yes."

Mylneh laughed at him.  "Silly!", she said, then became more serious.  "You
know,"  she  said  after  a while, "I thought this would be a really boring
stay, but it might become interesting after all." "Why is that?", Tar asked
innocently.   "Well,  I thought the only people I would be talking to would
be these old men." She smiled at him.

The next day Tar visited the Grandmaster again. "Yes, Tar," he said, look-
ing up from the scrolls on his desk, "What is it?" Tar looked him straight
in the eyes. "I should like to read the forbidden scrolls, the ones that are
locked away at the back of the library."

Kantuon sat up. "You're not even supposed to know about them!" Tar
shrugged. "It wasn't difficult to find out. Can I read them?" Kantuon sat
back in his chair. a stern look on his face. "What do vou need them for?"

Tar looked away, then said "It's an experiment I want to perform. I want to
invoke a Demon Lord."

"What?!", exclaimed Kantuon. "Have you gone mad ? Not even I would
attempt to call up a King of Hell! I order you to abandon this experiment!"
Tar glowered, then calmed his features again.

- You old fool, Tar thought, I will have those books even without your
  permission.

"Of course, Grandmaster. I will destroy my notes immediately." Then he
turned around and left. Kantuon watched him leave and wondered why
Tar wanted to invoke a Demon Lord.

Over the next few days Tar and Mylneh saw each other often. Tar showed
her the tower and told her what the Seekers did here, Mylneh told Tar
about her father and the court. Tar noticed that when he was with Mylneh,
he no longer felt angry or troubled. He was happiest when he was with
her.

One night, they again climbed to the top of the tower to look at the stars.
Mylneh was enchanted by the night sky. Tar stood next to her. After a
while he put his arm around her shoulders. Mylneh looked at him. "Tar?"
Tar looked in her eyes. She seemed sad and happy at the same time.

"Yes?", he said. "Kiss me."

Tar raised his eyebrows, but saw she meant it. He took her chin gently in
his hand and placed his lips on hers. It seemed to last forever. Then Myl-
neh pulled back and Tar noticed that her eyes were moist.

"Tar?" she asked. "Yes?" "I must leave tomorrow."

Tar  was  quiet  for  a moment.  Then he recovered.  "What?" - "I wanted to
tell  you as late as possible, so as not to spoil our last few days." - "Is
that  why  I  got  a  kiss?"  His  voice  sounded  bitter.  "In payment for
entertaining you for a while?"

"Tar. Don't make this too hard. You knew I had to leave at some time.
But he had turned away and was leaning on the parapet."

"Tar?"

He didn't reply for a moment, then he said "I wanted you to be there. I
wanted you to see it." - "See what?" she asked. He turned around, fire
burning in his eyes. "I'm going to invoke a Demon Lord. I'm going to fight
him."

Mylneh took a step back, frightened by this sudden change in him. "But,
you told me that Demon Lords were the most powerful demons there are."
- "They are. And I'm going to conquer one. Think of the power I'll have."
- "Oh Tar, don't do it. How can you possibly stand up to a creature like
that? He'll crush you like a fly!" He looked coolly at her. "He won't. I
know."

"Tar,  you mustn't ..." He interrupted her.  "No-one can tell me what to do
or  what  not  to do.  This is all academic anyway, isn't it?  You won't be
there.   I'll  ask you only once, Mylneh.  Stay.  It won't take long.  I'll
have finished my preparations soon."

But Mylneh shook her head and took a few steps away from him. "No,
Tar. I don't want to be around when you try something like that." And with
that she turned and ran down the steps. Tar didn't stop her. He leaned on
the parapet again and gazed sombrely at the starlit landscape.

- Stupid girl, he thought. You're just as small-minded as the others.

The next day Tar wasn't there when Mylneh left. Instead he sat in the li-
brary and read the forbidden scrolls. He had managed to pick the lock and
break the magical seals. Now he sat there, reading intently, occasionally
making notes.

Time passed unnoticed. He found the spell he needed and copied the vital
parts. He was writing down the final incantations when the door to the li-
brary suddenly crashed open. Grandmaster Kantuon stood in the door-
way, obviously furious. He strode forward to the desk where Tar was
studying, looked down at the scrolls and back at Tar and slammed the
books shut.

"Tar," he said with a voice seething with suppressed rage, "I told you ex-
pressly not to read these books. They are only to be used with consent
from the Twelve and from me. You have ignored a direct order and will re
ceive just punishment. By sunset, you will have left this tower. You may
continue your studies in the small hut on the hill to the north." Kantuon's
eyes widened in anger as he saw that Tar looked back at him levelly, obvi-
ously not impressed.

"Very well, Grandmaster, he said with a calm voice. "I have found what I
was searching for. I have no need to stay at the tower any longer."

He stood up and walked out of the library, leaving Kantuon staring
speechlessly at his retreating back.

The same afternoon Tar left the tower and entered the hut. It had been
standing empty for a while but he had soon made it inhabitable. He never
looked back at the tower.

Tar looked out of the window in his study. It was dark enough now. A
huge storm was forming over the hut. He turned away and prepared him-
self. He now had enough knowledge. He might be able to find and control
Thornahuun. A shudder went through his body. The forbidden scrolls had
been horrible. His very being had felt tainted after reading those ancient,
gruesome books. But now he was ready.

He breathed deeply and entered the magical trance state.  Fast, faster than
ever  before,  he  sank through the first eight levels, slicing through the
lesser  demons  like a hot knife through butter.  Then he once again passed
the fi- nal barrier.  He was on the first level.

He didn't hesitate, but spoke the name of the one he sought.

- Thornahuun!

Surprisingly, the Demon Lord appeared almost instantly. The King had to
be up to something. He looked at the boiling chaotic shape which was
slowly changing into a huge, vaguely human entity. The King was smiling.

"Greetings, Tarbos." His smile broadened. "What can I do for you, my
son?" He chuckled. Tar remained calm, although he felt anger rising up
within him. "Why do you persist in calling me your son?", he asked. "Be-
cause you are, answered Thornahuun. "Do you not remember when we
met in th cave with the mound?" Tar frowned, sensing the King was telling
the truth. "Then my parents did find me in the forest ..."

The King chuckled again.  "Yes.  Your real mother was a witch.  She was all
too  glad  to  be  inseminated by a Demon Lord.  She didn't realize what it
meant,  what  exquisite pain it would cause.  You had burrowed your way out
after  only  seven  months.   You  had quite an appetite." The King laughed
cruelly.   Tar  steeled himself, suppressing his anger.  He had never known
this woman.

"Why did you do this?"

The King looked down at him, still smiling. "Why, I have big plans for you,
Tarbos. You will conquer the world for me."

Tar felt his anger growing almost out of control now. "Not before I con-
quer you!", he screamed, and let power stream from his being towards
Thornahuun. The King was hurled back by the blast but recovered imme-
diately. His smile grimmer, he said "So, that is how you want it, eh? Very
well. I created you. Now I will destroy you." With that he raised his claw
and attacked.

Thus began a magical battle which shook the foundations of the Demonic
Realms. In the natural world, over Tar's hut, a storm raged with unparal-
leled force. In the Tower of the Seekers, Kantuon felt the immense magical
vibrations and concentrated deeply to find their source.

After an immeasurable time, both Tar and Thornahuun stopped fighting.
They were exhausted. Tar's new- found power was a match for the King's
but he couldn't beat him. Neither could the King destroy Tar. Thornahuun
smiled wearily. His plan needed a change. He saw an opportunity for
bringing even more chaos to the world. He mentally called his brother.

-Bralkur.

It didn't take long. All the Realms had been following the gigantic battle.

   - "Thornahuun, my brother"

Thornahuun did not even consider asking for help.

   - "Bralkur, I shall be defeated."

Bralkur showed no reaction at all.

   - "My essence will enter my son. I ask you to help him if he should need 
      it."                                                           ,,

Bralkur didn't hesitate.

- "As you wish, my brother. Farewell."

Thornahuun raised himself for one final effort. Tar saw the movement and
attacked the King, power flaring from him. However, Thornahuun was not
resisting but was flying straight towards Tar, closer and closer, laughing.
Then he merged with Tar's being. Tar felt his mind being stretched beyond
it's limits as his essence mingled with the Demon Lord's. He reeled at the
size of the King's mind, the world it encompassed, and tried to flee, tried to
hide, but couldn't. His being spread itself across the Demon Lord's, mixed
with it, became one with it. For an eternity, his universe was destroyed.
Then he felt his mind accept it's new form and he slowly, half-consciously
started floating up through the levels of the Realms. No demon blocked
his way.

Kantuon opened his eyes, deeply shocked. He tried to fully comprehend
what Tar had done but couldn't.

- To merge with a King of Hell ... the power it would give.

He stood up, covered his face with his hands. He mustn't think about it. A
being with enough power to move mountains, concentrated in one human.
But then he wondered if Tar was really human. He couldn't be, not any
more. He stood up and called for a servant.

- The council must come together. This abomination must be destroyed.


He looked up at the Seeker who had entered. "Call the Twelve," he said
and started at the sound of his own voice. He sounded older, much older
than he really was.

- Nn matter ... The King. I must warn Marakahn.

Tar came to slowly. He felt as if his body had been speeded up a thousand
times. Somehow, he had managed to control Thornahuun's essence. He
was himself, Tarbos. No longer Tar. He was infinitely more powerful now.
His mind still reeled when he contemplated the size of his new power.

- I have defeated my father. I have his power now. He was like a god.
  Yes. I am a god now. TARBOS, GOD OF CHAOS.

He started laughing, louder and louder.  He couldn't stop himself, and he
didnt care. Not even when the hut started trembling with his laughter.


        			III - GODS

Kantuon looked around the circle of Masters. These were the Twelve,
the most powerful Seekers of Lyramion. Few would think of challeng-
ing them.

- Yet now, who will say what we can do about this threat?

He cleared his throat. "My brothers, we are in a dire situation. Our former
brother, Tar, has mingled his essence with that of a King of Hell." They
gasped, then all started talking at the same time.

"But ..." "How could he ..." "That's preposterous!"

Kantuon held up his hand, demanding quiet. They fell silent. "It is true, my
brothers. I have already sent a message to King Marakahn. Meanwhile, we
must try to stop him ourselves."

The Twelve looked at each other. Together, they formed a magical force
which knew no equal. Yet each of them felt that they would very probably
lose their lives, and worse, in the coming battle. Kantuon stared at each of
the silent Masters. "Let us go, my brothers."

Tarbos  sat  on  an ornamental throne he had burned out of a large block of
stone.   The  stone  had  originally  been a part of the foundations of his
keep,  which  had  collapsed.  He smiled and looked down at the ruined land
which lay around him.  He heard a sound.  A group of people was approaching
the ruins of his hut.  He waited patiently.  It was Kantuon and the Twelve.

"Ah, Kantuon," he exclaimed with obvious pleasure, "You have come to
worship me. Good."

Kantuon stopped, a grave expression on his face.

- It is as If feared, he thought, the power was too much for him.

"We have not come to worship you, Tar. We have come to stop you. We
..." Tarbos' loud laughter interrupted him. It grew louder and more mania-
cal. The Twelve looked at each other. Tears were running down Tarbos'
face now. It seemed as if he would never stop. Finally he calmed down,
and managed to talk without chuckling too much. "You, you want to stop
ME?~

He burst out our laughing again. Then after a few moments he became se-
rious again. He looked sternly down at Kantuon and the Twelve.

"Seriously now. First of all, you will call me Tarbos. Second, I am now a
God, the God of Chaos, and I expect proper worship. So, if you want to
live, go down on your knees."

The Twelve were shocked at this display of insane, conceited calm. Kan-
tuon turned to them. "My friends," he said in a calm voice, "it is as I
feared. We must combine our powers and destroy him." They gazed at
each other, then, one by one, they all entered the magical trance state,

holding each other's hands so as to form a circle of thirteen. All thirteen
dark wizards sank deeper into their trances, sweat forming on their brows.
A globe of pure energy formed in the centre of the circle. It grew, pulsing
with many colours. Then it expanded and curved toward Tarbos at the
speed of light. Tarbos, who had been watching, held up his hand and de-
flected the incredible power without flinching. He stood up, no longer
amused, and spoke.  His voice was terrible, no longer human.  "So, you will
not  bow before your rightful Lord?  Puny fools!  You will all perish, here
and now! "                                                          

And with that he raised his hand. From the palm of his hand burst forth a
fountain of black energy which shot towards the circle of wizards. The ef-
fect was terrible. They were simply blown to pieces before they could even
react.

Meanwhile, King Marakahn had received his brother's message and sat
with his counsellors in the great hall of his citadel. "Well, Mandek? What
do the wizards say of this threat?"

Mandek, an old man clad in the grey robes of the Keepers of the Balance,
stood up and said with a grave voice "Your Majesty, my eleven brothers
and I have considered this throughout the night. We think this menace
must be destroyed before he is our doom."

The king thought quietly about this and then said ~Very well.  I think this
is  a  matter where magic is the best solution.  But can he be stopped?" He
looked  up and stared at Mandek, who coughed and answered "It is possi-
ble, Your Majesty.  Ancient spells are available to us, for control over
a Demon Lord, which is what this Tar has become if we may believe Grand-
master Kantuon's story."

The King looked vaguely annoyed. "I trust my brother in this, Mandek. He
wouldn't send a message like this if he weren't absolutely sure.~ Mandek
cast down his eyes. "Of course, Your Majesty."

"Meanwhile,"  continued  the  King, aI have sent a messenger to this Tar to
inform  him  that  he  may not enter our land.  It is doubtful that he will
heed this if things are as you say, but we must try."

"Yes, Your Majesty. May I ask whom you have sent?" "It was Sir Mando,
one of my best knights. He volunteered."

Sir Mando rode down from the Bollgar mountains on his tired horse and
looked out over the valley below him. He saw the Tower of the Seekers to
his right. The hut, his destination, was supposed to be a bit further, but he
couldn't see a thing. The sun started to sink behind the mountains when
he rode past the tower which stood there like a black gravestone. Mando
called but no-one answered. Puzzled, he rode on through the big boulders
towards the place where the hut was supposed to be. The land around
him was completely lifeless, the silence absolute. Once he thought he saw
something scurrying away behind a boulder but he didn't find anything
when he looked. He rode on, his unease deepening.

Mando reached the hill where the hut was supposed to be. It simply wasn't
there. Mystified, he tied his horse's reins to a tree and started to climb the
steep path to the top of the hill. Something was Iying on the rocky ground
further up. It was the size of a human hand. He climbed on until he ap-
proached the small object. Then he saw what it was. He turned pale and
sank slowly to his knees. It was a human hand, severed at the wrist and
burned black. He turned it around with his knife. Disgusted, he stood and
walked on towards the top.

Tarbos sat on his throne of rock and gazed around. He was bored. He had
been sitting there for two days and had found out that he no longer
needed food or drink. However, he found that he longed for something
else.

- Mylneh.

He was angry at her. He wanted to punish her, to show her how wrong
she had been, how powerful he had become. On the other hand he
wanted to hold her, to kiss her, to once again experience the simple joy he
had ...

His senses warned him of a living being approaching and he broke from
his reverie. Someone was coming up the hill. No form of life had come in
his  vicinity  since  he  had  destroyed the wizards.  Every man, woman and
child,  every  animal, bird and insect had left the valley.  Tarbos sat up,
all his senses focused on this sudden diversion.

- It's a human. Iron ... a Knight. The first to worship the God of Chaos.

Tarbos grinned.

The  blackened  hand  wasn't the only thing Mando found as he climbed to- y
wards  the  top of the hill.  As he came higher, he noticed more signs of a
massacre;  pieces of black cloth burned at the edges, pieces of indefinable
flesh,  more  limbs.  He found an ear in a clump of dead grass.  A sense of
horror and impending doom filled him as he climbed over the last ridge.

They looked each other in the eyes.  Mando flinched and looked away un- der
Tarbos'  terrible  gaze.   A  deep, evil light shone out of those eyes.  He
knew  this  man,  or demon, was responsible for the massacre which had left
the gruesome remains.  He cleared his throat and spoke.  

"I have been sent by the good King Marakahn. He has heard from Grand-
master Kantuon of your despicable action and informs you that you are
no longer welcome in his Kingdom. If you are caught within it's borders,
you will be captured and executed." He said the last words very quietly.

When Tarbos still hadn't reacted after around a minute had passed Man-
do looked up. Tarbos was sitting there, expressionless. Then, he chuckled.
And he chuckled again. He started chuckling more loudly until eventually
he was laughing. Louder and louder he laughed until he was roaring and
Mando felt the ground shake under the force of the demonic glee. Then
suddenly Tarbos sat up and screamed "KNEEL BEFORE ME, YOU WORM!"

Shaken by this outburst of anger, Mando felt himself fall forward on his
knees. Tarbos stood up. Miserable, pitiful human! How dare you and your
puny King address me, the God of Chaos, in such a manner! I have a mes-
sage for your KING."

He  raised  his hands and a piece of Mando's armour and clothing fell away,
revealing  his  naked  belly.  He felt a tearing sensation, starting at his
navel, and gasped as the pain hit him.  Realizing what was happening to him
he  tried  to  stop  it  with  his hands but it was no use.  After a while,
Tarbos  low- ered his hand and Mando looked down at his body with a look of
shocked  disbelief  on  his face.  Tarbos grinned and said:  "Do not worry.
You will not die.  Not until you have delivered my message to your King."

After the messenger had left, Tarbos smiled grimly.

- So, this king thinks to command me. Soon he will lie grovelling at my
  feet and then I will take his daughter before his uery eyes.

But first Tarbos needed an army. He extended his senses like tendrils into
the ground and searched for all the warriors who lay buried on the ancient
battlefields around the valley. With one thrust of his will he forced their
rotten corpses up. With another he opened a thousand gateways to the
Demonic Realms and ordered demons to come through, bringing new, evil
life to the long-dead bodies.

They  came slithering and shuffling towards his hill, vile light flickering
deep  in  their  empty  eye  sockets.  Some still had flesh on their bones,
others were mere skeletons.  Tarbos looked at his army and smiled broadly.

"Greetings,  my  loyal  servants.   We shall go and conquer a kingdom." The
earth  shuddered  as the demons responded to him, screeching and howling,
clattering their rusty swords against their shields.

Meanwhile,  Mando  rode  as  if a demon was on his heels.  His horse sensed
that  it's  rider  was no longer sane and was on the verge of panic.  Mando
felt  only  the pain from his belly growing worse with each mile.  The only
things  which  kept him from going insane were his oath as a knight and the
message he must deliver to his king.

A lone horse hobbled slowly towards the king's castle. It was visibly ex-
hausted,  trembling  on  it's  feet.   As  it neared the castle, the guards
recognized  a  knight  slumped  in the saddle and led the horse into the
courtyard.   There the knight fell off the horse with a loud crash.  As the
stable  hands  pulled  him  up,  he  regained  consciousness.  The men then
noticed  what was wrong with the knight and backed away in terror.  But the
knight didn't see them and stumbled slowly into the castle.

King  Marakahn  was  listening to the sorry tale of a cheated merchant when
several  servants came running into the great hall, horrified expres- sions
on  their  pale faces as if they were fleeing from something.  The chancell
cellor came to a halt before the king, opened his mouth, his entire body
trembling, and all fell quiet. The chancellor closed his mouth and turned
around, his face filled with terror, to look at the figure who had appeared.
The king who had been watching all this with growing wonder and anxi-
ety, raised his eyes to the wide doorway. The person standing there stum-
bled forward. Marakahn gasped as he recognized the broken man.

"Mando!",  he  exclaimed and rushed forward to help him.  But as he reached
out to grasp Mando's shoulders, he drew back with disgust and horror on his
face.   For  Mando  was not the man who had ridden out to deliver a message
for  his  king.   His  skin  was  pale as a corpse's, his hair as white and
lifeless.  His eyes were dead orbs sunken deep in their sockets.  But worst
was  the  horrible  wound  in  his  belly  - a large hole in his armour and
clothing  exposed  the  ragged  opening  in  his  skin and flesh.  Marakahn
staggered  back as he saw the empty abdomen.  Mando gazed at him, a look of
extreme  pain  in his eyes, and spoke.  "He told me I would not die until I
gave you his message."

His voice sounded like that of an old, sick man. Marakahn stood trem-
bling. "What is his ...", he stammered, then stopped. He looked in Mandos
eyes with pity on his face. "Mando..", he whispered, "Perhaps our wizards
can..."

But Mando looked back calmly and grimaced. Marakahn realized he was
trying to smile. Mando cast down his eyes. "No, my Lord." He looked up
and his expression had changed. "Please ..." he said, pleading.

Marakahn swallowed. Then he asked, almost whispering "What is his
message?"


Mando  took  a  deep breath and answered " Lord Tarbos, God of Chaos, tells
you  that he will soon come to claim these lands and that he may show mercy
upon  those  who  worship  him  faithfully,  and  that,  and that ..
Coughing racked his weakened body.  He managed to stop for a mo- ment, took
another deep breath, tears glistening in his eyes, and said his last words.
And that he will take Princess Mylneh as his bride."

For  a  number  of heartbeats all went quiet.  Then blood came from Mando's
wound,  a  trickle  at  first,  then growing into a steady flow.  His knees
buck-  led  and  he  fell into King Marakahn's arms.  The blood was gushing
from  the  gaping  hole  in  Mando~s body as the king held him tenderly and
watched  his  face,  tears running down his own cheeks.  The king had never
seen a happier expression on a man's face than on Mando~s when he died.

Marakahn  slowly  lowered  Mando's  body to the floor and closed his broken
eyes.   Then  he stood and looked at the side entrance, where Princess Myl-
neh  had  just come in.  She stared at her father, his grim expression, his
blood-covered  clothes  and  the  body  Iying  in a pool of blood on the st
floor.

"Father?" she stammered. "What has happened?"

The King looked down at the body, then clicked his fingers. The frightened
Chancellor came up to him, nervously wringing his hands. "Take Sir Man-
do away," said the King with a harsh voice. "Prepare him for a suitable
burial." He turned around and sat down on his throne.

"Yes, Your Majesty," stammered the Chancellor. He hurriedly ordered
some of the servants to carry the body away and some others to remove
the blood.

Mylneh  walked up to her father and asked again "Father?  What hap- pened?"
The  King,  who  had been staring sombrely into the distance, looked up and
stared at Mylneh as if seeing her for the first time.  ~Mando has brought a
message  from  Tar  ...   Tarbos," he said, staring at the pool of blood to
which  the  servants were attending.  "It cost him his life." He shivered
and  looked away.  Mylneh saw how deeply shocked her father was.  "What was
the message?", she asked very softly.

"He claims to be a god. Lord Tarbos, God of Chaos. He is ... coming here,
to take this kingdom. And ... he wants you as his bride."

Mylneh turned white as she heard these last words, then sadness filled her
soul and her eyes became moist. ~I knew it ... I knew he would go too far."
She looked at the king. "Oh father, will we be able to stop him?" The king
sighed. "I hope so, my dearest. I will summon Mandek and ask him how
the preparations are progressing."

Mandek came shortly after that, looking a little disgruntled. Marakahn told 
him about the message. "Well, Mandek? Have you and your brothers
found the right spell yet?" Mandek cleared his throat. We have found
one, Your Majesty. But there is one problem. He cast down his eyes,
coughed, then glanced briefly at Mylneh before continuing. "The spell
must be cast by thirteen people - four white wizards, four grey, four
black, and ... someone who knew Tarbos." Mylneh's eyes widened. She
opened her mouth to speak but the king cut her off with a gesture and
asked ~Is there any danger?"

Mandek looked down, then answered. There is, yes. It all depends on the
determination of, er, the person who is the, er, focus of the spell." He
glanced at Mylneh again.

The king leaned back in his chair and said "I will not endanger my ..."

But Mylneh interrupted him and said "I will do it." The king looked long at
her but said nothing. Instead he turned to Mandek and said very quietly
"Very well. Prepare her." Mandek sighed. "Yes, Your Majesty." He pre-
pared to leave with Mylneh when the king said Wait. Does it matter
where the spell is cast?" "Uhm ... No, Your Majesty. Why?"

The king smiled. "There is an old castle in the mountains to the northeast
of the capital. It would be much safer there." Mandek bowed. "Of course,
Your Majesty. What is this castle called?" "It's name is too old to be re-
membered. You will call it Godsbane."

Dark, oily clouds hung over the battlefield as Tarbos looked out over his
undead army and smiled. The remains of the army which had opposed
him were fleeing, mercilessly followed by his warriors who needed neither
rest nor nourishment. Soon he would reach the capital and the king's cas-
tle. Then Mylneh would be his and all would crawl in the dust before him.

~Your Majesty, there is another messenger from your army." King
Marakahn sighed, dreading more bad news. "Very well. What is your mes-
sage, good man?"

The messenger looked up. One could clearly feel he had seen many horri-
ble things in the last few days and the king waited patiently until he had
drawn his wits together.

Greetings, Your Majesty. I ... I have been sent by Sir Laneanor to tell you
that the province of North Danormia has been conquered by Tarbos'
army. We ... We were forced to retreat, Your Majesty. They were demons!
Undead monsters! We ..." The king raised his hand to silence him.

"Yes,  I  have  heard many reports like this." He fell silent in thought, a
troubled expression on his face as so often over the last few days."

- If only I could be sure that Mylneh is safe and that the spell will work.

He pushed these doubts away and forced a smile.

- They mustn't suspect how bad things really are.

Alright.   I  thank you for your message.  Do not worry, we will stop him."
But  his  mind  was  filled with the image of Tarbos' demonic army, cutting
through  his land like a sharp sword through flesh, leaving only gray death
in it's wake.

When  Tarbos  was  two days away from the capital, having chased the king's
army  before  him all the time, he sensed a great concentration of magic to
the  northeast.   Troubled,  he went into a trance and sent his mind out on
wings  of darkness towards the source of magic.  Once there, he rek ognized
which spell was being worked and who was the focus.

- Mylneh.

He concentrated on the place.

- It's a castle... Godsbane...

He returned to his body, seething with anger, and changed his army's
course with a single unspoken command.

"Mylneh? What is wrong?"

She looked up. Just now, she had sensed dark fingers obscenely caressing 
her mind. She shivered, feeling unclean. "It was nothing," she told Man-
dek, then went on with the chanting of the Great Spell. Mandek frowned,
then continued with his own part of the spell.

Marakahn  was  pacing the great hall, angry and frustrated in his helpless-
ness.

- How can I convince these people that all will be well when I am not
  sure myself? When nothing seems to stop this Tarbos?

He rubbed his eyes, he hadn't slept properly in days. A weary messenger
entered the great hall and knelt before him. Marakahn grimaced and said
NYes? What is your message?"

"Your Majesty", the man stammered, "Lord Tarbos's army has changed
course. They are no longer heading for the capital!" Horror filled the king
as he asked what he already knew.

"Where is he headed?"

"To the northeast, Your Majesty."

The king sat down on his throne, defeated.

- The northeast ... to Godsbane.

Tarbos  strode  forward  through  the  ranks of his demonic army with long,
powerful  strides,  pushing aside those who weren't quick enough to get out
of his way.  As he neared the centre of the battle he drew his great sword
and walked on purposefully. He felt filled with power and exhilaration.
Soon Godsbane would fall, although all the king's armies were gatheret
here to defend it.

Then Tarbos reached the front line and grinned as he saw the horror Ol
the defenders' faces at the sight of him. He raised his sword and started
hacking. Men fell before him like corn before the farmer's sickle as he
fought steadily onward towards the large gates of Godsbane. He could
have blasted them all apart here and now, but this was much more fun.

Inside, Mylneh heard the sounds of battle raging, the clash of metal on
metal, the screams of the dying. Terrified, she looked at the twelve wizards
but they were all mumbling their part of the spell. She closed her eyes
tightly and continued to chant.

Laneanor had the remaining human knights regroup before the gates of
Godsbane in a last desperate attempt. They held off the demonic warriors
as best they could but they were tired and Laneanor knew that they would
all die here. He fought on, grimly. If they could buy the necessary time with
their lives, so be it.

Then  he noticed the huge warrior who came through the ranks of the en- emy
and  his  eyes  widened with fear.  It was Lord Tarbos.  He looked like the
demon  he  was,  his  face a mask of hatred and passion, his eyes burn- ing
with  evil fire, his armour of the coldest, strongest steel.  Tarbos raised
his great jagged sword and attacked.

Laneanor tried to parry, but after two vicious slashes his own sword was
cut in two. He backed against the wooden gate and looked around for an-
other sword. Then he realized he was the last one left. Enrodar, who had
fought so bravely in so many wars, lay in the dirt, cut from shoulder to
chest. Gambon, who had been his friend for over ten years, lay against the
gate, blood seeping from a score of wounds. Over and under them lay the
other knights.

- All dead.

looked  out  over the enemy's army.  The sky was boiling.  And all he could
see  under  the  cover  of  dark clouds were row upon row of Tarbos' undead
warriors,  with  an  insane  red  light  glaring  from their eyes and flesh
falling  from  their  bones.   Finally  his gaze fell upon the face of Lord
Tarbos him- self.

They looked at each other for an infinite moment. Then Tarbos effort-
lessly lifted the huge sword and plunged it through Laneanor.

Mylneh stood at the centre of the circle of the twelve wizards, holding the
star-shaped jewel in her hands. It was the Amberstar, the jewel which
would capture Tarbos and banish him far, far away.

It  had  taken  long  days  and  nights  to  create  it, but at last it was
finished.   Now  came  the  most  difficult  part; the twelve wizards would
concentrate  all  their  power in Mylneh, who had to focus her entire being
and  direct  this  power  towards  Tarbos.   Mylneh  swallowed.  Mandek had
explained  that  the  least  distraction  would  mean  failure  and instant
dispersal of the combined power.  She closed her eyes again and ignored the
mumbling of the wizards.  All she should think of was Tarbos.

Tarbos  had blasted the gates wide open and slaughtered the few defend- ers
in  the  castle.   He sensed that the magic came from far above him and ran
towards  the central tower.  With a casual gesture he raised his hand.  The
door  set  in the bottom of the tower blew apart into a thousand pieces.  A
knight  who  had been guarding it screamed and ran out, where he fell under
Lord Tarbos' sword.  Tarbos started climbing the stairs.

Mylneh felt her hair stand on end as the power of the wizards gathered it-
self inside her. She frowned, then ignored the curious sensation and con-
centrated on Tarbos again.

Tarbos was almost running up the stairs now, sensing the huge concentra-
tion of magical power in the chamber above him. He came to the last door
which shattered under his hand and then he had reached the source of the
magic. His eyes widened as he saw that Mylneh was the focus of the
twelve wizards' power and he strode towards the centre of the magic circle
with his sword ready in his hand. The wizards kept on mumbling, caught
too deep in their trance to sense or react to anything. Mylneh did not
move but simply stared at Tarbos, horrified.

 - How he has changed...

She  felt the power growing inside hery Tarbos stood before her, his face a
mask  of  hatred  and  anger,  and raised his sword.  Mylneh felt the power
reach  a  climax  inside her and lifted the Amberstar.  Her eyes still wide
with  wonder,  she placed it on Tarbos' chest.  Then she felt a force being
released and the power flowed througfh her into Tarbos.

Tarbos  looked down at his chest and saw his armour beginning to melt under
the glowing Amberstar.  Then his clothes were burned away and his flesh was
touched.   His  scream  made the tower tremble.  He tried to move his arms.
to  destroy  Mylneh with magic, but he was powerless.  Slowly the Amberstar
sunk deeper inside him and he felt how it burned a hole.  through his body.
The  essence of his being was trying desperately to es- cape but was pinned
down  like a butterfly.  He felt his body burning away from the inside.  He
felt a force tugging at his being, drawing it away.  It tore loose from his
body  and  he  saw  his  own  shuddering, burning body being destroyed by a
wide-eyed  Mylneh.   He  was  being  dragged  higher and higher, faster and
faster,  as  if  he  was  falling upwards.  He suddenly sensed where he was
going.

- The third moon!


He was slammed down deep into the core of the cold block of stone that
was Lyramion's third moon.

Without  Tarbos  the  gateways  to  the Demonic Realms were closing and the
demons had to leave the land of the living.  Uninhabited, the bodies of the
undead  warriors  fell  lifelessly  to  the ground.  The entire area around
Godsbane  looked  as  if  a battle had raged there a hundred years ago, not
just  a moment agQ Mylneh looked in confusion at the Amberstar and the heap
of ash at her feet.  Mandek came and gently took the star-shaped jewel from
her.  "Come, Mylneh.  We must go now."

He  took  her  hand  and  led her out of the chamber, followed by the other
wizards.   She  didn't react to seeing the bodies, ancient and fresh, Iying
all  around.  The wizards behind her closed the gates and put great magical
seals on it.  Mandek took the Amberstar and pressed it onto the wood, where
it left a deep impression.  The seam between the double doors disappeared
and,  starting  around the Amberstar, the wood changed into something else,
something  harder and smoother.  The hardening effect spread over the great
doors  and  went  on  over the walls, over all of the castle until entire
Godsbane had been turned into something stronger than stone.

				EPILOGUE

The only way to ever free Tarbos from his celestial prison deep in the
third moon was to perform a counter-spell inside Godsbane, which is
why the great Sealing Spell was put on the castle by the twelve wizards.
Only the Amberstar could break the seal, but the Amberstar had been di-
vided into thirteen pieces. Each wizard kept one of the twelve points of
the star, to guard them. Mylneh kept the centre piece.

To further ensure that no-one would ever try to enter Godsbane, the Guild 
of Paladines was founded, who vowed to guard it's gates forever.

The task of repairing the damage which Tarbos had caused could begin.


				MARIMON

This is the tale of what happened a thousand years later.

One night. a dark wizard called Marimon was studying scrolls when he 
felt a tugging force on his mind. He frowned in puzzlement and entered
the magical trance state. Slowly he sank through the Demonic Realms,
where he was soon greeted by a Demon Lord.

"Greetings, Marimon" "How do you know my name?" Marimon stuttered.
"I know many things. I am Bralkur, King of Hell. I want to make a
pact with you."

- He must have sensed my true power.

Bralkur smiled. "How right you are. But I am sure you will be interested in
the kind of power I can offer you." Marmion squirmed under the incredible
aura of the Demon Lord. Then he slowly realized what he would be able
to do with the power Bralkur offered. A sly smile spread over his face.

"Well? What kind of pact?"

Bralkur chuckled inwardly.

- The most powerful are always the easiest to seduce.

There was only one being where this had not been true.

- I'm going to help your son, Thornahuun.

Sir Marillion stood on the battlements of the small keep which guarded
the ancient castle of Godsbane and thought sombrely about the conversa-
tion he had had with his fellow paladines. They said that Lord Tarbos
would not return after a thousand years, that they were fools to guard an
old castle. Some of them even said that Lord Tarbos was only a myth, a
story to frighten children.

But he believed the story, and he believed the danger was still there.  So
he guarded with vigilance, whereas his fellow paladines slept when they had
guard duty.

A  loud  explosion brought him out of his reverie.  Looking over the walls,
he  saw smoke and fire coming from the gates of the tower.  He hurried down
the  stairs  and  saw  that several other paladines had heard the noise and
were waking the others.  He reached the entrance hall and saw immedi- ately
that a battle was going on.  As he tried to count the numbers of the enemy,
he was surprised when he saw only one man in a black robe.

Marmion stood before the baffled paladines and grinned.

- Fools! Soon you will realize what a wizard can do!

A dry voice inside his head added:

- Especially when he is assisted by a King of HelL

Marmion frowned and raised his hands. Magical missiles flew forth to-
wards the paladines.

Sir  Marillion saw how the paladines who stood at the front fell before the
red-hot arrows which flew out of the wizard's hands.  He felt anger rise up
in him.
                                                               
- I told all of you that there is still danger.

He  drew  his  sword  and ran towards the wizard from the side.  Out of the
corner  of  his eye he saw how his fellow paladines were slaughtered by the
blistering  fire.   Raising  his sword, he bellowed his war cry and charged
the  wizard,  who  looked  up  at  the unexpected attacker.  But the wizard
raised his hand faster than lightning and fire flared at Marillion who felt
how  his  body  was  being  engulfed in energy, how his skin and flesh were
burned away, how his bones crumbled.  He felt it all.  His being was caught
in the wizard's fire even thou~h his body had turned to ashes.

Marmion smiled and wiped the sweat from his brow. All the paladines
were dead, even that last one.

- Well how do we get in? We do not haue the Amberstar.

- Easy.

Bralkur created a disc of glowing light in front of the gates of Godsbane. 
Marmion was surprised.

- What is that?

- A teleport through the Great Seal, right into the castle.

Marmion fell quiet when he realized the power needed for such a spell.
Then he stepped  through the disc. He had to perform the ritual to free Tar
bos. Thus he would gain ultimate power. Bralkur had said so.


                          The end and the beginning

Only a band of courageous adventurers can stop Marmion, and he must
be stopped for he has enough power to perform the ritual and bring Tar-
bos back to Lyramion.

To stop Marmion, you must enter Godsbane. However, Bralkur's teleport  .
leads through the Demonic Realms, if it is still there at all.         ,

So  you must find the thirteen pieces of the Amberstar.  Some have be- come
lost,  others are still being kept.  You will find clues all over Lyramion.
Once you have found all pieces, you must assemble the Amberstar.  This must
happen in a special place, but sadly no-one knows where ...

Now, go with my blessing. Know that I will try to help you if you really
need me.

Good Luck!

Shandra.
