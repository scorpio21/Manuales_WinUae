ASSASSIN DOCS 
=============

DROPPED BY HELICOPTER DEEP BEHIND ENEMY LINES, YOU ARE THE ASSASSIN, HIRED
BY ALLIED SECURITY FORCES IN A BID TO CEASE THE REIGN OF POWER HELD BY THE
EVIL VILLAN MIDAN, WHO LURKS DEEP WITHIN HIS UNDERGROUND LAIR.

SUPER-FIT AND HIGHLY ATHLETIC, YOU MUST USE ALL THE STRENGTHS AVAILABLE TO
YOU IN ORDER TO REACH THE SOURCE OF HIS POWER AND RENDER IT USELESS, BEFORE
TAKING ON THE MIGHT OF THE FOUL TYRANT HIMSELF.

ARMED WITH A DEADLY RAZOR-EDGED BOOMERANG AND LIMITED BODY ARMOUR, YOU MUST
LOCATE AND PENETRATE THE SECRET SHAFT WHICH LEADS TO THE LOWER LEVELS OF
MIDAN`S VAST SUBTERRANEAN WORLD.

THE TASK IS DEMANDING, BUT THE TIME TO ACT HAS ARRIVED...AS THE WIND BLOWS
IN YOUR HAIR, YOU CAREFULLY LOWER YOURSELF FROM THE CHOPPER AND HEAD OFF
TOWARDS YOUR GOAL...


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

THE GAME REQUIRES AN AMIGA WITH AT LEAST ONE-MEGABYTE OF AVAILABLE RAM AND
A JOYSTICK PLUGGED INTO GAMEPORT TWO. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU RELAY YOUR
AMIGA`S SOUND OUTPUT THROUGH AN AMPLIFIER/HIFI TO SAVOUR THE SUPERB STEREO
SOUND EFFECTS THE GAME HAS TO OFFER. IF YOUR JOYSTICK SUPPORTS AUTO-FIRE
THEN WE RECOMMEND YOU TURN IT OFF AS IT HAS NO POSITIVE EFFECT ON PLAY.

LOADING INSTRUCTIONS:

RESET YOUR AMIGA USING THE TWO AMIGA KEYS AND THE CTRL KEY, INSERT DISK ONE
AND AFTER A SHORT WHILE A TITLE SCREEN WILL APPEAR AND LOADING SHOULD
COMMENCE. INSERT DISK TWO ONLY WHEN PROMPTED BY THE SYSTEM. IF YOU HAVE AN
EXTRA DISK-DRIVE CONNECTED, THEN YOU MAY PLACE THE SECOND DISK INTO THAT.  

ASSASSIN DOES NOT SUPPORT THE USE OF HARD-DISK-DRIVES AND CANNOT BE STORED
AND USED ON SUCH A MEDIUM, ALTHOUGH YOU NEED NOT DISCONNECT THE UNIT.

UPON LOADING YOU WILL SEE THE ASSASSIN ATTRACT SEQUENCE, THE CREDITS AND
THE CURRENT HIGH SCORES. THESE WILL ROLL AROUND IN A CYCLE UNTIL YOU PRESS
YOUR BUTTON TO INITIATE PLAY.

GAME OPTIONS:

WHEN YOU PRESS YOUR BUTTON TO START THE GAME YOU CAN SET FURTHER OPTIONS OR
COMMENCE PLAY. USE THE JOYSTICK TO HIGHLIGHT "OPTIONS" AND PRESS THE
JOYSTICK BUTTON. BY MOVING THE JOYSTICK YOU CAN SET VARIOUS OPTIONS AS
FOLLOWS:

SKILL LEVEL:

YOU CAN PLAY ASSASSIN AT ANY ONE OF THREE SKILL LEVELS, EACH OF WHICH
DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE STRENGTH OF YOUR ENEMY AND THE LEVEL OF AWARDED
BONUSES DURING THE GAME.

ROOKIE:  THIS IS THE EASIEST MODE AND ALLOWS YOUNGER (OR OLDER!)PLAYERS TO 
         EXPLORE MORE OF THE GAME`S AREA, SEE MORE OF THE GAMES ENEMIES AND
         RELAX WITH MORE COMFORTABLE TIME-LIMITATIONS. PLEASE NOTE THAT
         ONLY THE FIRST TWO LEVELS ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS MODE OF PLAY.

ARCADE:  THIS IS THE DEFAULT PLAY MODE, YOU START WITH THREE LIVES BY      
         DEFAULT AND THE GAME IS A WHOLESOME CHALLENGE TO THE AVERAGE GAMES
         PLAYER. YOU MUST PLAY IN ARCADE MODE (OR ULTIMATE MODE) TO SEE    
         THE COMPLETE GAME. 

ULTIMATE:THIS IS A SPECIAL MODE DESIGNED FOR THE TOUGH-NUTS WHO RECKON THAT
         ARCADE MODE IS TOO EASY! ULTIMATE MODE REWARDS THE PLAYER WITH
         HIGH-BONUSES ON LEVEL COMPLETION BUT IT IS NOT CALLED "ULTIMATE"
         FOR NOTHING..THE ENEMIES ARE TOUGH, VERY TOUGH..
         COMPLETE IT IN THIS MODE AND YOU CAN RIGHTLY FEEL VERY PROUD.

BOOMERANG MODE:

MANUAL:  IN THIS MODE YOU ARE ABLE TO SELECT THE EFFECT OF DROPPED
         BOOMERANG POWER-UPS BY FIRING AT THEM WITH YOUR BOOMERANG. SEE
         SECTION 3 FOR DETAILS OF THE EXACT EFFECTS AVAILABLE.

AUTOMATIC:IN THIS MODE YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE EFFECT OF THE BOOMERANGS AND
         THIS MAKES FOR FASTER PLAY. THE BOOMERANG IS POWERED UP AS IF THE
         DESIGNERS OF ASSASSIN WERE PLAYING THE GAME.

STARTING LIVES:

1,3 OR 5:THIS ALLOWS YOU TO SELECT THE NUMBER OF LIVES THAT YOU BEGIN THE
         GAME WITH, THE DEFAULT BEING THREE. BIG BONUSES ARE GIVEN FOR
         STARTING WITH ONE LIFE, LESS SO FOR THREE AND NONE IF YOU SHOULD
         START WITH FIVE.

YOU MAY EXIT THE OPTIONS AND COMMENCE PLAY BY SIMPLY HIGHLIGHTING "EXIT".

PLAYING THE GAME: 

AT THE START OF THE GAME YOU USUALLY BEGIN WITH 3 LIVES (SEE ABOVE SECTION)
AND YOU LOSE ENERGY BY ABSORBING TOO MANY HITS FROM THE ENEMY, WHICH
EFFECTS YOUR ENERGY WHICH IS REPRESENTED BY A PURPLE HEART IN THE TOP LEFT
OF THE SCREEN. THIS HEART DEGENERATES DURING PLAY AND ONCE IT IS DRAINED, A
LIFE IS LOST.

DIFFERENT ENEMIES/WEAPONS ARE LOGICALLY MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN OTHERS, SO BE
CAREFUL. SOME HEAVY FALLS CALLS ENERGY LOSS TO, SO WE ADVISE CAUTION.

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO GET AS FAR AS YOU CAN INTO THE BASE, FOLLOWING
THE MISSION BRIEFS THAT WILL APPEAR BEFORE EACH OF THE GAMES FIVE HUGE
LEVELS.

YOU CAN KILL OR DAMAGE WITH YOUR ARMOURED BOOMERANG, DIFFERENT ENEMIES WILL
REQUIRE MORE HITS THAN OTHERS AND SOME WILL REQUIRE PRECISE HITS TO BE SURE
OF VICTORY. YOU CAN ALSO "POWER-UP" YOUR BOOMERANG AND USE SPECIAL "MEGA
WEAPONS", THIS IS EXPLAINED IN LATER SECTIONS. YOU CAN ALSO EARN BONUSES
AND EXTRA LIVES BY LOCATING HIDDEN AREAS AND PERFORMING SPECIFIC,
UNDISCLOSED TASKS.

ONCE ALL YOUR LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST, THE GAME ENDS. YOU WILL BE GIVEN A
RANKING AND IF SUCCESSFUL, GIVEN THE CHANCE TO ENTER YOUR NAME IN THE HIGH 
SCORE TABLE, WHICH YOU ARE ALSO ABLE TO SAVE FOR FUTURE POSTERITY SHOULD
YOU WISH TO PROVE YOUR WORTH AS A NOTABLE ASSASSIN. THE TOP RANK POSSIBLE
IS THAT OF "TEAM17 GOD" AND WE DON`T ENVISAGE TOO MANY OF THESE BEING
HANDED OUT!

1:CONTROLLING YOUR ASSASSIN CHARACTER;
YOU HAVE THREE BASIC MODES OF OPERATION, ONE WITH THE FIRE BUTTON PRESSED
DOWN, ONE WITHOUT AND ONE TO ACCESS SPECIAL "MEGA WEAPONS".

WITHOUT THE BUTTON DEPRESSED, YOU ARE ABLE TO CONTROL YOUR MOVEMENTS AROUND
THE SCENERY. LEFT AND RIGHT WILL ENABLE YOU TO RUN IN THE RELEVANT
DIRECTION, UP WILL ALLOW YOU TO JUMP, DOWN WILL CAUSE YOU TO CROUCH AND
UPWARD DIAGONALS WILL ENABLE YOU TO LEAP IN THE RESPECTIVE DIRECTION.

YOU WILL NOTICE THAT YOU CAN INTERACT FULLY WITH THE BACKGROUND AND YOUR
ASSASSIN CHARACTER WILL GRAB HOLD OF ANYTHING HE FINDS AVAILABLE TO CLIMB
OR SWING ON- THE CONTROL OF WHICH WE THINK YOU WILL FIND QUITE COMFORTABLE
AND EASY TO CONTROL.

WHEN HANGING BY HIS ARMS, THE ASSASSIN IS ALSO ABLE TO PERFORM A SOMERSAULT
AND LEAP ONTO AN ABOVE LEDGE, YOU CAN DO THIS BY PUSHING UP OR THE UP-
DIAGONALS ON THE JOYSTICK. TO DROP FROM A LEDGE WHEN HANGING, SIMPLY HOLD
THE JOYSTICK DOWN.

IF YOU HOLD THE JOYSTICK DOWN WHILST THE ASSASSIN IS STANDING, HE WILL STAY
IN A CROUCHED POSITION AND YOU CAN FIRE BOOMERANGS OR ACCESS THE "VIEW
MODE" (SEE LATER). TO MOVE OUT OF THE CROUCHED POSITION, MOVE THE JOYSTICK
TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT.

A QUICK PRESS ON THE FIRE BUTTON (WITH THE JOYSTICK CENTERED) WILL THROW A
BOOMERANG IN THE CURRENT DIRECTION FACED. IF YOU PRESS THE BUTTON AND HOLD
THE JOYSTICK IN THE DIRECTION, HE WILL FIRE A BOOMERANG IN THE DESIRED
DIRECTION. YOUR ASSASSIN IS ABLE TO FIRE WHILE STANDING, CROUCHING, HANGING
OR SWINGING-BUT NOT WHILST HE IS MOVING DUE TO THE ACCURACY NEEDED WHILST
THROWING SUCH A PRECISION WEAPON. THE ASSASSIN WILL KEEP THROWING
BOOMERANGS IN YOUR SELECTED DIRECTION UNTIL YOU RELEASE THE BUTTON AGAIN.

IF YOU HAVE COLLECTED ANY OF THE PODS THAT ALLOW ACCESS TO THE SPECIAL
"MEGA WEAPONS" THEN A THIRD, SPECIAL CONTROL MODE WILL BE ACTIVATED. TO DO
THIS, YOU MUST BE STOOD ON A SOLID SURFACE (I.E. NOT SWINGING, CLIMBING OR 
HANGING) AND THE MODE IS ACTIVATED BY PRESSING AND HOLDING THE JOYSTICK
BUTTON.

THE AVAILABLE "MEGA WEAPONS" WILL FLASH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN IN A
SEQUENCE AND YOU MUST RELEASE THE BUTTON WHEN THE SELECTED WEAPON IS
HIGHLIGHTED. YOU CAN ALSO HOLD THE JOYSTICK IN A UPWARD POSITION TO PAUSE
THE SELECTION AND TIME DETONATION OF THE WEAPON PRECISELY. YOU CAN ABORT
THIS MODE OF CONTROL BY HOLDING THE JOYSTICK IN A DOWNWARD POSITION.

AFTER SELECTING AND ACTIVATING ONE OF THE "MEGA WEAPONS" THE ASSASSON
CHARACTER WILL REMAIN STATIONARY UNTIL THE EFFECTS OF THE DETONATED WEAPON
SUBSIDE AND IST SAFE TO CARRY ON.

OTHER METHODS OF OPERATION;

VEIW AREA:
          TO VEIW THE AREA IMMEDIATELY ABOVE OR BELOW THE ASSASSIN YOU CAN
          USE THE "VEIW MODE". TO ENTER THIS, SIMPLY ENTER THE CROUCH
          POSITION AND PUSH THE JOYSTICK UP OR DOWN. TO LEAVE THIS MODE YOU
          SIMPLT MOVE THE JOYSTICK LEFT OR RIGHT.

          THIS MODE IS USEFUL IF YOU ARE UNSURE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS. NOTE 
          THAT YOU CAN STILL FIRE WHILST IN THIS MODE.

          ALWAYS REMEMBER, LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP!

2.TIME LIMIT EFFECTS;
EACH OF THE GAME`S FIVE HUGE LEVELS IS SUBJECT TO A STIRCT TIME LIMIT AND
ONCE THIS IS REACHED, REINFORCEMENTS AND STRONGER, MORE CAPABLE FOES WILL
ARRIVE ON THE SCENE. COLLECTING TIME-BONUSES ARE ONE WAY OF AVOIDING
THIS..SO YOU ARE WELL ADVISED TO GET A MOVE ON.

3.POWER-UPS AND BONUSES;
THE GAME OFFERS MANY POWER-UPS AND COLLECTABLES AS THE GAME PROGRESSES,
GIVING YOU THE ABILITY TO GAIN BETTER, MORE AGILE BOOMERANGS, SCORE LINE
BONUSES, TIME LINE BONUSES AND THE ABILITY TO INVOKE SPECIAL "MEGA-WEAPONS"
THESE ARE IN THE FORM OF CAPSULES AND ARE FOUND IN SECRET LOCATIONS OR
AWARDED AFTER A PARTICULARY NASTY ENEMY HAS BEEN DEFEATED.

BOOMERANG POWER-UPS ARE EARNED BY DESTROYING ENEMIES AND COLLECTING THE
ROUND CAPSULES THAT ARE LEFT.

THE BOOMERANG POWER-UPS THAT ARE OFFERED ARE IN A CUMULATIVE EFFECTED, IN A
SERIES THAT WE REGARD IDEAL TO SUIT THE PLAY; CHANGING DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF
THE WEAPON AS YOU MORE - SO THAT YOU HAVE A WEAPON THAT PROVIDES A LITTLE
BIT OF EVERYTHING.

HOWEVER THERE IS ALSO THE FACILITY TO CHANGE THE EFFECT OF THE POWER-UP
CAPSULE BY SHOOTING IT - THE LETTER ON THE CAPSULE WILL CHANGE AND
THEREFORE YOU CAN (IF YOU PREFER), TAILOR YOUR BOOMERANG TO SHOW YOUR OWN
SPECIFICATION.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ABOVE CHANGING EFFECT IS ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN PLAYING
THE GAME IN MANUAL BOOMERANG MODE (SELECTABLE VIA OPTIONS), THIS IS THE
DEFAULT OPTION.(SEE GAME OPTIONS IN EARLIER SECTION).

THE ROUND BOOMERANG POWER-UP CAPSULE TYPES ARE AS FOLLOWS AND CAN BE
POWERED UP A NUMBER OF TIMES ; 
      
    W  GIVES YOUR BOOMERANGS THE ABILITY TOMOVE IN A WIDER ARC WHEN THROWN.
       USEFUL FOR REACHING ENEMIES THAT A NORMAL STRAIGHT THROWN BOOMERANG 
       WOULDN`T REACH.(RATHER LIKE A WELL KNOWN BEVERAGE!)

    E  ADDS TEH POWER TO HAVE ANOTHER EXTRA BOOMERANG IN THE AIR, TO A
       MAXIMUM OF FIVE.IF ALL OF YOUR BOOMERANGS ARE IN THE AIR THEN YOU
       MUST WAIT UNTIL ONE OR MORE HITS SOMETHING OR RETURN BACK TO YOU 
       BEFORE WE CAN THROW ANOTHER.

    P  INCREASE THE BOOMERANGS ACTUAL POWER. WHEN YOUR BOOMERANG BECOMES
       MORE POWERFUL, THE WEAPON TAKES ON A DIFFERENT GRAPHICAL FORM.

    S  INCREASE THE SPEED AND HENCE THE EFFECT OF YOUR BOOMERANGS.

    L  INCREASE THE LENGTH (DISTANCE) THAT A BOOMERANG IS THROWN.

ONE OPTIONAL THROWING TACTIC IS THE "REVERSE-THROW" WHERE YOU THROW A
BOOMERANG IN ONE DIRECTION THEN JUMP OR DUCK ON IT`S RETURN, RESULTING IN
THE BOOMERANG FLYING OFF IN THE OTHER DIRECTION USUALLY MUCH FUTHER THEN
YOU CAN NORMALLY THROW IT. IT`S A VERY USEFUL TACTIC TO ADOPT, BUT QUITE A
DIFFICULT SKILL TO MASTER, BUT WITH THE BOOMERANG CAUSING EVEN MORE DAMAGE
THAN USUAL, IT`S WELL WORTH IT - ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT YOU CAN HIT
ENEMIES FROM A SAFE DISTANCE!

THE SQUARE "MEGA WEAPON" POWER-UP CAPSULE TYPES ARE AS FOLLOWS;

    W  GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO USE THE ROBO-WALKER MEGA-WEAPON.

    M  GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO USE A SET OF PROXIM-MINES.

    H  GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO USE THE HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES.

    F  GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO USE THE FLAME-PATH MEGA-WEAPON.

    S  GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO USE THE FLAME-STORM MEGA WEAPON.

YOU MAY ALSO DISCOVER OTHER CAPSULES AND BONUSES DOTTED AROUND THE COMPLEX,
THESE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING;

TIME ADD            (SEE SECTION 2).
 
ENERGY              RESTORES PLAYER ENERGY TO MAXIMUM.

                    WAVING) TO EARN YOURSELF AN EXTRA LIFE. AN EXTRA LIFE
                    CAN ALSO BE EARNED BY COLLECTING 99 STARS(SEE SECTION 4

SPEECH AID          IF FOUND, THIS USEFUL GADGET WILL GUIDE YOU AROUND THE
                    MAP AND ON TOWARDS THE TARGET LOCATION. IT WILL ONLY
                    LAST A CERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND COMES INTO REAL VALUE
                    ON LATER LEVELS, ESPECIALLY THE LAST LEVEL, MIDAN`S
                    LAIR, WHICH IS A HUGE LABYRINTH.

                    IT IS ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THIS GADGET WILL
                    ONLY BE FOUND ON ROOKIE AND ARCADE MODES OF PLAY AND
                    ONCE FOUND IN ROOKIE MODE, IT STAYS ON FOR THE DURATION
                    OF PLAY.

4. COLLECTING STARS;
ON EACH LEVEL THERE ARE MANY GOLD STARS TO COLLECT. IF YOU MANAGE TO
COLLECT 99 THEN YOU ARE REWARDED WITH A BONUS LIFE.

UPON COLLECTING 50 YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACTIVATE THE SPECIAL STAR BURST
"MEGA WEAPON" BUT THIS WILL RENDER THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLECTING AN EXTRA
LIFE REMOTE FOR A WHILE, BUT THATS YOUR CHOICE....

5. HIDDEN BONUSES;
THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED IN MANY NUMBER OF STYLES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REWARDED
BY SPECIAL BONUSES UPON LEVEL COMPLETION. SOME OF THESE SUCH AS COLLECTING
ALL 99 STARS ARE OBVIOUS, BUT THERE ARE MANY MORE FOR YOU TO TRY AND
DISCOVER. SOME, SUCH AS THE "PERFECT PLAY" SUPER BONUS WILL RARELY BE
HANDED OUT, CAN YOU MANAGE IT?

THESE BONUSES WILL BE AWARDED DURING THE INTER-LEVEL SCREEN AND WILL BE
SHOWN WITH ANY AWARDED POWER-UPS, SCORE BONUSES AND SO ON, IN THE FORM OF
ICONS, RATHER LIKE BEING AWARDED A MEDAL FOR YOUR DEEDS.

7. GAME OVER & CONTINUATION;

IN THE GAME THERE ARE SPECIAL "CONTINUE" BONUSES, WHICH WILL BE FOUND BY
ONLY THE BEST. HOWEVER ONCE FOUND, SUCH A BONUS WILL ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUE
THE GAME FROM WHERE YOU FINISHED PREVIOUSLY.

THERE IS NO OPTION TO SKIP COMPLETED LEVELS, NOR IS THERE SAVE-GAME
OPTION, SO LOCATING THE "CONTINUE" BONUSES IS A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF
COPMLETING THE GAME, ALTHOUGH A GAME COMPLETED WITHOUT THEIR USE WILL OF
COURSE RANK FAR HIGHER IN TERMS OF AWARDED BONUSES.

ON GAME-OVER YOU WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO ENTER YOUR NAME IN THE HIGH SCORE
TABLE ( WHICH IS SAVEABLE, SIMPLY FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON YOUR SCREEN)
AND YOU WILL ALSO RECEIVE A RANKING WHICH IS DECIDED UPON BY YOUR SKILL AND
STYLE OF PLAY AND, OF COURSE, YOUR SCORE.

TITLE-SEQUENCE, WHICH SPARES YOU FROM A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISC-ACCESS.
