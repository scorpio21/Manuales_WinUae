the known universe called Galaxy's End by the TimeLord Elders. You are in

Alien Fires --- Operating Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STARTUP --- REQUIRES Kickstart 1.2!

	Alien Fires, 2199 AD is designed to run under version 1.2 of the
Amiga operating system. Simply start your Amiga using version 1.2 of
Kickstart, and then insert your Alien Fires, 2199 AD master disk at the
Workbench prompt.


Saving Adventures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	While playing Alien Fires, 2199 AD, you may want to save your current
adventure. In order to do so, it is important that you format a blank disk
and name that disk "AF_CHARS". Be sure to do this BEFORE you begin to play
Alien Fires, 2199 AD. Keep in mind that as new parts of Alien Fires become
available, you will be able to use your existing stored characters in these
new adventures.


Resuming an Adventure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	You may resume an adventure that you have previously stored by
selecting this option at the Main Menu. You will then be given a list of the
adventures currently on your Alien Fires adventure disk from which you may
select the adventure that you wish to continue.


Extended Memory Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Users of extended memory systems, or RAM expansion systems, may make
use of additional memory to improve disk access during play, by copying image
and sound files from Disk#2 to a RAMDISK before running Alien Fires, 2199 AD.
Alien Fires will AUTOMATICALLY check for a


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 2 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


particular file in RAM if you are using extended memory. The only hitch is
that the layout of the RAM disk must be the same as that of Alien Fires, 2199
AD, Disk 2. In other words, the subdirectories "GFX" and "SFX" must appear in
the RAM disk. The most commonly accessed files during play are "GFX/Death" 
and "SFX/HB".

TimeLords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	An immortal race of beings responsible for protecting the temporal
balance of the universe from chaos and destruction.

	As a new TimeLord on your first mission, your powers are temporary
and dependent solely upon your performance. The Elder's Council will be
constantly weighing your character's performance to determine whether you
should be allowed to continue on your mission to stop Kurtz.


TimeLord Skills
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	All TimeLords have abilities, called skills, which are selected by
you when you create a new TimeLord. These


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 3 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


skills determine the overall ability of your character during game play.
There are seven skill values, each ranging from 0 to 99 points. These skills
are...
 
Fighting - The ability of your character in Hand-to-Hand and melee combat.
~~~~~~~~
Marksmanship - The ability of your character in using ranged weapons. This
~~~~~~~~~~~~   affects your character's overall performance during ranged
               combat.

Diplomacy - Determines your character's skill in interacting with other
~~~~~~~~~   characters in the game. This value will affect your character's
	    chance of successfully gaining information from the other
	    characters in Alien Fires, 2199 AD along with the purchasing and
	    trading of items.

Dexterity - This is your character's skill in performing delicate operations
~~~~~~~~~   such as picking locks and disarming nuclear devices.

Understanding - This skill determines your character's ability in using
~~~~~~~~~~~~~   unknown or new items. Generally, this will help your
		character point dangerous items like Plasma Rifles in the
		correct direction before firing them.

Tracking - This skill reflects your character's chance of seeing hidden
~~~~~~~~   objects such as traps --- before it's too late --- and secret
	   doors!!!

Quickness - This is your character's speed of reaction to situations such as
~~~~~~~~~   an attack by one of the less friendly characters in Alien Fires,
	    2199 AD. If your skill in this area is high, you just might be
	    able to avoid the other character's first strike.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 4 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Note that all of these skills will go up -- or down -- during the game
depending upon how well your character has been performing. The decision to
raise or lower your character's skill points is the responsibility of the
Elder's Council, and is done automatically as they review your TimeLord's
success to date.


Creating a TimeLord
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	You create a new TimeLord when you begin to play Alien Fires, 2199 AD
simply by selecting the "Create a new TimeLord" option from the Main Menu.
Creating your TimeLord is done by selecting the values [0-99] for each of the
seven aforementioned skills until you no longer have any points remaining to
allocate. When you select 'OK' the adventure will begin using your newly
created TimeLord.


Viewing Your TimeLord's Stats During the Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	You will want to keep constant tabs on your character's state as you
progress through the world of Alien Fires, 2199 AD. You can view your
character's stat sheet at any time during the game simply by pressing the
"AF" logo on the control panel on-screen. What you will see is as follows...

Skills - A list of your current skill values by name.
~~~~~~
Name - The name that you selected for your character.
~~~~
Level - Your character's current Level. This gives you a rough indication of
~~~~~   how powerful your TimeLord is.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 5 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


EP's - The amount of Experience Points [EP's] your character has. This value
~~~~   is used to increase your character's overall Level above.

Combat Readiness - An outline of your character, the shaded locations of
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   which indicate where your character is currently protected
		   by armor that he is wearing. Below this figure appears a
		   number which represents your character's Hit Points [HP's]
		   This value determines how much damage your character can
		   take before dying. See the Combat section of this manual
		   for more information on Hit Points and armor locations.
		   The speed of the cycling band of colors below your
		   character's outline varies depending on his performance.
		   The better your character's performance, the faster the
		   cycling colors.

Item List - The names of items -- up to a maximum of three -- which indicate
~~~~~~~~~   the objects in your inventory which you are currently using.


On Death and Dying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Since your character is bound to run into some obstacles that he may
not be able to overcome, you may find yourself in the rather uncomfortable
situation of being faced with death. Remember, the Elder's Council is
reviewing your every move on this mission and dying is considered something
of a failure in their eyes. When you die, your character will be brought
before the Elder's Council for review. This review progresses visually before
you on your Amiga's display. if the TimeLord Elder's are satisfied with your
character's performance to this point, you will be ressurected and allowed to
continue on your mission. If however,


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 6 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


your character has dissapointed them once too often, your character will be
stripped of his TimeLord powers and will not be allowed to continue on his
mission. The TimeLord Elders will inform you of their decision by
communicating directly with you. If your character is resurrected, he still
faces some form of penalty to his skill levels and Experience Points since
death is usually a negative experience.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Characters are an integral part of Alien Fires, 2199 AD and you will
find that your character's success in interacting with other characters in
the game will determine the overall outcome of your character's mission.

	Characters in Alien Fires, 2199 AD are exactly like real people. Each
and every one of them have friends and long term "memories". Many of the
characters in Alien Fires, 2199 AD have vital pieces of information that they
may tell you if you ask the right question(s) or offer something in return.
It's up to you to find out exactly what those questions, or that something
might be. However, since you can communicate and trade with characters just
as you


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 10 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


would in real life, you should find this process quite natural. But be
forewarned, characters in Alien Fires do not take kindly to insulting
behaviour!!!


Combat --- or Fighting With Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Fighting with other characters in the game is a special form of
interaction with its own set of commands and options. All combat takes place
on the special Combat Screen of Alien Fires, 2199 AD. The combat screen is
comprised of four major parts...

Weapon - The top line of the screen indicates the name of the weapon that
~~~~~~   your character is fighting with. If this weapon is a firing weapon,
	 an ammunition guage appears next to the weapon's name indicating the
	 number of rounds left in the weapon versus the maximum number of
	 rounds possible for this weapon. The current color of the guage
	 changes from shades of green, if the weapon is nearly full, to
	 shades of red as the weapon runs out.

Opponent - A picture of your character's opponent appears in the centre of
~~~~~~~~   the screen.

Combatants - The generic outlines of your character and your opponent's
~~~~~~~~~~   character will all currently armored locations shaded. Below
	     your character's outline which appears on the left side of the
	     screen is a running total of your character's Hit Points.

Options - Combat options appear centred at the bottom of the screen.
~~~~~~~

	The combat session which your character is in continues until either
your character or your opponent runs away or dies.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 11 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Picking a Fight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	There are two ways to get into a fight or combat in Alien Fires, 2199
AD. One is to let your character start it by clicking on the figure of the
other character that is on screen. The other occurs when your character's
actions or presence has aggravated the character on-screen to the point of
violence. Either way, you will find yourself in the special combat mode of
Alien Fires, 2199 AD. It is only fair to warn you that if your character
picks a fight with another character, your character runs the risk not only
of dying, but of facing the vengeance of your opponent's friends.


Options and Interaction During Combat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Options during combat are restricted to those that are directly
relevant to the fight at hand. There are four options, three of which appear
on-screen, the fourth being your character's inventory which is associated
with the right mouse button. The four combat options are...

Fight - Attack your character's opponent using the currently selected weapon.
~~~~~
Panic - Attempt to run away from your opponent. This option will not always
~~~~~   succeed.

Dodge - Select an evasive action for your character that makes him a more
~~~~~   difficult target for his opponent.

	You can change your character's current weapon or reload a firing
weapon by clicking the right mouse button to bring up your character's
inventory and either selecting a new weapon to change weapons, or selecting
the ammunition for the current weapon in order to reload.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 12 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Damage and Armor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	There are seven locations for damage and armor in Alien Fires, 2199
AD. These are the head, chest, abdomen, and the right and left arms and legs.
Armor used by your character can protect any number of these seven locations.
Up to two pieces of armor can be used by your character at any one time.

	During combat, damage is reported on a hit by hit color-coded basis
by location. Every time a combatant takes a hit, the location of the hit is
highlighted by a color corresponding to the degree of damage done to the
character. The more damaging the hit, the closer the color is to red, the
lighter the hit, the closer the color is to green. Each hit is also
accompanied by a numeric damage value. This value indicates the actual damage
done to the character himself. This value also take into account any
protection offered to the character by armor covering the damaged location.
Note that it is possible therefore, for a character to have all or part of
his armor destroyed during combat. This is what has happened when a
previously armored location (a shaded area on the character) reverts to an
unshaded area.
