CrEePy, KoOkY, oOkY, SpOoKy.

Morticia has been kidnapped!

Uncle Fester has lost his memory and has fallen under
the spell of Abigail Craven, a conniving character who
is anxious to lay her greedy hands on the Addams'
hidden fortune.

Having recruited a misled Fester, and assisted by her
cohorts, Tully and The Judge, she manages to capture
and imprison the other members Or lhe Addams Family
within the huge Addams' Mansion!

Only Gomez can save the day by freeing his son
Pugsley, his daughter Wednesday, and Granny; and by
restoring Fester's memory. Accomplishing these tasks
is daunting enough - but then Gomez must seek out
Morticia in the underground vaults of the Addams'
mansion and confront the evil Judge in a kooky and
spooky climax!

STATUS PANEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You begin  the game with just two heart units, which means that
Gomez can sustain two hits before losing a life. These units can be
replenished  along the way, but there are opportunities to collect an
extra THREE energy  units by defeating some of the large guardians
(bringing your heart quota up to a potential FIVE, allowing you to now 
sustain five hits!). The top letft of the screen displays your
energy information; the number of hearts shows how many enery units you 
have left in total - the solid ones show you how many hits you have left 
before losing a life.

MONEY
~~~~~
Along the way, Gomez can collect money, shown as $. For every 25
$ you will have a heart replenished (if necessary). On collecting 100
$, you will gel a 1-UP. The $ collected are displayed on the bottom
left of the screen.

Lives
~~~~~
Gomez has an infinite number of lives, due to the continue Option
(see CONTINUE). However, he only has so many 'lives' per attempt,
before he is put back to the start. These lives are displayed next to
the $ on the bottom left of the screen.

Additional 1-UPs can be collecled along the way, and earned (see
MONEY). You begin the game with 5 lives.

Score
~~~~~
Points are scored each time you collect an object, or stomp a nasty.
If you manage to stomp a number of nasties consecutively (that is,
bounce from one to the next), the points scored for each one will
double. You will be awarded a 1-UP for each 50,000 poinls. The
score is displayed at the top of the screen.


PLAYING THE GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gomez must rully explore the Addams Mansion and rescue Pugsley,
Wednesday, Granny, Uncle Fester, and finally, Morticia. The Mansion
is enormous, and his journey will take him inside, outside, above
and below. Walking, flying and swimming. Gomez must keep his
wits about him at all times as danger lurks within every scenario. If
anything, the Mansion is tven weirdtr than the Family, and nothing
is quite as it seems, but careful exploration of walls and other
features may prove very rewarding.

The only information Gomez has is a cryptic note handed to him
by thing:

		The Big Bird, The Sinister
		Centipedes and The Shape-
		Shifting Snowman are
	        Guardians of the heart. The
		Wacky Scientist babysits
		Pugsley, While the Grinning
		Goblin Nurses Wednesday.
		Granny cooks for the Funky
		Fire-Dragon and Uncle
		Fester walks Hypnotised by
		The Wicked Witch.
		Liberate Them All to Give 
		Lurch the Tune That Opens
		The WAy to the Ultimate 
	 	Treasure.


More information will be given by Thing along the way, as he is your
only ally.

You begin at the front door to the Addams Mansion. At this point
you can explore around outside, or enter the front door by pushing
Joystick UP. Note that this action is used each time you wish to
enter a doorway or opening.

On entering The Mansion, Gomez has a choice of doors to enter,
each accessing a different (and very large) area of the house. These
can be played in any order, but some are better (and easier) to
complele than others.

Within each area are a number of strange creatures who wiil do their
utmost to hinder Gomez. The only way to eliminate these guys is to
is to jump onto them - but watch out; if any or them has a pointed or
spiked head, you must avoid hitting them!

Each door from the hall of stairs will lead, ultimately, to one of
the Big Bad Guys, and therefore a mojor reward - either a captured
member of the Addams family or an extra heart.

Also, there are items scattered around the mansion that can assist
Gomez in his task (see PICK-UPS). Many of these are in plain view
along the way, but nothing  is as straightforward as it seems. The
Addams family and everything associaled with them is WEIRD...
especilly their home! Secret doors exist everywhere; of course,
the doorways are usually invisible to the human (and INhuman)
eye, so exploration Oo walls and floors is highly recommended, Look
out especially for inconsistencies in appearance. It is all very
deceptive, but highly rewarding if discovered!

Each time you rescue a member of your family they will make their way
immediately to the music room. Here, Lurch sits at his orgran
ad plays a tune. Each member of the family gives Lurch a portion of 
music to play. This tune will build up gradually as Pugsley, Granny, 
Wednesday and Fester have been rescued. Once they are ALL congregated 
in the music room, Lurch will have the entire tune to play which will 
open up the secret passage leading to the underground chambers, and
eventually, Morticia!


SWITCHES
~~~~~~~~
At strategic places within the Mansion are Switch-Blocks, sometimes
marked ON or OFF, and sometimes just shown as a patterned block.
Jump up to hit and switch these blocks. The result can be
discovered further down your path (or maybe back the way you
came!). These usually make platforms appear or provide access to
otherwise inaccessible places.

YOU must figure out whether they should be switched off
-experiment!


END OF LEVEL BAD GUY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the end of each major area of the mansion, you will confront a
LARGE Bad Guy! To defeat it, you must stomp on its head a
number of times, while avoiding it and any projectiles it may launch.
An ENERGY METER will appear on the right side of the screen to
display how many hits you need to defeat the Bad Guy. Accomplish
this, and the reward makes it all worthwhile!


CONTINUE
~~~~~~~~
When you lose all of your lives, you are allowed to CONTINUE the
game, if desired. When this option is selected, you will restart from
the Hall of Stairs in the Mansion. However, you will retain however
many HEART units you had when you last played, and whichever
members of your family you had rescued.


PASSWORD
~~~~~~~~
When you score a major achievement, such as gaining an extra
HEART, or rescuing a member of lhe Family, you will be given a
password - MAKE A CAREFUL NOTE OF THIS! Next time you play the
game, you can input your password to enable you to start wilh the
same number of hearts, and Family rescued, as you had last time
you played. You will, however, restart the game in the Hall of Stairs.


THING
~~~~~
By some of the doors, you will sec a box labelled A. These are
Thing's boxes, and if you jump up under them, Thing will spring out
and reveal a clue for thw section you arceplaying.

These can be REALLY useful!


PICK-UPS
~~~~~~~~
There are many items scattered throughout the Mansion (and 
beyond) which will aid Gomez in his quest:

Small Hearts: Replenish one of your Heart energy-units, if applicable.
	      These will NOT add to your overall heart quota.

Dollar $    : See MONEY

1-UP 	    : Increaes your lives by 1

Shield      : Makes Gomex indestructible for a limited time. The
	      shield effect is portrayed as a 'star trail'. A noise 
	      will sound just before your shield expires.

Shoes       : Makes Gomez move faster and jump further. You can lose the
	      shoes when hit by a baddy but you wont lose any energy.

Fez	    : If Gomez jumps into this floating hat, it becomes a
	      'Fezi-copter' and allows him to fly about for a limited 
	      time by repeated pressing of the JUMP Button. The 
	      'Fezi-copter' will be operative until you enter through 
	      a door. At that time, it will flash to signify the 
	      remaining few seconds it is operative.

Points      : As wcel as gaining points by collecting items and stomping
              enemies, there are 'invisible' points scattered throughout 
	      the Mansion. You cannot see these, but if you touch them, 
	      an indication will appear on screen  (in Units Of 1000).


PLAYING TIPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Trees are a good place to begin, then find somewhere cold.
  The Big Bad Guys at the end of these secLtons may be
  dangerous, but they are not Heartless.

* Going back through the same door does not always lead you
  back to the same place.

* There is always a 'safe spot' when confronted by a Big Bad
  Guy. Find this and you should defeat him easily.

* Use the creatures as 'springboards' to jump on in order to
  reach an otherwise inaccessible spot.

* Map your progress - remember, the Mansion is HUGE, and you
  don't want to forget where you're going (or have been!).

* Platforms may materialize in mid-air as you walk across - be
  brave!
