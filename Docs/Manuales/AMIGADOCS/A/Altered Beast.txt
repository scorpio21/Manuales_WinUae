                                ALTERED BEAST

AWAKEN THE BEAST WITHIN YOU...

Zeus has called upon you! Only a brave and fearless warrior can save his
beloved daughter Athena, from the cunning clutches of Nelf, evil Lord of
the underworld.

Risen from the grave, you are presented with Supernatural powers beyond
this world. Collect the 'mystical' spirit balls and transform into an
awesome array of creatures - as Strongman, punch and kick harder than ever
before, as WereWolf and WereTiger rip the flesh off the demons of hell and
as Bear, knock out your enemies with one bad breath!

You hear the distant cries of the beautiful Athena and as terrors of the
Underworld tighten their grasp, the beast within you rises to face the
final battle!!
