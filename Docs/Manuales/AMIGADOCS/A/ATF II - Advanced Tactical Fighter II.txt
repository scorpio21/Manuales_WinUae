BALANCE OF POWER:

 . BASES                . FACTORIES
 . TANKS                . FUEL DUMPS
 . SHIPS                . SUBMARINES
 . COMMUICATIONS        . ARTILLERY

CHANGES IN ENEMY AND ALLIED STRENGTHS ARE DISPLAYED AT THE END OF EACH BAR
GRAPH,WITH GAINS AND LOSSES SHOWN AS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE VALUES.
CHANGES WILL BE ZERO BEFORE YOUR FIRST MISSION AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE COMBINED
EFFECT OF:

 . TARGETS DESTROYED BY BY YOUR AIRCRAFT
 . TARGETS DESTROYED BY ALLIED & ENEMY FORCES
 . TARGETS CAPTURED BY ALLIED & ENEMY FORCES
 . TARGETS REGENERATED BY FACTORIES

IF ALL ALLIED MOBILE FORCES ARE EXTERMINATED THEN THE ALLIES WILL BE FORCED TO
SURRENDER.THE OVERALL BALANCE OF POWER IS SUMMARISED BY THE SCALES SYMBOL. USE
THE NEXT BOX OR SPACE BAR TO MOVE ONTO THE NEXT DISPLAY.

MISSION BRIEFING:

PLANNING YOUR FLIGHT ROUTE BEGINSAT THE MISSION BRIEFING. SHOWN ON THE GLOBAL
ARE ALL POSITIONS OF ALLIED AND ENEMY INSTALLATIONS AND MOBILE FORCES. THE
SMALL TV SCREENS PROVIDE A KEY FOR ALLIED,ENEMY,ATF AND LAND SYMBOLS THE
LOCATIONS OF EACH TARGET WILL VARY FROM GAME TO GAME,EVEN ON THE SAME MAP. AT
THE BEGINNING OF YOUR OWN GAME,THE EXACT NATURE OF EACH ENEMY INSTALLATION IS
UNKNOWN.INTELLIGENSE REPORTS WILL IDENTIFY TWO TARGETS AND STORE RANGE AND
BEARING INFORMATION IN THE ON-BOARD COMPUTER DATABASE.ADDITIONAL ENEMY THREATS
WILL BE ANALYSED AND IDENTIFIED DURING YOUR MISSION SA YOU FLY WITHIN RANGE OF
EACH TARGET.

YOUR CURRENT `ATF` POSITION IS HIGHLIGHTED ON THIS DISPLAY. DEPENDING UPON THE
RANGE TO YOUR CHOSEN TARGETS,YOU MAY DECIDE TO RETURN TO THIS ALLIED BASE OR
TERMINATE YOUR MISSION AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION. IT IS ALWAYS USEFUL TO CHECK
FOR NEARBY ALLIED BASES EN ROUTE JUST IN CASE YOU NEED TO DIVERT AND LAND IN
AN EMERGENCY.IT IS ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THE MAP `WRAPS AROUND`.IE FLY OFF AN
EDGE OF THE MAP AND YOU WILL APPEAR AT THE OPPOSITE EDGE.

WEAPON SELECTION;

THE ONLY REMAINING TASK BEFORE TAKE-OFF IS TO REFUEL AND REARM YOUR
AIRCRAFT.MISSILES ARE LOADED OR UNLOADED IN PAIRS AND THE CANNON ROUNDS ARE
BELT FED INTO THE AIRCRAFT.WEAPONS AND FUEL ARE LOADED AND UNLOADED BY USING
THE MOUSE POINTER ON THE RELEVANT TV SCREEN(LEFT MB TO LOAD, RIGHT MB TO
UNLOAD) OR BY USING THE FUNCTION KEYS(F1 TO LOAD CANNON, F2 TO UNLOAD CANNON)

PRIOR TO TAKE OFF YOU WILL ALSO NEED TO CHECK YOUR FUEL STATE.

AS YOU LOAD UP WITH WEAPONS AND FUEL YOU WILL NOTICE THE `FREE WEIGHT`
DECREASING. THIS FIGURE IS THE MAXIMUM ADDITIONAL WEIGHT THAT YOU CAN LOAD
ABOARD YOUR AIRCRAFT. THE ATF WILL BE AT ITS MAXIMUM WEIGHT WHEN THE FREE
WEIGHT IS ZERO.

CHOOSE A COMBINATION OF WEAPON AND FUEL APPROPRIATE TO YOUR MISSION.AFTER YOUR
FIRST FLIGHT, YOUR AIRCRAFT WILL ALREADY BE RE-ARMED AND RE-FUELED WITH THE
SAME COMBINATION IN ORDER TO MINIMISE TIME TO TAKE-OFF.

INSTRUMENT PANEL:

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL IS CONFIGURED AROUND 3 MULTIFUNCTION DISPLAYS(MFD).ON THE
ST AND AMIGA VERSIONS ALL PANEL FUNCTIONS CAN BE CONTROLLED USING THE MOUSE.
THE DISPLAY ON EACH MFD IS USER SELECTABLE FROM THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.

(1)    MOVING MAP

A LARGE SCALE PLAN VIEW OF NEARBY TERRAIN AND TARGETS.ADDITIONAL INDICATORS AT
THE LEFT AND LOWER EDGES SHOW THE APPROPRIATE GLOBAL POSITION.

(II)   GLOBAL MAP

A `WORLD` MAP HIGHLIGHTING LOCATION OF THE ATF AIRCRAFT AND DESIGNATED TARGET.

(III)  PRIMARY FLIGHT INFORMATION

 . SPEED................AIRCRAFT SPEED
 . HEADING..............DIRECTION OF FLIGHT
 . ALTITUDE.............HEIGHT ABOVE SEA LEVEL
 . RADIO ALTITUDE.......HEIGHT ABOVE THE GROUND
 . POWER................ENGINE THRUST SETTING
 . FUEL.................REMAINING FUEL

(IV)  DATABASE

A COMPUTER DATBASE CONTAINING INFORMATION ON ALLIED AND ENEMY TARGETS. THE
INFORMATION IS ORGANISED INTO CATEGORIES;

 . ALLIED OR ENEMY
 . TARGET CATEGORY IE, TANK, FACTORY ECT
 . KNOWN TARGETS WITHIN CATEGORY

SELECT AN ENEMY TARGET BY SWITCHING TO THE ENEMY HALF OF THE DATBASE,THEN
SELECT THE REQUIRED CATEGORY..EG SHIPS, AND THEN STEP THROUGH ALL KNOWN SHIP
LOCATIONS. AT THE BEGINNING OF A GAME, THE LOCATIONS OF ONLY 2 ENEMY
INSTALLATIONS OR MOBILE FORCES WILL BE KNOWN. DETAILS OF ALL ALLIED LOCATIONS
WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES. AS YOU FLY WITHIN RANGE OF A NEW ENEMY TARGET,
RANGE AND BEARING INFORMATION WILL BE ENTERED INTO THE DATABASE THUS
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TARGETS SELECTABLE.

IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE THE MOUSE POINTER ON THE DATBASE `MFD` TO SELECT A
TARGET(ON ST AND AMIGA ONLY):

 . NEAR - NEAREST TARGET
 . COM - MOST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED TARGET ON MESSAGE PANEL
 . A/E - ALLIED OR ENEMY BASE
 . +/- - STEP FORWARD OR REVERSE THROUGH CATEGORY

(V)   ATF SYSTEM STATUS

THIS DISPLAY HIGHLIGHTS SYSTEM DAMAGE DETECTED IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS:

 . AIRFRAME.............AIRCRAFT HANDLING
 . WEAPONS..............WEAPON ACCURACY
 . AVIONICS.............HUD,MFDS...ECT
 . ENGINE...............REDUCED ENGINE THRUST


(VI)  WEAPONS DISPLAY

SHOWS WEAPON TYPE SELECTED(CANNON,AMRAAM OR MAVERICK), NUMBER OF TYPE
AVAILABLE,FUNCTION(AIR-TO-AIR OR AIR-TO-GROUND). THIS DISPLAYS ALSO COMFIRMS
WHEN A MISSILE IS LOCKED ONTO ITS TARGET AND READY TO LAUNCH.

(VII) OTHER

ON THE LEFT OF THE PANEL YOU WILL FIND THE THROTLE LEVER WHICH CONTROLS ENGINE
THRUST. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FLY TO SLOWLY OR ELSE THE AIRCRAFT WILL STALL AND
LOSE ALTITUDE. BELOW THE LEFT MFD IS THE MISSILE ALERT INDICATOR. THIS WILL
FLASH WHEN AN INCOMING MISSILE IS DETECTED. RESPOND BY PRESSING THE JAM KEY(OR
CLICK ON THE FLASHING LIGHT WITH THE MOUSE ON ST OR AMIGA) EITHER SIDE OF THE
CENTRE MFD ARE THE FOLLOWING STATUS/SELECTOR LIGHTS;

 . VT - VECTORED THRUST. USED TO SLOW DOWN DURING COMBAT
 . RL - BARREL ROLL.(ST AND AMIGA ONLY)
 . W  - WEAPON SELECT(ST AND AMIGA ONLY)
 . UC - UNDER CARRIAGE
 . AL - AUTOMATIC LANDING
 . TF - TERRAIN FOLLOWING RADAR

HEAD UP DISPLAY:

THE LEFT HAND VERTICAL SCALE SHOWS THRUST SETTING(SOLID TRIANGLE) AND SPEED
(POINTER) THE RIGHT HAND VERTICAL SCALE SHOWS ATF ALTITUDE(POINTER) AND GROUND
LEVEL(SOLID TRIANGLE). AS YOU FLY OVER HILLS YOU WILL SEE THE SOLIDE POINTER
RISE AND FALL. THE HORIZONTAL SCALE SHOWS THE COMPASS HEADING OF YOUR
AIRCRAFT(SOLID TRIANGLE) AND THE BEARING(POINTER) OF THE SELECTED TARGET. WHEN
YOUR HEADING MATCHES THE TARGET BEARING THE SYMBOLS WILL BE SUPERIMPOSED AND
YOU WILL BE FLYING TOWARDS THE TARGET.IF THE BEARING IS OFF THE SCALE THEN THE
POINTER WILL SHOW YOU WHICH DIRECTION TO TURN.

AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE HUD YOU WILL SEE RANGE AND BEARING
INFORMATION FOR THE SELECTED TARGET. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE REPLACED BY
`DASHES` IF NO DATA IS AVAILABLE.

MISSION:

(A) TAKE-OFF

TO TAKE OFF,OPEN THE THROTTLE AND PULL BACK ON THE JOYSTICK.AS SOON AS YOU ARE
AIRBORNE, RAISE THE UNDERCARRIAGE OR ELSE YOUR MAXIMUM SPEED WILL BE SEVERLY
REDUCED.

(B) TARGET SELECTION

TARGETS ARE SELECTED BY DISPLAYING THE COMPUTER DATABASE ON ONE OF THE MFD
SCREENS, SELECT THE `ENEMY` DATABASE AND THEN THE REQUIRED TARGET EG
TANKS,BASES,SHIPS,COMMUNICATIONS,FACTORIES,FUEL DUMPS,SUBMARINES OR ARTILLERY.
NOT ALL CATEGORIES WILL CONTAIN INFORMATION DUE TO LACK OF DATA OR TARGETS
HAVING BEEN DESTROYED. CATEGORIES MAY CONTAIN MORE THAN ONE TARGET IF
INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. YOU MAY SELECT A PARTICULAR TARGET OR SIMPLY SELECT
THE NEAREST. MESSAGES WILL APPEAR DURING YOUR FLIGHT ANNOUNCING DETECTION OF A
NEW ENEMY TARGET WITHIN RANGE OF YOUR AIRCRAFT. PRESSING THE ENTER KEY WILL
AUTOMATICALLY SELECT THIS TARGET IN THE DATABASE.

(C) WEAPON OPERATION

THERE ARE 3 TYPES OF WEAPON AVAILABLE - CANNON..AMRAAM AND MAVERICK. ALL
WEAPONS ARE FIRED USING THE SAME `FIRE` BUTTON, SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO SELECT
YOUR REQUIRED WEAPON BEFORE USE.

(1) CANNON:
FOR USE AGAINST ENEMY INTERCEPTOR AIRCRAFT AT CLOSE RANGE..EG IN A DOG FIGHT.
SELECTION CONFIRMED ON HUD BY `CANNON` LEGEND PLUS CANNON SIGHT. NOTE THAT THE
CANNON SIGHT WILL MOVE WHEN THE ATF IS TURNING.

(2) AMRAAM
ALSO FOR USE AGAINST ENEMY INTERCEPTORS,WITH THE ADVANTAGES OF LONG RANGE AND
AUTOMATIC TARGET TRACKING. SELECTION CONFIRMED ON HUD BY AMRAAM LEGEND PLUS
TRACKING BOX. THE LOCK-ON DIAMOND WILL APPEAR WITHIN THE TRACKING BOX AS SOON
AS THE TARGET IS WITHIN RANGE. ACCURACY WILL DETERORATE AFTER WEAPON SYSTEM
DAMAGE.

(3) MAVERICK
AIR TO GROUND MISSILES FOR USE AGAINST ENEMY INSTALLATIONS AND MOBILE GROUND
AND SEA FORCES. SELECTION CONFIRMED ON HUD BY MAVERICK LEGEND PLUS TRACKING
BOX. THE LOCK ON DIAMOND WILL APPEAR WITHIN THE TRACKING BOX AS SOON AS TARGET
IS WITHIN RANGE. EFFECTIVENESS INCREASES AS YOU GET CLOSER TO YOUR TARGET.

(4) INTERCEPTORS
ENEMY INTERCEPTOR AIRCRAFT WILL APPEAR FREQUENTLY WITH THE SINGLE OBJECTIVE OF
PREVENTING YOU FROM COMPLETING YOUR MISSION. ATTACKS WILL OCCUR FROM BOTH
HEAD-ON AND FROM THE REAR AND YOU ARE ADVISED TO TAKE DEFENSIVE ACTION AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. USING EITHER CANNON OR AMRAAM MISSILES, INTERCEPTORS WILL
APPEAR ON YOUR MOVING MAP, GIVING YOU PRIOR WARNING OF THEIR APPROACH.

(5) INCOMING MISSILE ALERT
THE ENEMY WILL LAUNCH SURFACE TO AIR MISSILES(SAMS) AS YOU APPROACH
INSTALLATIONS SO BE PREPARED TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION BY USING YOUR JAMMER.
INTERCEPTORS ARE ALSO CAPABLE OF LAUNCHING AIR TO AIR MISSILES(AAMS) AND YOU
ARE ADVISED TO USE THE JAMMER AS AN ELECTRONIC COUNTER MEASURE.

(6) TACTICS
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME YOU WILL ONLY KNOW THE PRECISE LOCATION OF TWO
ENEMY TARGETS. HAVING ARMED AND RE-FUELLED YOUR AIRCRAFT, TAKE-OFF AND PROCEED
TO THE NEAREST TARGET. THROUGHOUT YOUR FLIGHT YOU WILL RECEIVE MESSAGES
CONFIRMING NEW DATA ON THE LOCATION OF ENEMY TARGETS.USE FUNCTION KEY 5 OR THE
ENTER KEY TO LOCK ONTO THE MOST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED TARGET.

STRATEGICALLY, EACH TYPE OF INSTALLATION HAS A SPECIFIC ROLE TO PLAY. FOR
EXAMPLE, FACTORIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIR AND MANUFACTURE OF TANKS,SHIPS
ECT...FUEL DEPOTS WILL GOVERN THE MAXIMUM RANGE OF MOBILE UNITS,AND
COMMUNICATION BASES CONTROL THE INTELLIGENCE AND DEPLOYMENT OF MOBILE FORCES.

BY LAUNCHING AN AIR-TO-GROUND MISSILE AT MAXIMUM RANGE IT IS LIKELY THAT YOU
WILL ONLY DAMAGE THE TARGET. THIS MAY ENABLE ALLIED FORCES TO CAPTURE THE
INSTALLATION AND USE IT FOR ALLIED PURPOSES..EG TO CAPTURE AN ENEMY AIRBASE TO
USE FOR LANDING.

USING THE TERRAIN FOLLOWING SYSTEM WILL REDUCE THE FREQUENCY OF ENEMY
INTERCEPTORS AND AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE ATTACKS.USE THE VECTORED THRUST AND BARREL
ROLL TO MANOEUVRE INTO FIRING POSITION WHEN ATTACKED FROM THE REAR BY AN
INTERCEPTOR.(TO BARREL ROLL, YOUR SPEED MUST BE OVER 400KTS).

(7) LANDING
ALL LANDINGS ARE PERFORMED USING THE AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM.WHENEVER YOU ARE
WITHIN GUIDANCE RANGE OF AN ALLIED AIRBASE YOU WILL SEE THE AUTOMATIC LANDING
INDICATOR FLASH(AL).IF YOU WISH TO LAND THEN SELECT `AUTOMATIC LANDING`AND THE
ATF AUTOPILOT WILL TAKEOVER CONTROL. LOWER YOUR UNDERCARRIAGE BEFORE TOUCHDOWN
AND KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR INTERCEPTORS DURING THE LANDING SEQUENCE.

DEBRIEF;

AFTER YOUR FLIGHT YOU WILL SEE THE DEBRIEF SCREEN WHICH SUMMARISES THE
FOLLOWING:

 . PERFORMANCE - FAIR,GOOD ECT...
 . ATF CONDITION - DAMAGE SUSTAINED DURING MISSION
 . TARGETS DESTROYED IN EACH CATEGORY
 . CURRENT SCORE - TOP LEFT HAND CORNER OF SCREEN
 . NUMBER OF LIFES LEFT - TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER.

UPON LEAVING THE DEBRIEF SCREEN YOU WILL RETURN TO THE DISPLAY FOR BALANCE OF
POWER.

GAME OVER;

GAME OVER IS REACHED IF (A)YOU ABORT THE GAME.(B)YOU HAVE NO ATF AIRCRAFT
LEFT.(C)THE ALLIES SURRENDER OR(D)YOU REACH A STALEMATE. IF YOU ACHIEVE YOUR
OBJECTIVE OF GETTING THE ENEMY TO SURRENDER YOU WILL PASS THROUGH THE
CONGRATULATIONS SCREEN.

HIGH SCORE TABLES;

A HIGH SCORE TABLE IS USED FOR EACH DIFFICULTY LEVEL. ACHIEVING A NEW HIGH
SCORE WILL QUALIFY YOU FOR ENTRY OF YOUR NAME OR INITIALS INTO THE HIGH SCORE
TABLE FOR THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL JUST PLAYED. THE HIGH SCORE TABLE MAY BE SAVED
ON HARD DISC OR FLOPPY. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FORMATTED DISC TO HAND IF
NECESSARY. IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY SAVED A HIGH SCORE THEN MAKE SURE THAT YOU
LOAD THE HIGH SCORE TABLES BEFORE YOUR FIRST GAME.
