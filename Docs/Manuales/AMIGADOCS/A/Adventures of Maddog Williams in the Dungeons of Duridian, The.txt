Welcome adventurer, to the world of Maddog Williams. A world of kings and
castles, of great dragons and lovely princesses. Come sit with me for a 
while, rest from your weary travels and I will tell you a tale.
                                                                            
This is a story filled with both good and evil. For you see, many years ago
there was a king ...............                                           

This king who was named Serak, was seduced by the power of the dark god, 
Malthazar. He became an evil and powerful man. For many years he ruled with 
blood and horror from his dark fortress atop the Corbala mountains.          
                                                                        
One day, a man named Sir Robert Thaylor, a cousin to the wicked Serak, 
decided the time had come to end the Dark King's evil rule. He gathered 
together a secret army and trained them in the art of war. In the land were
White Wizards who pratised the magic of truth and light. Thaylor gathered 
these wizards together and enlisted them in his noble cause. They planned for
many months, developing strategies and making weapons. When the preparations
were complete, Thaylor took his men across the plains of Gilgorath to the
foot of the Corbala mountains.                                                             
                                                                           
There they engaged in battles against the armies of Serak. The fighting was
fierce and the battle for good and evil raged for many days. The powers of 
Malthazar were pitted against the power and will of the White Wizards. Many
good men lost their lives in the conflict, but Thaylor's army prevailed and
drove the army of Serak into the wilderness. They then stormed the castle and
captured Serak.                                                            
                                                                             
The white wizards cast Serak into an enchanted cellm banishing him for     
eternity. As the portal slowly closed, Serak's voice echoed through the 
castle, "By all this evil and in the name of Malthazar, I shall return and
wreak my vengeance upon this land." The Dark Castle of Serak was left in 
ruin as a reminder of the evil that had once enveloped the land.            
                                                                           
The people of the land made Thaylor their king and the kingdom prospered.
After several years of peace and prosperity there was born to King Thaylor
and his Queen, a daughter whom they name Leoria. Times were good for the 
people of Duridian and Marinor. No longer oppressed, many men began to travel
to far lands seeking adventure and riches.                                 
                                                                           
One of the most adventurous of these men was Sir Walter Williams of Marinor.
Sir Walter travelled to all known lands to meet with kings and princes. He 
travelled through dangerous waters just to watch the sunset over the bay of 
Baldagorg and swim with the mermaids of Carish.                           
                                                                            
While Sir Walter roamed the world, his wife stayed at home and raised their 
son whom they name Michael.                                              
                                                                          
Michael Williams grew up a bright and inventive boy, always tinkering and
inventing new things. As Michael grew into adulthood he found he had a 
passion for history and began to collect objects from times gone by.       
                                                                           
Some days Michael would sit on the rocks by the beach and wait for his 
father's return. He was always anxious to hear the stories his father had to 
tell. Michael would listen with interest and longing to all of his father's
adventures. When we would ask if he could accompany his father the answer 
was always "When you are a man then you may come."                         
                                                                            
One day while his father was away, young Michael ventured into the local 
tavern. Pulling up a chair he sat down amongst his father's friends. 
"Begone you young pup, this is a place for men!" one grisled old sailor said.
"Today is my eighteenth birthday, so today I am a man." Michael said. 
"BAH!" the sailor said, "You aren't a man until you can out drink me! Barkeep
bring us two tankards of your foulest ale." Soon two foaming mugs of ale were
placed before them. "If you can finish that ale before me then you can call
yourself a man." The old sailor grabbed his mug. Lifting it to his lips he 
began to gulp down the ale.                                               
                                                                           
Michael, accepting the challenge, raised his mug, threw back his head and 
poured the ale down his throat as fast as lightning, and slammed his empty
mug on the table. The old sailor choked, spewing ale all down his front.
Looking at the ale dripping from Michael's face the old man said, "With all 
that foam on your face young man you look like a mad dog." The pub erupted 
in laughter. Wiping his face, Michael stood with pride and walked out of the
pub, the men still laughing behind him.                                   
                                                                            
Henceforth, Michael Willians was known as Maddog Williams, he has born that
name since.                                                                
                                                                          
Maddog's father shook with laughter as Maddog told of his experience in the
pub. Slapping his son on the back, Sir Walter said, "When I leave next spring
you may accompany me." Maddog filled with excitement and anticipation, looked
forward to the following spring.

The following week, Maddog's father took him to the weapon smith in Sydra. 
There Sir Walter purchased the finest sword and presented it to his son.
                                                         
During the following months, Maddog's father taught him the art of sword 
play. Maddog practised many hours and became a fine swordsman.         
                                                                        
The winter that year was harsh. One day in late winter while Maddog and his
father were chopping wood, Marinor was attacked by a group of pirates. The
men of the village came to defend their families against the raiding pirates.
The fighting was fierce and much blood flowed that day. Maddog and his 
father entered the battle fighting side by side, but as the battle wore on
Sir Walter and Maddog were separated. When the battle was done and the
pirates were driven from the village, Maddog went in search of his father.
As Maddog rounded one of the buildings he saw his father sitting against the
wall clutching his stomach as blood ran from the large gash in Sir Walter's 
belly. Maddog rushed to his father's side. Sir Walter looked up at his son
and said, "I'm not much longer for this world. Take care of your mother,
I'm very proud of you." Sir Walter gasped as his body was wracked with pain.
Grasping Maddog's shoulder, Sir Walter died. Maddog was heartbroken. After
they buried Sir Walter, Maddod sat upon the rock where he had, in times past,
waited for his father's return and looked out over the Ocean. Maddog's mind
was filled with memories  of sitting by the fire and listening to his 
father's tales.                                                              
                                                                           
That spring Maddog boarded the ship and set forth without his father on his
first adventure. Maddog travelled to far lands and collected treasure and 
artifacts. Many times Maddog and his companions had to fight of pirates and
outrun seamonsters. They fought against the Navarall on the Island of
Wilikarik and procured the stone of Gorack.                               
                                                                          
After several years of travelling the world, Maddog decided it was time to 
settle down. He returned to the village of Marinor, built himself a house,
and opened a shop. He dealt in rare and precious objects.                
                                                                           
Unknown to Maddog and the residents of Marinor was the evil blight slowly
enveloping the land. King Thaylor and his daughter had not been seen for 
weeks, and rumours abounded that the vile and evil Serak had escaped his
enchanted cell. The people of Sydra were living in fear of Syrak's 
vengeance. So it was that one day Maddog awoke and found himself thrust into
the midst of the evil and treachery.                                       
                                                                            
You, brave adventurer, have been sent as the guide and mentor to Maddog 
Williams. Together you will travel as Maddog learns of the evil swiftly 
approaching his quiet village. If the two of you fail to stop this spreading
evil, the world will be plunged into an everlasting darkness and despair.
Go forth adventurer and meet your destiny.

			    IN THE BEGINNING.
			    -----------------

You will now be greeted by the Guardian of Marinor. His responsibily is to 
explain to you the events leading up to your adventure and to make sure that
you can pass the test of the noble heart. If you do not answer his questions
correctly, you will not be allowed to leave the valley of Marinor.

You will now find yourself in the bedroom of Michael (Maddog) Williams. On
the wall of the bedroom is one of Maddog's inventions and on the bed Maddog
lies asleep. After a series of events, Maddog awakens and stands up beside
his bed. You now may fulfill your role as a guide and companion to Maddog.

MOVING THE CHARACTER:

Move Maddog over to the set of drawers at the foot of his bed. To do this,
you may use either a joystick, keypad or arrow keys. To select the joystick
press the J key while holding down the Control key. You will notice that the
icon at the top of your screen will change from a picture of a key, to a 
picture of a joystick. To select back to the keyboard repeat the process. 
Note that the icon will change back to a picture of a key. Pressing up on 
the joystick will move Maddog up, as well as pressing the up arrow key or 
the 8 on the keypad. For the purpose of this manual we will assume that you
understand the basics of moving by using the joystick, keypad or the arrow
keys. If you do not, please take a few minutes to experiment with them. 
When you press either of the shift keys, it will be the same as pressing 
the fire button on the joystick which will cause Maddog to jump in the 
direction he is moving, or straight up if he is not moving.

CHANGING THE SPEED:

You may change the speedat which Maddog moves, this may be done in 
two ways:

1.) Press the F6 key and use the arrow keys to move up or down the 	
    selections. When the sword is beside your selection hit the ENTER
    key.

2.) Type in your desired speed. 'FAST', 'NORM' or 'NORMAL' or 'SLOW',
    using the text input.



	                     SHORT WALK THROUGH.
			     -------------------

USING THE KEYBOARD:

Type in  : LOOK DRAWERS.

Response : The solid oak dresser stands against the North wall of the
	   bedroom. A small Chinese vase sits on top of the dresser.

NOTE : You must press the ENTER key to erase the text response. If you try
to type while a text is being displayed on the screen you will hear a beep.
This is done so that you will not miss any important text displays that may
come up while you are typing.

Type in  : OPEN DRAWER.

Response : The drawer slides quietly open.

Type in  : LOOK IN DRAWER.

Response : The top drawer contains my clothes.

Type in  : CLOSE DRAWER.

Response : The drawer slides closed.


			      FIGHT / PRACTISE MODE.
			      ----------------------

Move Maddog to the shelves on the West wall and pick up his sword. To
activate fight/practise mode press the F1 key. If an enemy is present
on the screen (you can tell this is the case by the enemy health line
appearing below Maddog's health line). Maddog will draw his weapon in
preparation for battle. If an enemy is not present, a prompt will ask if
you wish to practise. If you do press 'Y', if not press 'N' or ANY OTHER
KEY. The fight/practise mode may not work in all situations. i.e. when
Maddog is sitting down.

Once in fight/practise mode you may control Maddog by using the joystick/
keypad or arrow keys, whichever you have selected. When in fight/practise
mode Maddog will only move left or right , not up or down.

Moving the joystick left or right moves Maddog to the left or right. 
Pressing the fire button causes Maddog to attack in the direction he is
facing. By pushing the joystick up and pressing the fire button , Maddog
will swing his sword up. By pulling down on the joystick and pressing the
fire button, Maddog will swing low. Leaving the joystick neutral, Maddog
will swing level. To block the blows from the enemy, hold the joystick 
down. After a block, you must again pull the joystick down to block a
second time.

To exit from the fight/practise mode press the F1 key.


			       INVENTORY
			       ---------

Another function is inventory. To see the inventory press the F7 key. If
you picked up the sword it would now show up in the inventory list on the 
left hand side.


				SOUND ON/OFF
				------------

This is a toggle switch to turn the sound effects on or off. If you press 
the F8 key you will then see an icon at the top of the screen that tells 
you if it is on or off.

			        HELP SCREEN.
				------------

This function is activated by pressing either the F2 key or the HELP key
(if available). It then brings up a screen describing the different 
functions and their keys.

				REPEAT KEY.
				------------

This is done by pressing the F3 key. This will repeat the last line typed
in.

				THE TAB KEY.
				------------

This key will display the last text output to the screen.


				HINTS AND TIPS.
				---------------

1.) When entering a new screen type LOOK or LOOK AROUND. This will give
    you an all round description of the screen and will sometimes give 
    you hints about what to do next.

2.) Try picking things up. There are many things to pick up and use 
    throughout the game. In some cases, if you have failed to pick 
    something up, it may stop you later in the game and cause you to go 
    back and get it.

3.) Save often. It is always a good thing to save often or at a critical
    point of the game. EXAMPLE: If you come into a screen which shows a 
    gaping hole and no apparent way across. Or if you come into a screen
    with a large scary monster. In these cases it may be best to save your
    game. That way, if Maddog is killed, you may restore without going back
    through the entire game or an earlier saved game.

    You will not be able to save your game on a screen where an enemy is 
    present. When you are running the game from a floppy drive you will be
    asked to insert a pre-formatted floppy disk to save to. You will only 
    be able to fit a maximum of 10 games on each diskette, but you can 
    write over a save game that you already have. When using a hard drive
    you will be able to save as many as 18 saved games.
