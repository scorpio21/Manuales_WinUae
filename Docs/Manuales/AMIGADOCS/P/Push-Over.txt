 -GAME PLAY-
 -----------

 The objets of the game is to manipulate the blocks in order to achieve a 
 'chain-reaction'of falling dominoes.The LAST domino to fall.however,
 must always be the TRIGGER block.All other blocks,apart from the red
 STOPPERS,must have fallen before the TRIGGER block.
 G.I.ANT can pick up and carry,then drop,any of the blocks into
 different positions,except for the TRIGGER which cannot be moved
 many blocks have different symbols,signifying the particular property
 of that block - at any time during play,pressing 'P' or F1 will pause
 the game and bring up the help screen,showing you the symbols
 and their meanings.
 
 When you're sure you have positioned all of the blocks correctly,you
 have just ONE push to succeed.If successful,you must exit the open
 door within a time limit,otherwise the screen will have to be re-played.
 If you are unsuccessful at completing a screen,press ESC to re-try.
  
                           G.I.ANT
 G.I.ANT is tough,and can fall from a pretty good height with just a 
 dazed head.however,there is a limit,and if G.I.ANT falls too far,he
 will disintegrate.The level will have restarted if this happens.
 Similarly,he can get crushed if caught under a toppling block.he is
 also quite happy to run up and down steps with blocks,if necessary.
 G.I.ANT is strong enough to carry blocks along the surface,and even
 up and down ladders.Basically,the only thing too heavy for him to 
 move is the TRIGGER block.Due to the energy exerted to manipulate all
 the blocks,G.I.ANT only has enough strength for ONE push per screen.

                           PAUSE/HELP
 When 'P' or F1 is pressed during gameplay,this will PAUSE the game,
 and bring up a help screen,showing and describing the 'SPECIAL'
 domino-blocks.Additionally,once you have overrun the time limit,this 
 screen will also display a HINT on how to complete the current screen.
 
      
                           BLOCKS:
                           -------

  -----   NORMAL(plain yellow)
 |     |  These fall just once,except when they are placed on the edge of
 |     |  steps or at the edge of a gap,where they will tumble until they
 |     |  reach a flat surface or another block.
 |     |  
  -----   

  -----   TUMBLER(middle red,top and bottom yellow)
 |_____|  These continue tumbling until they are stopped by a fallen block.
 |XXXXX|  
 |XXXXX|  
 |     |  
  -----   

  -----   ASCENDER(one vertical red stripe) 
 |  |  |  These will,when hit,float up until they hit an obstruction,at which
 |  |  |  time they will continue flipping in the same direction until stopped
 |  |  |  by a flat surface.
 |  |  |  
  -----   
 
  -----   BRIDGER(one horizontal red stripe)
 |     |  When positioned at the edge of a a gap,when hit these will bridge
 |_____|  the gap.When positioned elsewhere,they will act as a NORMAL block.
 |     |  
 |     |  
  -----

  -----   DELAY(diagonally,half yellow,half red)
 |X\   |  When hit,these will not fall for a few moments,causing the 'hitter
 |XX\  |  block'to rebound off it.
 |XXX\ |  
 |XXXX\|  
  -----

  -----   SPLITTER(horizontally,half yellow,half red)
 |     |  When hit (usually by a falling block),this will split and knock
 |_____|  over blocks on both sides of it.
 |XXXXX|  
 |XXXXX|  
  -----

  -----   VANISHER(two horizontal red stripes)
 |_____|  When hit,this will knock the next block over,then vanish as it
 |     |  hits the ground.
 |_____|
 |     |
  -----

  -----   EXPLODER(verticaly,half yellow,half red)
 |XX|  |  When hit,this will explode,leaving a gap in the platform.
 |XX|  |  
 |XX|  |  
 |XX|  |  
  -----   

  -----   STOPPER(plain red)
 |XXXXX|  When hit,the block will rebound off it.This block cannot topple
 |XXXXX|  
 |XXXXX|  
 |XXXXX|  
  -----   

  -----   TRIGGER(three horizontal red stripes)
 |_____|  This must be the last block to fall to open the door to the
 |_____|  next screen.
 |_____|  
 |     |  
  -----   



                     DOS & DON'TS
                     ------------


 DO ensure that the TRIGGER is the last block to topple.
 DON'T allow a block to fall from directly above onto another block,
 unless the lower block is a SPLITTER.
 DO keep your exit door clear.

                     TOKENS
                     ------

 When you complete a screen successfully,and within the time limit,you
 will be awarded a TOKEN.TOKENs can be used in two ways:

 1) If you complete a screen,but have gone beyond the time limit,
 you will be allowed to use a TOKEN to allow you to progress to the
 next level.

 2)if you fail a screen for any reason other than overunning the time limit
 you can use a TOKEN to replay the screen from the point at which you
 'pushed'-i.e. the screen will be set up as you arranged previously.NOTE-
 the timer will also be reset to the time at which you made the push.
                    
                     QUAVERS
                     -------

 On each level,there is a screen which,when completed successfully,will
 award you with a pack of Quavers.The specific screens are unknown,
 but you will need to collect all ten packs in order to play the very final
 screen.you will not be awarded your pack of Quavers if you have used a
 token to complete that particular screen.

                     PASSCODES
                     ---------


 After each screen is complete,you will be given a number,which will
 allow you to play the game from the level you last played.
 The passcode number contains information relating to:
 
 1)The screen you have progressed to.
 
 2)The number of packs of Quavers collected
 The passcode does NOT contain information relating to TOKENS,so
 when you restart using a passcode,you will have no tokens.
 
                     HINTS & TIPS
                     ------------


 1) Although you only have one PUSH,results can sometimes be achieved 
 in other ways.
 
 2)No matter how many blocks are on screen,you only need to rearrange a
 few sometimes no blocks need to be moved,it is just a question of which
 to push!

 3)It is possible(and sometimes necessary) to move standing blocks after
 a cascade has started!

 4)Always ensure G.I.ANT has access to the exit,although he CAN move faster
 than toppling blocks.

 5)if you run out of time,you can always access the PAUSE/HELP screen 
 for a HINT.
