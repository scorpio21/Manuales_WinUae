The Story So Far...

The evil Lord Talmouth, ruler of the underlands, has broken the bonds
which have held him in check for centuries. Now free, he has called
forth his hordes of vicious trolls, heartless fighters, zombies, and
other abominations of nature to wreak havoc upon the once-peaceful
Kingdom of Waerna.

As a paladin, you have decided that it is your duty to go forth with
your band of nine champions and vanquish the Lord of Darkness deep
within his own domain. Your quest will be long and full of great
danger. From time to time, you may expect new supplies and party
members, provided by grateful villagers, but those who will risk the
honor are few and far between. You must be prepared to use your
party's full magical abilities or there will be little hope of victory.

Talmouth's power lies in the secret scrolls he has stolen; scrolls
whose ancient syllables hold the power of the gods. These scrolls are
rumored to be scattered throughout his kingdom for safety. Many other
paladins have tried to recover these... tried and failed.

Go forth, brave paladin! Defeat Talmouth's evil armies, free your
captured comrades, recover the ancients scrolls, and peace will once
again reign over the Kingdom of Waerna.
