   THIS IS A 1 OR 2 PLAYER GAME WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED BY A JOYSTICK IN PORT 2.
   TO MOVE A BLOCK,MOVE THE FLASHING CURSOR OVER THE BLOCK AND THE PRESS AND
   HOLD DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON.YOU CAN NOW MOVE THE BLOCK BY PUSHING THE 
   JOYSTICK EITHER RIGHT OR LEFT.BLOCKS CANNOT BE MOVED UP OR DOWN BY THE
   JOYSTICK.

   THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO ILLIMINATE ALL OF THE BLOCKS FROM THE SCREEN
   WITHIN A TIME LIMIT.
   A BLOCK IS ILLIMINATED WHEN IT IS PLACED ADJACENT EITHER HORIZONTALLY OR
   VERTICALLY TO A BLOCK OF THE SAME SORT.
   A BLOCK THAT IS FALLING WILL NOT ILLIMINATE A SIMILAR BLOCK THAT IT PASSES.
   BLOCKS WILL ONLY BE ILLIMINATED WHEN ALL BLOCKS ON THE SCREEN HAVE STOPPED
   FALLING.
