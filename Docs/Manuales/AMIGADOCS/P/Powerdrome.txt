 RACE CONTROLS
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Mouse:
 ~~~~~
 Move the mouse left or right to roll your Typhoon in the corresponding
direction.
 Push the mouse forwards to pitch down (i.e dive).
 Pressing the right mouse button will open up the throttle,accelerating your
Typhoon.
 Pressing the left mouse button will open the speeed brakes and close the
throttle,thus slowing you down.
 Pressing both buttons will activate the afterburners.

 If you find the mouse control overly sensitive,you can alter various
parameters from the tuneup screen to tailor the response to your tastes.

 Joystick:
 ~~~~~~~~
 The joystick is used to control your Typhoon and you must still use the mouse
to make the various selections within the game.So keep the mouse plugged in
port 1 while playing the game.

 Move the joystick left or right to roll the Typhoon in that direction.
 Push the joystick forwards to pitch down (i.e. dive).
 Pull the joystick back to pitch up (i.e. climb).
 Press the fire button and push the joystick forwards to accelerate.
 Press the fire button and pull the joystick back to open up the speed brakes
and close the throttle.
 If you are at maximum speed,press the fire button with the joystick forwards
to cut the afterburners in.
 Centering the joystick will hold the amount of roll/pitch until you cancel it
by roll/pitching in the opposite direction.

 FLYING TIPS
 ~~~~~~~~~~~

 Piloting the Typhoon can seem to be almost impossible to a beginner,but if you
follow a few simple guidelines you should be reasonably proficient within half
an hour and breaking lap records within and hour or so.

 Use the centeringfield.At strength 9 the typhoon will almost pilot itself
around the tracks and if you also hold down the right shift key,to point down
the track,the typhoon will fly around any track without you doing a thing! As
you get better,reduce the centering field strength,which allow you to fly
faster and soon you will be able to fly around the tracks unaided.

 Ues the mouse for control.Although many people prefer joystick control,the
mouse gives a far better response time and is THE control if you want to
achieve spectacular lap time on the later tracks.
 
 Don't use the afterburners.These add around 30% extra speed and will easily
blow up your engines! so stay well clear of them until you are very proficieny.
Also use the default Economy Spec' fuel as the other two make you go much
faster.
 
 Don't fly too fast! Most beginners put their"foot to the floor"losing control
and crashing immediately.

 Aim at the centre of the track in the distance.Most beginners hug a wall and
therefore find themselves often hitting it.Sticking a marker of some sort in
the middle of the screen can be a good aid to keeping to the centre.

 If you find yourself "stuck" in the wall or the floor then press the 'A' key
and you will be repositioned in the middle of the track.

 Practise on the oval test track. The other tracks are far harder to fly around
and should be left until you can consistently lap the test traack at around 16
seconds.

 Some beginners find themselves constantly either pitching up towards the
ceiliing or down at the floor. You can reduce the pitch sensitivity with the
roll/pitch bias slider in the tune up Typhoon screen.Just move the slider all
the way to the left and you should  now be able to control the Typhoon.

 The nosecone and wings can take around 20 hits before they are damaged.Each
time you see a blue flash when colliding with a wall or floor you are
registering a hit.
effectively scraping the Typhoon along the wall.This will knock out the nose or
wing very quickly so again press the 'A' key to reposition yourself in the
middle of the track.

 Scraping the force ceiling,causing a white flash,does not damage your craft
and therefore is preferable to scraping walls.So fly high where the track is
wider and there is less risk.

 Just because the Typhoon is banked over doesn't mean that it will turn a tight
corner,in fact you can fly banked over at 90 Degrees and fly in a straight line
if you try.You will have to bank over and pull back to make fast tight corners.

 For really fast pitstops,fly down the pit lane at full speed and kill the
engines by pressing 'E' before you reach your robopit!.

 The less fuel you have the faster the Typhoon will go

 The fastest recorded lap time on track 0 is 11.86 seconds,which was achieved
by blowing the engines just after crossing the lap marker! CAN YOU DO BETTER?.



 TUNE UP TYPHOON
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Aerofoil Sensitivity:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 You have three different sizes of aerofoil wich you can step though and select
using this button.Corresponding to each selection a graphical representation of
the different aerofoils will be shown on the cut away wing section to the right
of the button.
A small aerofoil requires more Yoke movement than a larger aerofoil to acheive
the same resulting pitch,roll or yaw.This means that with a small aerofoil you
can achieve finer control over your racer,whereas a large aerofoil allows you
to make very rapid direction changes,usefull on the very twisty tracks.

 Spreed Brakes:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 There are three different sizes of speed brake available,with each increasing
size giving greater braking effect.Each press of the Speed brake button will
step through the three options,and a graphical representation of the different
brakes will be shown on the cut-away wing section to the right of the button.
 The smallest brake allows delicate control of your racer's speed,whereas the
largest will stop the racer in just a few metres.Use the prectice sessions on
each track to discover which brake suits them.The race is the wrong time to
discover that your brakes are too weak,and find yourself ploughing full speed
into a corner,engines glowing white hot from the afterburners.

 Roll/Pitch Bias:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Press the button to the left of the slider to increase the bias away from
pitch and towards roll and press the right button to move the bias towards
pitch and away from roll.
 This control effects how much yoke is required to give the desired amount of
pitch or roll.If the slider is over to the left hand side of the display(a roll
bias) then small movements of the yoke side to side will result in large
amounts or roll,whereas large forward and back movements will only give small
amounts of pitch.
 Use pitch/roll bias in conjunction with the Aerofoil sensitivity control to
tailor the handling response to your taste.

 Fuel Select:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 There are three different types of fuel available:
A)Nitra-Mono Premium, B)Mono Standard and C)Economy Special. Use the Next/Last
fuel select buttons to step forward/backwards through the available fuel types
and make your selection.
 Nitra-Mono Premium gives far more thrust than Economy Special but,as you
rarely get something for nothing,the Nitra fuel burns up very rapidly,
especially with afterburnerss blazing.Therefor frequent trips to the robopit
will be required!.

 Filter Select:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 There are five different engine filters available:
A)Ammonia B)Sulphur C)Oxygen D)Methane and E)Particle. Use Next/Last to select.
 These filters are large covers which fit over your Typhoons engine intake and
protect against the effects of differing planetary atmospheres.Fitting the
correct filter will allow your engine to operate at full efficiency under the
corrosponding atmospheric conditions.Fitting the wrong filter can lead to
disaster,with reduced power,engine overheating and even the possibility of
completely wrecking an engine.
 To futher complicate matters,conditions can change during a race.A storm
brewing up will necessitate a quick visit to the robopits and a change to the
particle filter.But dont foget to change back when the storm has passed.



 ROBOPITS:
 ~~~~~~~~
 Refuelling:
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 Upon entering the robopit the refuelling pod will open,and if your Typhoon is
not fully fuelled up the refuelling pipes extend,attach themselves to your
racer.You can monitor the process with the fuel guage,situated by the status
screen.
 If you feel you have choosen the wrong type of fuel for the race,or this is
part of your stratagy,you can change the grade of fuel in use.Select Tune-Up
mode from Robopits 'O' and then select the new fuel type as outlined under the
fuel select.When your done click on ok to return to Robopits.

 Info About Typhoon:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 When an engine's temperature guage goes red,a warning sounds and you should
kill the afterburners immediately! If you dont then an engine will burn out.If
you lose the other engine your only hope of getting back to the pits is to call
for a Rescue Craft 'B' If it acknowleges your request it may take some time to
get to your position,so be patient.If your request was denied you will have to
quit(and ditch)that race.

 Proximity Warning:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The closer you are to the walls,roof or floor,the faster this warning light
will blink.You can also engage an audible warning,which will bleep in time with
the light.

 Engine Temperature:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 These two guages show how hot each of your engines are.If the bar charts are
green then the engines are within their normal operating parameters,but once a
bar moves into the red you may be damaging an engine and an audible warning
sound will sound.Once a bar goes off the top of the red section that engine
will burn out and will be useless.Keep a careful eye on these guages while
using the afterburners,as engine temperatures rise rapidly when they are lit.

 Systems Status:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The red light should move smoothly back and forth in this display,indicating
that all systems are fully operational.If the lights movement becomes irregular
then a system is either damaged or failing,though its up to you to trace the
fault.
