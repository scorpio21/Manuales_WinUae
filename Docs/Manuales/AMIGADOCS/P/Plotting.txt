Scenario
--------

it all seems so easy, but you can beat the micro or your partner, at
this hideosly mind boggling game.

Special blocks will give you extra lives.... GREAT...but believe me, you'll 
need to take advantage of this software's hardware! Plot your move, take 
aim and block'em out!... It's that simple. as simple as grilling ice cubes!

Controls
--------

Usual josystick option for moving the player UP and DOWN. 
Press fire button to throw your block. Escape key will bring you back to
the menu during a game.


Gameplay
--------

The object of the game is to reduce the number of blocks on screen to less 
than a target number within a preset time limit. This target number starts 
at nine, and will decrease as you progress through the different levels.
A block can be eliminated by hitting it with the same type of block,either 
from the front or from above. When you eliminate a block, the next block in 
the same direction will be thrown out. If you hit a line of the same type
of block,then all those blocks will be eliminated.
When the game starts,you will have a 'zapper' block. This allow you to 
eliminate any type of block.

 How to eliminate blocks
 -----------------------

 (a) To eliminate a block you must hit it with the same type of block from
     the side or from above.

 (b) the block you will be eliminated, and the block you have thrown will
     replace the next block in the row, wich be thrown back to you.

 (c) if there is a gap below a block, then gravity will put the block down 
     into the hole

 (d) if you hit a line of the same type of blocks, then all those blocks
     will be elimated

 (e) if you throw a block and miss, or hit a different type, then the block
     you have thrown will be returned

 (f) if there are no blocks to hit of the same type that you are throwing 
     then you will lose one life, and you will be given a 'zapper' block

 (g) In some of the stages you will find the 'zapper' block in between the 
     normal bloks. If you hit it, then you gain an extra life.

 (h) A block can only pass through a pipe from the top. It acts as a wall 
     if it is from the side, and deflect the moving block down.
