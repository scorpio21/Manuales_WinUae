                            Welcome, Athletes!

Upon this day of great joy, celebration, and meaning, this glorious Day of
Purple Dawning, the launching of a new year on Saturn, the Supreme Gem of
the Sky, we native Saturians bid to you alien athletes who desire to
participate in and of course perhaps win the events created to honor our
great being Exxos for giving us this new day, new year, new victor -
welcome!

The day's events will be held in whatever order the athletes want.  The
winners of each round of events will go on competing in a sort of ladder of
winners until there is one single victorious and gloriously delirious
champion who will be rewarded by our Queen - the Queen of Saturn - then and
there.

What follows is a rendition of the Grand Purple Saturn Day Ceremony Speech,
given with the Benediction of Exxos Himself, in Person, and orated by the
Purple Saturn Day Prezident before the commencement of events:

                   Oh Exxos!  You are Good for Us!

Oh Exxos, it is once more the new year on Saturn, the Day of Purple
Dawning, Wonder of Wonders. Ata Ata!

Gaze, great Exxos, upon the Humans from the Blue planet, the Bulul from the
Asterox constellation, and the Golgos all the way from marvelous Klakos. 
Look, oh Exxos, upon the proud Croolis warriors from ancient Mastochok and
the humble, homeless Shaaxa refugees.  Finally, smile fondly upon your
friends the Kumo from Corpo WW!  All have come for You, oh Exxos, and for
the Pangalactic games we hold each and every Purple Saturn Day.

This year, four superb competitions have been randomly selectorized by
Exxos Himself: The Ring Pursuit, The Time Jump, The Tronic Slider, and The
Brain Bowler.  These will be explained to you when you most need to know
about them.

Dear friends, competitors, loved ones, others, and those of you who come to
benefit by placing bets, let us with one voice heap thanks on Exxos!

Hanz Merlok is a Human scientist born on Earth circa A.D. 1950.  He is
currently in vegetized survival status in Switzerland.  (Visitors are
welcome to discuss interesting topics with one of the several thousand
Merlok clones at the Saturn Institute in N.N.N.Y City, Mars.)

A renowned intergalactic alternative medicine expert, H. Merlok left an
indelible mark on Space Conquest Phaze 2, also known as the "Great Second
Phaze of Interstellar Conquest."  Political shadowboxer, pizza playmate,
crooner, inventor of note and notorious cocktail-set Cazanova, Hanz Merlok,
is also uncle to General Robert "Snarling Bob" Merlok, better-known as
Blood, first husband to Torka Blood.

                            All your ideas gone?
                         Has your brain turned to sticky
                        garbage?  Chances are you've been
                          smoking too many Tromp tails!
                            Why not think of Exxos?
                             Exxos is good for you!

                              Prayons Discovered!

Thanks to the new gigantoscope Luna 45, a new prayer particle known as a
"Prayon" has been detected in the universe.  This discovery should
guarantee that Lunatox Inc. will become Saturn's new leading prayer
accessory manufacturer.

The following radio prayer (as yet untreated by Exxos prayer experts) was
captured by Luna 45 and probably originates from the Cigar galaxy. 
Preliminary studies indicate that a triple repetition of this prayer just
before major competition will slow opponents down by a factor of .3.

                                WHY

Purple Saturn Day games are held on the first day of every Saturn new year.
(In competitor's terms, that's every 29.46 Earth years, .3 Klakonian years,
every day on Mastochok, and less time for the Corpo WWians than it takes
them to suit up).

Eight forms of physically mobile life are invited to contend in the games. 
Competitors divide into four pairs.  The two individuals of each pair
compete against one another in four competitions.  The winners of these
quarter-finals go on to the semi-finals, and the winners of those go on to
the final.  The outright winner receives a swift face lock-on and leg
entwinement from the Queen of Saturn - a prize highly valued by all life
forms for its universally euphorious sensation.

                          FROM THE PODIUM

From the podium (the first game screen) you can see the symbolic plaques
for each of the four events.  If an event has been played, its window also
shows the latest scores, with your score at the top and your opponent's
score below.

                        A Practical Recipe

The great sporting encounters that make up Purple Saturn Day leave our
bodies and minds so drained, don't they!  Well, why not try the following
easy recipes from Doctor Hanz Merlok's acclaimed blockbusting bestseller My
Alternative Medical Inside Secrets From Across the Ages, published in the
hard-hitting series "I Can Feel Exxos Doing Me Good."

                        The Pain Transmuter

This fun recipe is guaranteed to solve all your stomach scale Pruritus
problems!  Millions of fighter pilots have known this itchy horror, caused
by laser-fire "dribble."

Here's what you do:  Grab a big juicy Putrex Vomicus quince, preferably from
a Turpos 17 recycling pharmacy.  Place it gently in your closet.  After a
few days, the quince will be covered with Writhing Yuks.  They love fruit! 
Put one of the Yuks in a little metal box with lots of air holes, so that
breathing remains a viable primary life-support option.  (After all, even
Writhing Yuks hate not being alive any more!)  As soon as your scales start
itching like crazy, remove the Yuk from his box and slip the wriggly fellow
in-between two inflamed scales.  You'll be delighted with the results!

TRAINING	If you need to train before the competition begins (after
ALLOWANCE 	all, it's been almost 30 years since you last worked out),
		move the cursor to one of the event windows and select it.
		Training will begin in that event with a robot acting as
		your opponent.

THE REAL THING  To begin competition, select the triangle at the bottom of
		the screen.  The competition lineup appears, showing all
		eight competitors.  Starting from the left, each set of two
		competitors is grouped into a competing pair.  Each
		contender's cumulative score appears beneath his picture.

		You (the Human) and your opponent are privileged to open
		the competition.  To do that, select an event window.  You
		are free to play the events in any order.

BOWING OUT	If you don't want to compete, select the X at the bottom
		of the screen.  The other contenders will compete (without
		you) to finish and the ultimate winner will receive the
		victory prize from the Queen.  To continue, press the left
		mouse button, Spacebar, or the fire button.

                            Ointmentus Meteoris

Goodby bumps and bruises!  Here's how to make a soothing cream to chase
those meteor-shower blues:

Choose a plumb Style-Conscious Glook (a variable unit of measurement
formerly employed on rubber plantations).  With a carefully selected Exxos
feather, make an incision in the throat of a prepared Migrax (prepare him
by buying him large quantities of gin in a low-life joint).  Use the
feather to spread a few drops of green Migrax blood over the Glook.

Next, soak the Glook in used engine oil.  Bring to a boil.  Pour into a
bowl containing large numbers of Writhing Yuks.  Rub the resulting ointment
over your entire body.  Now, meteors, come make my day!

Important: This cream is ineffective in the case of incandescent meteors.

                           RING PURSUIT  

                          Mastering Space

In the Ring Pursuit you fly in Saturn's brightest ring (called the B ring on
Earth and the Bathtub ring on Mastochok).  This competition is a duel in
which time doesn't count.  To win, you must score higher points than your
competitor.  Space buoys mark the route.

Scoring

You score points when you're in the lead, and when you pass the markers
correctly while in the lead.  You increase your opponent's score by passing
on the wrong side of the buoys when you're in the lead. You get no penalty
for passing on the wrong side if you're behind (although you should!).

Tips

Push your opponent to get him out of the way.

Move into the inside curve to catch up to your opponent.

                Rituals Forbidden During the Ring Pursuit 

1.  Hostile gestures, words, subliminal messages, or any form of negative
    sentiment transfer.

2.  Mumbo-jumbo antics of any kind.

3.  Radio chants based on Prayon technology.

4.  The wearing of dark spectacles.

                           TRONIC SLIDER

                          Mastering Energy

This is a grab game!  To win, you must capture more energy fragments than
your opponent as you pilot a slider about an orbiting squared ring.  To
compete, fire at the energy ball that's flying around!  A direct hit
fragments the ball.  The energy fragments are now yours to take, so fly
your slider over them to pick them up.  (Don't forget that your opponent is
also grabbing fragments!)  As soon as you pick up all the fragments, the
energy ball reforms and you start again.

This is a timed event!  You compete until the clock reaches 5:00.

Tips

Push your opponent to make him drop fragments.  Cut away into 90-degree
turns to gain time and pick up more fragments.

Turn 180 degrees when up against the end of the platform to quickly get
away.  Stay away from the bumpers on the platform - they turn you into a
pinball.

                           BRAIN BOWLER

                      Mastering Mental Waves

Brain Bowler is a revolutionary cutting-edge technology way to control
someone's mind!  You and your competitor face a brain wall.  The two sides
of the brain are your territories - yours on the right and his on the left.
Your goal is to activate your side of the brain while deadening his.

Hurl your electro-ball to strike your targets and guide the electrical
charges towards your pins.  In the meantime, your opponent is doing all he
can to steal energy from your condensors, deactivate your chips, open and
close switches to block your progress, and other dastardly deeds.  Of
course you can (and should) do the same to him!


 |------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 |   Moves             Mouse              Keyboard           Joystick     |
 |                                                                        |
 | Move electro-ball  Roll in any      Press Arrow keys.    Move handle.  |

 | Hurl electro-ball  Press left       Press Spacebar.      Press fire    |
 |                    button.                               button.       |
 |------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Hit a Switch to open or close it and either release or block an electric
charge.  Condensors are temporarily charged up when electric charges pass
through them.  When a condensor is charged up, hit it to power up your
electro-ball.  Then hurl the energized electro-ball at a Chip.  When you
make contact, the chip lights up.  Pass an electric charge over the lighted
chip and the chip becomes permanently activated.  Hit charges blocked at
one end of a Gate to push them through it.  Resistors slow the charges
down, Accelerators speed them up.  Short circuits restart the charges from
the beginning.

Scoring

Light up the six pins connecting your side to the center of the brain
before your opponent can light up all his pins, and you win!  Your score is
shown at bottom right and your opponent's score at bottom left.  The clock
is in the middle, between the two scores.

Tips

When your opponent's condensors light up, steal his energy!  Open and close
his switches to keep his charges from traveling towards the pins.  Hurl
your electro-ball into his to deflect his aim.

                             Ask Him

Here's a wonderfully soothing mind-massage technique called "Ask Him."  Him
knows everything.  With Him, everything becomes clear; why we're here, what
happens afterwards, the truth about flying saucers, and so forth.

First, stop reading.  Now count to 100 in a loud, clear, positive voice:
One... two... three... four ... You should be ready now, your mind empty of
all material desires and intruding thought modules.  Breathe.  Kill those
lights.

Now I'm going to count to three.  When I say "three," you stare relaxedly
at that nice picture on the center pages of this book.  Concentrate real
hard on the nice picture.  Ready?  Here I go:  One... two... two and
thirteen seventeenths ... three.  Stare!

There!  I told you it would work!  Now you feel happy, in control of your
corporeal body.  Your astral eyes keep reading as your physical eyes stare
at the magic picture.  You feel so wonderful now. The doors of your inner
mind open to receive the thrilling secret:

                           I am Him!

You come to with a start.  Sweat spurts from many of your pores.  You
breathe in a manner known to doctors as "hmmmmmmm."  And yet you are
convinced nothing has happened.  Or has it?  

Don't ask me.  Ask Him!

                         Time                  Speed

First, wind up the catapult.  (You can slow down the sparks by pressing
rapidly while winding.)  When the catapult is at rupture point, your
spaceship wobbles and shakes, then the sparks start flying.  Now fix your
sight on the sparks and grab them!  If your sight is directly on a spark
when you make the grab, a box flows out to capture it.

Repeat the winding up and spark-grabbing three times.  Then fasten your
safety-belt, wind up the catapult one more time, release - and jump.

If you captured enough sparks, your trajectory leads you past the crown of
seven suns.  Beyond them, you exceed the speed of light and enter another
dimension.  The more sparks you captured, the further you plunge through
mind-altering visions of space-time contraction, a vertiginous spectacle of
theoretical vacuum, intrinsically exprapolational!  The competitor with the
farthest jump wins!

                     A Good'Un for Intergalactic Vertigo

The sickening vacuum of deep space, we've all suffered from it, haven't we?
It's awful enough just remembering those timeless moments of intergalactic
horror when your mind wanders off into forbidden and useless metaphysical
speculations, when you can't resist the temptation to light up a Tromp
tail.

This recipe is for you: Mince together some used chewing gum, moldy sock
powder, nasal scrapings, and garlic and mix into a pound of ground computer
disks.  Add bat droppings, chili powder, and a zest of concentrated body
dampness.  Knead mixture until it is an oozing yellow dough.  Divide into
reptile-sized balls, dip into thoroughly-beaten toad spawn, and fry slowly
in deep, smoking bug juice.  Serve with savory rats and decomposed
vegetable sauce.

You've forgotten all about total vacuum and space fatigue, haven't you? How
about another sickball?  Look at this one, just dying to be gobbled up! 
It's winking at you!

                              THE CONTENDERS

                          Evolution and Prowess

As the competitions are held each Saturn year, each competition being a
consecutive progression from the year before, the various individual
competitors change at the same time as their species continues to evolve. 
As a result (and taking one species as an example), the Golgos on the first
Purple Saturn Day won't have the same characteristics as any other Golgos
on any other day.

Note: Competitors' evolution and performances are recorded on disk, so do
not write-protect your disk!

Select the triangle at the bottom of the podium screen to see the lineup of
competitors.  Then select a life form in the lineup to consult his species'
I.D. file.  When his file appears, you'll see his picture on the left. 
Next to it is a list of characteristics and the rating this particular
permutation of the species holds for that quality:

1.  Agility

2.  Mental Fluid

3.  Aggression

4.  Temporal Flux

5.  Size

6.  Eyesight

On the right you'll see the contestant's name and his top scores and
percentages in each competition.

Select another contender in the lineup to see his file.  When you've seen
all you want, select the triangle at top center to close the file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               BIOZ

NOVTEK-STZR

Novtek-Stzr means Prism-Head in the Human speech.  This contender is very
hard-headed, but he lives so close by that he simply steps away from the
office to contend.  (Notice his corporate dress.  Such a harmone-loaded
dude often wins and gets his victory prize.  Bet he goes back to the office
with a big smile on his crystal.)

SHAAXA

The Shaaxa used to have a planet but their owner moved and dropped them off
on a side galaxy on his way out of town.  When not competing, Shaaxa make
great pals.  They're quite friendly, like to have their ears scratched, and
can be counted on to tread newcomers to a warm, if somewhat unusual,
greeting.

GOLGOS

Early on in history, a forebear of the Golgos race stepped on a nail and
didn't go to the doctor.  Lockjaw set in, and was passed on to the rest of
the species.  Golgos have never been know to speak, or even smile, although
they can whine in a mystical, menacing soprano.

				12

KUMO

Kumos leave most of their bodies on their home planet, Corpo WW, when they
come to the Purple Saturn Day games.  They regard the games as mental
endeavors, steer with their trunks, and wear gigantic earrings to keep
their center of gravity.  Bodies, to the Kumo way of thinking, are for
work, not pleasure.  Therefore, when a Kumo wins, his body doesn't get in
the way of the thrill of victory.

HUMAN

Humans communicate with gutteral, nasal speech.  Quite astonishing, since
the nose is the least prominent organ, especially compared to some of the
other combatants.  Another unusual feature of this species is something the
Humans call "hair", a matting-like material on their heads.  Speculation
has it that the purpose of "hair" is to get a nice tight fit for the space
helmet.  Perhaps you other species might look into this!

SWIL

Contrary to what some of you think at first glance, Swil is among the
friendliest, most agreeable of all contestants.  Swil hails from the rare
planet Swol, which orbits with a long, undulating motion.  Two Swill, or
even three Swill, will often accompany their participant.  At the previous
Purple Saturn Day, half a dozen or more Swilllll came along to cheer on
their favorite.

BULUL

Bulul hail from the only planetoid known that is 100 percent water.  When
not participating in or training for the strenuous events of Purple Saturn
Day, Bulul stay busy with their inventions. Among the better-known Bulul
contributions to intergalactic civilization are the Buoy-O-Bed and tankless
goldfish.

CROOLIS

The Croolis have a long history of warfare.  Starting with the same simian
ancestors as Earth's Humans, the Croolis evolved into fighting machines. 
From eons of holding automatic weapons, these warriors eventually ended up
being born with armor and machine guns growing from their bodies. Croolis
never show mercy, but you can get them to negotiate for a bag of peanuts
and a banana.
