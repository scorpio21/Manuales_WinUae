 season, this time in more locations and more popular then ever before.

 A game for one or two players, Pitfighter is a battle to the death in an
 attempt to become the new Pitfighting world champion. You have the choice
 of being one of three fighters :

 his special moves are the Combo Punch, the Flip Kick and the Backhand.
 
 BUZZ - Ex pro Wrestler. His greatest assit is power, whilst his special
 moves are the body slam, the head butt and the piledriver.

 You can select your chosen fighter from the title screen in the game. In
 a two player game you may, if you wish, select the same tow fighters.

 Your task is to defeat each of the seven different fighters who stand 
 between you and the final duel, the Championship Match, against the
 Ultimate Warrior. Every third match you face is a grudge match, where
 in two player mode you will fight the second human player, in one player
 mode you must face a computer controlled clone of yourself.
 
 Bonus points are awarded at the ed of each round for Knock Outs. A KO
 is awarded to the player who delivers the final blow to the opponent.

 Along the way you will find various different objects strewn around the
 floor of the `pit' which you may pick up and use against you opponent:- 
 you can even try pciking up and throwing your opponents.

 Objects you will find in the `pit' are:
 
 THROWING STARS / CRATES / KEGS AND BARRELS
 
 - Stand a distance from your opponent ans use the "punch" move to throw
 the weapon, they can be used only once, unless they miss their intended
 receiver, in which case they will fall to the floor to bbe used again.

 STICKS - Use the "punch" move to crack the stick against your opponent.
 The stick will break after a few hits.

 On 16-bit versions there are also Motorbikes on the later levels which can
 be hurled at your fellow fighters.

 Inside some of the barrels you will find power pills. When you see one
 of these fall out grab it immediately. The lucky owner of the power
 pill will have, for a limited time only, extra powers which double the
 power of their blows and halve the power of their opponents blows.

 At the end of each round you will be awarded bonus points according to
 how you performed in that round. The bonus are a FIGHT PURSE, a standard
 amounst awarded for each round, a KO BONUS, for how many KO`s you achieved
