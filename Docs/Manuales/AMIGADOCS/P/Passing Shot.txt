                           HOW TO PLAY PASSING SHOT
                           ~~~ ~~ ~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~
          Press FIRE (or keyboard equivalent) to start.  If you
          wish to play double, then FIRE must be pressed on
          both sets of controlls.  Input your intials by moving the
          marker across the letterpad, then select the difficulty
          level - higer levels start you further into the world 
          stages and put you up against tougher opposition.
            
          PASSING SHOT lets you play the deciding set in a
          three set match.  If you play doubles then the two 
          players are on the same side, against computer 
          controlled doubles pairs.  The tramlines are included 
          in-bounds when playing doubles.
  
          The view of the court in PASSING SHOT is
          represented from spectator level for service, then
          switches to top-down perspective for rallies - this
          allows the best view and control over the action.
 
          There are four types of stroke in PASSING SHOT
          Flat, Slice, Topspin and Lob.
 
          Serve the bally by selecting your shot as the ball flashes.
          The display will then alter to the top-down view.  The
          joystick will control the movement of your player, but
          when the joystick fire button is pressed the different
          directions control the shot type.
 
          PASSING SHOT follows the normal rules of tennis
          and incorporates all the usual features: - double-faults,
          body touches, direct returns, aces, service aces etc.
          You are required to reach six games to win the set, as
          per the rules of tennis.  If you manage to win the match,
          the next round will take place at another location
          in the world.

                            JOYSTICK CONTROLLING

          intials.

          fire button is pressed the joystick directions control the stroke:

          With FIRE pressed:
          
          FORWARD = FLAT
          LEFT    = SLICE

          for the type of stroke when the ball flashes:
       
          P = PAUSE
