POSTMAN PAT NOW COMES TO YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN IN THIS HIGHLY ENTERTAINING
AND COLOURFUL ARCADE GAME. THE GAME HAS AN EASY VERSION SUITABLE FOR YOUNGER
CHILDREN AND A HARDER VERSION; AS WELL AS POSTMAN PAT SNAP, LUDO AND
SNAKES AND LADDERS.

IT SEEMED JUST LIKE ANOTHER DAY TO PAT AS HE CLIMBED OUT OF BED.
LITTLE DID HE KNOW THAT HE WOULD BE RUSHED OFF HIS FEET BY ALL THE WORK THAT
FACED HIM THIS MORNING AS HE DID HIS ROUND OF GREENDALE PARCELS, LETTERS
AND ALL SORTS OF ODD JOBS WOULD KEEP HIM VERY BUSY. YOU CAN HELP PAT AND
JESS TO GET THE JOB DONE BY GUIDING HIS VAN AROUND THE VILLIAGE.

YOU START THE GAME BY FINDING THE POST OFFICE WHERE MRS.GOGGINS WILL TELL
PAT WHAT HE MUST DELIVER. IT WILL BE A NUMBER OF LETTERS OR A PARCEL FOR
ONE OF PATS FRIENDS. YOU CAN DRIVE AROUND THE VILLIAGE(AND CAN REVERSE IF
YOU NEED TO TURN ROUND) IN ORDER TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS HOUSE AND DELIVER
THE PARCEL. (IF YOU RETURN TO THE VAN AND YOU THEN WISH TO GO BACK TO A
HOUSE YOU MUST LEAVE THE SCREEN THEN RE-ENTER IT.)
LETTERS ARE DELIVERED TO THE HOUSES WHICH FLASH AS YOU PASS THEM. TO
DELIVER A LETTER PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON AS YOU PASS THE HOUSE. IF YOU MISS
YOU HAVE TO GET PAT OUT OF THE VAN USING THE FIRE BUTTON AND GUIDE HIM
TO PICK UP THE LETTER AND TRY AGAIN.
IF PETER FOGGS SHEEP GET LOOSE YOU CAN HELP HIM BY HEARDING THE SHEEP BACK
THROUGH THE GATE(YOU MUST FIND THEM YOURSELF).
WATCH OUT FOR OIL SLICKS ON THE ROAD AND MISS HUBBARD ON HER WOBBLY BIKE.

BECAUSE PAT IS SUCH A BUSY CHAP YOU HAVE ONLY GOT A SHORT TIME TO 
COMPLETE ALL YOUR TASKS. IF YOU RUN OUT OF TIME THE GAME IS OVER.


SNAKES AND LADDERS (1-4 PLAYERS)

THE AIM OF SNAKES AND LADDERS IS TO GET YOUR COUNTER FROM SQUARE 1 (AT
THE BOTTOM) TO SQUARE 60(AT THE TOP). SHOULD YOUR COUNTER LAND AT THE 
BOTTOM OF A LADDER, YOU WILL BE MOVED TO THE TOP OF IT. HOWEVER IF
YOU SHOULD LAND AT THE TOP A SNAKE THEN YOU WILL SLIDE DOWN ITS TAIL.
IF YOU SHOULD BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO ROLL A SIX YOU ARE GIVEN ANOTHER ROLL
OF THE DICE. TO WIN YOU MUST LAND EXACTLY ON SQUARE 60.


LUDO (1-4 PLAYERS)

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO TAKE ALL OF THE COUNTERS OUT OF YOUR BASE
THEN AROUND THE BOARD AND GET THEM HOME TO WIN. IN ORDER TO TAKE A COUNTER
OUT OF YOUR BASE YOU FIRST MUST ROLL A SIX. AS IN SNAKES AND LADDERS YOU
MUST ROLL AN EXACT NUMBER TO COMPLETE THE GAME.


SNAP (1 PLAYER)

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO MATCH THE TOP HALF AND THE BOTTOM HALF OF
THE DISPLAYED CHARACTER CORRECTLY. WHEN THE PLAYER PRESS'S FIRE WITH
PAT(THE CURSOR ICON) OVER THE GO BUTTON THE REEL STARTS SPINNING.
THE BOTTOM WILL STOP AFTER A WHILE. THEN THE PLAYER MUST PRESS FIRE
WITH PAT OVER THE STOP BUTTON. IF THE BOTTOM AND THE TOP MATCH THEN HE
WINS A POINT. PLAYING 99 TIMES OR SELECTING END RETURNS TO THE
TITLE SCREEN. PLAY AGAINST A FRIEND AND SEE WHO CAN SCORE THE MOST.
