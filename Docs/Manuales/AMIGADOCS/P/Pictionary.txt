MEMBER OF EACH TEAM (THE PICTURIST) DRAWS THE PICTURE FOR HIS/HER TEAM 
MATES TO IDENTIFY.THERE MUST BE AT LEAST 2 PLAYERS ON EACH TEAM TO PLAY
THIS WAY AND THE PLAYERS MUST TAKE TURNS TO BE PICTURIST.
THE PICTURIST MUST LOOK AT HIS/HER WORDCARD TO FIND THE WORD FOR A PARTIC-
ULAR TOPIC FROM THE GRID REFERENCE (CELL) SUPPLIED BY THE COMPUTER.FOR
EXAMPLE,THE WORD UNDER OBJECT REFERENCE G3 IS PROPELLER.
WHILE THE WORD IS BEING DRAWN PLAYERS ON THE PICTURIST TEAM MAY INTERRUPT
THE DRAWING TO GUESS THE WORD FOR A TIME BONUS.THE WORD MUST BE GUESSED
CORRECTLY IN THE TIME ALLOWED OR PLAY MOVES TO THE NEXT TEAM.
IF A WORD IS GUESSED CORRECTLY,THE DIE WILL BE ROLLED AND THAT TEAMS
COUNTER IS ADVANCED ROUND THE BOARD.THEY THEN TAKE ANOTHER TURN TO GUESS A
NEW WORD.HOW PRECISE AN ANSWER IS MUST BE DECIDED BY THE PLAYERS AT THE
START OF A GAME.YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TYPE IN THE ANSWERS AS THE COMPUTER WILL
ASK IF YOU GOT IT RIGHT,ALLOWING YOU TO USE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT!. (BUT NO
CHEATING!).
