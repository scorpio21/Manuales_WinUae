      THE DOX TO [-PEGASUS-] WERE TYPED FOR <SKID ROW> BY SCOOTER

THANX GOTO TO ANNIHILATOR AND KE**** FOR SUPPLYING THE DOX FOR ME TO TYPE IN.

PLAYING PEGASUS;

WHEN YOU PLAY PEGASUS,YOU WILL TAKE PART IN 2 VERY DIFFERENT GAME STYLES. ONE
ON PEGASUS,THE FLYING HORSE. THE SECOND WITH PERSEUS ON FOOT. THEY BOTH PLAY
DIFFERENTLY, AND DIFFERENT TACTICS WILL BE NEEDED TO COMPLETE EACH. THERE ARE 5
WORLDS IN TOTAL AND ON EACH THERE ARE 5  RUNNING SECTIONS PLUS 5 FLYING
SECTIONS, MAKING A TOTAL OF 50 LEVELS!!

THE 5 WORLDS ARE -SWAMP-ICE-DESERT- WAR AND FINALLY HELL. AT THE END OF THE
TENTH SECTION OF EACH WORLD YOU WILL BE FORCED TO ENCOUNTER THE END OF LEVEL
GUARDIAN. WHICH WILL REQUIRE SOME SUBSTANTIIAL BATTLING TO DEFEAT. SAVE UP AS
MANY PULSE WEAPONS AS YOU CAN FOR THESE,AS THEY WILL BE DIFFICULT TO DEFEAT.

PASSWORD;

ONCE YOU HAVE COMPLETED 10 LEVELS AND DEFEATED THE END OF LEVEL GUARDIAN,YOU
WILL BE GIVEN A PASSWORD THAT WILL SERVE FOR THE NEXT LEVEL WHENEVER YOU PLAY
AGAIN. THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER A PASSWORD OCCURS AT THE START OF THE GAME.

STRENGTH:

THE STRENGTH OF YOUR CURRENT CHARACTER IS INDICATED BY THE SWORD AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE PLAYINF SCREEN. AS THE WHITE OF THE SWORD IS REPLACED BY MORE AND MORE
BLACK. YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOUR CURRENT CHARACTER IS ABOUT TO LOSE A LIFE AND
DIE. ONB THE RUNNING SECTIONS,COLLECTING CRYSTALS WILL ALLOW YOU TO RESTORE
FULL HEALTH.

CRYSTALS;

WHEN YOU PLAY, SOME CRYSTALS WILL BE FOUND,SOME WAITING TO BE COLLECTED,OTHERS
ONLY APPEARING AFTER ENEMIES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. THEY CAN BE USED IN DIFFERENT
WAYS, DEPENDING UPON WHERE YHEY ARE COLLECTED. IN THE BOTTOM LEFT HAND CORNER
OF THE PLAYING SCREEN IS AN ICON, WHICH WILL BE A CRYSTAL WHEN YOU START TO
PLAY, WITH A FIGURE TO THE RIGHT OF IT. THIS FIGURE REPRESENTS HOW MANY
CRYSTALS YOU HAVE. THE ICON WILL CHANGE PERIODICALLY, TO INDICATE THE WEAPONARY
OR AID AVAILABLE TO YOU, WHICH WILL BE DEPENDANT UOPN HOW MANY CRYSTALS YOU
HAVE COLLECTED.

THE FLYING SECTIONS;

CRYSTALS ARE USED IN THE FLYING SECTIONS TO INCREASE THE POWER OF YOUR
WEAPONARY. EACH TIME YOU COLLECT ENOUGH CRYSTALS, YOU WILL BE GIVEN THE CHANCE
TO ALTER YOUR WEAPONS FOR BIGGER MORE POWERFUL ONES. THE NUMBER OF CRYSTALS
WILL VARY,DEPENDING UPON WHICH LEVEL YOU ARE ON, AND WHAT THE NEXT WEAPON IS.
THE WEAPONS ARE AS FOILLOWS;

1. STANDARD FIRE; no crystals needed, this is the weapon that you will begin
with. it is a rapidly repeating ball of energy that will destroy most of the
smaller ene,mies you come across,but will need several impacts on bigger
enemies.

2. DOUBLE BEAM; 2 beams will now fire, spreading out before re-converging and
spreading again in a wave. this allows you to either hit 2 enemies at once,or
with careful timing to hit a single enemy with 2 bolts of energy.

3. TRIPLE DAGGER; 3 daggers will be thrown. 1 straight forward, 2 others going
off in diagonal directions.

4. PULSE ARC; this weapon will only fire forward,but will destroy most enemies
with just a single hit. a very powerful weapon. when an enemy is hit the arc
will continue to travel off the screen,hitting any others in its path.

5. HORIZONTAL DAGGERS; 3 daggers will again appear, but instead of 2 going
diagonally, they will 1st spread out, and then the 3 will zoom forward in
parallel at a tremonous speed. again this can be a very powerful weapon.

6. BACK AND FRONT FIRE; this will allow you to defend pegasus from the enemies
that sometimes appear at the back of you. weapons will be launched that will go
forward, but will also spin around and fly behind you to protect you.

7. ALL DIRECTIONAL FIRE; this one will fire its bolts in a direction that will
depend upon the position of pegasus on the playing screen. it can be utilised
with very accurate effect with some practise.

8. EAGLE OUTRIDERS; these outriders allow you to destroy just about anything
that is thrown at you. they are stunningly powerful,but be warned, they have a
limited life span. if you manage to collect enough crystals whilst you have
outriders, you can still upgrade your own weapons without effecting the
outriders.

9. EXTRA LIFE; 40 crystals are needed to gain an extra life.and the crystal
zero will reset to zero.

PULSE WAVE WEAPONS;

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE WEAPONS THERE ARE ALSO PULSE BEAMS WHICH CAN BE
COLLECTED. THESE ARE UTILISED BY HOLDING THE FIRE BUTTON DOWN,AND WILL DESTROY
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ON THE SCREEN. THE NUMBER OF PULSE WAVES THAT YOU HAVE IS
INICATED TO THE RIGHT OF THE CRYSTAL INDICATOR BY AN ICON WHICH LOOKS LIKE A
`STRONG ARM`. THE WHITE FIGURE TO THE RIGHT OF THIS TELLS YOU HOW MANY PULSE
WEAPONS YOU CURRENTLY HAVE STORED. THESE ARE BEST UTILISED WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT
OF ENEMIES ON SCREEN.

1. SMART BOMB; OCCASIONALLY SHOOTING AN ENEMY WILL LEAVE A MUSHROOM CLOUD
ON SCREEN. ALTHOUGH THESE CANNOT BE COLLECTED,BY MOVING OVER IT A SMART BOMB IS
ACTIVATED,WHICH WILL DESTROY EVERY ENEMY ON THE SCREEN.

2. RUNNING SECTIONS; the flying sections are interspered with running sections
which perseus must traverse without any help from pegasus. these are a little
easier than the flying sections. provided you take your time, although you may
easily lose a life by faloling over a crevasse or an edge. as in the flying
sections,killing enemies can reveal icons which when collected will provide
some assistance to you. pulse weapons are also available to you on these
sections. NOTE; on some running sections, it will seem that there is no method
of exiting a screen without sustaining damage. there will be one, but it is UP
to you to find it. some will lead you into hidden caverns, and some will take
you elsewhere.

3. KEYS; other collectable items are keys, which open some doors on the running
sections. if you have collected any keys. simply pull down on the joystick when
you are stood in front of the door, you will find yourself inside the building,
some will be packed with crystala waiting to be collected, but some will also
be inhabited by hordes of enemies. it is up to you to take a chance on
enetring.

4. CRYSTALS; collected and used as in the same way as in the flying section,
but one of the benefits you will gain in the running section is the ability to
restore strength. collect enough crystals and a red cross will appear over the
crystal icon. this is an indication that tapping the space bar at this point
will restore your strength to full.
collecting 30 crystals will also give you a special magical sword that will
launch a fireball in front of you,killing an enemy if it hits before they reach
you. these are surprisingly effective.

and thats yer lot...HI`S GOTO THE BEST UK GROUP AROUND L-S-D AND TO ANYONE WHO
KNOWS ME..(EXCEPT SOMEONE IN SHEFFEILD WHO MIGHT THINK I`V FORGOTTEN SOMEONE
REALLY IMPORTANT)
