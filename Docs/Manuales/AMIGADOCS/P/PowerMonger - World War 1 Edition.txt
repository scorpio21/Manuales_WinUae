WW1 REFERNCE CARD.
------------------

WELCOME A THE GREAT WAR.
-------------------------
OR THE GREAT WAR,AS THEY ONCE CALLED IT.AT THE TIME,IT OVERSHADOWED EVERY
OTHER CONFLICT IN THE HISTORY OF WARFARE. EUROPE HAD ENJOYED 50 OF RELATIVE
QUIET BEFORE ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE IN 1914,AND NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN THE BLOODY
RESULTS OF MECHANISED WARFARE.

WHOLE NATIONS WERE MOBILISED. RESOURCES WERE FUNNELED INTO THE WAR
EFFORT,INDUSTRY WORKED OVERTIME TO FILL ARMS QUOTAS. MACHINE GUNS,AIRPLANES AND
TANKS RUMBLED ONTO THE WORLD STAGE AND PROVED THAT SLAUGHTER WOULD NO LONGER BE
COUNTED IN THOUSANDS,BUT IN `MILLIONS`.

TO MANY,IT SEEMED A SENSELESS STRUGGLE - POWER EXERTED AND SOUGHT FOR THE SAKE
OF MORE POWER. PEOPLE SWORE THAT MEN - MODERN,RATIONAL,CIVILISED MEN -WOULD
NEVER WAGE WAR AGAIN....THEY CALLED IT THE WAR TO END ALL WARS.

but as you know, the hunger for power is never filled.

GETTING STARTED.

THE PATH TO CONQUEST.
---------------------
AFTER THE GAME LOADS,THE MAP SELECTION APPEARS.DISPLAYING THE TERRITORIES YOU
CAN CONQUER.

THERE ARE 175 TERRITORIES TO CONQUER IN THE WW1 SCENARIO. AT THE BEGINNING OF A
CONQUEST GAME,THE ONLY TERRITORY YOU CAN CONQUER IS THE ISLAND IN THE TOP LEFT
CORNER. IF YOU CAN`T IMMEDIATELY FIND THIS ISLAND,MOVE THE MOUSE POINTER AROUND
IN THAT CORNER OF THE MAP. A GREY RECTANGLE APPEARS WHEN THE POINTER IS OVER
THE AREA.

LIKE THE ORIGINAL POWERMONGER, YOU MUST BRING 2/3 OF ANY TERRITORY`S POPULATION
UNDER CONTROL TO CONQUER IT. KEEP AN EYE ON THE CONQUEST METER FOR WHEN VICTORY
IS AT HAND - THE NEEDLE WILL BE POINTING TO THE MEDAL.
AFTER YOU`VE CONQUERED A TERRITORY,YOU CAN MOVE ON TO ANY ADJACENT TERRITORY.
unlike the original powermonger,however, you must conquer all 175 territories

MISCELLANEOUS SYMBOLS

STORE:
INVENTIONS CONTAINED IN THE HOUSE:RIFLES,BIPLANE, OR TANK

NOTE: THAT BIRDS ARE NO LONGER LISTED IN THE QUERY BOX, THANKS TO MIRACLES
OF  TELEGRAPH AND RADIO, YOUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH SUBORDINATE CAPTAINS ARE
INSTANTANEOUS!. OF COURSE, SO ARE THE ENEMY`S...

THE CAPTAINS.
-------------
THE CAPTAINS STATUS BAR,SELECTION ARROW,MEDALS,AND POSTURE FUNCTION AS
DESCRIBED IN THE ORIGINAL POWERMONGER MANUAL.HOWEVER,THE CAPTAINS STRENGTH(AS
IT APPEARS WHEN YOU CLICK ON HIS MEDALS - AHH SO THATS WHAT THE ARROW WAS
POINTING AT HIS MEDALS FOR) CAN BE ANY OF THE
FOLLOWING...FIT,WELL,WEAK,INJURED,WOUNDED,DYING,DEAD.

INVENTIONS.
-----------
YOU CAN ONLY INVENT IN A VILLAGE WITH A FACTORY,FACTORIES ARE EASILY REGONISED
ON THE COSE-UP MAP. AS IN THE ORIGINAL POWERMONGER,WHAT A FACTORY PRODUCES
DEPENDS ON THE CAPTAINS POSTURE,AVAILABLE RESOURCES,THE PRESENCE OF A FACTORY
BOSS,AND THE OCCUPATIONS OF THE LOCALS.

A PASSIVE POSTURE WILL PRODUCE ONLY `RIFLES`\. THOUGH NOT HEAVY ARMS,RIFLES CAN
BE PRODUCED QUICKLY AND ISSUED TO EVERY SOLDIER UNDER YOUR COMMAND,THUS
INCREASING YOUR FIREPOWER SIGNIFICANTLY.

INVENTING IN A `NEUTRAL` POSTURE IS MORE LIKELY TO PRODUCE A `BIPLANE`. IT
TAKES MEN,FOOD,LUMBER,AND A GOOD DEAL OF TIME TO INVENT A `BIPLANE`,BUT
INVESTMENT MAY WELL BE WORTH IT. A CAPTAIN IN A BIPLANE CAN DESTROY A WHOLE
TOWN THROUGH STRAFING AND STRATEGIC BOMBING. BE CAREFUL OF ENEMIES WITH RIFLES
TAKING POTSHOTS AT YOUR PLANE - IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WELL-AIMED HITS,BUT THEY
CAN SHOOT YOU DOWN.
KEEP IN MIND THAT AIRPLANES ARE YOUR ONLY MEANS OF CROSSING WATER - THERE ARE
NO BOATS IN THE WW1 SCEANARIOS. YOU`LL NEED ONE AIRPLANE FOR EACH SOLDIER YOU
WANT TO TAKE WITH YOU.

A TANK IS THE LAST AND MOST POWERFUL MACHINE YOU CAN MAKE,AND ONLY
`AGGRESIVE`INVENTING WILL EARN YOU ONE OF THOSE. A TANK NOT ONLY SUPPLIES YOU
WITH THE HEAVIEST FIREPOWER AVAILABLE,IT GIVES YOU GREATER PROTECTION AS WELL.

EQUIPPING RIFLES,AIRPLANES AND TANKS.
-------------------------------------
RAW RECRUITS CARRY BAYONETS. ANY RIFLES YOU PICK UP ARE HANDED OUT ACCORDING TO
IMPORTANCE - CAPTAIN IS EQUIPPED FIRST,AND THEN HIS ORIGINAL FOLLOWERS,AND
FINALLY ANY OTHER TROOPS.

ONLY ONE SOLDIER CAN FLY IN YOUR AIRPLANE. YOUR CAPTAIN IS THE FIRST ONE TO
RECIEVE A PLANE,AND AGAIN,ANY ADDITIONAL PLANES HANDED OUT ACCORDING TO
IMPORTANCE. IF YOU SEND A CAPTAIN OUT ON A FLYING MISSION,HIS MEN WILL FOLLOW
BEHIND HIM AND JOIN IN THE ATTACK WHEN THEY ARRIVE. IF HE CROSSES WATER,HIS MEN
WILL WIAT BY THE SHORE UNTIL HE RETURNS. IN THIS SITUATION, YOU MAY AS WELL GO
ISSUE A `GO HOME` COMMAND,SINCE THEY ARE ONLY USING UP RATIONS WHILE DEPLOYED
IN THE FIELD.

2 PLAYER GAME - YOU CANNOT PLAY 2 PLAYER GAMES IN THE WW1 EDITION OF P`MONGER.

END..
