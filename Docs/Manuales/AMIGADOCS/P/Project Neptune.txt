RE:		YELLOW SHADOW

My tactical team and I have analyzed the situation developing in the North
	Sea.  We agree that YELLOW SHADOW's operation must be eliminated as
	quickly and quietly as possible.

The situation is unfortunately complicated by the fact that YELLOW SHADOW
	is conducting his operation on the northeast edge of Dogger Bank.
	This location is one of the most heavily trafficked fishing grounds
	in the North Sea.  In addition, the area is encumbered with natural
	gas drilling platforms.  Due to the repeated occurrence of
	potential witnesses in the area, sending a surface strike team is 
	out of the question.

The only way this operation can be performed secretly is by sending a small
	one-man submarine into the area to covertly destroy YELLOW SHADOW's
	network of bases.  The operation's code name will be PROJECT
	NEPTUNE>

I am assigning special agent Robert "Rip" Steel to this mission.  He is an
	accomplished diver who has successfully completed several
	underwater missions, most notably PROJECT PUFFERFISH (ref file
	009.3665).  He is also experienced in piloting submersibles.  Most
	importantly (due to the extreme urgency of this mission), he is
	currently unassigned.  I am confident Steel will quickly eliminate
	YELLOW SHADOW and his operation.

Steel will be dropped by parachute to his submarine tomorrow at 0745Zulu.
	I will keep you advised on his progress.

Rip -

This is a copy of the memo H. sent to SACEUR this morning.  He asked me to
slip this into your TOP SECRET folder.  The mission is entirely on your
shoulders.  Be careful!!

1. Allied intelligence reports surveillance satellite stations and are
   recording increased underwater activity in North Sea as of 0903Z 14Nov.
   Photographs by Airborne Unit show activity is undersea mining operation
   of unknown duration. Intelligence believes operation coordinated by
   known private arms dealer code name Yellow Shadow.  Past geologic
   surveys indicate area is rich with uranium deposits repeat uranium
   deposits. Consensus is that Yellow Shadow will manufacture nuclear
   stockpile for sale to unfriendly governments.

2. Mining operation consists of multiple undersea bases.  Intelligence
   suspects facilities can extract unacceptable amounts of uranium within
   thirty-six hours repeat thirty-six hours.  Consensus is that these bases
   must be destroyed.  NATO concurs but insists operation be covert to
   avoid international incident.

3. You will be airlifted to North Sea drop site 55N 3E at 0745Z 16Nov.
   From there you will travel due west by power ski to rendezvous with
   submarine HMS Remora.  Conduct commando raid to destroy bases before
   Yellow Shadow extracts sufficient uranium to fuel nuclear arsenal.

Due to the dynamic nature of your assignment, you will need
up-to-the-minute information about YELLOW SHADOW's movements and activities
in the area.  Your submarine is equipped with a SASMAP (Satellite/Aircraft
Symbolic Map) which superimposes graphic symbols of various strategic
elements on a map of your immediate surroundings.

SASMAP is compiled from a number of intelligence sources which are
invisible to you; however, you get the resultant signal.  It is fortunate
that your assignment location is in water less than 150 feet deep, so you
will not have to surface to receive telemetry.  The SASMAP signal can be
transmitted directly to you continuously by ELFR (Extremely Low Frequence
Radio) from an aerial 200kW transmitter.  This telemetry will be
transmitted on a coded channel known only to you and the radio technician
operating the transmitter.

SASMAP has been installed with some special features specific to your
assignment.  It is linked with your Automatic Pilot, such that you can
specify a point on the map and your Automatic Pilot will take you there.
Also installed is the ability to access precise information about various
items, i.e., how much longer an acoustic decoy will operate, the amount of
supplies an Allied base has, etc.

                             November 15, 1989

ANALYSIS OF YELLOW SHADOW'S OPERATION

YELLOW SHADOW is planning to extract uranium ore from the sea bottom with a
network of mining bases.  Undersea mining has always been too expensive for
commercial applications; however, the amount of money many countries will
pay for nuclear arms makes YELLOW SHADOW's operation extraordinarily cost
effective.

To get the uranium from the sea floor requires a tremendous amount of
energy, and therein lies YELLOW SHADOW's weakness.  To power his mining
network, YELLOW SHADOW has connected his bases by what appear to be power
and supply linkages.  Halfway between any two linked bases ia a node that
facilitates the transfer of power and supplies between bases.  Intelligence
advises that the cutting of all links leading to a base will effectively
destroy it.  The conclusion is obvious: destroying all nodes will result in
the destruction of all bases.

This will not be a simple task because YELLOW SHADOW has surrounded his
mining network with undersea patrols.  These patrols consist of men in
enclosed versions of your submersible's propeller driven platform.  They
make up YELLOW SHADOW's primary work force.  Three kinds of patrols have
been identified:

	Defense Patrols:	Two defenders who stay with each base to
                                protect it from attack.

	Worker Patrols:		Two or four workers who construct new bases
                                and linkages.

	Warrior Patrols:	Six warriors who aggressively seek out and
                                attack encroaching vessels.

These patrols are totally dependent upon their bases.  By extrapolation,
destroying a base should destroy all its patrols as well.

THREATS TO YOUR OPERATION

1. ATTACK BY YELLOW SHADOW PATROLS.  Patrols attack by releasing depth
   charges or contact mines.  One member of the patrol attacks while the
   others hang back to avoid taking flak from the incipient explosion.

  To counterattack:  A) Launch a UCD from your submersible.  Immediately
                     evacuate

File Pn1420C-62						Page 2 of 2

		     the area to avoid sustaining damage from the blast.

		     B) Exit the submersible in SCUBA gear and drop UCDs.

                     C) Exit the submersible and utilize the PDP to obtain
                     proximity to a patrol.  Destroy the patrol with laser
                     fire.  Watch out for kelp.

2. COLLISIONS WITH FLOATING MINES AND SUBMERGED ROCKS.  NOTE: When your
   Automatic Pilot is engaged, your submersible will avoid all obstacles.

   To protect your submersible from damage:  A) Steer around obstacles.

                                             B) Utilize your torpedoes to
                                                destroy them.

ALLIED SUPPLY BASE

By the time you reach your submersible, we will have placed a number of
unmanned Allied supply bases in the area.  When you need to restock your
ordnance (UCDs and decoys) or replenish your oxygen and fuel supplies, pull
your submersible up close to an Allied base.  It will automatically be
restored to full operating capacity.

Constant monitoring of your control room meters (oxygen, energy, UCD
status, decoy status) is essential to knowing when your submersible
requires repair and resupply.

SUMMARY OF MISSION OBJECTIVES

1. DESTROY YELLOW SHADOW'S BASES.  Destroy a base by severing all links to
   that base.  To sever a link, travel to its node (manually or on
   Automatic Pilot), then dive with your SCUBA gear to plant a UCD at the
   node.  The UCD must be planted directly in front of the node to insure
   that the link is completely severed.  A spear gun is supplied with your
   SCUBA gear for eventualities.

2. PROTECT ALLIED SUPPLY BASES FROM WARRIOR PATROLS.  REMEMBER: Refitting
   at Allied bases is the only way you can replenish your oxygen and fuel
   supplies, restock your defense systems, and sustain repairs.  Expect
   warrior patrols to attack Allied bases.

3. COMPLETE YOUR MISSION WITH THE UTMOST SPEED.  YELLOW SHADOW is like a
   plague of warts.  While you're destroying one part of his operation,
   he's constructing new base, strengthening his network with linkages, and
   continuing to mine increasing amounts of uranium ore.  You MUST move
   faster than YELLOW SHADOW.

WEAPONS AND TACTICAL HARDWARE BRIEFING
PROJECT NEPTUNE

Compiled:	15 November 1989
By:		Tactical Division Chief Allied Special Forces
To:		Special Agent Robert Steel
Authority:	Commander Allied Special Forces Europe
Archive:	PN1520-D-62
Status:		SECRET

Tomorrow morning at 0745 you will be dropped by parachute into the North
Sea at coordinates 55N 3E.  Then you will travel by Power Ski due west to
rendezvous with HMS Remora, the submarine you will use for this mission. We
are confident that we will get you to the drop site unnoticed, so you will
be able to travel to the Remora unmolested.

This report describes all the weapons and hardware that will be at your
disposal throughout the course of your mission.

I. Submarine Spec Sheet 633S-EG/1 (Fig.1.1)

The Remora was originally a research vessel.  On short notice it was the
best submarine we could find that was less than twenty meters in length.
Reduced length is desired in order to minimize its sonar signature.

It is fitted with relatively little armor and has no built-in weapons
systems.  It does, however, have fairly good range and produces minimal
noise.  It has been retrofitted with several technically advanced devices
for your assistance.  Due to these refits, the submarine can accommodate
only a single crewman.

Although the submarine originally had no torpedo tubes, the bow area held
powerful underwater spotlights.  These were removed to allow installation
of two miniature torpedo launchers capable of firing Needle CAST-2
torpedoes.  The submarine also has two chambers in the bow that were used
to discharge scientific equipment.  These chambers have been modified to
allow the starboard chamber to drop Underwater Concussion Devices (UCDs),
and the port chamber to drop acoustic decoys.

In the stern is an airlock through which you can exit the submarine while
submerged. Inside the airlock is your equipment for conducting submerged
maneuvers: SCUBA gear, a spear gun, and a Propeller Driven Platform (PDP).
There is direct access from the bridge to the airlock.

I.D.:		CS-51/3D (Great Britain)

CLASS:		Research Submersible

NAME:		HMS Remora

BUILT:		March 27, 1983

DIMENSIONS:
	Length:	17.6 meters
	Beam:	5.1 meters
	Draft:	5.6 meters

DISPLACEMENT:
	Surfaced:  800 tons
	Submerged: 950 tons

PROPULSION:
	Diesel/electric; single motor/generator
	Single shaft

CREW: 1						
				Fig. 1.1
			 HMS Remora (C5-51/3D)

II. Needle CAST-2 Torpedoes (Fig. 2.1 & Fig. 2.2)

The bow of your submarine has been retrofitted to accommodate firing tubes
for the deployment of Needle CAST-2 (Counter Anti-Submarine Torpedoes)
torpedoes.  These torpedoes are small contact-detonated explosives which
are designed to quickly destroy enemy anti-submarine devices, such as
floating magnetic mines.  Needles are launched in pairs.  They are guided
by coordinated active sonar that allows them to contact the target at a
single point to concentrate their destructive power.

III. Underwater Concussion Devices (Fig. 3.1)

Your submarine is stocked with five (5) Underwater Concussion Devices
(UCDs).  UCDs are sophisticated bombs made with charges of confined high
explosives.  The main explosive is Composition B, which you may know is a
combination of liquid TNT and RDX. (I believe you Americans call RDX
hexogen).  The CompB putty is packed into high-strength titanium-steel
cylinders under extreme pressure.  These cylinders are then grouped: six
cylinders around one.  By detonating the outer cylinders first, the inner
cylinder explodes an instant later, intensifying the resulting shock wave
by a factor of three.  The CompB charges of the UCDs are set off by a
powerful detonating base charge made with pentaerythritol tetranitrate
(PETN).  This in turn is ignited by a tungsten-magnesium wire, which is
connected to a battery through a simple timer.

UCDs are very durable and safe.  They cannot be accidentally detonated by
mild concussion, they are fairly resistant to heat, and they are, of
course, quite waterproof.  The only danger of accidental detonation is if
the timer casing is pierced, which may short circuit the fuse and set off
the bomb.  Therefore it would not be wise to shoot your spear gun at an
armed UCD.

IV.  Acoustic Decoys (Fig. 4.1)

Your submarine is stocked with five (5) acoustic decoys.  These are
cylinders that emit sounds similar to but louder than those made by your
submarine.  They are battery powered and have an operating duration of
three (3) minutes.

V. Propeller Driven Platform (Fig. 5.1)

In the airlock you will find a Propeller Driven Platform (PDP).  It is
propelled by twin propellers which are housed in cylinders on either side
of the platform.  The cylinders are powered by a simple battery.  There is
no throttle; just turn on the power to cruise at its nominal speed.
Steering is performed by shifting your weight left, right, up, or down. The
PDP is equipped with a low frequency, high energy laser which, when fired,
can effectively destroy small enemy submersibles at very close range.

VI. SCUBA Equipment

In the airlock you will also find SCUBA equipment, including a spear gun.
Your invigorating reputation as a diver leads me to forego any further
explanation.

1  Compass - Shows your current heading in degrees.  Zero (0) is magnetic
   north.

2  Clock - Displays the current Greenwich mean time (Zulu time).

3  AWAM - Advanced Warning Acoustic Monitor.  Collects and interprets
   acoustic data on near objects; translates the signals into graphic
   images.

4  Viewport - Shows what lies directly ahead of the Remora.  Due to light
   distortion, objects appear 30% larger than actual size.  During
   Automatic Pilot navigation, an armored grid protects the viewport from
   collision.

5  PDP Access - Use this panel to move into the airlock and activate the
   propeller driven platform.

6  Drop UCD - Use this panel to prepare a UCD for launching.  Then use the
   UCD Timer to launch the UCD, or use this panel again to abort the
   launch. Once you use this panel, you must either launch or abort the UCD
   before you can give another command.

7  Drop Decoy - Use this panel to jettison an acoustic decoy.  Once
   jettisoned, decoys operate for 180 seconds.

8  SASMAP - Satellite/Aircraft Symbolic MAP. Use this to consult a detailed
   map of the surrounding seascape and all strategic elements, and to set
   your Automatic Pilot.

9  UCD Status - Bright lights indicate remaining UCDs.  Flashing lights are
   UCDs that have been planted and are undergoing countdown to detonation.
   Dull lights are UCDs that have detonated within the last 10 seconds.

10 Decoy Status - Bright lights indicate available acoustic decoys.
   Flashing lights are jettisoned decoys that are still operating.

11 UCD Timer - Shows the current UCD Timer setting in seconds.  It can also
   display time left before detonation of the UCD selected in the UCD
   Status bar.  If no UCDs are selected or undergoing countdown, the
   readout displays a time of 000.

12 UCD Timer Adjust - Use these arrows to change the time delay of the
   selected UCD.  If no UCD is selected, use either arrow to move the
   identification square on the UCD Status bar so you can check the time to
   detonation of any UCDs you have dropped.

13 SCUBA Access - Use this panel to move into the airlock and activate your
   SCUBA gear.  SCUBA stands for Self-Contained Underwater Breathing
   Apparatus.

14 Oxygen and Energy Meters - Display the amount of oxygen and fuel
   available.  Full bars indicate reserves are at 100%.  During normal
   operation, reserves are used at a rate of 8% per minute.  Structural
   damage to the submarine substantially reduces the available supplies. 
   If the reserve level in either bar reaches 0, the Remora automatically
   surfaces.
