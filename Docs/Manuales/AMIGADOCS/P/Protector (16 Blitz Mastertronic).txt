Protector
Typed by Belgarath


'It ain't only the US Navy that has a top pilots training school...'

Assigned to Fort Rucker, the US Army Helicopter Training School based in the Nevada
desert, your aim is to become the best chopper pilot this side of the Iron Curtain. A real
Protector!

Your mission consists of a strategic battle of wits between yourself and either another
pilot, or a computer controlled by RPV (Remote Pilotless Vehicle).

Your mission objective is to collect all the supplies that are scattered around the desert
landscape and return them to your cave base. When all the supply cases have been
collected, the parts contained within build a bomb. Take this bomb and drop it on your
opponents base.

Simple? Not quite.

While you are out busy collecting the supply cases, your opponents can enter YOUR cave
base and steal your supplies. Lucky for you, you can do the same to him.

Completed bombs can also be stolen, but they must be taken back to your base and
re-armed in your own colour.

Your helicopters are equipped only with a 30mm Gatling cannon. This may be used
offensively against the other player.

Should a player be carrying an item and be hit by cannon fire, the item will be dropped.
Take careful notice of your damage, ammo and fuel levels. Helicopters tend not to fly too
well when the engine has stopped!

Landing at your own base will top up ammo and fuel and will repair any damage.

If you are directly over your base and run out of fuel, you will autorotate down and land
safely.

Can you defeat all comers and become "Top Dog" of Fort Rucker!
