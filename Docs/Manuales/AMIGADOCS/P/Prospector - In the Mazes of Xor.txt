			Prospector In The Mazes of Xor

Adapted and improved from t he original game "Xor" on the CBM 64, Spectrum
and Atari ST.

MEET THE PROSPECTORS
     
Herb and Pip are Prospectors always on the look out for treasure.  Herb's
the fat guy with the striped pullover, and his trusty companion Pip, who is
ot unrelated to the Great Reptiles of the Mesozoic Era, is the other one. 
When they heard about the legendary maze of Xor, they knew there wouldn't
be much treasure around, but it would be a great chance to try the jetpacks
they'd recently bought at the local Fishing Shop.
     
Once inside the mazes, however, the terrible truth soon dawned on them. 
Unless they collected all the balloons on each level, and got to the exit
of each maze, they would never escape alive.  Somewhere somehow, the Xor
himself was watching every move, and clocking it up.  And Herb and Pip have
to beat that clock...

AMIGA LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

1. Turn the computer off and disconnect all unnecessary peripherals.

2. Switch the computer on and then place the disk in drive (DF0:).

3. After a few seconds the workbench will appear.  Double-click on the
   "Prospector" disk icon marked 'HT'.

4. You will now see a turtle icon labelled 'Prospector'.  Double-click on
   this icon and after a few seconds, the Prospector music will start to
   play followed by the game.

NOTE: Please ensure that the write-protect tab is closed so that the game
can save your high scores and construction set mazes to the disk.

MAKING A BACKUP

We recommend that you make a backup of your Prospector disk.  To do this
from the workbench, click the disk icon and select 'Duplicate' from the
pull-down menu.  For further details refer to your user guide.  Only use
your working copy to play Prospector - you should keep your original disk
in a safe place so that if your backup fails then you can easily make
another copy.

NOTE: It is illegal to copy this game and give any copy to another person. 
Backup copies are for personal use only!

MULTITASKING

'Prospector in the mazes of Xor' is capable of multitasking with other
programs.  This means that you can load and run the game from your
workbench whilst running other programs at the same time.  You can return
to the workbench whenever you require by moving the mouse pointer to the
very top of the screen.  You can use this in the customary manner to move
the screen up or down and you can use the icons in the right hand corner to
bring the screen to the front or the back.
     
If you wish, you can also put the game on your hard disk. Simply drag the
program itself and the accompanying data drawer (XOR_LIB) into the same
directory and you're ready to go.
     
One idea to make use of multitasking, would be to switch off or kick out
the Prospector music and use "Sonix" to play your own tune.
     
SELECTING A MAZE

When you have entered the manual protection password you will see the title
'XOR's Mazes' and a list of fifteen maze names.  These are the legendary
labyrinths taken from XOR.  There are another two sets of fifteen mazes
which can be selected by clicking the left/right arrow icons or by using
the left or right on either your joystick or the cursor keys.  The extra
maze sets are the Procyon mazes and the Construction Set mazes.  To select
a maze you need only double-click on the maze name or change the maze
select with up/down then press fire.
     
Beginners should start on the first maze entitled 'Olaf's Warm Up' on the
XOR set of mazes as this is the easiest.
     
CONTROL GUIDE

Control is by joystick or use the cursor keys on the keyboard to move your
Prospectors up, down, left or right.  To change between your Prospectors,
press "FIRE" on the joystick and "RETURN" on the keyboard.

PLAYING THE GAME

The display to the right shows you the number of moves that you have made
and below this, the remaining number of balloons that you need to collect. 
You control the Prospectors "Herb and Pip" as they negotiate the maze
collecting balloons.  Once all the balloons have been collected, one of the
Prospectors has to make his way to the exit to complete the maze.  And all
of this has to be done in no more than two thousand moves.  If you complete
a maze in a fewer number of moves than ever before then the computer will
save the number of moves to disk.
     
Collecting the balloons is not as easy as it sounds, for many obstacles
block  your way.
     
Decoy Balloons - these look similar to normal balloons but a nasty thing
happens when you touch them.
     
Power Fields - horizontal or vertical.  If you step into them in the
correct direction then they will disappear.  But if you try to step into
them in the wrong direction they will be just as impenetrable as walls.
     
Zeppelins - when nothing blocks their path, they have a strong tendency to
drift to the left.  Warning Zeppelins can squash you if you get in their
way!
     
1.  Rocks - these tumble down when pushed over the edge.  Make sure none
    land on your head!
     
2.  Spheres - these look harmless but once they start rolling there's no
    stopping them.
     
3.  Maps - there are four pieces of the map, hidden in the maze.  Collect a
    piece and you will see it appear in the box in the top right-hand
    corner.  White dots on the map show the locations of balloons to
    collect.
     
4.  The Dynamite Pack - if a rock falls on this or a Zepplin collides with
    it then it explodes.  this is very useful for blowing holes in walls
    but beware that you do not blow up any balloons or you will never
    complete the maze.
     
5.  Tin Bomb - this bomb moves around like a Zeppelin and will also blow up
    in a different manner if a rock or Zeppelin hits it.
     
6.  Teleporter - also known as BMUS (Beam Me Up Scottie!).  If you walk
    into one of then then it will teleport you to another part of the maze.
    If something is blocking your way though then the teleporter will
    automatically beam you back.
     
7.  The Exit - the exit is locked until you collect all the balloons.  Then
    it will become unlocked and you can escape.
     
REPLAY

By clicking on the 'circular arrow' icon or by pressing the 'R' key you
will get a replay of your game so far.  By pressing 'SHIFT' and 'right'
(cursor or joystick) you can then enter single-step mode. Now, whenever you
press 'right', the game will single-step through the replay. to get out of
this mode, press 'FIRE'.  Once the replay has finished, you can resume the
game.
     
PROSPECTOR CONSTRUCTION SET

Prospector has a inbuilt Maze Construction Set so that  you can build up to
fifteen mazes and save them to disk.  To start constructing you must
highlight a maze in the Construction Set Menu and press "C" in this mode,
there are two screens.  You toggle between them by pressing the spacebar. 
The first shows you the maze which you can scroll around and have a look at
- press FIRE/RETURN to place the component selected under the spanner icon.
The second is a kit containing all the available components - select a
component by placing the 'spanner' icon over the component and pressing
FIRE/RETURN.
     
When constructing a maze, always remember these golden rules:
     
i)   The edges must be made up of wall blocks or empty fields.
     
ii)  Herb and Pip must be placed in the maze, once and only once.
     
iii) There must be at least one exit.
     
iv)  There must be four, two or no teleporters.
     
When you've set up your maze, click the door in the bottom right corner (or
press 'Q' once only).  If anything isn't quite as it should be, the
Construction Set will tell you that you've made a mistake.  If you do not
decide to correct it (by pressing 'Q' once again) then your construction
will be erased.

THE END

When you have finished playing 'Prospector in the mazes of XOR', click on
the 'door' icon or press ESC or F10 and the game will be quitted
completely.
