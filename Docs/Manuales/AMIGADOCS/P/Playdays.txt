Welcome to the PLAYDAYS educational package for children aged 3 to 8 years old
This package has been carefully designed to give children a friendly, familiar
and enjoyable environment in which to develop a wide range of essential skills
Playdays makes learning fun.

GENERAL NOTES FOR PARENTS
--------------------------
Children learn more readily when they are doing a wide range of things that
they enjoy in situations that they feel comfortable. Children who are forced
to learn, are likely to learn little and become bored and resentful. It is
better to let them "play" and learn at there own pace and to be allowed to
stop when they want to.

Praising success is important and helpful to a child, but it is equally impor-
tant to respond properly to a poor performance. Never tell a child off for 
getting something wrong and don't force a child to keep trying again and again
It is better to think of positive and friendly things to say such as "It was
nearly right" or "Never mind" or "Do you want to try again?" rather than 
"Thats wrong" or "Do it again!".

Don't worry if your child gets things wrong, we all learn from making mistakes
Children rarely get things wrong on purpose since they feel good when doing 
well, but can feel rejected when failing. Try not to draw attention to errors
as this may further discourage them, but encourage them to try again, but only
if they want to.

Children often look upon their computer as a friend that is always on their
side no matter what they do. A child can make numerous mistakes without feel-
ing embarrassed or discouraged. Children often continue to tackle difficult
problems on a computer, eventually getting them right, where as they may qui-
ckly give up when wotking with an adult.

If your child is not used to using a computer it is sensible to give them some
rules such as no drinks or food near the computer, clean hands and fingers, no
touching of power supplies or switches and no touching of tapes or discs. It
is probably best with young children to load the program for them so that they
do not need to touch the disc or tape.

ABOUT PLAYDAYS
---------------
The Playdays program has been designed to be easy enough for children to use
by themselves, though it is advisable to give them help when they use the 
program for the first time.

The program contains 13 separate "games" that are described later in this text
Ten of these "games" use over 250 words and pictures that have been divided
into groups based on the alphabet. All but one of the "games" have a diffic-
ulty level. This is set at the start and is then automatically adjusted accor-
ding to your childs perfomance.

The computer chooses the set of "games" used each time, making sure that
easier "games" are played first, and that a different set of "games" is played
the next time which helps maintain interest. Throughout the program, animatio-
ns and sound effects also maintain interest and will encourage your child.

Children will recognise the familiar WHY BIRD character from the Playdays
television series. She is used as a friendly guide and tutor through out the
program, giving messages and expressive animations of praise and encouragement
as appropriate. Young children may have to have these simple messages read to
them to start with, though most children will realise what to do by watching
the animationsand listening to the sound effects.

All the way through the program, success is rewarded with cheerful tunes and
animations involving various Playday characters. Poor performances are ackno-
wledged, but not dwelt on or punished. After three un successful tries, the
child is always given the answer.

At the end of a series of games, a performance table is displayed for parents
to view. Children will see and be encouraged by their progress as well.

USING THE PROGRAM
------------------
Once the program has loaded (see loading) your child is encouraged to enter
their name. This is done by choosing letters on a screen with a joystick,
mouse or cursor keys (see controls). In this way your child is not confused
by the odd arrangement of capital letters on traditional keyboards.

The initial difficulty level is selected in a similar way. This difficulty
level will be adjusted to your childs performance during the program. In 
order not to discourage it may be advisable to set this to a low level the
first time the program is used.

A letter is then chosen (see choosing letters). If the chosen letter is X,
three X "games" are played (see X "games). For the other letters, five or six
pictures or words beginning with the letter are displayed to allow your child
to become familiar with them. If a theme is available for the letter, then 
these pictures and words are also displayed. (Some themes do not have pictures
.) A series of "games" using these words and pictures are then played. (See-
normal "games").

A performance table is displayed at the end of a series of "games". This shows
the level achieved at each "game", and a percentage score. "Games" not yet
played have no score.

After the performance table, the child can select a new letter, and go through
a different series of "games".

                             THE 10 NORMAL "GAMES"
                            -----------------------
1. MATCHING
------------
Several pictures appear with their words shown in a different order near the
bottom of the screen. The child selects a word and the picture it belongs.
When all the words have been used, incorrectly placed words are returned to
the bottom of the screen for the child to reply.
Abilities encouraged.  .................. Coordination and word recognition.

2. SNAP
--------
Two pictures appear. If they match, the child should press fire before new
pictures appear. At harder levels, the child matches pictures with words as
well as having to think more quickly.
Abilities encouraged.  .................. Coordination and word recognition.

3. ODD ONE OUT
---------------
Four words or pictures are displayed. The child selects the one they thinh is
the odd one out. The child has up to three tries before the answer and the 
reason is giving.
Abilities encouraged.  .................. Reasoning and word recognition.

4. COUNTING
------------
Several identical pictures appear. The child is asked how many there are and
selects a number. Three tries are allowed before the answer is given.
Abilities encouraged.  .................. Counting.

5. WHAT'S GONE
---------------
Several pictures or words are displayed. A short time later, they are display-
ed again, but with one missing. On easy levels, the child selects a word from
a list to indicate what is missing. On harder levels the word has to be spelt
by picking letters from the alphabet. Three tries are allowed before the answ-
er is given.
Abilities encouraged.  .................. Observation, memory, spelling and
                                          word recognition.

6. SPELLING
------------
A single picture appears and the child is asked what it is. The child then 
spells the word from a selection of letters. On easy levels, only letters that
are in the word are used. Extra help is given at the easiest level by having
the first few letters of the word already in place. Three tries are allowed
before the answer is given.
Abilities encouraged.  .................. Spelling and word recognition.

7. MOVING WINDOW
-----------------
A large picture is covered apart from a small window that slowly moves back
and forth revealing only part or the picture at a time. The child is asked to
guess what the picture is by spelling the word. Three tries are allowed before
the answer is given.
Abilities encouraged. ................... Observation, spelling and word
                                          recognition.

8. DOT TO DOT
--------------
A series of numbered dots are displayed. As the child selects each dot in turn
a line appears joining this dot with the last one to create a picture. The 
child is allowed three goes at completing the picture. After the third go, the
correct picture appears. To complete the task, the child is asked what it is.
The child then spells the word.
Abilities encouraged.  .................. Counting, coordination, spelling,
                                          and picture and word recognition.

9. SLIDING PUZZLE
------------------
A large picture is displayed. It is split into nine blocks which are then mov-
ed around. The child is asked to move the blocks back to their correct posit-
ions. A block can only be moved up, down, left or right into a vacant position
by moving the small Why Bird X or square onto the block to be moved and press-
ing fire. If the child gets stuck, help is given by moving some of the blocks
to their correct position. To complete the task, the child is asked what it is
by spelling the word.
Abilities encouraged.  .................. Coordination, observation, logic,
                                          problem solving and spelling.

10. RHYME
----------
An original rhyme based on the theme for that letter is displayed as Why Bird
slowly reads it. Parents would be expected to help read the rhyme with Why 
Bird.
Abilities encouraged.  .................. Reading.

                              THE THREE X "GAMES"
                             ----------------------
1. NOUGHT AND CROSSES
----------------------
The child plays Why Bird at noughts and crosses. The child moves the small 
Why Bird X or square to where they want to put their cross when it is their
turn. Why Bird is harder to beat at the harder levels.
Abilities encouraged.  ................... Logic and reasoning.

2. TREASURE
------------
A treasure island appears with a grid. The child is asked to find the treasure
by moving a small X or square to where they think it is. For each guess they 
are told whether they are hot, warm or cold. The number of goes allowed before
they are shown where the treasure is depends on the level.
Abilities encouraged.  ...................  Logic and reasoning.

3. SHAPES AND COLOURS
----------------------
In colour matching, the child is asked if two colours are the same. In shape
matching the child is asked if two shapes are the same shape. At harder levels
the shapes vary in size and may be rotated.
Abilities encouraged.  ...................  Observation, colour and shape
                                            recognition.
