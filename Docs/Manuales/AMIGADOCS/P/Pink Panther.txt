                       Pink Panther Docs by THE DEMON
                       ==============================
                           (c) 1987 micro-partner

  Pink Panther is completely broke again due to his excessive way of living
and is now looking for a job. `Butler' would be the right thing, opportunity
to live in comfortable homes and rob the owners at night. Five burgalaries
would do it nicely!  Then Pink Panther could afford a holiday in the South
in order to recover from his hard work. Hard Work ? Ah yes, when he applied
for the jobs, Pink Panther didn't know that all his masters were into
sleepwalking. Now he has to guide his employer carefully through the house
enabling him to pick up the valuables without his master waking up.

 But Inspector Clouseau is not so lazy either!  For years he has tried to
catch Pink Panther on the nap. So he sneaks about the house as well.  How
can Pink Panther in all this confusion reach his goal, without getting
caught?  However, he has some tricks up his sleeve...


 GAMEPLAY
 ========

 First Pink Panther can choose where to go:
 - looking through the job offers (here he can choose an employer)
 - into the department store (the wealthy his employer the better)

 Pink Pathers appearance has to be good. If he has enough money he can buy
tophat and tails for his job.) So, now equiped, he can introduce himself.
You can get into the houses of the richer if you have successfully raided...
ehm, visited the previous ones.

 For the different houses you need:
                          - house 0:-
                          - house 1:tophat
                          - house 2:gold watch
                          - house 3:reference(faked)
                          - house 4:car

 Guide the SleepWalkers
 ======================
 1) If pink panther stands in the defensive position facing the sleepwalker
   (fire and direction) the latter changes his direction when colliding with
   Pink Panther.
 2) If you want the sleepwalker to change direction (front/back) Pink
    Panther has to face the desired direction and jingle the bell.

 Pink Panther can make use of his tricks: he can inflate some objects, for
 example, a phantom-panther out of plastic that makes the sleepwalker turn
 around and catches the Ispectors attention. Even the Inflatable hole has
 unhappy consequences for the Inspector: of course he'll fall into it! In
 order to direct the sleep-walker from a distance Pink Panther can
 distribute catapults and boards which guide the sleepwalker safely around
 obstacles. The other items...you'll see!
