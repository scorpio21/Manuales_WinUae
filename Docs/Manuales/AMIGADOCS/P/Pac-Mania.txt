Pac-Mania
Typed by Belgarath


Pac-Mania is a one player game in which you
manoeuvre Pac-Man through a World of 3-D
mazes. Armed with unique BOUNCE power,
Pac faces new challenges as he enters the
worlds of Block Town, Pac-Man's Park,
Sandbox Land and Jungly Steps.

Start the game by selecting level 1, 2, 3 or 4 - the
higher the level the more difficult the game.
Your objective is to eat all the dots and power
pills in the mazes whilst at the same time
avoiding those pesky ghosts. Boss ghost
Clyde has recruited the talents of 2 new
ghosts, Sue and Funky, making Pac's journey
even more troublesome. However, eat a
power pill and the ghosts will temporarily
change colour giving Pac the chance to
munch his way to extra points.

Pac also has the help of 2 "special items", a
green and a red power pill. The GREEN pill
adds temporary speed and the RED awards
double points. FRUIT may also appear and
when eaten will add bonus points to your
score.

If you are Pac-Maniac enough to have reached
the next maze world before running out of
lives, don't despair as there is the option to
munch on!!
