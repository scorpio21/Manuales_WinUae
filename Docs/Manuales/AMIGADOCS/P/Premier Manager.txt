INTRODUCTION
------------

AT GREMLIN WE BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WISH TO CREATE A GAME IN AN ALREADY
CROWDED GENRE, THEN THAT GAME REALLY HAS TO STAND HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE
THE REST OF THE MARKET.  SECOND BEST IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH,  ITS GOT TO BE
NUMBER ONE.  PREVIOUSLEY GRAMLIN HAVE APPLIED THIS PHILOSOPHY TO RACING
GAMES WITH THE LOTUS SERIES, AND TO ARCADE GAMES WITH ZOOL AND HARLEQUIN
AMONGST OTHERS.  NOW ITS THE TURN OF FOOTBALL MANAGEMENT SIMULATIONS.  
WELCOME TO  PREMIER MANAGER.
WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THIS GAME IS THE BEST, MOST PLAYABLE FOOTBALL
MANAGEMENT GAME EVER RELEASED.  IT MICHT NOT BE THE MOST COMPLICATED, BUT
ITS UNDOUBTEDLY BRILLIANT FUN TO PALY, AND AMAZINGLY ADDICTIVE.  A QUICK
WORD OF WARNING THOUGH.  BEFORE YOU LOAD IT, MAKE SURE THAT YOU DONT HAVE
ANY PLANS FOR THIS EVENING. OR TOMORROW, OR THE DAY AFTER THAT....
 NOTE:  AT THE ENS OF EACH MATCH THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT PAUSE WHILE THE
GAME WORKS OUT THE RESULTS OF ALL GAMES IN ALL DIVISIONS, PLAYER STATS AND
CUP COMPETITIONS. THIS IS BECAUSE RATHER THAN JUST YOUR DIVISION, THE
COMPUTER IS WORKING ON ALL THE OTHER DIVISIONS TOO. THIS MEANS THAT EACH
GAME YOU PLAY IS A REAL COMPLETE PLAY UNIVERSE, AND NOTHING IS LEFT TO
CHANCE AND LUCK.  EACH TEAM HAS PLAYED FORTY ODD GAMES IN A SEASON, AND THE
TEAMS THAT ARE RELIGATED AND PROMOTED ARE NOT JUST CHOSEN AT RANDOM.  THIS
IS AIMPORTANT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, NOT LEAST BECAUSE AT THE END OF A
SEASON YOU MAY BE OFFERED JOBS MANAGING OTHER TEAMS.

ON LOADING
----------

THE FIRST SCREEN YOU WILL ENCOUNTER WHEN YOU LOAD PREMIER MANAGER WILL BE
THE  " ENTER NAME " SCREEN.
EACH PLAYER CLICKS THE MOUSE ON A SLOT, AND TYPES THEIR NAME IN.  WHEN THE
ENTER KEY IS PRESSED TO REGISTER THE NAME, A TEAM FROM THE CONFERENCE
LEAGUE WILL BE ALLOCATED TO THAT PLAYER.  IF THE PLAYER WISHES TO HAVE A
DIFFERENT TEAM, THEY SHOULD CLICK ON THE ARROWS WHICH APPEAR TO EITHER SIDE
OF THE PANEL.  ONLY TEAMS FROM THE CONFERENCE LEAGUE WILL BE ALLOCATED TO A
PLAYER.  IF A PLAYER WANTS TO MANAGE A PREMIER DIVISION TEAM, THEN THEY
HAVE FIRST TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE UP TO THE JOB. UP TO FOUR PALYERS CAN
PLAY SIMULTANEOUSLY, EACH CLICKING ON A DIFFERENT PANEL TO ENTER THEIR NAME
AND SELECT A TEAM.  ONCE ALL PLAYERS HAVE A TEAM ALLOCATED, CLICK ON THE
WORD CONTINUE  AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.

MULTI PLAYER GAMES
------------------

UP TO FOUR PEOPLE CAN PLAY SIMULTANEOUSLY. OF COURSE, EACH OF THE FOUR
PLAYERS WILL TAKE TURNS ON COMPLETING THEIR MOVES. IN ORDER TO MOVE BETWEEN
THE FOUR, THE FIRST FOUR FUNCTION KEYS ARE USED.  SO,IF IT'S THE TURN OF
OFF PLAYER TWO, THEN THE F2 KEY SHOULD BE PRESSED, AND PLAYER TWO THEN
TAKES CONTROL OF THE MOUSE AND THE KEYBOARD.  FOLLOW THE ON-SCREEN
INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUTHER ADVICE.


ONCE THE GAME HAS LOADED, YOU WILL SEE THE MAIN OPTION SCREEN..

MAIN OPTIONS SCREEN
-------------------

		1.	GROUND IMPROVEMENTS AND SPONSORS SCREEN
		2.	TRANSFER MARKET
		3.	LEAGUE TABLE
		4.	SQUAD DETAILS
		5.	LOADING AND SAVING
		6.	CAREER HISTORY
		7.	FINANCES
		8.	TELEPHONE
		9.	CUP DETAILS
		10.	LEAGUE RESULTS/FIXTURES
		11.	FAX MACHINE
		12.	PLAY MATCH

 THIS SCREEN OFFERS TWELVE SECTIONS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE
SUB SECTIONS.  WHICH SECTIONS ARE VISITED BETWEEN EACH MATCH, LESS
FREQUENTLY OR NOT AT ALL DEPENDING UPON PLAYER PREFERENCE.  THERE IS NO
REGIMENTED ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE USED IN THE GAME, SO THE EASIEST THING
TO DO IS TO GO THROUGH EACH THING IN TURN AS IT APPEARS ON THE SCREEN.

	1.GROUND IMPROVEMENTS AND SPONSORS SCREEN.
	  ---------------------------------------

ON THIS SCREEN YOU CAN FILL UP THE BOARDS SURROUNDING THE PITCH, AND ALSO
CARRY OUT IMPROVEMENTS ON YOUR GROUND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE SHOULD
YOUR GROUND COME UP TO SCRATCH, THE FA WILL NOT HESITATE IN ISSUING A VERY
HEAVY FINE.

IMPROVING YOUR GROUND
---------------------

 THE MAIN PANEL ON THIS SECTION IS MADE UP OF A LIST WHICH INDICATES THE
CURRENT STATUS OF YOUR GROUND, EACH POINT IS DETAILED BELOW. IN GENERAL,
THE BETTER MAINTENANCE AND QUALITY OF FACILITIES OFFERED, THE MORE FANS YOU
WILL ATTRECT TO THE GROUND. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE WILL KNOW THAT THERE IS
MORE CHANCE OF SEEING A GOOD QUALITY FOOTBALL GAME ON A WELL LIT MAINTAINED
GROUND WITH UNDER SOIL HEATING, AND SO IF YOUR GROUND OFFERS THESE
FACILITES, THEN FANS WILL BE MORE INCLINED TO ATTEND.

STANDING CAPACITY
-----------------
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE STANDING CAPACITY OF YOUR GROUND, AND CANNOT BE
INCREASED.

SEATING CAPACITY
----------------
THE SEATING CAPACITY OF YOUR GROUND CAN BE IMPROVED, PRIMARILY AT THE
EXPENSE OF THE STANDING CAPACITY.  EACH TIME YOU DICIDE TO IMPROVE THE
SEATING, THE CAPACITY WILL, ON COMPLETION OF WORK, BE INCREASED BY 5OO
SEATS.

SAFETY RATINGS
--------------
THIS IS FROM ONE STAR UP TO FIVE STARS.  AS YOUR PROGRESS THROUGH THE
DIVISIONS, THEN OBVIOUSLY YOUR SAFETY RATING MUST IMPROVE.  EACH SET OF
IMPROVEMENTS BECOMES PROGRESSIVELY MORE EXPENSIVE.

GROUND FACILITIES
-----------------
THE QUALITY OF YOUR CURRENT GROUND FACILITIES.

SUPPORTERS CLUB
---------------
THE SIZE OF YOUR CURRENT SUPPORTERS CLUB FACILITIES.  IF YOU INVEST IN YOUR
SUPPORTERS CLUB,  THEN YOU WILL ATTRACT MORE FANS TO EACH GAME, WHICH WILL
MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE TO YOUR INCOME OVER A SEASON, FIRST FROM GATE
RECEIPTS, AND SECONDLY FROM SPONSORS WHO WILL ALSO BE WILLING TO OFFER YOU
MORE MONEY FOR THE BOARDS SURROUNDING THE PITCH.

UNDERSOIL HEATING
-----------------
THIS INDICATES WHETHER YOU HAVE UNDERSOIL HEATING OR NOT.

FLOODLIGHTS
-----------
THIS INDICATES WHETHER YOU HAVE FLOODLIGHTS, AND IF SO WHAT QUALITY THEY
ARE.  OBVIOUSLY, CHEAPER FLOODLIGHTS AREN'T AS EFFICIENT AS MORE EXPENSIVE
ONES, AND MORE PRONE TO MALFUNCTION.

SCOREBOARD
----------
AGAIN THIS INDICATES WHETHER YOU HAVE A SCOREBOARD, AND IF SO , OF WHAT
QUALITY.

FILLING THE SPONSOR BOARD
-------------------------
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN YOU WILL SEE TWO BOARDS (1) ABOVE ONE BOARD
(2) TO THE RIGHT OFF THIS WILL BE THE NUMBER OF WEEKS FOR WHICH THIS
PARTICULAR COMPANY WILL SPONSOR YOU, AND HOW MUCH THEY WILL PAY YOU (3).
WHEN YOU FIRST BEGIN THE GAME, YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT HAVE ENOUGH SPONSORS
TO FILL THE BOARDS, SO JUST ACCEPT WHATEVER IS GOING.  SHORT TEARM
SPONSORSHIP TEND TO PAY BETTER BY THE WEEK, BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY NEED
UPDATING MORE REGULARLY,WHILST LONG TERM DEALS PAY LESS PER WEEK, BUT ARE A
LOT LESS HASSEL.  LATER IN THE SEASON, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR TEAM PROVES
SUCCESSFUL, THE COMPETITION FOR THE BOARDS WILL INCREASE, SO YOU MUST DECIDE
CARFULLY WHOSE SPONSORSHIP YOU ACCEPT. TO FILL A SPONSOR BOARD, SIMPLY
CLICK ON EITHER OF THE TWO ARROWS TO THE SIDE OF THE TWO BOARDS UNTIL A
BLANK ONE APPEARS, AND THE CLICK ON IT.


	2.TRANSFER MARKET

 THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN BUY OTHER PLAYERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT,
OR WHERE YOU CAN SELL ONE OF YOUR PLAYERS  AT THE  TOP OF THE SCREEN ARE
YOUR DETAILS, AND BENETH THIS A LIST OF PLAYERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
FOR TRANSFARE.  BENEATH THIS A NUMBER WILL INDICATE HOW MANY PLAYER THERE ARE
AND UNDER THIS  THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF PLAYER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THIS
APANEL HAS FOUR ICONS:

 LIST ICON
THE FIRST, THE LIST ICON, WILL PUT UP THE LIST OF PLAYERS AVAILABLE, OR
TAKE YOU TO THE NEXT PAGE IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE PAGE.

 EXAMINE ICON
BENEATH THIS IS A MAGNIFYING GLASS, WHICH WILL GIVE YOU THE CURRENTLY
SELECTED PLAYER. (PLAYERS ARE SELECTED BY CLICKING ON THEM WITH THE MOUSE
POINTER).  OF YOU SELECT THIS OPTION, THEN A SCREEN WILL APPEAR WHICH WILL
GIVE YOU THE DETALS AVAILABLE TO YOU ABOUT THAT PLAYER. ( NOTE: YOU NEED TO
HAVE HIRED A SCOUT BEFORE YOU CAN GET ANY DETAILS.  YOU BEGIN THE GAME WITH
A SCOUT ALREADY HIRED, BUT MORE DETAILS ABOUT HIRING AND FIRING WILL APPEAR
LATER.)  APART FRON THE PLAYER ABILITY, THIS SECTION WILL INDICATE THE
PLAYER AGE AND OTHER SUCH RELEVANT INFORMATION.  AS THE SEASON PROGRESSES,
THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS AVAILIBLE FOR SALE WILL DECREASE STEDILY.  ON THE
MAIN LIST THE TWO FIGURES GIVEN ON THE LEFT ARE VERY INPORTANT.  THE IS AN
INDICATION OF HOW MANY WEEKS A PLAYER HAS BEEN ON THE TRANSFER MARKET, AND
THE SECOND IS AN INDICATION OF THEIR BEST PLAYING STRENGTH.  SO, IF OVER A
NUMBER OF WEEKS YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GOALIE, AND IT WAS WEEK SEVEN
IN THE SEASON, THEN YOU WOULD PRIMARILY BE INTERESTED IN A PLAYER WITH THE
NUMBER SEVENTO THE FAR LEFT, AND  HN  IN THE NEXT COLUMN.

SKILL RATINGS
 A PLAYERS SKILL RETINGS ARE INDICATED AS FOLLOWING:

		THE ULTIMATE
		EXCEPTIONAL
		WORLD CLASS
		SUPERB		( 1 STAR - 5 STARS )
		V. GOOD		( 1 STAR - 5 STARS )
		GOOD		( 1 STAR - 5 STARS )
		FAIR		( 1 STAR - 5 STARS )

IN THE ABOVE TABLE ` FAIR 1 STAR ' IS THE LOWEST RATING, AND ULTIMATE IS,
WELL, THE ULTIMATE.

BUYING A PLAYER   
---------------
JUST AS IMPORTANT IS HOW MUCH THE CLUB WANT FOR THE PLAYER,AND THE CONTRACT
FEE,BOTH OF THESE ARE ADDED TOGETHER TO GIVE YOU A BASIC FIGURE TO WORK
FROM.FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE PLAYERS VALUE WAS 5000 POUNDS AND HIS CONTRACT WAS
FOR 10.000 POUNDS THEN YOUR BID WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO BE AT LEAST 15,000
POUNDS. YOUR BID IN THIS INSTANCE WOULD APPEAR AS 10,000 AS THE CONTRACT
FEE IS SUBTRACTED FIRST. SO IF ANYONE HAS BID,AFTER CONTRACT,10.500 POUNDS
THEN YOU LOSE THE PLAYER. REMEMBER OTHER THAN A PLAYERS MARKET
VALUE,CONSIDER THAT IF YOU HAVE INJURIES,OR ARE LACKING IN SOME AREAS,THEN
A PLAYER COULD BE WORTH A LOT MORE TO YOU THAN HIS MARKET VALUE. CONSIDER
THIS WHEN YOU BID, BUT ABOVE ALL BEAR IN MIND THAT THIS IS THE TRANSFER
MARKET, AND JUST ABOUT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. CERTAINLY IF A PLAYER IS OF
LOWER ABILITY, THEN A BIT BELOW THE ASKING PRICE MIGHT PROVE SUCCESFUL. IF
A PLAYER IS IN THE HIGHER DIVISIONS HOWEVER,THEN THIS TACTIC IS LIKELY ONLY
TO WASTE YOUR TIME.
          ------------------------------------------------------
[PLAYER/CASH ICON] PLAYER BIDDING ICON
------------------
YOU BID FOR A PLAYER BY CLICKING ON THE ICON SHOWING A PLAYER AND A HAND
FULL OF COINS. WHEN YOU CLICK ON THIS A NEW SCREEN WILL APPEAR WITH DETAILS
OF THE PLAYER.AND ALSO WHAT YOURSCOUT RECKENS WOULD BE A REASONABLE
OFFER. NEXT,YOU TYPE THE OFFER YOU ARE MAKING,AND PRESS "ENTER". ANOTHER
NEW SCREEN WILL APPEAR GIVING DETAILS OF ALL THE BIDS WHICH WERE MADEFOR A
PLAYER, AND WHICH,IF ANY,WERE SUCCESSFUL. IF THE BID YOU MAKE IS TOO
LOW,THEN IT MAY NOT EVEN REGISTER. IF YOUR BID WAS SUCCESSFUL,HOWEVER,THEN
THE NEXT TIME YOU GO TO THE SQUAD SELECTION SCREEN,THE NEW PLAYER WILL BE
THERE.
         -----------------------------------------------------
[PLAYER/POUND ICON] SELLING A PLAYER
-------------------
SHOULD YOU WISH TO SELL A PLAYER,FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE INVESTEDIN A NEW
STRIKER AND NOW HAVE ONE SURPLUS TO REQUIREMENTS,THEN CLICK ON ICON WHICH
SHOWS A FOOTBALL PLAYER IN FRONT OF A POUND SIGN. A LIST OF YOUR PLAYERS
WILL APPEAR,AND YOU SHOULD CLICK ON THE ONE YOU WISH TO SELL. THE SCREEN
WILL NOW CHANGE,AND INFORM YOU OF ANY BIDSWHICH MIGHT OF COME IN FOR THAT
PLAYER. IF YOU DECIDE TO ACCEPT A BID,THE CLICK ON THE BIDAND THEN
THE "THUMBS UP" ICON. IF YOU WISH TO DECLINE ALL THE OFFERS MADE,THEN CLICK
