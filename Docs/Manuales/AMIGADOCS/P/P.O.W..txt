                             P.O.W.!
                             ~~~~~~
Amiga Loading Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
P.O.W. requires any Amiga computer with at least 512K of memory, a 1 Meg
computer gives music. To load:

1) Turn on your Amiga and monitor in the normal manner and insert the
Kickstart disk if required (typically Amiga 1000 users).

2) When the display prompts for a Workbench disk, insert the P.O.W. disk in
your internal drive.

3) CHOOSING YOUR WEAPON
   Insert either the mouse or the Actionware light phaser into the
appropriate game port and P.O.W. will automatically detect and give you the
desired weapon.

4) CHOOSING PLAYING MODE
   
   1 Player                       Dual Gun

   Before selecting the play option, you can AIM (Calibrate) your gun by
hitting the letter "A" (not the Amiga key), then make the 1 player or dual
gun selection.

If one player wishes to play, hit the 1 PLAYER OPTION.
If two people wish to play simultaneously and they have the DUAL GUN
INTERFACE (sold separately) hit the DUAL GUN option.
(For Amiga 500 & 2000 only. Not Amiga 1000 compatible)

	AIMING
     ~~~~~~
After making your selection, the aiming screen will appear. Aim your gun at
the center of the crosshairs, then press (and hold) the gun trigger.
Crosshairs will follow your gun's aim. Repeatedly strike the arrow keys to
align the small crosshairs with your aim. note: we say REPEATEDLY because
the increments of movement are small. Don't be worried if the small
crosshairs seem to jump around; this movement is normal. When your sights
are calibrated, hit the SPACE BAR to continue.

	If you selected the DUAL GUN option each person will have the
opportunity to aim (calibrate) his or her gun sights.

PAUSE
~~~~~
To pause the game, just hit the "Space Bar" on the keyboard. To start, just
hit the "Space Bar" again.

DEMO MODE
~~~~~~~~~
A continuous demo starts any time no input is sensed for approximately 30
seconds. When you are ready to begin, click the mouse or press the gun
trigger.

SOUND EFFECTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The sound effects used are real. For best results connect your Amiga to a
Stereo System with good bass response and pump up the volume.

ABOUT P.O.W.
~~~~~~~~~~~
P.O.W. is one of several new action adventures that requires the agility
and marksmanship of an action arcade game, but also gives the atmosphere of
an adventure.

Every red-blooded American is sickened by our enemy's injustice toward our
men who gave so much for their country. Many of our boys are still over
ther, and you're going to get them. With your M14 and a few good men, you
adventure behind enemy lines and bring 'em home, if you can.

As the adventure begins you find yourself drafted on your way to boot camp.
Depending on your marksmanship shown here, you are given the rank of
Private, Sergeant, or General. With each rank comes a separate mission and
a different map. After escaping from the jungle, you look at your map and
decide where to go. The Village? The Armory? Directly to the Camp? You
choose your strategy by firing at the desired location. (Remember, you
don't have winga - you must follow the paths. For example, you must cross
the bridge to get to the village.) If you get through all of the missions
by finally rescuing our 6 men and escaping to the ocean, you'll be promoted
to the rank of "HERO."

But before glory comes boot camp....

WELCOME TO BOOT CAMP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 3 ranks and 3 corresponding missions available to you. However,
you cannot simply choose your rank and mission; you must earn it. You must
prove your ability at the boot camp target range by hitting as many targets
as possible with as few misses as possible. The better you do, the higher
your rank and more challenging your mission.

Sould you be lucky enough to complete a less difficult mission, you will be
promoted and allowed to continue to the next mission.

HINTS
~~~~~
1) Hit the blue bullet clips dropped by men to replenish your own supply of
ammunition.

2) Hit the First Aid kit after it has landed on the ground to restore your
health some. You will destroy the kit and render it useless if you shoot it
while it is still in the air.

3) Get as much ammunition, rockets and health as possible.

4) Don't waste your bullets.

5) Some of the enemy need to be hit in the chest to be removed.

6) Tanks, helicopters, and submarines are destroyed with one shot if you
have rockets. If you are out, they can only be destroyed by firing many
bullets at them.

7) Although they may not be shooting at you, the tanks and helicopters do
decrease your health as they move across the screen, so shoot them down
quickly.

8) Fire your weapon between levels to speed up the RANK and MISSION
screens.

9) Get at least 75,000 points to have the option to continue your mission.

10) If you have the Dual Gun Interface and are playing with two people, it
helps to let one person play half of the screen while you take the other.

                           A BIG HINT
                           ~~~~~~~~~~
Don't go blindly from area to area, think about what you would do if you
were really there.

THE TERRAIN
~~~~~~~~~~~
JUNGLE
~~~~~~
You land and find yourself in a jungle under heavy attack. Defend yourself
by eliminating the enemy. In missions 2 and 3, snipers appear in the heavy
underbrush that give you all you can take. Don't let them get away with it!

BRIDGE
~~~~~~
Crossing the bridge is only a first step towards victory. You'd better have
a good supply of rockets and ammunition, you're going to need them to fight
off helicopters, tanks, and paratroopers. Since no First Aid kits appear on
this screen, it's also a good idea to be high on your health side.

VILLAGE
~~~~~~~
Relief of first aid appears in this scene, but you still need to worry
about the enemy, bot on the ground and in the air.

ARMORY
~~~~~~
Come here to destroy the enemy's ammo supply. After completion of this
scenario, enemy fire will have a weakened effect on your health.

SWAMP
~~~~
As usual, there are enemies galore. Be sure to get those snipers!!

RADIO TOWER
~~~~~~~~~~~
Protect your man who is going up the tower to prevent the enemy from
calling for help. You have 6 Americans to attempt the job; if you fail,
it's back to boot camp for you. If you succeed, you'll find that First Aid
kits come twice as often.

CAMP
~~~~
Here at last! This is where your markmanship is needed most. Kill off the
enemy to protect and free our hostages.

BEACH
~~~~~
You're almost home-free, but first you must survive the enemy on the beach.
you encounter the danger of missile-launching nuclear submarines here. Sink
the submarines or destroy the missiles in flight; if more than a few
missiles get by you, a dead hero is what you'll be.

Amiga 500 Light Gun Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This version of the Amiga requires the light gun be connected to the second
game port.

Amiga 1000 Light Gun Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This version of the Amiga requires the light gun to be connected to game
port 1, which is the port normally used by the mouse. Therefore, you will
have to remove your mouse and insert the light gun into the mouse port.

Amiga 2000 Light Gun Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This version of the Amiga uses the second joystick (game) port for the
light gun.

Dual Gun Interface (Twice the Fun)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Dual Gun Interface ($39.95) will allow you to connect 2 light guns so 2
people can play simultaneously. See your dealer.

For Amiga 500 & 2000 only (Not Amiga 1000 compatible).
