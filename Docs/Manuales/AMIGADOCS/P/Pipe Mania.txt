HARD DISK INSTALLATION
----------------------
Make a new folder on your hard disk called PIPE or another suitable name.
Copy the contents of your AUTO folder into the hard disk folder.  Then copy
the file PIPEDATA in as well.  These two are the only necessary files.

PLEASE NOTE:
The program can only load and save high scores to a floppy disk.
If you want to save your high scores you must have the game disk
in Drive A:. If you wish,however,you can copy the high scores onto a
blank disk of your choise. To do this insert your chosen disk into
the drive and then during the attract sequence press ALT-S. After
a warning the high scores will be written to your disk.


SECRET CODE
-----------
Certain versions of Pipe Mania require you to enter a secret code at the
beginning in order to start the game.  A screen will appear with one large
symbol, with a colour below it and seven assorted pipe sections.  You'll
use the large symbol to get the secret code from the code card.Find the
large symbol on your code card together with the colour.  Read down the
card from the large symbol until you find the line opposite the colour.
Where these two lines cross you will find three pipe sections.  Now find
the matching pipe sections on the screen and click on them in the same
order they appear on your card.  Don't lose your code card as you can't
begin the game without it.


THE GAME
--------
Pipe Mania starts on a playing grid that is empty except for the starting
piece.  The object is to score as many points as possible by construction
pipeline from the starting piece.

As you play, pipe sections appear in a dispenser to the left of the grid.
You can place a pipe section anywhere you like, whether or not it connects
with other pipe sections.  In fact, you'll learn to place pieces in a
pattern that anticipates connections five or ten moves in advance.

You can "bomb" any previously placed pipe section by placing a new section
on top of it.  The old pipe will explode and the new pipe will appear in
its place.  There is a short time delay for replacing pipes, and a 50 point
penalty.

Once a pipe piece fills with flooz, you can no longer replace it.  At the
start of higher levels advanced pipe sections and obstacles will appear
randomly on the grid.  These pieces can't be replaced by other pieces.

With each level you have a set amount of time in which to connect as many
pipe sections as possible before the flooz starts to flow.  This time
decreases as you as you progress up through the levels.  When the flooz
reaches the end of your pipeline the round is over.

Once you've placed all the pipe pieces you can (or want to), press the F
key and the flooz will speed up and end the round quickly.  You will score
double points for each additional pipe section the flooz passes enough.


ADVANCING TO THE NEXT LEVEL
---------------------------
In order to advance to the next level, the flooz must flow through a
certain number of pipes.  A counter in the upper right corner of the screen
indicates the minimum number of sections that must be connected within that
level.

The countdown starts the moment the flooz starts flowing through the
pipeline allowing you to keep track of how many sections still need to be
connected.  When the counter reaches zero, you qualify for the next level.
On higher levels things change:

* The flooz flows at a faster rate.
* Obstacles appear on the grid which you can't "bomb".
* Bonus-pieces: These earn you extra points if the flooz goes through them.
* One-way pieces: Through which the flooz can only flow in one direction.
* End pieces: In addition to achieving the required pipeline length, the 
  flooz must terminate in an end piece in order to advance to the next 
  level.
* Reservoir pieces: These slow down the flooz giving you valuable extra 
  time.
* There are sections of the grid that allow the flooz to exit one side of 
  the screen and reappear on the opposite side.


PLAYING MODES
-------------
Pipe Mania has three playing modes:  basic one-player, expert one- player
and competitive two-player.  There is also a training mode that allows you
to play any of these modes at a slower rate of flow.  In training mode it
is not possible to enter your score into the high score table.

BASIC ONE-PLAYER
Pipe sections appear in a single dispenser on the left of the screen.  You
can always see the next five sections in the dispenser.

EXPERT ONE-PLAYER
Pipe sections appear in two dispensers on the left side of the screen, one
above the other.  The pipe sections nearest the middle of the screen are
available to be placed on the grid.  You can always see the next three
sections in each dispenser.

COMPETITIVE TWO-PLAYER
As in expert mode, pipe sections in two dispensers on the left side of the
screen.  Player one uses the pipes from the top dispenser and player two
uses the pipes from the bottom one.


PIPE SECTIONS
-------------
You'll encounter a variety of pipe sections, obstacles and speciality
pieces as you progress through the levels of Pipe Mania.

BASIC SECTIONS
The seven basic pieses conduct the flooz straight, around corners and back
through itself in a loop.  Remember, the flooz flows in a straight line
unless it has no other choice.

PLAYER TWO SECTIONS
They are just like player one's pipes, except for the identifying dots
and/or colour differences, depending upon your computer system.

ONE WAY SECTIONS
The flooz can only flow in the direction of the arrow on the one way pipes.
so be careful how you use them.

START SECTIONS
Soon after the round begins, the flooz oozes out of the starting section,
identified by the letter "S", or an arrow.

END SECTIONS
On some levels, you'll find an end piece, identified by the letter "E" or
an arrow.  Try to build a pipeline that exceeds the minimum distance
required and terminates in the end piece.  When the flooz enters the end
piece, you'll earn a 1000 point bonus.  If you don't finish in the end
piece you lose that level.

OBSTACLES
You can't "bomb" them or go through them, so you'll have to go around them.
Try to construct loops with the obstacles in the centre.

RESERVOIRS
These are very useful because they buy a little extra time.  The flooz has
to fill the entire reservoir before it will flow out the other side.  Use a
reservoir before your pipeline reaches the minimum distance and earn 500
bonus points.  After that you'll earn 1000 bonus points.

BONUS SECTIONS
Build a higher score by direction the flooz into a bonus piece.  Before the
minimum distance required, each bonus piece is worth 500 points.  After the
minimum requirement, each bonus piece is worth 1000 points.

SCORING
-------
BASIC GAME SCORING
* 50 points for each section the flooz flows through until the minimum is 
  reached.
* 100 points for each extra section the flooz flows through.
* 500 points for each time the flooz crosses itself in a cross pipe 
  section.
* 500 points for each bonus or reservoir section the flooz flows through.
* 1000 points for using the end piece.
* 100 point penalty at the end of each round for each unused piece left.
* 50 point penalty for each replacement made.
* After pressing the "fast flooz" key, every pipe the flooz flows through 
  earns you double the usual point value.

EXPERT ONE PLAYER
The basic scoring as above, plus:
* 100 bonus points are given every time the flooz flows through pipe pieces 
  selected from alternating (top and bottom) dispensers.

COMPETIVE TWO PLAYER
The basic scoring as above, plus:
* Points from the flooz flow, including the 500 point bonus for cross-overs,
  are scored only by the player who placed that section.
* The 100 point penalty is taken only from the player who placed the pipe.
* The bonus piece points go to the player who placed the previous piece and 
  connected it to the bonus piece.


PLAYING TIPS
------------
* Use the training mode to become a good Pipe Mania strategist. Learn how
  to visualise the completed pipeline and place pieces accordingly.
* If you want a big score, don't be too eager to advance quickly to the 
  next level. Earn as many points as you can on each level.
* Think ahead. If you don't need a piece right away, put it where you can 
  connect it later. Blowing up pipes wastes time and valuable points.
* Use cross pipes wisely. You only get a limited number of them, and each 
  one can earn you bonus points. Make sure you place them where there's 
  room to loop back through.
* Even if you're way ahead of the flow, work fast. That way, you'll have 
  time to figure out how to fill as much of the grid as much of the grid as
  possible, alternatively you can press the "F" key to score bonus points.
