PARASOL STARS DOCS
==================

THE STORY SO FAR...
===================

After rescuing the inhabitants of Rainbow Islands in their
last hair-raising adventure, BUB and; BOB are enjoying a
well earned vacation. However, their peace is shattered
when the warmongering warrior Chaostikahn unleashes a
magma of menacing monsters throughout the universe.

With their magic parasols in hand (gifts
from the grateful Rainbow Islanders).

Bub and Bob must defeat the
monsters and free the universe.

Bub and Bob depart from Rainbow World to take on the monsters of seven 
wildly differing planets:

World One - Music World 
-----------------------
Bob and Bob must battle mutant grand
pianos/accordions, trumpets and other
musical instrurnents in this cacophony.

World Two - Woodland World
--------------------------
Seemingly innocent woodland
creatures have been warped by
Chaostikahn into deadly monsters, even
the trees have a wicked streak. 

World Three
-----------
The inhabibnts of the deep rise up at
Chaostikahn's command. Hoards of her-
mit crabs, seals and even penguins have
become aquatic assailants.

World Four Machine World
------------------------
Mechanoid madness!

World Five
----------
Every devious device from the casinos
is brought against you. One-armed
bandits, playing cards, mounds of gold
coins; even humble chessmen are making their move.

World Six - Cloud World.
------------------------
Even high above the ground Chaostikahn
prevails over all manner of flying
devices - planes, helicopters, satellites
 - are on the rampage!

World Seven - Giant World.
--------------------------
Seemingly his last stronghold,
Chaostikahn has mustered his most,
powerful forces here - giants walk this,
world - lotsof them!

World Eight - Rainbow World.
----------------------------
At last Bub and Bob return home for a
well earned rest.....if Chaostikahn
doesn't get there first.

Are there more worlds beyond these eight? Only you
can find out, and only if you can unlock the 'secret'of
the Parasol Stars!!!

STATUS AND SCORING
==================

When Bub or Bob is playing he will have a status display
at the top of the screen showing his name, how many
lives he has left and his score. 

If neither of them are playing then this space will be
occupied with the message PRESS FIRE and the number
of credits. If there are no credits left then GAME OVER 
will be displayed. If both Bub and Bob are playing then
you will not be able to see how many credits you have
until one player dies.

In the centre of the status area is a blank space where
the miracle icons will be displayed when you collect them. 

Points are scored by collecting objects and by destroy-
ing the monsters.

Every food item collected will score between 10 points
and 10,000 points. All big food items will score
100,000 points.

To get points for destroying baddies you need to throw
monsters against each other when they are paralysed
(green or blue). You get 2000 for the first monster you
destroy this way, then 4000 then 8000, doubling all the
time up to 100,000 if you destroy seven or more monsters with a 
single throw.

An extra life is awarded, after 100,000 points and then
after every 1,000,000 points.

As the food you collect becomes more valuable then
watch out for the 100 coin - it's only worth 100 points,
but it gives you an extra credit!

HOW TO PLAY    
===========
To get past each level you have to clear it of all mon-
sters before your time runs out. If it does run out the
foul Gaiko will begin its relentless pursuit from which
there is no escape!

HOW TO DESTROY THE MONSTERS 
===========================
To destroy the monsters you first have to paralyse them.
This is done by hitting them  with your parasol, or 
for the stronger monsters by throwing objects at them. 
When a monster is paralysed then it will turn green
(if Bub paralysed it) or blue (if paralysed by Bob).

When a monster is paralysed you can destroy it, either
by picking it up and throwing it against the wall, or by
throwing something else at it. 

HOW TO USE THE DRIPS AND DROPS 
==============================
Most levels have some sort of magic droplets dripping
and rolling around them. You can collect these drops on
top of your parasol and throw them at the monsters.

But best of all, if you collect five small drops on top of
your parasol they will merge to give you a mega-drop. 


There are four types of mega-drop:        

Water Drop - Unleashes a torrential cascade, washing
	     everything before it.

Fire Drop -  Forms a deadly field of fire wherever it falls!

Lightning Drop - Shoots an unstoppable bolt of
		 lightning across the world!

Star Drop - Sets off a spiral of deadly spinning stars!

HOW TO KEEP YOUR PARASOL UP 
===========================

The most important technique to master is attacking 
monsters from below.If you are standing below a mon-
ster then put your parasol up by pressing fire and hold-
ing the joystick down. Then jump by quickly moving the
joystick up. Your 'parasol willi remain up and you should
paralyse the monster. If you jump up with the parasol
up above your head then you can keep it there by
quickly moving thejoystick down whilst still pressing
fire.

HOW TO COLLECT OBJECTS
======================
You can collect objects by walking over them or by 
throwing something over them.

You can often find new objects by throwing something
over the ground.

Some objects just give you points, some give you
special powers such as:

Magic shoes - Helps you move up to twice as fast.
Hearts	    - Gives you bonus food when you finish a level.
Crooks      - Like a heart but more!
Power heart - Give you deadly powers for a limited time. 
Clock 	    - Stops time for everyone but you.
Diamond ring - Unleashes a deadly glowing star to aid you!    
Bomb 	     - Explodes with, catastrophic effect!

There are four very special items - the Miracle,lcons.
Every time you collect one of these it will appear at the
top of the screen when you have collected three you
will get a miracle. If you get three correctly then this will
open doors for you!!! The most powerful miracle icon is
the Parasol stars!

END OF PLANET 
=============
Each planet has seven levels, on the last level of each 
world there is, a special planetary guardian. This cannot
be defeated by normal means. Bub and Bob must collect the power 
flagons to give them temporary special power. If you put your parasol up 
above your head (down+fire) then you will generate droplets on it
which can be thrown at the guardian, or you can continue generating 
droplets to get a mega-drop.

HINTS AND TIPS
==============

1. Use your parasol to the full, it can be used as a weapon and as a shield. 
2. Destroy the most dangerous monsters first, remember the most dangerous 
   is not always the one that moves the fastest!     
3. Collect food, find out where food is generated when
   you throw things across the ground, use these to get
   credits as you will need them later.
4. Use the Mega-drops, especially the water, to flush
   out monsters in difficult to reach places.
5. You can jump on lots of things - drops, paralysed
   monsters and the other player's parasol. Quite often
   you need to remember this when getting out of a seemingly
   impossible situation.
6. Watch the demo mode to see how it is done by an expert! 
7. There is a way in - somewhere!
