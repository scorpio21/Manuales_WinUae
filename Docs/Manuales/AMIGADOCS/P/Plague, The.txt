                               THE PLAGUE

OPERATION ARETE

Excerpts from Chief Engineer's Logbook:

02/04/2102

All operations and experiments are under control and continue to proceed as
planned.  All genetically engineered species are in final stage of
development; final testing of species should commence in two weeks. 
Everything is proceeding without delays and shipment is still scheduled for
May, '02...

Amphibian humanoids, class PW-7, are functioning properly and exceed all
previously anticipated warfare requirements.  Their instincts have
successfully been programmed to allow for performance of specific tasks
with tremendous efficiency and discipline...  Pisces mining class PM-1 has
successfully demonstrated the ability to travel through most forms of solid
matter...  Optical Surveillance system PS-12 has proven to be far more
efficient and adaptable than mechanical systems, and is nearing final
testing stage...  Flying Reconnaissance class IF-9 are adequate in most
respects.  Development team is experiencing some difficulties

				1

with establishing chain of command and programming specific tasks... 
Psychic Warden, IW-6, is now functioning adequately, although recent
difficulties in establishing specific duties have been reported.  The
development team does not anticipate difficulties or delays...

02/23/02

All new development has ceased for this period.  Omega Testing has
commenced for all species.  Anomalies with the intelligence endowed I Class
species have been verified, but not yet corrected.  While all tasks
continue to be performed adequately, frequent reprogramming of specific
duties has been necessary.  Certain I Class species seem 'distracted' and
at times revert to old programming.  Cause for these abnormalities is still
yet unknown, but delays of shipment are not expected.  The non-intelligent,
instinct driven P Class species continue to exceed all requirements...

				2

03/27/02

We continue to experience more unexpected and so far unexplainable problems
with all I-Class species.  In addition we have now begun to experience
abnormalities with the P Class...

I Class species not only refuse to take new directives, but somehow seem to
be forming their own directives.  These new priorities and tasks are no
longer simple reversions to previous ones, but are entirely alien and
almost cruel in nature.  The source of these new directives has not yet
been determined...  Yesterday IW-6 seemed to have imagined a maintenance
technician as a threat, and slowly incinerated him.  The engineer did not
live...

The difficulties we are experiencing with P-Class are similar to those
first noted in the semi-intelligent species.  Although their instinctual
programming is still in effect, individual tasks are difficult to direct
and show evidence of serious flaws.

				3

On 03/24, Amphibian-humanoids PW-7, while performing exercises in Sector
12, became completely misdirected.  Although they performed all functions
surrounding their task perfectly, the actual task performed was not the one
intended.  Their anticipated objective was the destruction of a military
target in Sector 12.  The actual accomplishment was the destruction of Dr.
Gillen in Sector 13...

Delays are expected.

04/19/02

I no longer hesitate to call this myriad of 'abnormalities' an epidemic of
catastrophic proportions.  I question whether it is now possible to
stabilize the experiment at all.  All of our efforts are now directed
simply at trying to contain species of all types and classes.  The cause
for their chaotic and now even horrific acts are without explanation and
without precedent.  They seem to be reverting to a primeval past they never
had...

I begin to fear for the safety of the scientists and staff.

05/03/02 (Last entry received)

I have refused all requests of personnel to abandon this station.  This
epidemic, this plague, has now spread to humans.  This area should be
quarantined.  This area should be purged at all costs.

                          STARTING PLAY

Turn the computer OFF for 30 seconds and then ON to preserve the disk from
virus infection.  (Amiga 1000 users will have to use Kickstart)

Single drive users:  Insert Disk 1 in the internal drive.  The program will
prompt you for the other disk when it is required.

Multiple drive users:  Insert Disk 2 in drive df1: FIRST.  Then insert Disk
1 in internal drive.

When the title screen comes up, press the F1 key to toggle between a game
with no sound at all, with sound effects or with music.  The icon at the
top left of the screen indicates the present settings.  One musical note
indicates a game with sound effects, two notes indicate a game with music. 
A crossed note indicates not sound at all.

Press the fire button on the joystick to start the game.

				6

                             THE GAME

Your objective is a simple one: destroy everything that moves. 
accomplishing this task may not prove so simple...

You will be given three men who each have a certain amount of power.  Lives
remaining are indicated by the L on the bottom of the screen.  Power left
is indicated by the P at the bottom of the screen.  Each time the hero is
hit by an enemy his power goes down.  When all power is gone, that life is
over.

Your game is over when you lose all of your lives. If you have enough
credits left, you can continue play on the same level.  If you continue,
your score, lives and power are all reset.  You begin with three credits.

The program will remember your highest score, which will go into the
HighScore table.

				7

                      FUNDAMENTALS OF PLAY

* The hero is controlled by a joystick in Port Two.

* To jump to a platform directly above you, simultaneously push joystick
  up and press the fire button on the joystick.

* To drop down to a platform directly beneath you, simultaneously pull
  joystick down and press fire.

* Passing by a weapon's icon will cause that weapon to be taken by the
  hero.  Depending on the weapon, it will either be the one immediately
  used, or a secondary additional weapon available by special command. (See
  next page).

* Whenever a new weapon's ammo has been used up, play reverts to your 
  original blast rifle.

* Two bars on the bottom of the screen convey weapon information.  The one
  indicates shots left on special weapons.  The other bar indicates charge
  status of high power weapons (next page).

* Your score, lives and power are all indicated at the bottom of the
  screen.

* Press "P" to pause the game.

* To quit the game, press "P" followed by "ESC."

                           THE WEAPONS

The many methods for obliterating the foe...

There are six different weapon types in the game:

* Blast Rifle.  This is your hero's default weapon.  It has a fast firing
  rate and unlimited shots.

* Three-way Blaster.  Similar to the above, this weapon does not shoot as
  fast, but its fire spreads out to encompass a greater area.  Limited
  ammo.

* Three-way Laser.  Similar to the 3-way Blaster, this weapon has faster
  fire rate and shoots three bursts all perpendicular to one another.
  Limited ammo.

* Firebolt.  Press the fire button and hold it down.  A bar at the bottom
  of the screen will build up.  When it reaches its peak, release the
  button to fire this very powerful weapon.

* Laserbolt.  This is very similar to the firebolt and operates the same
  way.

* Smartbomb.  This will do critical damage to all enemies on the screen.
  To release it, quickly 'waggle' the joystick left and right or press the
  spacebar.

The two 3-way guns are weapons which temporarily replace the blaster.  The
others can be used in addition to the immediate weapon.

                        HIGH SCORE TABLE

When you've made it into the High Score table, you can enter your name
either by mouse or joystick.

When you've obtained the highest score, you will have the option to enter
your signature onto the highscore table.  You can select pen color at the
left side of the screen.  The tools to aid you in your drawing are on the
right side of the screen.  The following are the commands available:

Draw: Press the left mouse button and hold it down while drawing.  Use the
mouse to guide the pen.

Line: Press the left mouse button to set the starting point of the line. 
Press the right mouse button to draw a line to the present pointer
location.

Block: Draws a rectangle on the screen.  Again, left mouse button marks the
starting point, right button draws the box.

View: Views the drawing.

Undo: Erases the last task performed.

Clear: Clears the screen.

Done: Ends the drawing session.

The image entered will reappear in Level 3.

                  SOME TIPS FROM THE PROGRAMMERS

Watch the attack pattern of each creature closely.  For each wave of enemy
there is an optimal way for defeating them.  Find the best strategy for
destroying each enemy and you've won half the battle.

You can keep your Laserbolt and Firebolt weapons charged up near their
maximum.  Keep them near their max so you save valuable time in blowing
away the powerful enemies.

The immediate replacement weapons (3-way laser and blaster) will usually be
present when they are most needed.  But you should always show restraint in
using Smartbombs, and should try to save the charge-weapons for the
end-of-level guardians.
