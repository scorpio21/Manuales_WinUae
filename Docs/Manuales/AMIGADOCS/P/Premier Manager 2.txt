PROTECTION
~~~~~~~~~~
In your Premier Manager II box, you will find a code wheel. When the game
loads, a picture of a football strip will appear on the screen made up of a
set of shorts and a shirt. This image should be recreated on the codewheel.
Turn the outer wheel until you get a matching picture and then type in the
number that appears in the window indicated by the screen. Press return and
before you can say `Jimmy Hill' the game will load for you.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When Premier Manager was released last year, it proved to be an instant
succedd with established fans of management simulations, because of it`s
attention to detail and realism; while newcomers to the genre applauded its
playability. No doubt about it, Premier Manager was easy to get into and
the range of choices meant you could make it as easy or as hard as you
wanted.
 
It was addictive too!
 
Now Gremlin proudly presents Premier Manager 2, which takes the original
game several hundred steps further. Perhaps the only criticism you could
level at the original was that it was a little too simplistic with Premier
Manager 2, we at Gremlin feel we have produced the most comprehensive,
involved and enjoyable Football Management game ever.

Premier Manager 2 gives you even more choices, while making the game easier
to play. You`ll find you can do almost everything a real manager can except
hurl the half time cup of tea at your under achieving striker. You`ll find
yourself bargaining with your own players, offering bonuses and incentives
to improve morale and help performance. There are new in-match animated
sequences, which knock the spots off any other management sim around; plus
extensive commentaries enabling you to followe the progress of your team
adding realism and making matchday more exciting.

The extended tactics section allows everyone to tailor their team to their
favourite playing style. There is something for every football fan, whether
you`ve been a life-long Cloughie admirer, or you think Wimbledon are sadly
misunderstood you`ll find it in here.


TAKING SIDES
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the first screen you will see after loading Premier Manager.

Click the mouse in one of the panels and type in your name. Press `return'
and a team from the Conference will be allocated to you. You are only
allowed to select a team from the Conference League at this stage.

If you want to manage a different Conference side then click on the arrows
at either side of the panel to toggle through all the conference sides.

Two players can play simultaneously, clicking on the two panels to enter
their names and selecting a team. In the game, to change between plaers,
press the space bar.

Once you are happy with your chosen team, click on Continue at the foot of
the screen.


PRE SEASON FRIENDLIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can play up to 4 friendlies and the teams available will be displayed
on the screen. Click on a number at the foot of the screen and then click
on the team you wish to play. If you are not happy with the team you have
elected to play on that particular day, click on another.

Most of these games will be away from home, but if you click through the
list of teams you may find a lucrative home fixture.

Friendlies can help you organise your side for the immenent league
campaign, allowing you to get the balance right before the real season
commences. It is worth bearing in mind that you will get no revenue from
away matches and your players are just as prone to injuries and sendings
off as they would be in a league match.

WHen you have finished arranging your friendlies, click on the power button
in the corner of the screen to take you to the Main Options Screen and the
start of the game.

This screen is made up of the above thirteen icons, which make up the
various sections of the game. Some screens will be visited far more than
others, but how regularly screens are visited is largely dependent upon the
player.

There is no order in which to carry out the various options, to best
explain the game, it is easiest to take each section in order.


SQUAD SELECTION SCREEN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This screen holds all the information you need to put together your
championship winning side (or indeed make the best of a bad bunch). The
table contains the name of your squad members followed by a breakdown of
their strengths and weaknesses:

HN - Handling
TK - Tackling
PS - Passing
SH - Shooting
CR - Control
FT - Fitness

The number below these figures are scaled between 1 and 99. A player with a
score in the high 90`s is one of the best in the world, whilst a player
with a score below 10 will be lucky to get out of the conference.

Players are graded in bands, as are teams and your coaching staff. This
helps to give a broad comparison between abilities and formations as well
as between teams.

The ratings are as follows:

Fair 		*-*****
Good 		*-*****
Very Good	*-*****
Superb
Outstanding
World Class
Exceptional
The Ultimate

A side with Fair* would be totally hopeless, whilst one with an ultimate
rating (which no-one is likely to achieve) would be almost invincible. Try
to think of your local Sunday LEague side playing the Brazil team of 1970.

The first four attributes are self explanatory but Control and Fitness need
a little explaining.

Control refers to the plaers ability to bring the ball under control,
dribble the ball (when was the last time you saw that in English Football?)
and ride tackles. Players with greater control will be more successful in
these areas. Players at full fitness will have a number in the high
nineties the lower this number goes the more likely they are to pick up an
injury.

At full fitness a player will be performing to maximum ability, as his
fitness wanes you will find him less successful. You can also monitor the
recovery of injured players as their fitness level rises, but don`t be to
eager to throw them back into the fray until your sure they`re fit or they
could have a relapse.

By highlighting a player with the mouse you will bring up an information
list. This will give the usual player stats but also the number of games
played and goals scored (or conceded for your keeper) plus a breakdown of
their training schedule, age and wages; whether they are insured or not,
contract details and any disciplinary points conceded - basically,
everything you could possibly wish to know.

Below these statistics are a set of ratings for the various areas of your
team, plus an overall rating for the whole team. These will allow you to
assess the effectiveness of each area enabling you to select the
appropriate team to suit the opposition.

At the foot of the page are a set of 8 icons, Each one provides you with
different information. Clicking on each of these will do the following.

FORMATION 	-	This allows you to select one of 16 different
			formations. Will you pack the midfield, or hoof the
			ball, over the top, to your gaggle of forwards? The
			choice is yours!

SQUAD		-	This icon is to take you back to the main squad
			selection screen from any other screen in this
			section.

TACTICS		-	This allows you to select the tactics to suit your
			formation. Clicking on this ocn takes you to a 
 			further screen. The name of your chosen eleven
			appears plus a map of their current formation (you
			can still click on the formation icon to select a 
			different one if you wish). Here you should be able
			to hone your team to perfection; maximising their
			attributes and hiding their deficiencies. Place
			left footers on the left and right on the right to
			maximise their effectiveness and then brief your
			players in a selection of match strategies.

Will they mark the nearest man in a traditional fashion or will you
introduce a continental zonal system? Will you belt the ball high into the
penalty box at your big number 9, whose only talent is nutting it into the
net? Or will you sweep majestically up the pitch in neat attacking
triangles playing ball to feet? Tackling can be leg-breakingly hard (but
watch out for bookings!) medium, or soft and you can choose to walk the
ball into the net from short range or blast it from anywhere. A multitude
of possibilities should allow everyone from purist to kick-and-rush
fanatic, to field the side they want.

OPPOSITION	-	This icon gives a breakdown of your next oppenents
			and provides you with the information to provide a
			counter strategy by comparing them with your own
			side. On the day of the match it will show weather
			conditions and the name of the ref, allowing a
			final assessment of match tactics.

DATA		-	This is the `Players Match Data' Icon, you will be
			presented with a man-by-man analysis of your teams
			performance for their last game.

HEALTH		-	This icon will provide a list of any current
			injuries within your squad; with details of the
			kind of injury, estimated number of weeks out and 
			whther they are being treated or not. It will also
			give you information for any other players who are
			unavailable for selection; whether they are banned
			or are currently on international duty.

FIXTURES	-	This will provide you with a fixture list for the
			coming season. Each time you click on the icon with
			the left mouse button, a new page of fixtures will 
			appear until you reach the end of the season.
			Clicking with the right mouse button will take you 
			back a page.

Clicking on the power button will take you back to the Main Option Screen.



LEAGUE TABLES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will give you all the relevant information concerning your teams
current league performance. As well as a run down of your current league
status, press keys F1-F5 will allow you to take a look at the other
divisions. You can examine the whole range of statistics for any team in
any league by highlighting the name of the team you wish to examine and
pressing the other icons to bring up the relevant information.

The icons at the foot of the screen do the following:

TABLE		-	This will bring you back to the main League Table
			if you have chosen any of the following icons.

FORM		-	This will show you the League table split into home
			and away results, making it easier to assess any
			team`s form. The keys F1-F5 will give you a
			breakdown like this for each division.

CHART		-	This charts form through the League in a colour
			coded graph, providing a comparison with other 
			teams in the division. Yellow - A win; Green - A
			Draw; Red - A Defeat.

GRAPH		-	A graph indicating the selected team`s match by
			match position in the division.

GROUND		-	This contains loads of information about current
			squads and grounds.

PROGRESS	-	This charts the selected team`s progress week by
			week throughout the season, and gives a list of
			remaining fixtures. It runs to six pages and each
			time you click this icon with the left mouse
			button, the next page will appear. Clicking with
			the right mouse button will take you back a page.

GOALS		-	This is a list of the top goal scorers for the
			selected division, including those scored in both
			league and cup matches.

REFEREES	-	This gives a run down of the referees in the
			division, giving stats for age, red and yellow
			cards, matches refereed and total disciplinary
			points. Useful information and can help you decide
			whether those bitingly hard tackles you`d planned
			for you next game are likely to go unnoticed or
			not.


TELEPHONE
~~~~~~~~~
This screen allows you to keep in contact with each member of your staff,
giving you all the information you need to pick the most effective team.

When you first enter this screen most of the numbers will be blank; in
order to fill the vacancies you need to ring the Job Centre.

JOB CENTRE
~~~~~~~~~~
By clicking on the Job Centre on the pad next to the phone, you will be
taken to a screen displaying information about your current staff, including
their current weekly wages and their rating. The higher the rating, the
higher the wage, but they will be more effective.

If you wish to sack a member of staff, click on their name with either
mouse button, you will then be asked if you really want to sack them, just
type `Y' and their name will be removed from the screen.

Below your current staff, is a list of those available for work. To hire
someone click on the name of that individual with the left mouse button.

When you hire or fire any staff, you will have to pay them a fee roughly
equivalent to two months wages. Think carefully before making changes to
your backroom staff, mistakes could prove costly.

Finally, at the bottom of this screen will appear, from time to time any
other management appointments. As the season progresses, you will discover
some managers either retire or are given their marching orders (no doubt
after the dreaded `Vote of Confidence' from the board). You will receive a
fax notifying you that the manager of a team has been sacked.If you wish
you can apply for the position by clicking on the job with the left mouse
button. A `Y' will now appear next to the job, showing you that you have
applied for it.

You may only apply for one job at a time. If you are successful you will be
offered a new contract with your new club which you can accept or decline.
If you are unsuccessful you will receive a fax informing you to that
affect.

Another word of caution. If you are consistently turned down for job after
job, your directors will seriously begin to lose confidence in you. It may
end up being your job people are applying for.

Finally, your staff, like your players, receive a rating. The better the
rating the better that member of staff. Better coaches will be able to
improve your players faster, a better physio will be able to attend to more
injuries etc.


COACHES
~~~~~~~
Ringing your coaches will enable you to allocate trainging routines to each
individual player. You can train players in any of their abilities by
clicking on the training type at the end of the line. You can also choose
whether you wish to train them genrally (useful if that player is a good
all round `utility' squadman) or even fitness for those who don`t appear to
be going to bed as early as instructed.

You can also set the intensity of the training. The harder you work your
players, the faster they will improve, but be careful they will pick up far
more training ground injuries if you`re flogging them.

INSURANCE
~~~~~~~~~
You can insure your players against injury by ringing the Insurance
Company. There are three groups of insurance available:

GROUP 1		-	Which is the cheapest, will pay the players wages
			for you if they become injured.

GROUP 2 	-	Will pay their treatment fee as well.

GROUP 3 	- 	Will also pay you a cash sum by way of compensation
			for an injury. Compensation will also be paid if
			any player retires due to injury.

The premiums of group 3 are far higher but it may be worth your while
insuring at least one or two star players in this band. You do not have to
insure all, or indeed any, of your players.

At the end of the season the insurance company will work out if it has made
a profit or a loss. If you have proved a financial burden, with your crocks
eleven never out of Lillishall, you will find your premiums increasing.


PHYSIOTHERAPIST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This number will put you through to your physio. Here you can decide in
which manner you wish to treat injured players. Players with long term
injuries will be better off going to Hospital or Lillishall, which are more
expensive but will ensure a more speedy recovery. Depending on their
rating, your Physio will only be able to look after a  certain amount of
injuries at any one time. Any injured player not receiving treatment will
still get better, but nowhere near as quickly.


SCOUT
~~~~~
You can instruct your scout to look for players from here. A scout will
only be able to look for a player with an ability rating as high, or lower
than, his own. He will also be limited to what divisions he can search in..

Click on any of the `Searching For' categories to alter them and in time,
your scout will find any players that meet your specifications. For 
example, if you send your scout to look for a shooting skill of Good *****
in the Second Division, then ringing him a couple of weeks later will give
you the detials of any players in this category. Clicking on a players 
name now, will enable you to make an offer for him, but remember that these
players are not for sale, and so a club may want over twice their actual
market value before they will consider selling them.


YOUTH TEAM COACH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your Youth team coach will look for players to promote to the first team if
you specify which skill you are looking for. The youth team coach will fax
you when he has found a suitable player. You can then return to this
screen, examine the player, and determine whether to promote him to the
senior squad or not.


CLUB SECRETARY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finally for a resume of your standings you can give the Club Secretary a
ring. She will tell you, the weather and current confidence ratings with
the boards and fans, as well as your own manager rating. As a season
progresses you will find these numbers fluctuating. The board are generally
only interested in how financially viable the club is while the supporters
demand success at any cost. You`ll do well to keep them both happy.

This is also the screen to go to if you wish, for any reason to resign.
Simply click on the resignation letter on the secretary`s desk, and when
prompted press `Y'. This will take you to the start of a new game. In the
two player game mode, one of the players can resign, allowing the other to
continue playing. Quite useful if one of you has to leave but the other
wants to play all night. (The game can be saved before resignation of
course, allowing who ever resigned to continue later)


PLAYERS
~~~~~~~
Halfway down the right hand side of the pad is a page marker. Clicking on
this will enable you to turn the page and get a list of your players
allowing you to phone any of them. You can offer them new contracts, offer
them incentive bonuses and, for the more ruthless amongst you, sack the
hopeless ones. To ring a player click on their name and you`ll be taken to
a business screen.

It is wise to make sure all your players are under contract as those who
are not will leave as soon as a better offer comes in.

Players out of contract with other clubs will fax you and then leave their
numbers here if they, want to sign for you. Ring them as you would a normal
player and decide whether or not to sign them.


SPONSORSHIPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This icon will take you to your ground. At the bottom left of the screen,
below the picture of your ground, is a list of the available sponsors. It
will also show the number of weeks for which this particular company wish
to advertise and how much they will pay.

To fill up your advertising boards, click on the sponsor and, if there is
room, their name will appear in the boards surrounding your pitch.

There are four sections of advertising space; North, South, East and West
and sponsors bid for boards on each side. The ends facing the home
supporters are more desirable and easier to fill. When you begin the game,
you will not have enough sponsors to fill all the boards, so just take
whatever`s going. Remember, short term sponsors tend to pay better but need
updating more frequently. If you are successful, you will find competition
for the board increasing.

To run through the sponsors before selecting them, click on the arrows at
either side of the sponsors logo. Some of them will be offering a lump sum
one-off payment whilst others will be offering weekly installments. If you
need a quick injection of cash, take the one-off payments, although those
paying weekly tend to offer more money over all and will provide a steady
cash flow. 

At the bottom right of the screen is a list of the four sides of your
ground and the number of free boards. Click on any of these to give a list
of sponsors available.

Your advertising boards can be increased by builiding a covering on your
stadium (see Ground Improvements) enabling people to advertise on the eves
of the covering as well as around the pitch.


GROUND IMPROVEMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With the Taylor report, ground improvements have become a necessity for the
whole, rather than a luxury for the few. This screen will enable you to
improve your ground and enable you to enjoy the full range of benefits, a
fully modernised ground offers. (one of which appears to be relegation - ask
any Wolves fan over the age of 25!)

Be careful though. Can you afford to build an extra thousand seats? Or do
you need to splash out on a new defender? On the other hand can you afford
not to cover your stadium when you weigh up the increase in revenue this
will bring from advertising?

The screen is basically divided in half, with a picture of the currently
highlighted side of the ground (North, South, East, West) in the top half
of the screen is the Ground Improvements Menu, showing the various
improvements you can make to your ground.

There are a variety of improvements you can make that will indirectly help
your club;

Terracing/Seating	-	Without wishing to go into too much detail,
				these ground improvements will affect your
				club in a number of different ways. Fans
				are more likely to be enticed to a covered,
				all seater stadium with good facilities
				than they are to an exposed grassy knoll
				with a hot-dog stand.
				Improvements to the ground will bring in
				more supporters, particularly if you are
				successful and this will generate more
				advertisers. Remember also, that you can
				charge people more for sitting than for
				standing on the terraces. You can increae
				your seating, or terracing by increments of
				1,000. You can also upgrade seats.

Covering		-	Even a basic covering will entice more fans
				but it will, more importantly, double the
				amount of advertising boards and boost your
				revenue.

Please note that when working on any part of the ground, for the above
options, capacity for that part will be reduced to just 12% of normal until
the improvement has been completed.

Facilities		-	This will increase the amount of
				miscellaneous sales you make at each game.

Supporters Club		-	This will increase the level or hard-core
				support at your matches: people who will
				come and watch no matter what the weather,
				nor how bad the football - mad, basically.
				Like the time I stood on Mansfield Towns`s
				terracing during a January blizzard...

Soil Heating		-	This will enable you to play games
				throughout the winter months, that would
				have otherwise been postponed. This will
				save you money and leave your season less
				congested at the end.

Floodlights/Scoreboard	-	Generally improve the overall quality of
				your facilities.

Car Park		-	Expensive, but will make your ground
				accessible to a far greater number of
				people, again, increasing the attendance.

Safety			-	This will improve the safety rating of your
				ground. The FA are keen to fine those whose
				rating is too low. Visits from their
				inspectors can prove costly. Be warned!

				To make an improvement. Click on the
				improvement. The kind of improvement
				available with that the option will appear
				and if you wish to make the improvement,
				press the `Build The Improvement' Panel.

				If you wish to rename any part of the
				Ground simply click ob the appropriate side
				(North, South, East or West) with the right
				mouse button, and type in the new name. Go
				for either authenticity; `The Kop', `North
				Bank', `Stretford End' or, the not so
				authentic; Bucks Fizz Memorial Stand, Darth
				Vader Away End, The Coronation Street
				Terrace etc. It`s up to you.


CLUB FINANCES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Everything you need to know about the financial status of your club. The
first screen is a daily club bank statement giving you a breakdown of all
the transactions that have taken place during that day with a daily +/-
total at the bottom. It is here you will find the disastrous effects of
signing that star striker, or be able to bask in your marketing glory, at
the amount of advertising you have sold (won`t the board be pleased!).

Football is a business and, if you`re anything like me, you`ll quiver with
fear when you see the state of your finances towards the end of the season.
You`ll hear yourself asking where the stay-away fans are, as your teams
rise to glory is not mirrored by a suitable increase in loyal supporters.
Then again, maybe it will be.

The icons at the foot of the page will let you access the following
information.

STATEMENT	-	This icon takes you back into the Daily Bank
			statement from any other screen.

STATEMENTS	-	Yearly Bank Statement. This allows you to keep a
			track of your current spending and income. You will
			be able to see everything from Club wages, to just
			what your loyal fans have parted with to buy club
			merchandise (Miscellaneous Sales),

LOAN		-	Loan Screen. This will give you a breakdown of your
			club finances in relation to any loans you have
			outstanding. You may be allowed up to 4 loans at
			the banks discretion, who will be keen to see that
			you are able to make the repayments.

LOAN TICK	-	Apply for a loan. Click here to apply for a loan.
			Type in the length of time you wish to borrow the 
                        money for. Press `Return' and then type in the
			amount you wish to borrow. Press `Return' again and
			you will be told whether you were successful in
			your application - or not!

It is important to note at this point that when the loan period expires,
you will be expected to make repayment, in full, plus interest! You would
be advised to budget for this eventuality. We can all learn the valuable
lesson that borrowing money is never cheap (I didn`t).

WAGES		-	Players Wages. Allows you to see, at a glance, the
			comparable salaries of your playing staff. Are you,
			as you suspected paying over the odds for that
			useless lump, who hasn`t scored for two years and
			keeps getting injured? I thought so.

TICKET		-	Club Ticket Prices. This allows you to alter the
			ticket price for both seats and terracing. You can
			also charge a different entrance fee for Cup 
			Matches. Punish those stay away fans for daring to
                        ignore your rising stars by doubling the admission
			price for cup games. (Only of use of course if
			you`ve got a cup-run.)

			At the foot of the screen are three attendance
			charts, which allow you to follow the fluctuations 
 			in attendance for terracing/seating and the total
			gate. You will also find a seasonal average league
			attendance, for these three areas on this screen.

BOARD		-	Pitch Advertisement Boards. This gives you a
			breakdown of the current sponsorship situation for
   			your club. Each screen holds information for two
			sides of the ground showing, current sponsors,
			sponsors available, number of boards free and the
			number of weeks they are booked for. Click on this
			icon again to see the other half of your ground.

GROUND		-	Ground Information Screen. This gives you all the
			details of your ground. It tells you what
			improvements are being made, how long they will
			take to complete and the current status of all your
			facilities. You will also receive an overall ground
			rating as a percentage. The better the ground, the
			higher the percentage.


FAX MACHINE
~~~~~~~~~~~
This section gives you news update and information concerning grants,
fines, injuries and transfers. If someone wishes to contact you, they will
leave a fax and by going to the telephone you can ring them on the
appropriate number. Various members of staff may contact you here from time
to time.

When a fax has arrived, the words `fax In' will appear on this icon in the
Main Menu Screen.

The Fax machine also gives you the information about forthcoming fixtures
as well as results from the last round of League Matches. By pressing
F1-F5, whilst in these options, you can see the results/fixtures for teams
in any Division...

Finally, you can also get a breakdown of your last match showing how long
you had possession, shots, goals, passes etc. You can judge the
effectiveness of your formation and selections. Where you lucky? Or, was
you robbed?


TRANSFER MARKET
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is where the main transfer action takes place. Clicking on this icon
will take you to a screen where you will find a list of all the players
currently for sale. As the season progresses you will find the number of
players available for sale decreasing. Buy early or strengthen your squad
for the end of season run in? It may help you to make a regular check of
these screens as new players are coming onto the market all the time and it
is possible to get a bargain - if you look hard enough.

Clicking on the first icon will take you through the pages of players
available for tansfer. It will also take you back to this screen from
anywhere alse in this menu.


Magnifying Glass-	This allows you to examine the attributes of any
			particular player you may wish to buy. Click on the
			player you wish to look at, and then click on this
			icon to bring up your scout`s report on the player.
			(Remember, no scout, no report) The scout will
			provide you with a general guide to the player`s
			age, form and abilities, but will also give you an
			estimated Transfer Fee and Signing on Fee.


If you decide to bid for a player, click on the BUY icon after selecting
the player you wish to sign. The computer will invite you to make your bid.
You must offer the club a fee, unless the player is out of contract (out of
contract players can be a real bargain) and offer the player a signing on
fee, weekly wage and contract length. You not only have to satisfy the
club, but also the ambitions of the player himself. Young players,
particularly those under 20, will not sign a long contract with your club
(they have their career ahead of them after all) so offer them contracts of
only 1 or 2 years to be sure of signing them. Conversely, battle hardened
veterans of the John Wark/Kevin Moran variety (that`s over 30 to you) will
hold out for a long contract in order to see them through their twilight
playing years.

After you have made your bid, press `Return' and you will be informed
whether your bid has been successful or not. If you are successful, go to
your squad selection screen and you will find your new signing appears in
the list.

Selling A Player. If you wish to off load some deadwood or need to raise
some cash by selling your best player, click on this icon. You will see a
list of your squad, with appropriate valuations for your players down the
right hand side. Click on the player you wish to sell and the computer will
inform you if any bids were made. If there were any, highlight the offer
you wish to accept and click the tick icon. To reject all offers click the
cross. In some circumstances your player may refuse to go because the
personal details in the contract are not satisfactory. If this happens ...
Tough! (Try selling him again in a few weeks or, if he really is that bad,
sack him.)


THE CUPS
~~~~~~~~
This screen will give you all the information of upcoming Cup matches in
all competitions. Each competition is represented by an icon at the foot of
the screen, which run from left to right as follows;
THE FA CUP, THE LEAGUE CUP, THE EUROPEAN CUP, THE CUP WINNERS CUP, THE UEFA
CUP, THE CHARITY SHIELD.

Clicking on the icon will bring up the next round of matches. If your team
is playing in any competition, the fixture will be highlighted.

All competitions follow their real world rules. For example the Champions
Cup is played on a League basis after the first two rounds.


SAVING AND LOADING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This screen allows you to save a game to, or load one from floppy. Insert a
floppy disk into your disk drive before you select this option. 
                   DO NOT FORMAT ANY OF YOUR GAME DISKS

As a special formatting method is used, you must use the in-game formatting
option to make a `Saved Game Disk'. Click on the `format disk' icon and
follow any on screen instructions.

To save a game, click on the `Save' icon (you can get 2 saves per floppy
disk and 4 saves for hard disk users) and follow the on screen prompts.

Likewise, to load a game insert the `Saved Game disk' before selecting this
icon in the main menu, click on the `Load Game' icon and follow the on
screen instructions.

The final icon, DFO, is the default save for floppy users, and will
challenge automatically for hard disk users. Click on the icon with the
left mouse button to go through the available drives (DFO, DF1, DF2, and
DF3). Clicking with the right mouse button will call up a directory of the
current drive (except when the game is on hard disk)


PLAYING THE MATCH!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So you`ve selected your best 11, given them their final briefing, and
picked your subs. There is nothing left for it but to get them out there
and watch them perform...or not!

When you are as ready as you ever can be, clicking on this icon will take
you to the start of your next match. You will be told if you have selected
a valid team, with valid substitutes. If you have not, you can return to
the Squad menu and make the appropriate changes. If for some reason you are
unable to field a full side and reserves, replace the invalid player with
one of the blank strips. (You could always `dig deep' and buy a new player
of course).

Once your team is valid, you can start the match. Click on the `Match'
command at the foot of the screen and the game will begin. The screen will
look like this:

The top section of the panel gives you the current score, the position of
the ball (which will slide up and down the bar towards either goal) and a
commentary of the play.

The two panels down either side hold details of the scorers and any
bookings, sendings off or injuries that have taken place.

The central panel gives a breakdown of the match play so far, allowing you
to assess the effectiveness of your chosen strategy. This also contains
details for the weather and the amount of time elapsed.

When a player takes a shot, an animated sequence will appear showing the
outcome.

There are six speeds at which you can wactch the game. The slower speeds
allow you to follow the game closely, establishing the performance for
individual team members, whilst the quicker speeds allow you to rush
through a game quickly. The slower speeds are more useful at the start of
the season to assess your squad but, with the extensive commentary and
animated goal mouth action, they do make big matches particularly
nail-biting.

At half-time, or at any time you press `Sub' on the bar at the bottom,
click any mouse button and you will be taken to a screen that looks similar
to the Squad selection screen.

This screen only holds details for your team and subs. From here you can
make substitutions and change formation or tactics (as you would in the
squad selection screen). You can also get a breakdown of each players
performance by clicking this icon. This screen will tell you how many
minutes each player has had the ball and the amount and effectiveness of
shots/passes/tackles. Clicking on the similar icon with the red player will
give you the same information for the opposition.

Click on the power button to take you back to the match.

When a match is completed, click either mouse button to take you to the
results screen.

You can examine results for any/all leagues and cups, by pressing the
appropriate icon. When you are happy click the power button to return to
the main menu.

GAME OPTIONS SCREEN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click on this icon and you will be taken to a screen allowing you to turn
on match reports for any games in any competition. Just click on any of the
options to turn them on/off.

When you enter your play match screen any reports you have currently turned
on, will appear before you play your game. Click on the `Next' to take you
through each report in turn. When you have seen all the reports, or just
had enough of them, click on `Exit' and your match will commence.

Real statistics junkies can see reports for every game in every competition
....phew!

To de-activate the reports, simply click the option a second time.

Finally, for all you people out there with a printer, by pressing the `P'
key. While on the main menu screen, you will be presented with another list
of options, which will allow you to print out reports from certain areas of
the game. Unfortunately this option is only available to users who are
playing from hard disk and 2 meg of memory. This is due to the nature of
Premier Manager which, due to the enormous amount of data used, is very
memory demanding.

WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT THEN TREVOR?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That`s basically all you need to know to play the most exciting and
involved football management game going. There are a few other touches -
watch out for the Manager of the Month Award - that may help in the job
hunt and there is a cash bonus too - and does your club secretary always
look like the Mona Lisa or does she cheer up when things are going well -
who can say?

Just a few words of advice. Firstly, don`t expect to find a magic formula a
la Premier Manager 1. If you play the same formation and tactics, week in,
week out, you`ll never win promotion. Instead check out the oppositions
tactics and from your resources build a counter strategy!

Secondly, pay careful attention to your players fitness. Good squads rather
than good teams win championships these days. Low fitness ratings for your
player could see them earn a hiding from potential pushovers. You`ll see
just how much that season in Europe takes out of your squad.

Finally, if your playing Premier Manager 2 on an Amiga with 1.5 megs,
you`ll benefit from some spectacular enhanced sound effects.

                                GOOD LUCK!
