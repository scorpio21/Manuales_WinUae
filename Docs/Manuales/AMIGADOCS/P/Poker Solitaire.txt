6                         GETTING A QUICK START
7
8   Make sure that the WRITE PROTECT tab on your
9   disk is in the READ/WRITE position.  Insert the
10  POKER SOLITAIRE disk in your Amiga when work-
11  bench is requested or insert it, and warm boot and
12  you're off !  Use the mouse to position cards ...
13  Good Luck !  If you need a little more more help please
14  read on ...
15
16  POKER SOLITAIRE runs on any Amiga
17  with Kickstart 1.2 or later and at least 512K of
18  memory.
19
20  POKER SOLITAIRE is designed to take full
21  advantage of the mouse interface so insure that your
22  mouse is installed in the game port on your comput-
23  er.
24
25  BEFORE YOU START WE RECOMMEND THAT 
26  YOU MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF POKER SOLI-
27  TAIRE.  THE GAME DISK IS NOT COPY PRO-
28  TECTED !!  ANY COPY PROGRAM WILL WORK.
29
30
31                             MAKE A BACKUP
32
33  Use any copy program or use DISKCOPY pro-
34  vided in your workbench disk.  If you need help
35  making a copy please refer to your Amiga manual.
36  Once you have made a copy put the original in a safe
37  place and you are ready to begin.

6   Turn on your Amiga and install Kickstart 1.2
7   (this is done automatically on the Amiga 500 and
8   Amiga 2000) like you normally do.  When the system
9   requests Workbench, insert POKER SOLITAIRE in
10  the internal disk drive and it will boot automatically.
11
12  If your Amiga is already on, use the warm reboot
13  process to start Poker Solitaire, i.e.  Insert the
14  POKER SOLITAIRE disk in your internal drive then
15  press the CTRL key and the left and right Amiga
16  keys all at the same time.  Your game will automati-
17  cally startup.
18
19  After several seconds the start-up/credits screen
20  will appear showing game credits.  (Strike any key to
21  shorten startup.)  A few seconds more and you will
22  be requested to locate and enter a verification key
23  word from your manual (this is it).  Sorry about the
24  Keyword requirement but it appears that this is ne-
25  cessary to slow down the pirates.  Simply use your
26  manual to look up the requested keyword on the ap-
27  propriate page number, line number and word posi-
28  tion and enter it in the requester on the title screen.
29  Example:  Line 21, Page 2, Word 2 is "AND".
30
31  After pressing return the VOICE selection screen
32  will appear offering you a choice of MALE, FE-
33  MALE, or NONE.  To select the voice simply move
34  the mouse pointer into the appropriate box and click
35  the left button.  Selecting none will reduce the game
36  loading time considerably although game play is en-
37  hanced with male or female voices.  You can change
38  the voice any time during the game.

7
8
9   Form the best 5 card stud poker hand in each of 5
10  rows, 5 columns and 2 diagonals for a total of 12
11  hands.  Since each hand may be dependent on anoth-
12  er place cards so that you can form good hands in
13  both rows and columns.  Hand values are based on
14  standard poker hands, which are covered in detail in
15  a later section of this manual.
16
17                        GAME PLAY
18
19  After the game begins a screen appears with a 
20  series of rectangles on the left side and the score-
21  board - card deck (in blue) on the right.  Play begins
22  by placing the top card from the deck into one of the
23  rectangle on the game board.  This is done by posi-
24  tioning the mouse pointer in the desired rectangle
25  and pressing the left mouse button.  The card will
26  move from the deck to the selected position.  Once
27  played, a card cannot be moved.  Continue in this
28  manner placing cards to form the best hands in the
29  rows (horizontal), columns (vertical) and diagonals.
30
31  When all 25 cards are played, the 12 hands are
32  all evaluated automatically.  As each hand is evaluat-
33  ed the value (Flush, Full House, etc.) and total
34  points accumulated are displayed on the scoreboard.
35  If you choose a voice the value of the hand will be
36  spoken as well as displayed.  For more information
37  on voices see the manual section Voices Menu.  Upon
38  completion of the evaluation sequence your high

				3

1   game (current) score is shown.  If it is among the
2   top ten all time high scores, the High Scores window
3   will appear with a place for you to enter your ini-
4   tials.  After you enter your initials, click the small
5   (close window) box in the corner of the screen to
6   record your score (this may take a few seconds) and
7   continue game play.  (You can view high scores by
8   selecting the View Scores choice under the Project
9   Menu.)  Click the mouse in the Click Here to Contin-
10  ue box in order to begin a new game.
11
12                 TWO PLAYER GAME PLAY

14  This mode is activated by choosing the PLAYER
15  Menu and selecting the 2 Player option.  A check
16  mark will appear when the menu is properly chosen.
17  The 2 player option may be chosen any time a new-
18  hand is started.  Once the 2 Player mode is activated
19  the play progresses as follows:
20
21  Player 1 positions his first card on the game
22  board using the mouse as previously described.
23  Upon placing the card, play switches to Player 2
24  who then positions the same card wherever they
25  choose.  Play continue in this fashion until all 25
26  cards are played.
27
28  When all 25 cards are played the hands are eval-
29  uated as previously described, first for Player 2 then
30  for Player 1.  High scores are recorded if they are
31  better than the top ten and the winning player # is
32  displayed on the screen.  Click the mouse in the 
33  Click to Continue box to begin a new game.
34
35          TIMED PLAY - Experts Only !

37  This mode is activated by selecting the MODE

3   onds.  If you finish ahead of the clock you are re-
4   warded with 2 bonus points for every second left on
5   the clock.  If you run into overtime your score is
6   penalized 2 points for every second over eighty.

14  dow.  To play, place your bet by positioning the
15  mouse pointer in the appropriate betting box and
16  clicking the left mouse button the amount will be

9
10  There are three modes of game play, NORMAL,
11  TIMED, and GAMBLE.  The latter two are only
12  available in the one player game.  NORMAL is the
13  standard game of Poker Solitaire.
14
15  The TIMED mode selection pits you against the
16  clock.  The clock starts at 80 seconds, for every sec-
17  ond remaining after all 25 cards are played you re-
18  ceive 2 points, for every second over 80 you are
19  penalized 2 points.

21  The GAMBLE mode selection allows you to use your 
22  skill and a little of Lady Luck's help to beat the sys-
23  tem.  Who know's Poker Solitaire may be a Casi-
24  no hit someday ..  All you have to do is score better
25  than 120 points per game and you're in the Money !

32  be made any time during play of the game.
33  Note: Changing the voice from to MALE or FEMALE
34  will suspend game play for approximately 20-30 sec-
35  onds while the voice loads.  This may be a good time
36  for another cup of java, a soda, or a brewski.

13  No combination of cards worth anything.

18  suites, such as two aces or two 5's.

34  be arranged in an ascending or descending order.
35  Example: You have a 2, a 6, a 4, a 3, and a 5 in a
