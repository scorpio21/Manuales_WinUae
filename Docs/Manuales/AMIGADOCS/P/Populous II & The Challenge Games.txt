                 Populous II: The Challenge Games Docs



WELCOME TO THE CHALLENGE GAMES
==============================
The Populous II: The Challenge Games data disk is really two games in one.


THE CHALLENGE GAMES

The Challenge Games are 42 special worlds that put your strategic expertise
and knowledge of the game to the test.

In the original Populous II, your ultimate goal was always conquest - to help
your people prosper and to destroy their enemies. In the Challenge Games,
your goal is not conquest but survival. Your followers are faced with a
specific threat - tidal waves, burning forests, hurrican winds - and it's
down to you to help them. You must save a certain percentage of your
population in order to win.

Sound easy? There are catches. In each challenge world your arsenal of
miraculous powers is somewhat depleted. In other words, you have only a
limited number of Divine Interventions Commands you can use. Your peoples
survival depends entirely on how creative you are with the few commands at
your disposal.

You are also limited by time. Your time limit varies with each world, but at
best you'll only get a minute or two to save your people. Not only do you
have to be smart, you have to act fast!

                                   - 03 -

The first five challenge worlds are tutorials, designed to introduce you to
the new concept of the Challenge Games. While the tutorials are pretty easy,
you'll find that the 37 worlds that follow become increasingly difficult. Can
you survive as a deity until the very end? Only the fates can fortell.


500 NEW WORLDS

In addition to the Challenge Games, 500 new worlds have created for the data
disk, complete with new "Shogun" graphics and a new Command called Fire Burst.
As in the original Populous II, these worlds can be played randomly or as part
of a Conquest "series".

THE NEXT CONQUEST SCREEN

When you see the Next Conquest screen, the first thing you should do is
left-click on the Show Level details option. This option provides you with
hints about your people's predicament and the challenge facing you as a
deity.

Next you should note which Divine Intervention Commands are available to you.
Left-click on any options you're unsure about. With the exception of one new
command, all of the commands are identical with those in Populous II. Be
aware that the icons for Place Pala Magnet and Perseus are different, though
their functions remain exactly the same.

                                   - 07 -


Note which special parameters are in effect - for example, it's important to
know whether you can raise or lower land. Also check what percentage of your
population you need to save in order to win the challenge.

When you're ready to start the game, left-click on Proceed.


THE TIME CLOCK

The Time Clock is an element used specifically in the Challenge Games. The
shaded area represents time gone by. It starts at the bottom of the screen
and rotates anti-clockwise until it returns to its starting line - at which
point the game is over.

                                   - 08 -


GAME RESULTS SCREEN

The Game Results screen tells you what percentage of your original population
you needed to save in order to win, and what percentage of your original
population you actually did save.

If you were skilfull enough to win the challenge, this screen tells you the
name of the world where the next challenge will take place. Always write down
the name of the next world in the Challenge series - you'll need it if you
decide to quit the game and play some other time.


FIRE BURST - A NEW DIVINE INTERVENTION!

Fire Burst sends out streams of divine fire out from your Leader. These
streams travel in a wide radius and kill any human populations they hit,
including heroes. The fire will burn both friends and foes alike, so make
sure your leader is nowhere near your own people when using this Command.

To use this command, you must already have made a Leader using the Go To Pala
Magnet Command.
