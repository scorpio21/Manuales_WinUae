 The Aim of the game!
---------------------- 
  
  Defeat each of your opponent's over a 15 round fight to win.
 
  In the two player game You and a friend play head to head against
eachother!
 
  In one player mode you are placed against five of the world's 
greatest boxer's: Easy Eddie, Corrupt gfx-Mike (i.e. if you got either
the Skid Row or FairLight version!), Tricky Tim, Tough Ted, Killer Kev.
You must defeat all five opponent's to become the Boxing Champion of the
World. 
 
  Pro Boxing is an extremely accurate simulation! 
Of all official boxing moves are allowed including jabs, body punches 
and uppercuts! However, it is also possible to use a few unofficial 
boxing moves including Kicks, Headbutts and groin punches! 
Use these moves wisely, the referee only has to catch you three times
and you will be disqualified.

  Hints and tips!
-------------------
 Work out your opponents weaknesses.
The referee doesn't see much when he is asleep!
Ignore the crys from the crowd. 
 
 That's it. But who needs to know a lot for a lame game like this.
