			THE PRESIDENT IS MISSING

			  " Read this First!"

                         - IMPORTANT ADDENDUM -
                            
                               for the

                            Amiga Version
                             
                                 of

                       THE PRESIDENT IS MISSING

Congratulations! Because of its advanced design, your AMIGA version of "The
President Is Missing!" is going to allow you to solve this diabolical
mystery in a much easier fashion.

Please read the enclosed IBM PC documentation in order to familiarize
yourself with the game play features, but disregard the command prompts.
The principle differences between the AMIGA and the IBM PC versions are due
to the use of the MOUSE and ICON system enhancements available on the
Amiga.

The MAIN MENU option has been replaced by a selection of five OPTION ICONS
which are located in the lower portion of the display. Select the required
ICON; it will be highlighted and the appropriate option or information will
appear. All interaction is via a fully implemented WINDOW/ICON environment.

GETTING STARTED:

To load "The President is Missing!" on your Amiga, carry out the following
procedure:

	a) Turn on your computer.
	b) Install Kickstart (not necessary on Amiga 500).
	c) Place "The President Is MIssing!" disk in the disk drive and it
           will automatically load.

After the introductory loading sequence, press any key and you will be
prompted to establish a security access file. Please follow the screen
prompts.

It is advised that the investigator study the GUIDE, which is available via
one of the OPTION ICONS, in order to become fully conversant with the
S.I.S. as implemented on the AMIGA. The GUIDE is also a very helpful
reference during the course of your investigation.

Good Luck! The safety of the free world is in your hands!

			     - PROLOGUE -

                               DAY ZERO

The President Is Missing and presumed kidnapped by persons with hostile
intent towards the United States of America.

With these words, an adventure of global proportions and diabolic intrigue
begins.

On June 6, 1996, in the smallest country in Europe the largest terrorist
action ever conceived was flawlessly executed and within minutes the
President and the leaders of ten nations of Europe were abducted.

Where they were taken, by whom, and whether they are safe, no one can say.

An unidentified voice on tape claiming responsibility and issuing a list of
impossible demands is only the starting point in an investigation of
unprecedented dimension.

The case of characters ranges from the most powerful figures in Washington
to most dangerous figures in terrorism.

The Vice-President - He must take the helm at the most critical period in
U.S. history, but does the real power rest with the White House Chief of
Staff?

The Director of the C.I.A. - He planned the security for the meeting of the
Heads of State. Was he criminally negligent or is there a traitor in his
midst?

The Head of Libya's Secret Army - Is this charismatic and deadly man
organizing all the world's terrorist groups into an invincible, invisible
army capable of an act of this magnitude, or is there more than meets the
eyes to this mysterious leader?

The Secretary of Defense - He wants full-scale military action now! But
against who? And is he prepared to sacrifice the lives of all the hostages
to inact his vengeance?

The Secretary of State - He is not even a member of the President's inner
circle, but it's his job to find the hostages before the world goes over
the brink.

A special independent investigator is appointed by the Secretary to plow
through the haystack of evidence and find the needle of truth.

You are the investigator. The world is in your hands.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your Executive Commission:

	1. Examine the dossiers.

	2. Study the aerial and satellite photos.

	3. Control eight field agents who can go undercover     	   
           anywhere in the world.

	4. Listen very carefully to the audio evidence tape to
 	   discover its secrets.

	5. Decipher the coded messages that may hold the  ultimate truth.

	6. Monitor the events of a world crumbling into chaos.

	7. Remember your independence: No one is above suspicion.

	       The Investigative Methodology
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	1. Study the official report on the abduction of the     	   
	   President of the United States found in the document
 	   files. Note the principals involved, the locations,
 	   and the timetables and equipment referred to. Look for discrepancies 
           or weaknesses in the security system.

	2. Open your case file and begin your report with your
 	   facts and conclusions regarding the official report
 	   and the events therein.

	3. Listen to the acoustic intelligence collected on
 	   audio tape. Each piece of information may have
 	   significance relating to things already known or
 	   things yet to be discovered. It is a matter of
 	   preference whether the tape is studied in its
 	   entirety or each section analyzed when thought to be
 	   pertinent. (A list of the material is found under
 	   audio files.)

	4. Begin to examine the subject files. There are many
 	   and so you must decide whether to see only the files
 	   on persons that have been mentioned and wait until a
 	   name appears from another source before looking at
 	   their file, or you may, of course, examine as many
 	   files as you like and analyze the data therein
 	   looking for links, connections, personality traits
 	   and the importance of a subject's money, power or
 	   geographical location.

	   NOTE: Keep your case file updated. The distillation
 	   of the information that you put in there
 	   should be clearer than the totality found in
 	   the data files.

	5. When you discover something you find to be of interest and you
           wish more information, assign a field agent to investigate. 
           (Follow the guidelines set down in the S.I.S. manual for giving 
           an order.)

	6. Should you find a person or an address to be of particular 
           interest or suspicion, you should then notify the State 
           Department to detain and question the person officially or to 
           investigate the address. (Remember that there are legal and 
           international limits to the powers of the State Department.)

	7. New information obtained from an agent or the State Department 
           will usually contain further data to investigate. Use your agents
           liberally; they have very few legal or international limitation.

	8. The most valuable information is found in coded form. All codes 
           conform, in one configuration or another, to the deciphering tools
           available to you. While it can be time-consuming, do not be 
           intimidated by an apparent complexity.

	9. The photographic files are also a valuable source of insight. Look
           them over; do not overlook them.

	10. Be aware that world events are proceeding outside and conditions
            everywhere are deteriorating quickly. If you can solve this 
            crime, you will be saving more than the hostages.

	11. GOOD LUCK. We're all counting on you.

                          NO. 11130

APPOINTING A SPECIAL COMMISSION INVESTIGATOR TO REPORT ON THE
 	ABDUCTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

	Pursuant to the authority vested in me as Vice President of the
United States, I hereby appoint a Special Investigator to the Commission on
Abduction and Terrorism. The duties, responsibilities, and powers assigned
herein are to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to
the abduction of the President of the United States of America. Under the
authority of the Acting Commander in Chief, the Special Investigator shall
have made available:

	Federal Data Bases
	Federal Agency Reports
	Official Government Documents
	Public and private Records
	Intelligence Organizations Files
	Cooperation of related investigating Agencies

	The purpose of commissioning an independent and external
Investigator is to examine evidence developed by established Intelligence
Sources and evaluate the facts and circumstances surrounding the abduction
of the President to determine the perpetrators of the offense, the location
of the abductees, and the feasibility of rescue and recovery operations
through objective analysis free of centralized administrative limitation.

	The Investigator is further charged with the obligation to respond
to this office and other members of the National Security Council when
required by authorized officers.

	The Special Investigator is hereby empowered to prescribe
independent methods and procedures and to compel cooperation when deemed
necessary.

	All Executive departments and agencies are directed to furnish any

				  VICE PRESIDENT
                             ACTING COMMANDER IN CHIEF

			    PURPOSE AND METHODOLOGY

The duties of the Investigator as prescribed by the Executive Order are
herein detailed:

	(1) Examine the evidence compiled and made available to you and
	    your staff - beginning with the Official Report on the
	    abduction of the President and other executive officers of
	    European nations.  This report is filed under DOCUMENTS.

	(2) Analyze the methods, tactics, weapons, vehicles, and personnel 
            utilized by the perpetrators and evaluate their significance as
            potential conclusive evidence.

	(3) Examine photographs of the attack site taken by aerial 
            reconnaissance and security teams and appraise the value of the
            explicit or implicit details therein.

	(4) Listen to the Audio Evidence Cassette and examine the
	    transcripts of the material. Determine, by careful and repeated
	    examination, any information from this source which might prove
            to be of value for the resolution of this case.

	(5) Coordinate the activities of persons that may have participated 
            in any aspect of the events, prior, during, or after the 
            abduction.

	(6) Use the field Operatives to search for information which is 
            otherwise unavailable to you.

	(7) Take note of national and world events. Some public activities 
            may have a bearing on the investigative process.

	(8) Maintain and update your case files as the investigation 
            proceeds. These files will aid in the organization and 
            perspective of your research and facilitate a more efficient
            mode of operation. Also, the State Department and other
            administrative organizations will have access to these files
            and their contents will affect the decision-making process in
            formulating national policy and specific resolve of the events
            of this case.

	(9) The objectives of this investigation are to first expedite the 
            recovery of the President and the other abductees safely, and 
            second, to bring those accountable for the violation to
	    justice.  The formal methods used to this end is to reconstruct
            from the  evidence the plan, execution, and aftermath of the
            abduction and  to reveal the identities of any and all persons
            involved directly or indirectly in the furtherance of this
            effort.

				USING THE S.I.S.

SCREEN FORMAT

	The S.I.S. is designed to be an easy to use menu-driven system. The
top line of every screen displays the name of the current function or
process. The third line from the top is reserved for messages such as news
bulletins. The bottom line of the screen displays the currently active keys
and the line above that is the OPTIONS DESCRIPTION LINE which briefly
describes the function of the highlighted menu option. Menu-options windows
are displayed in the center of the screen. The menu windows are explained
below.

MAIN MENU

	Upon successful completion of the LOGON process the MAIN MENU
window will be displayed. The options available from this menu are:
COMMUNICATIONS, DATA BASE, UTILITIES, OPERATIONS GUIDE, and LOGOFF. These
options are explained in more detail below.

COMMUNICATIONS MENU

	Upon selection of the COMMUNICATIONS from the main menu, the
COMMUNICATIONS MENU will appear with the options: AGENT, STATE DEPARTMENT,
and OTHER and are described below.

AGENT

	Upon selection of AGENT from the COMMUNICATIONS MENU a list of
codenames will display. Select an agent and a communications channel to
that agent will be established via the Pyramider Satellite Network. A menu
will display with the options: TRANSMIT, RECEIVE, and REVIEW. These options
are explained in later sections.

	The investigator has at their disposal eight field operatives. They
can be assigned individually to collect intelligence anywhere in the world
as the investigation requires. They are trained, experienced people and are
directed by the highest authority to execute the orders of the
Investigator, forgoing any allegiance or association with any other
department, agency, or person. They are covert operatives and are empowered
only to investigate - they cannot arrest, detain, or otherwise interact
confrontationally with anyone without compromising their own security
positions.

STATE DEPARTMENT

	The investigator may communicate requests to the State Department
through the Security Supervisor. See the discussion on TRANSMIT for a
description of requests to the State Department.

OTHER

	Select other if a communication is to be with OTHER than an agent
or the State Department, such as the CAD at Langley.

TRANSMIT

	Select the TRANSMIT option if your objective is to send an order to
an agent. The nature and structure of the order must be very specific and
must fall within the category of either a person, place, or thing.

	If a person is to be investigated then the order must be the full
name of the person and nothing else. Partial or incomplete names will
reduce the viability of the agent's efforts.

	If a place is to be investigated then a single, specific location
must be entered - a house, apartment, or building requires an address in
the form: number, street, city (e.g. 1499 CARLSON, LONDON). If the place is
a name (e.g. CLARINGTON HOTEL) then enter the name exactly as you find it
in your source.

	A thing must also be specific and not general. However; this
category is difficult to predict or confine and only experimentation will
guide the investigator here. The best rule-of-thumb is the source of the
item. If it is found in a file, write it as found. If it is something in a
picture or audio file then use your discretion.

	When the order is typed to satisfaction, press the <Enter> key. If
the order is acceptable it will be acknowledged, otherwise you will receive
an error message and you may try again.

	The time required for an agent to execute an order varies
considerably with the nature of the order and the location of the agent -
some investigations may take several days while others only hours or
minutes. The agent, once assigned, cannot be recontacted until he or she
reports in.

	If the communique is to be transmitted to the State Department then
a menu will display with the options: QUESTION SUSPECT and SEIZE AND SECURE
PREMISES. These options are described below.

QUESTION SUSPECT

	If a suspect is to be questioned you will be prompted to enter the
suspect's full name and then press <Enter>. A report will be filed with the
Investigator's office upon completion of the action.

SEIZE AND SECURE PREMISES

	If a location is to be secured, by force if necessary, you will be
prompted to enter an address in the form of number, street, city and press
<Enter>. (Follow the guidelines for entering names under the AGENT section
above).

RECEIVE

	Select the RECEIVE option from the COMMUNICATIONS MENU to display
the most recent communique to or from an agent or the State Department.
(See the discussions for AGENT and STATE DEPARTMENT).

REVIEW

	Select the REVIEW option from the COMMUNICATIONS MENU to display
the most recent communique to or from an agent or the State Department.
(See the discussions for AGENT and STATE DEPARTMENT).

NOTE: It is recommended that the investigator make use of the CASE FILES
option of the UTILITIES MENU (described later) to maintain records of
significant communications.

				   DATABASE MENU

	Upon selecting DATABASE from the MAIN MENU, the DATABASE MENU will
appear with the options: DOSSIERS, PHOTOGRAPHIC, DOCUMENT, RECORDS, AUDIO,
REPORTS, and LIMITED ACCESS. These date types are described below.

DOSSIERS

	Upon selection of the DOSSIERS option from the DATABASE MENU a
"Record Criteria" template will display. Enter zero or more values into
this template used to isolate records in the Dossier Database. Press the
<F10> function key and all (if any) records matching the data you have
specified will be listed in the "Selected Records" window. Position the
cursor on the dossier to be examined using the up/down arrow keys and press
the <F10> function key.

	A photograph and textual information will be displayed. Use
<PgDn>/<PgUp> if there is more than one page of information.

PHOTOGRAPHIC

	Select the PHOTOGRAPHIC option from the DATABASE MENU for the
display options: Surveillance, Satellite, and Aerial Photos.

DOCUMENT

	Select the DOCUMENT option from the DATABASE MENU for the display
options: Official papers, Orders, Releases of governments.

RECORDS

	Select the RECORDS option from the DATABASE MENU for the display
options: Police, Medical, School, Sales, Passports, Transportation.

AUDIO

	Select the RECORDS option from the DATABASE MENU for the display
options: Police, Medical, School, Sales, Passports, Transportation.

AUDIO

	Select the AUDIO option from the DATABASE MENU to display
transcripts of the audio evidence file (also on cassette).

REPORTS

	Select REPORTS from the DATABASE MENU to review any filed agent
reports.

LIMITED ACCESS

	Select LIMITED ACCESS from the DATABASE MENU to view confidential
files. You will be prompted to enter an access code. Enter the code and
press <Enter> - further instructions will be provided and are dependent on
the entered access code.

				UTILITIES MENU

	Upon selecting UTILITIES from the MAIN MENU the UTILITIES MENU will
display with the following options: CASE FILES and CRYPTOGRAPHICS which are
described below.

CASE FILES

	Select CASE FILES from the UTILITIES MENU to create/edit a text
file of your investigation notes.

	As the investigation proceeds a large amount of data is generated
such as items from other files, agent reports, and the investigator's
personal observations, ideas, and conclusions. The CASE FILE PROCESSOR is
used to create and organize, store and retrieve this data.

	The size and number of case files is limited only by available disk
space. The files may be stored on either formatted floppy disks or hard
disks if available.

	Upon selection of this option a data entry area will display. If
you had previously selected a case file then the contents of that file will
also display.

	If a case file has not yet been selected, or if you press the <F7>
function key for NEW FILE, then you will be prompted to enter the name of
the file. Enter a file name following DOS conventions for file names (e.g.
C:\SIS\CASEDIR\*.CAS) If wildcards are used in the file name then matching
files will be listed in a window and you can select the file by positioning
the cursor to it and pressing the <F10> function key. If the file does not
exist in the specified path it will be created as a new file.

CRYPTOGRAPHICS

	Select CRYPTOGRAPHICS from the UTILITIES MENU to decode encoded
data.

	For reasons of security, some intelligence gathered during the
investigation may be in code. The encoding method is unpredictable. There
are two possible modes of response to this circumstance.

	The CRYPTOGRAPHICS MENU displays the options: CAD and ONLINE. These
options are described below.

CAD

	Select the CAD option to send the material to the CAD
(Cryptographic Analysis and Deciphering) Section at Langley. A report of
their finding will be transmitted to you via the Pyramider Satellite
Network upon completion of their analysis (See communications). Due to
frequent heavy workloads and backlogs at CAD, be prepared for lengthy
periods of time before results are made available.

ONLINE

	The alternative to CAD is the investigator to attempt translation
of the material. To this end, a limited set of deciphering tools are made
available at the terminal. Although some aspects of the system are not
comparable to CAD, insight, ingenuity, and a possible time savings will
compensate.

	Upon selection of ONLINE a menu will display with the following
options: TRANSPOSITIONS, Morse CODE, ENIGMA MACHINE, and SYNONYMS. These
are described below.

TRANSPOSITIONS

	Within the TRANSPOSITIONS MENU is a list of the various
transposition functions. Position the cursor on any function and a brief
description of the function will display in the OPTIONS DESCRIPTION LINE
(see SCREEN FORMAT). Press the <F10> function key to perform the function
at the cursor - the function will be performed on the encoded data.

MORSE CODE

	Select this option to translate Morse code. The RIGHT SHIFT key
acts as a telegraph key to enter Morse code. Use the space bar for long
pauses (word separation). The duration of time the <F10> key is depressed
determines the dot/dash pattern. The translation will display in the work
area.

ENIGMA MACHINE

	The ENIGMA MACHINE is a device often used to encode (scramble)
normal text. In its simplest application (and the one employed here) some
or all characters of the alphabet are substituted for other characters.

	Above the workspace, the cursor is in front of a blinking '='
character. Enter a character of the alphabet to be changed at the cursor.
The cursor will move to the other side of the '=' character. Enter a
character of the alphabet at this cursor position and all occurrences of
the character left of the '=' will be replaced by the character to the
right of the '='.

	Example: Assume the encoded text were, "z dzd zt". The "z"
character stands alone and thus we can guess the proper substitution is
either the character "A" or "I" since either can be a word. To try the "I"
we would enter "z=i" and the text in the wordspace would change to "i did
it".

SYNONYMS

	Some names and places are referred to by their code names. Enter
the possible code name at the prompt and if there is a match (synonym) it
will be displayed in the workspace.

OPERATIONS GUIDE

	Select OPERATIONS GUIDE from the MAIN MENU for online SIS users
instructions.

LOGOFF

	Select LOGOFF from the MAIN MENU when you wish to leave the SIS and
return control to DOS.

IMPORTANT: Always exit the S.I.S. by selecting the LOGOFF option.
