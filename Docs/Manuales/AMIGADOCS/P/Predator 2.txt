LOS ANGELES, 1997...

It's the hottest summer on record. Pollution is choking the city. Rival Jamaican 
and Columbian drug ganngs are fighting the police for control of the streets.

You are Detective-Lieutenant Mike Harrigan, a though street wise L.A Cop who 
is determined to see justice prevail in a city that is being destroyed by the 
terribble consequences of drugs. It is your Job to take charge of the situation 
and bring an end to the street war as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, as bad 
as things already are, they're about to get worse...much worse!!!

A special F.B.I team assigned to the case. Co-Opperation with the F.B.I is expected
from your own Captain Pilgrim and his supervising officer, Debuty Chief Heinnemann.
The F.B.I know something else is out there. Something more daedly than all off the 
Drug Lords put together. Something silent, invisble, invincible...and ALIEN !!

It hunts man for sport. It collects human skulls as trophies. It can take out 
for men armed with mashine guns by hand, and it has now entered by battle....

The following information has been gleaned from various Top Secret F.B.i reports.

             +++ TOP SECRET +++ TOP SECRET +++ TOP SECRET +++

10 years ago, an alien (fortwith referred to as a 'PREDATOR')
stalked and eliminated an elite Special Forces Team in Central Amerika. There
was only one survivor from the team. His testimony revealed that the Predator
was able to almost completly camouflage itself with a technology far in 
advance of our own. It was armed with a laser guided energy weapon which 
could blast through anything. It seemed to be heavily protected against gun 
fire and was able to move with great speed and agilty. Further investigations
have revealed that the Predators have been visiting Earth for centuries,
dating back at least 700 years.they appear to be drawn by heat and conflict.
they hunt man for sport,but only those worthy of the chase.

Latest intelligence reports suggest that the Predators also have nets,
razor sharp disks and telescopic spears that can slice a man in pieces.These
weapons are constructed from a metal unknown to man which is self lubricating
and harder than diamond.

Do not attempt to engage a Predator in combat.Until more is known about them,
avoid at all costs.

                               PLAYING TIPS 

                                 LEVEL I 

Don't shoot the latine woman, the Taco stand owner or the injured police offices.
It is bad publicity if you shoot any TV repoters or any one beginn interviewed 
by them life on national TV !

Concentrate on the Drug Gang members who through granates, knives or rockets,
are any who try and attack you from close range or hide in doorways. The Gang
Members in doorways can't actually be shoot down, but you can force them to 
take cover for a while by shooting at them.

                                 LEVEL II 

There are lots of hidden ammo clips to be found withhin this level. Try not to
shoot any of Texans! 

                                 LEVEL III

Some people can shoot as acurately when it is dark! 

                                 LEVEL IV 

When mixed together, nitrogen in water might interfere with the Predators vision!
Don't shoot at the F.B.I team!
