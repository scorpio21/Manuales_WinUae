The Mouse =====================================================================

In a traditional aircraft, the main control is the 'stick' or 'wheel'. In
ProFlight this control is replaced by the mouse.

                                  Pitch Up

Pitching and Rolling ==========================================================

A conventional aileron system consists of two hinged control surfaces on the
outboard trailing edge of the wing which move differentially. Deflecting these
surfaces causes the airflow around them to change increasing the lift on one
wing and reducing it on the other, causing a roll.

Similarly, a conventional elevator system consists of two hinged control
surfaces on the tailplane of the aircraft which move in unison. Deflecting
these surfaces causes the airflow around them to change altering the lift
generated.

In the Tornado the conventional aileron / elevator system is replaced by a
'taileron', a single control surface which acts as both elevator and aileron.
The fly-by-wire computer moves the tailerons together for a pitching motion,
and differentially for a rolling motion.

Moving the mouse forward and backwards controls the pitching of the aircraft,
i.e. motion in the lateral plane. Moving left and right controls the rolling
of the aircraft, i.e. motion in the longitudinal plane. The motion of the
mouse causes the fly-by-wire computer to alter the settings of the 'taileron'
(ailerons/elevators).

Yawing ========================================================================

The rudder is a hinged control surface on the rear fin of the aircraft.
Movement of the rudder changes the sideways forces on the aircraft, causing a
yaw to the left or right, i.e. rotation of the aircraft round a vertical axis
that runs through its centre.

Pressing the left or right mouse button controls the yawing of the aircraft by
altering the setting of the rudder.

The Keyboard ==================================================================

Supplementing the mouse, the keyboard provides additional controls for various
ProFlight options. Some keys have a secondary function (indicated in italics,
underneath the main entry) when using the mission area display map.

@4Key:@5 A                                                        Engage Air Brakes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Tornado is equipped with air brakes at the rear of the aircraft, on either
side of the fin. Used primarily to reduce speed quickly and in certain
aerobatic manoeuvres, they are also useful in combat when a sudden change in
airspeed is required to outwit enemy planes or missiles. Air brakes radically
affect the performance of the aircraft and should be used with caution.
Current status of the airbrakes is shown on the instrument panel.

@4Key:@5 B                                                       Engage Wheel Brake
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To achieve the shortest possible take-off, the Tornado is brought to full
engine power while held stationary on the runway by the wheel brakes. Only when
full power is indicated are the brakes released.

Wheel brakes are also used on landing to help reduce the ground speed of the
aircraft. Current status of the wheel brakes is shown on the instrument panel.

@4Key:@5 C                                                  Auto-pilot Heading Mode
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the auto-pilot is operating, the current altitude and heading set in the
auto-pilot's memory can be displayed on the screen, and may be adjusted to a
new setting by moving the mouse. Default mode is in both axes of movement, i.e.
moving the mouse from side to side alters the set heading; moving forwards or
backwards changes the set altitude.

Use KEY C to switch the heading adjustment to the mouse buttons, so that
movement of the mouse only affects the altitude. Holding down the left button
then rotates the heading anticlockwise (numbers decrease), right button rotates
the heading clockwise (numbers increase).

Altitude adjustments are sensitive to mouse movement. Observe the + or - sign
by the number, indicating whether the value is increasing or decreasing. Large
mouse movements increase or decrease the value more rapidly. To stabilise the
value, use small mouse movements and watch for + and - signs changing rapidly.
Find the null point between them and release the mouse, which will allow the
new value indicated to be set.

@4Key:@5 D                                                         Deception Jammer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When under ground-to-air or air-to-air attack, holding down KEY D will
continuously jam any incoming missile while you perform the high-g evasive
actions required to lose it. Ideal jamming period is about 10 seconds before
impact.

@4Key:@5 E                                              Select Engine Auto Throttle
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Airspeed of the aircraft is determined by measuring air pressure. At sea level,
this measurement is accurate but at high altitude, where the air is
considerably thinner, such measurements are unreliable. The automatic throttle
settings account for these variables.

Select from three modes by repeatedly pressing KEY E, which rotates the
options; AOFF (Auto-throttle Off), where throttle adjustments are made manually
by the pilot; Automatic Indicated Airspeed (AIAS), where the engine management
system will maintain the indicated airspeed; and Automatic True Airspeed,
where a true airspeed will be maintained irrespective of the indicated
airspeed. Current status of the throttle is shown on the instrument panel.

@4Key:@5 F                                                             Deploy Flaps
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Complementary to KEY R command Retract Flaps)

Increments value of flap extensions setting. Single keypresses increment in
single units; holding down KEY F will cause the value to increment faster.
Current position of the flaps is shown on the instrument panel.
Flap settings can be adjusted automatically using Auto Wing and Flaps (Flight
Options menu) but in combat situations the pilot will need to make manual
settings to obtain maximum performance.

4 Key:5 G                                                     Landing Gear
                                                          4 Go to Way Point
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In normal flight, KEY G toggles landing gear between retracted and extended
positions. Current status of the gear is shown on the instrument panel.
In Mission Planning mode, this key is used to centre the map display directly
over a selected way point (from a choice of 8). After KEY H is pressed, enter
the number of the required way point using the keys at the top of the keyboard
and press return. Use the delete key to remove incorrect entries.

4Key:5 H                                                          HUD Horizon                                                    4 Change Way Point Height
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toggles the Head Up Display horizon bars, which indicate the pitch and roll of
the aircraft relative to the ground.

In mission planning mode, press this key to enter a new way point height for
the selected way point. After pressing KEY H, enter the new altitude value
using the keys at the top of the keyboard and press return. Use the delete key
to remove incorrect entries.
4 Key:5 I                                                    Interrupt Simulator
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Puts the simulator in pause mode. ProFlight records continuously updated
positional information of the Tornado at 5 second intervals for the last 175
seconds of flight. In Interrupt mode, it is possible to step back in five
second increments through the recorded positions and recommence flight from a
chosen point (up to the maximum of 175 seconds elapsed time).

Recorded position options are displayed when any key is pressed while ProFlight
is interrupted. You will be asked to enter one of three options, selected by
the indicated function key. F1 will move the aircraft to the last recorded
position, F2 moves it to the next position. The recorded position is indicated
by a negative value in elapsed seconds. F10 restarts from the point at which
you interrupted the simulator, or from the recorded position you have selected.
@4Key:@5 J                                                            Increase Trim
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Complementary to KEY U command Decrease Trim)

Adjusts the elevator element of the 'Taileron' by small amounts. Used in flight
to trim the altitude of the aircraft for straight and level flight, accounting
for variations in weight, payload and atmospheric conditions. Trim settings
are indicated on the instrument panel.

point or target.

4 Key                                            Opportunity Ground Target Lock
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programmed ground targets are divided into Primary and Opportunity targets.
When they appear on the radar, KEY O will select one and lock the weapons
system to it. If multiple Opportunity targets are programmed, repeatedly
pressing this key will step through them. The selected target is highlighted
on the radar display.

4 Key                                               Primary Ground Target Lock

selects the programmed Primary Target when it comes into radar range. The
Primary target is highlighted on the radar display when selected.

In Mission Planning mode, press KEY P to nominate a target under the cursor as
Primary.

4 Key                                                            Retract Flaps
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Complementary to KEY F command Deploy Flaps)

Decrements value of flap extensions setting. Single keypresses decrement in
single units; holding down KEY R will cause the value to decrement faster.
Current position of the flaps is shown on the instrument panel.

Flap settings can be adjusted automatically using Auto Wing and Flaps (Flight
Options menu) but in combat situations the pilot will need to make manual
settings to obtain maximum performance.

4 Key                                                         Sweep Wings Back

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flying straight and level at 30,000ft, the nearest ground in view is some 43
miles away. At 500ft it is only 25 miles away. The difference in distance
renders the Horizon line of the HUD inaccurate. For this reason the world
horizon may be changed to an artificial one on which the Horizon bar may be
aligned to cancel any variation in pitch.

Keypad Controls ===============================================================

The following six keypad control have similar functions in both Flight and
Mission Planning modes and this explanation applies to all the keys in this
group.

Use keys in this group in flight mode to move the aircraft when Position Skew
is activated, which allows static repositioning of the aircraft in all three
axis. Once the aircraft begins to skew in the chosen direction it will continue
to move until you input keypresses in the opposite direction, or press KEYPAD /
to stop any motion and reset the aircraft's position at that setting.

In Mission Planning mode, use this group of keys to move around the terrain
map, although if you release a key the map will stop scrolling. The Move Up
and Move Down keys (KEYPAD +/-) alter the zoom level of map magnification.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a valid target has been acquired and selected, the correct choice of missile
or cannon made and the selected weapon armed, press the SPACE BAR to launch the
missile or fire the cannon. Bombs do not require manual release since the
payload will be dropped automatically at the correct time by the weapons
system computer.

@4Keys:@5 Escape + both Shift Keys                                    EJECTION SEAT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For use only in the most dire of circumstances. The Tornado is fitted with
Martin-Baker Mk10A rocket-assisted ejection seats rated effective from zero
speed to Mach 2, and from ground level to 50,000ft. Canopy ejection is
automatic.

Ejection seats are by no means reliable. Although in most circumstances they
will indeed eject the occupant, there is some probability of injury or death as
a result. The pilot may experience temporary unconsciousness due to the violent
'g' forces incurred by the rocket system, although parachute deployment is
automatic.

After ejection, and if the pilot survives, he will be returned to the airfield.


Menus =========================================================================

ProFlight can be configured using the menus provided. The function keys F1-F10
may be preceded by a tick (selected) or a '-' which indicates that the
selection is not permitted by the simulator at the moment. i.e. if your current
mode is combat then crash inhibit is not allowed. Function key driven menus
were chosen because mouse pointing interferes with flying.

Menus are nested; some menu entries call other menus. All menu options are
called from a main menu (F1), under which nine other subject menus for various
ProFlight functions can be found. These menus in turn may call additional sub-
menu options. Function key F10 always exits from any menu level. Repeatedly
pressing F10 (once for each menu level opened) will return you to the
simulator.

In this text, a sub-menu entry is indicated by an F number prefix in brackets,
which indicates the subject menu from which the sub-menu is chosen.

The Main Menu ============================================== From Simulator: F1

Pressing F1 from the simulator will bring up the main, or 'root' menu:

F1	SIMULATOR		Pressing the function keys shown
F2	VISUAL			bring up subsequent menus. The F10
F3	AUTO PILOT/NAV		key always exits the current level
F4	TRAINING		of menus.
F5	COMBAT
F6	WAY POINT
F7	MISSION PLANNING
F8	WEATHER
F9	HUD
F10	EXIT

In the menus displayed, press the appropriate function key will either bring up
a further menu, or turn the option on and mark it with a tick. If an option is
marked with a minus sign (-) it is unavailable (due to some other options
currently being selected).

Simulator ======================================================= Main Menu: F1

F1	CRASH INHIBIT
F2	COMBAT MODE
F3	EMPTY NO STORES/TRUE A/C WEIGHT
F4	BANK LIMITER
F5	PITCH LIMITER
F6	DEMO OPTIONS
F10	EXIT

F1: Crash Inhibit

When enabled, ProFlight will prevent the aircraft from being destroyed upon
crashing into other objects. In combat mode this option is not available.

If you hit the ground with crash inhibit on, you vertical motion is halted,
however any horizontal motion continues. If your IAS is subsequently too low,
you will not be able to take off and you should stop before attemping to
continue, so that ProFlight can automatically lower the landing gear.

F2: Combat mode

The ProFlight simulator operates in two modes: Training and Combat. Combat may
only be selected while on the ground and stationary. Attacking aircraft and
ground installations are introduced into the simulator when combat mode is
selected. Whilst in combat mode several flight simplification options, such as
crash inhibit are disabled (marked with a -).

F3: Empty no stores/True aircraft weight

When this option is selected the weight of the aircraft is increased to reflect
the true weight. Flying without this option produces a more manoeuvrable
aircraft and consequently more 'exciting' flight.

F4: Bank limiter

Enabling bank limiter prevents bank angles in excess of 60 degrees. This is
usually enabled during initial training.

F5: Pitch limiter

Enabling pitch limiter prevents pitch angles in excess of 20 degrees. This is
usually enabled during initial training.

F6: Demo options

F1	DEMO FLIGHT		The Demo options allow you to view various
F2	DEMO LANDING		manoeuvres being performed by ProFlight.
F3	DEMO TAKE-OFF		Pressing the appropriate function keys F1 to F3
F4	DEMO TRAINING		starts the relevant demonstration sequence.
F5	AUTO DEMO OFF
F10	EXIT

(F6) F4: Demo training

On selecting Demo training a take-off is performed and the aircraft is
positioned in the air ready for you to take control.

Pitch and back limiter are automatically selected, together with position skew
from the training menu.

(F6) F5: Auto demo off

When this option is selected ProFlight automatically enters demonstration mode
after a period of inactivity. Deselecting this option turns off the automatic
demonstration mode.

Visual ========================================================== Main menu: F2

F6	GRID		OVERLAY
F7	NIGHT STAR	DISPLAY
F8	GROUND SPOT	DISPLAY
F9	OBSERVER VIEW	OPTIONS
F10	EXIT

F1: Day Dusk Night

Selecting day/dusk/night alters the view for day, dusk or night time flying.

F2, F3 and F4: Solid ground/elevated/enemy objects

Enables solid ground/elevated/enemy objects, causing the relevant features to
be shaded. Shaded graphics require more processor time from the computer, so
the frame update rate will slow down. The fastest simulator mode is with all
shading turned off, and night flying selected.

F5: Artificial horizon

On enabling artificial horizon a horizon, as seen on the head up display, is
superimposed on the world view to compensate for the displacement of the
horizon at high altitudes in relation to the HUD horizon.

F6: Grid overlay

With grid overlay enabled, a grid is superimposed on the ground. Having the
grid enabled can be particularly useful during spin recovery since it allows
the direction of the spin to be easily observed.

F7: Night star display

If this option is selected during night flight, the stars are shown for January
1st at latitude 51.5 degrees north.

F8: Ground spot display

Enabling ground spots, shows an 'abbreviated' form of the grid on the ground.
This has the advantage of taking less time to draw than the full grid option.

F9: Observer view options

F1	OBSERVER    VIEWING	The observer view options control the view
F2	INSTRUMENT    PANEL	seen when observer viewing is enabled.
F3	STATIC/ CHASE PLANE
F4	STATIC		PAN
F5	STATIC         ZOOM
F6	STATIC    WAY POINT
F7	NEW STATIC POSITION
F8	SET ZOOM DIST 0-9 5
F9	DETAILED  A/C SHAPE
F10	EXIT

Observer view mode means that rather than seeing the view through the front of
the aircraft, the view seen is that which an observer standing (or flying)
outside the aircraft would see.

(F9) F1: Observer viewing

This option is the main switch on/off point for the observer view options. None
of the options have any effect unless observer viewing is on.

(F9) F2: Instrument panel

This option causes an instrument panel to be displayed whilst in observer mode.

(F9) F3: Static/chase plane

When selected, this mode changes the observer view from a static standpoint, to
that of a 'chase plane', i.e. a closely following plane.

(F9) F4: Static pan

Static pan mode causes the observer to rotate about the viewpoint so that the
plane is always central in the field of view.

(F9) F5: Static zoom

Static zoom mode causes the observer to maintain a fixed distance from the
aircraft.

(F9) F6: Static way point

Static way point sets the observer to the way point which is currently selected
from the way point menu.

(F9) F7: New static position

This option sets the new static position at the current position of the
aircraft. The viewing direction is set in the altitude of the aircraft.

(F9) F8: Set zoom distance

This allows the zoom distance used by the static zoom and chase plane modes to
be altered. A value between 0 (max zoom) and 9 (min zoom) should be entered
followed by return.

(F9) F9: Detailed aircraft shape

When detailed aircraft shape is selected, the aircraft seen in the simulator
will have a more detailed and realistic shape but will take longer to draw.


Auto-Pilot/Nav ================================================== Main Menu: F3

F1	AUTO PILOT		The auto-pilot menu selects and changes the
F2	ALT+HDG			modes of the navigation computer and
F3	SELECTED TARGET		automatic pilot.
F4	SELECTED WAY POINT
F5	COUPLED APPROACH
F6	NAV DIRECTOR
F7	FLIGHT OPTIONS
F10	EXIT

F1: Auto-pilot

This option is the main switch point for the auto-pilot. None of the options
have effect unless the auto-pilot is on.

F2: Alt+hdg

With altitude and heading mode on, the auto-pilot will attempt to fly the
aircraft to the altitude and heading indicated. The altitude is altered by
moving the mouse back and forth, whilst the heading is altered using the left
and right mouse keys.

The control for adjusting the heading may be changed onto the left and right
movement of the mouse by using the heading rudder/stick option from the flight
options menu.

F3: Selected target

Selected target mode causes the auto-pilot to fly towards the target which is
currently locked into the navigation computer.

F4: Selected way point

Selected target mode causes the auto-pilot to fly towards the way point which
is selected on the way point menu.

F5: Coupled Approach

In coupled approach mode the auto-pilot will try to land the aircraft. This is
not a full auto land sequence so the pilot must select an appropriate approach
speed, lower the gear and position the aircraft on the instrument landing
system within 20 n.m. of the runway.

If at any time the auto-pilot loses the necessary radio signals, it will
automatically deselect itself. Control is always handed back to the pilot 5
feet from the ground.

F6: Nav director

To try to compensate for the restricted field of view, ProFlight can display a
navigator icon (in the shape of an aircraft) which points towards the place the
auto-pilot is heading.

F7: Flight Options

F1	AUTO RUDDER
F2	HDG RUDDER/STICK
F3	RUDDER DYNAMIC/FIXED
F4	AUTO WING+FLAPS
F5	AUTO STALL LIMIT
F6	AUTO BANK STABILIZER
F7	AUTO PITCH STABILIZER
F10	EXIT

(F7) F1: Auto rudder

Selecting auto rudder will apply rudder automatically, in coordination with
stick input. This option should be avoided in combat manoeuvring because the
pilot should constantly be using the rudder bar to assist in weapon aiming.

(F7) F2: HDG rudder/stick

Selecting heading rudder/stick toggles the adjustment of the automatic heading
mode (Alt + Hdg) between the mouse buttons and the left/right mouse movement.

(F7) F3: Rudder dynamic/fixed

When the rudder is in dynamic mode, it acts as though 'spring-loaded', slowly
returning to the central position after an offset. In fixed mode this self-
centring behaviour does not occur.

(F7) F4: Auto wing+flaps

Auto wing sweep and flaps continuously selects the optimum settings for these
controls surfaces to achieve low induced and profile drag at the true airspeed.

The wing sweep angle is determined by the speed ranging from 25 degrees at Mach
0.73 to 67 degrees at Mach 0.95

(F7) F5: Auto stall limit

With auto stall limit enabled the wings are unloaded at the onset of a stall.
Because it is easy to exceed the angle of attack limits in the Tornado, even at
high indicated air speeds, this mode is normally engaged.

(F7) F6 and F7: Auto bank/pitch stabiliser

Selecting the auto bank/pitch will increase the tendency of the aircraft to fly
straight and level i.e. the stability is increased.


Training ======================================================== Main menu: F4

F1	HOLD NORTH  MOVEMENT
F2	HOLD EAST   MOVEMENT
F3	HOLD HEIGHT MOVEMENT
F4	POSITION SLEW
F5	TARGET AIR
F6	TARGET GROUND
F10	EXIT

F1, F2 and F3: Hold north/east/height movement

Selecting the hold north/east/height movement restricts the movement of the
aircraft in that particular direction.

These options are unavailable whilst the aircraft is still on the ground and
must be selected whilst in flight.

F4: Position slew

Selecting position slew is equivalent to selecting the hold north/east/height
movement options. However, the position of the aircraft may be adjusted using
the 7, 8, 9, ), +, - keys on the keypad.

F5 and F6: Target air/ground

The target air/ground creates a target for you to practise your combat skills
against. These targets always appear between the runway and bridge.


Combat ========================================================== Main menu: F5

F1	SAVE ENEMY DATA BASE
F2	LOAD ENEMY DATA BASE
F3	DAMAGE REPORT
F4	SET SKILL 0-4 0
F10	EXIT

F1: Save enemy database

Selecting save enemy database saves the current enemy status in a file named
ENEMY.DB in the current directory, i.e. from the same folder or disk from
which you loaded the program. You are not required to name the file; only one
enemy database may be saved on a single disk; additional saves will overwrite
the old file although different positions could be recorded on separate disks.

If loading from a floppy disk, you can save the file on the backup program disk
you loaded from, or insert a blank, formatted floppy in the drive from which
you loaded ProFlight, on which the ENEMY.DB file will be created.

If you loaded ProFlight from a hard disk, the file will be saved to the same
directory as the program file. Only one file may be saved; additional saves
will overwrite the old file.

F2: Load enemy database

This loads the enemy status from a file named ENEMY.DB. If loading from a
floppy drive and you saved the database on a different disk from the the backup
program, you should insert the disk on which you previously saved the enemy
status. If you loaded from a hard disk, the file will be loaded automatically.

F3: Damage report

The damage report option displays a summary of any damage currently incurred.

F4: Set skill

Set skill allows you to set the difficulty of combat mode. After selecting set
skill, a number between 0 (easiest) and 4 (hardest) should be entered using

F1: Wind

When the wind option is selected, wind factor is introduced into the ProFlight
simulation. The current wind direction and velocity are also shown; the three
digit figure indicates direction, the two digit figure speed.

F2: Turbulence

When the turbulence option is selected, turbulence is introduced into
ProFlight. The value shown is the amount of turbulence currently selected.

F3: Cloud

Selecting the cloud option enables the display of clouds.

F4: Set wind direction

Set wind direction allows you to set the direction from which any wind comes.
A number between 0 and 359 (degrees) should be entered using only the top row
of numeric keys (not the numeric keypad) followed by Return.

Set turbulence allows you to set the degree of turbulence encountered. A number
between 0 (min) and 9 (max) should be entered using only the top row of numeric
keys (not the numeric keypad) followed by Return.


HUD ============================================================= Main Menu: F9

F1	HUD		The head up display menu allows the elements of the
F2	HORIZON		head up display to be turned on and off. In fast jets
F3	COMPASS		a head up display is provided to allow the pilot to
F4	G SPOT		assimilate the information from instruments without
F5	FLIGHT PATH	averting his view from the outside.
F6	VSI

F8	AP ERROR
F9	ILS BARS
F10	EXIT

F1: HUD

The HUD option is the main switch on/off point for the head up display. When
this is selected HUD elements are shown on the head up display.

F2: Horizon

The horizon bars indicates the pitch and roll of the aircraft relative to the
ground. Horizon bars above the 0 degree line are shown solid, whilst those
below broken. The 0 degree line is shown as a broken line with no end bar.

The pointers on the end of the horizon bars indicate normal or inverted flight,
with bars on the right for normal flight and on the left in inverted flight.
These pointers also always point in the direction of the 0 degree line.

F3: Compass

The compass bars allow the pilot to assess his rate of heading change.

During certain manoeuvres this information is more important than the actual
heading which is displayed on the instrument panel.

F4: G spot (Look, no rude jokes, this is a serious simulation!)

The boresight ring is always displayed with the 'g' indicator to reference the
1 'g' datum.

The 'g' spot deflects up and down as 'g' is pushed and pulled. It moves left
and right as the aircraft is yawed to the right and left of it's flight path.
In other words it indicates where you body weight is being thrown.

F5: Flight path

The fly to line indicates to the pilot where the inclined lift force generated
by the wings of the aircraft is acting. The magnitude of this force is depicted
by the length of the line.

F6: VSI

The vertical speed indicator consists of two markers. The small scale marker
registers rates up to 2000 feet per minute, the large scale mark indicate up to
32000 feet per minute.

F7: Incidence

The angle of incidence indicator gives a direct indication of the combination
of angle of attack and wing sweep back. As such it gives a good indication of
an approaching stall.

F8: AP error

When the auto-pilot is flying the aircraft the pilot may, if he wishes, display
the auto-pilot error.

This error is the difference between where the aircraft is, and where the auto
pilot is aiming to fly the aircraft. The auto-pilot always flies the aircraft
towards the error mark.

F9: ILS bars

The ILS indicators will only be present when a valid signal is being received
from the instrument landing system. They allow the pilot to watch the runway
and ILS at the same time.

Artificial Horizon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   `J0017			The Artificial Horizon is always central to the pilot's
   `K0017			view and is one of the most important instruments on
   `L0017			his panel.
   `M0017
   `N0017			It's function is to indicate the roll and pitch of the
   `O0017			aircraft relative to the artificial horizon.
   `P0017
   `Q0017			When an aircraft is flying at altitude the world
			horizon falls away beneath the field of view of the
			pilot, however the artificial horizon reference remains
			constant.

The instrument comprises an aircraft symbol fixed to the 'glass' and an
artificial horizon line which is kept parallel with the world horizon by a
gyroscope. A sky orientation marker indicates the position of the sky relative
to the aircraft (above, below or to the side), resolving any ambiguity which
might exist during inverted flight.

In flight, the artificial horizon indicator will show the current attitude of
the aircraft relative to the ground. If the Tornado is climbing the horizon
line will drop below the aircraft symbol. In a dive, the horizon line moves
above it. The amount by which the horizon line is displaced gives an indication
of the angle of climb or descent.

In a turn, the horizon line will rotate in the opposite direction. So, for
example, in a level right turn, the horizon line will rotate left and the
aircraft symbol will be just above it, with it's right wing closer to the
line.

Remember that when an aircraft is almost vertical with respect to the horizon,
roll will not be initiated because the horizon surrounds the aircraft.

AirSpeed Indicator (ASI)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This instrument is of particular importance to the pilot as the lift generated
by the wings depends upon the indicated airspeed.

    `J1709		The airspeed indicator shows the airspeed in knots. At sea
    `K1709		level the Indicate AIRSPEED (IAS) is equal to the True
    `L1709		AIRSPEED (TAS). However, at altitude the instrument under-
    `M1709		reads.
    `N1709

The measurement of airspeed is performed by obtaining the air pressure
surrounding the aircraft (static air pressure) and the air pressure on the
forward facing parts of the aircraft (the dynamic air pressure). The difference
in pressure may then be interpreted as an airspeed in knots.

As the altitude increases the air becomes more rarefied and the flow of air
onto the aircraft is reduced, reducing the dynamic air pressure and hence the
indicated airspeed.

Machmeter (MACH)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     `J2607		The machmeter express the speed of the aircraft as a fraction
     `K2607		of the local speed of sound, which varies with altitude. This
     `L2607		instrument is the cornerstone of high speed flight and provides
     `M2607		the pilot with the best indication of the true airspeed.

The speed of sound is about 662 knots at sea level, under typical conditions,
falling to about 574 knots in the colder air at higher altitudes. Thus Mach 2
at 30,000 feet is about 1200 knots.

Altimeter (ALT)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    `J3309		The altimeter gives an indication of the current height of the
    `K3309		aircraft. The analogue scale reads in units of one hundred feet
    `L3309		whilst the digital display shows the height in hundred foot
    `M3309		increments. When the analogue scale shows 500ft and the
    `N3309		aircraft is at 500ft altitude, the digital scale will read 005.
		If the aircraft was at 25,500 ft, the digital scale would show
		255 and the analogue scale 500. The maximum permitted altitude
		for this aircraft is 65000ft.

The rate at which the altimeter 'winds' can often provide a useful indication
of vertical speed.

For accurate low-level flight, there is an additional altimeter display that
appears at the top of the screen when the aircraft is below 250ft.

Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   `J4303	The vertical speed indicator shows the rate of climb or descent of the
   `K4303	aircraft, although it is possible to maintain rates that exceed the
   `L4303	scale of the VSI.
   `M4303
   `N4303	The full scale position corresponds to climb or descent at about 2000
   `O4303	feet per minute.

The purpose of the instrument is to allow the pilot to control
his climb rate, establish level flight and to judge the correct
rate of descent, especially when landing.

Angle of attack indicator (AOA)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    `J4609		This meter displays the current angle of attack (Alpha). Alpha
    `K4609		is the angle at which the air flow meets the wing. Increasing
    `L4609		Alpha will increase wing lift, too high and the wing will
    `M4609		stall. An aircraft flying straight and level at low IAS will
    `N4604		therefore require to be pitched up above its direction of
		travel. Higher Alpha's will be recorded when pulling 'g' with
		swept back wings.

High Alpha produces more induced drag which can be used to an advantage by
rapidly slowing the aircraft. If acceleration is required the wings will have
to be unloaded by reducing Alpha.

Auto Throttle Indicator (AOFF/AIAS/ATAS)                                  Key E
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The automatic throttle indicator shows the throttle mode currently selected
using KEY E. There are three different modes:

   `J5510		This mode indicates that the engine management computer has
passed full control for the throttles to the pilot.

   `K5510		In this mode the engine management computer will adjust engine
thrust to maintain the indicated airspeed set by the pilot. The maximum
permitted IAS is 900 Kts.

   `L5510		In this mode the engine management computer will adjust engine
thrust to maintain the true airspeed set by the pilot. Remember that this may
result in too low an airspeed for the aircraft to fly at altitude.

Control surface indicators
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   `R0017			In a simulator such as ProFlight there is no control
   `S0018			loading, so feedback from the controls must be conveyed
   `T0018			in a different manner. The control surface indicators
   `U0018			provide this function.The position of the ailerons,
   `V0018			elevators and rudder bar are displayed on this
			instrument, and these should be centralised prior to
			take off.

The Tornado uses a differentially moving tail which acts as both the elevator
and aileron. On the "I" shaped instrument they are, from top to bottom,
aileron, elevator and rudder input. Associated with this display are the trim
and sensitivity settings and they are to the left and right of the elevator
respectively. The Tornado seldom requires any trim change but at low IAS some
increase in sensitivity may be required due to loss of responsiveness.

Engine Thrust (RPM)                                                   KEYS: < >
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     `J6504			Although the thrust generated by a jet engine is not
     `K6515			directly related to engine R.P.M. it is usually
     `L6515			depicted in this manner and this convention has been
     `M6515			adopted for lack of a better one.
     `N6505

The instrument is divided into two regions; cold, the lower region in which the
engines are running without reheat; and the upper hot region where reheat is
used.

The rising bar in the centre of the gauge shows the amount of thrust currently
being output by the engine. In auto throttle modes (AIAS, ATAS) this reading
will reflect the power applied by the engine management system according to the
attitude of the aircraft. With a level flight setting of 300 knots at 20,000,
only one quarter power will be indicated on the RPM gauge, yet if the aircraft
is pitch up the engine management system will automatically increase power to
maintain airspeed.

With this type of engine, reheat does not produce a sudden surge of power (as
is often depicted) but is a controllable increase in engine thrust. Thus, there
is no sudden increase in speed when reheat is applied, only a steady
acceleration.

There are a number of different types of fuel for use in jet engines, and
whilst some can boost the power by a considerable margin the engines life is
reduced accordingly. Typically aircraft flown in combat make use of these
special fuels to improve their performance.

Furthermore, by increasing the fuel flow past the normal limits set for peace
time flying, greater power may be extracted in reheat (due to increase in
exhaust gases). However, engine life is again compromised.

In ProFlight the engines are configured for war time missions and no
restrictions are set for jet pipe temperature.

Fuel gauge
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  `O1704	The fuel gauge shows the amount of fuel remaining, which is
  `P1704	automatically replenished when the aircraft is stationary on the
  `Q1704	ground.
  `R1704	

Remember that reheat considerably increases fuel consumption, whilst flying at
altitude will use less fuel and increase your operational range. Sufficient
fuel is provided for missions, however combat greatly reduces flight endurance
so careful observation of the remaining fuel is required.

Gear                                                                      Key G
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 `W0006	As the landing gear is raised and lowered the status is displayed on
 `X0006	the instrument panel.

 `W0606	If an attempt to lower the gear is made when the aircraft's velocity
 `X0606	is too high, a configuration error message 'Config' is displayed on the
	head-up-display.

Air and Wheel brake indicators                                    KEYS: A and B
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 `S1806	The air brake indicator 'A' indicates the current air brake setting
 `T1806	(KEY A). Remember that air brakes provide more drag, and hence more
deceleration, the higher the airspeed.

 `U1806	The wheel brake indicator 'W' shows the current wheel brake setting
 `V1806	(KEY B). The wheel brakes can hold the aircraft stationary with full
full thrust applied but are not powerful enough to slow the aircraft against
this force of thrust if moving at speed down the runway. They also become less
effective as the lift generated by the wings increases.

Wing sweep angle                                                  KEYS: S and W
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 `W1206	The wings sweep angle may be varied between 25 degrees (fully
 `X1206	forward) and 68 degrees (fully back) and the current setting is
displayed on the instrument panel. An attempt to select an incorrect sweep
angle will result in a configuration error message being displayed on the head-
up-display. Configuration errors will occur if the wings are too far back with
flaps deployed or too far forward for the aircraft's velocity.

With the wings swept forwards higher lift at lower IAS may be achieved, however
drag increases enormously at speeds approaching Mach 1 due to shock waves
forming along the wing (wave drag). Sweeping the wings back delays the onset of
wave drag at the expense of lift.

Flap angle Keys: F and R
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 `W1806	The flap angle may be varied between 0 degrees (fully retracted) and
 `X1806	30 degrees (fully out) and the current setting is displayed on the
instrument panel. An attempt to select an incorrect flap angle will result in a
configuration error message being displayed on the head-up-display.
Configuration errors will occur if the flaps are deployed with the wings too
far back or if the aircraft's velocity is too high.

Even with the wings swept forwards additional lift is required for low IAS's.
This is achieved by deploying leading edge slats and trailing edge flaps. For
the purposes of this simulation they are collectively referred to as flaps.
When an aircraft turns it banks over and uses its wings to pull it round the
turn. As mentioned before, flaps increase positive lift but diminish negative
lift, so don't expect to push 'g' with them deployed. Establishing the optimum
sweep/flap setting may best be learnt during training.

'G' force indicator                                               KEYS: X and Z
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   `O2411		The 'g' force meter measures the acceleration of the aircraft
   `P2411		as a ratio of standard gravity (one 'g').
   `Q2411
   `R2411		The analogue scale shows the number of 'g' the aircraft is
   `S2404		currently pulling or pushing, and the digit gives the current
		limit entered by the pilot.

Ammunition gauge
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  `O3504	The number of cannon shells remaining are indicate by this gauge.
  `P3504	About 30 seconds of ammunition is loaded into your aircraft when
  `Q3504	you are stationary on the ground (at least three times that
  `R3504	available on a real Tornado).

Ammunition should be used sparingly, since only short bursts should be required
if your aim is good. During training unlimited ammunition is provided. Remember
that a target must be acquired and the cannon selected and armed before you can
fire. Use the Space Bar to fire the cannon.

Arm/Safe Weapon System                                             Keypad Enter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 `N7006	When a weapon has been selected, it must be armed before use. This key
toggles between safe and armed status. Fire cannon or missiles with the
Spacebar: bombs are delivered by the weapons system.

Radar display
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    `N5015			The Plan Position Indicator Radar display is used to
    `O5016			establish the position of enemy targets which are
    `P5016			currently within range of the radar. The current range
    `Q5016			of the radar sweep is displayed at the bottom of the
    `R5016			instrument in nautical miles. The radar range may be
    `S5016			altered between 3 and 46nm (keys - and =+). When the
    `T5016			radar range is altered there is a slight delay whilst
			the scanner reorganises the returns.

During flight the information on the radar rotates about the display as the
heading of your aircraft changes. This means that if you are on a heading of 0
degrees and the target is on a bearing of 90 degrees (shown on the radar screen
to the right of the aircraft) then you must alter your heading to 90 degrees in
order to face the target. At the time the radar 'blip' will move to the top of
the display, and the bearing will be equal to the heading. The target which is
currently being tracked is represented on the radar display by flashing the
radar return 'blip'. When multiple air targets are available, only the target
selected by the Step Target Aircraft Lock (KEYS [ and ]) will flash.

In ProFlight no radar black spots exist. Whilst this is not strictly accurate,
during combat the pilot would normally expect information to be relayed to him
by ground controllers and other friendly fighters, hence the high performance
of this radar display compensates for the lack of intercom chatter and presents
the information in a clear manner.

Distance Measurement Equipment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   `S2810		The DME displays the plan distance in nautical miles to a
selected target, way point or the runway. Whenever the DME is engaged, the
bearing to the target, way point or runway is also displayed.

   `T2810		If no valid target has been selected by the navigation system
   `U2811		the DME and bearing displays will be OFF.

World Position Indicator
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     `V2407		The position of the aircraft relative to the runway is
     `W2407		displayed on this instrument.

The home base is at position N0000 E0000. Note that the update rate of this
instrument is once every 5s.


Head Up Display ===============================================================

The Head Up Display (HUD) is a standard feature of all high-performance combat
aircraft. Allowing the pilot to read many of the most important instruments
from a projected image at head height, the HUD system reduces the need for the
pilot to look down at the panel.

There are nine instrument display options for the ProFlight HUD, which can be
accessed through the HUD menu (F1:Main Menu/F9:HUD). Some HUD components can
also be selected using the keyboard, and where applicable the keys are
indicated in the text.

F1	HUD		The Head Up Display menu allows various instrument
F2	HORIZON		displays to be selected or removed from the screen.
F3	COMPASS		In addition to the menu, certain options also have
F4	G SPOT		keyboard commands which work independently of the menu,
F5	FLIGHT PATH	but duplicate entries in it. Optional key commands are
F6	VSI		given in the text where available.
F7	INCIDENCE
F8	AP ERROR
F9	ILS BARS
F10	EXIT


Menu F1: HUD                                                            Key Tab

The HUD menu option is the main enable/disable switch for the head up display.
When this is the selected HUD elements are shown on the head up display.

Menu F2: Horizon                                                          Key H
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  _________.			The horizon bars indicate the pitch and roll of
           |			the aircraft relative to the ground. Horizon

           |			whilst those below broken. The 0 degree line is
  ___   ___			shown as a broken line with no end bar.
 ----------- True Horizon
  ___   ___|

The pointers on the end of the horizon bars indicate normal or inverted flight,
with the bars on the right for normal flight and on the left in inverted
flight. These pointer also always point in the direction of the 0 degree
line.

Menu F3: Compass
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   `J6911		The compass bars indicate to the pilot the rate of heading
 		change of the aircraft.
 
During certain manoeuvres this information is more important than the actual
heading which is displayed on the instrument panel.

Menu F4: G spot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  `O3904	The Boresight ring and G spot are always displayed together. Use
  `P3904	the Boresight ring to reference the 1 'g' datum.
  `Q3904

The 'g' spot deflects up and down as 'g' is pushed and pulled. It moves left
and right as the aircraft is yawed to the right and left of it's flight path.
In other words it indicates where your body weight is being thrown. As the 'g'
spot moves further away from the Boresight ring the aircraft and pilot will be
subject to greater effects from gravitational forces and the pilot may, under
certain circumstances, lose consciousness for a brief period of time. If you
are in any doubt about your ability to withstand high 'g', set the 'g' limiter
for the aircraft to a level you can tolerate.

Menu F5: Flight path
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  `R3904	The Flight Path fly to line indicates to the pilot where the
  `S3904	inclined lift force generated by the wings of the aircraft is
  `T3904	acting. The magnitude of this force is depicted by the length of
	the line.

Menu F6: VSI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    `P4301	The Vertical Speed Indicator consists of two markers. The small
    `Q4301	scale marker registers rates up to 2000 feet per minute, the
    `R4301	large scale mark indicate rates up to 32,000 feet per minute.

The VSI will appear above the horizon line when the aircraft is climbing, and
below when diving. Note that the range of the dual scale VSI in the HUD covers
a wider range of vertical speeds than does the panel mounted VSI.

Menu F7: Incidence
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    `S4301	The angle of incidence indicator gives a direct indication of the
    `T4301	combination of angle of attack and wing sweep back. As such it
	gives a good indication of an approaching stall.

Menu F8: AP Error
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   `M5502	When the auto-pilot is flying the aircraft the pilot may, if he
	wishes, display the AUTO-PILOT Error indicator.

This error is the difference between the actual path of the aircraft and where
the auto-pilot is aiming to fly the aircraft. The auto-pilot always attempts to
fly the aircraft towards the error mark. As the heading of the plane changes,
the AP Error indicator will gradually centre itself in relation to the HUD.

Menu F9: ILS bars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   `O6711		In addition to the ILS error display on the instrument panel by
   `P6711		the Artificial Horizon indicator, the pilot may also display
   `Q6711		the ILS indicators on the HUD. These indicators will only be
   `R6711		when a valid signal is being received from the instrument
   `S6711		landing system. They allow the pilot to watch the runway and
   `T6711		ILS at the same time.
   `U6711		
   `V6711		

The HUD ILS display has two components. The Glide Slope Error indicator, which
duplicates the G/S scale at the left of the Artificial Horizon, consists of a
horizontal bar and small cross hair centre marker whose vertical position
indicates the altitude of the aircraft relative to the glide scope. If you are
above the glide scope, the indicator will appear below the vertical centre of
the HUD; with the aircraft below the glide slope, the bar will be above the
centre. To correct the vertical approach, fly the aircraft towards the
indicator bar.

The second component of the HUD ILS display is the Localiser, depicted by a
vertical bar with a cross hair centre marker. Duplicating the Localiser scale
at the top of the Artificial Horizon, the Localiser shows deviation from the
correct runway approach heading. If the ILS beam is off to the right of the
aircraft, then the Localiser bar will appear displaced to the right of centre
on the HUD. To correct the heading, fly towards the Localiser bar.

To make a perfect ILS landing, the Glide Slope bar and Localiser bar must be
kept in the centre of the HUD with the cross hairs aligned.

When the auto-pilot (AP) is engaged, it captures the current altitude and
heading of the aircraft, then flies along that course. The HUD can also display
the current 'fly to' information i.e. altitude and heading above the compass,
using the Altitude/Heading mode. The HUD can also display a cross indicating to
the pilot where the auto-pilot is currently flying to. The AP is capable of
stall recovery and can pull up to 4'g'. If a negative 'g' manoeuvre is
indicated the AP will invert the aircraft and pull 'g'.

Except in Coupled Approach mode (semi-automatic landing at home base runway)
the auto-pilot has a ground clearance height of 150 feet. During all manoeuvres
the projected flight path is monitored to maintain this clearance. It does not,
however, avoid elevated objects. The auto-pilot does not by-pass any of the
flight equations within the simulator; it flies the aircraft by adjusting the
control surface positions. It is, therefore, instructional and trainee pilots
should learn, by observation, how to fly.

  WARNING NOTICE : WHENEVER THE AUTO-PILOT IS DISENGAGED, THE AIRCRAFT CONTROL
     SURFACES ARE LEFT IN THEIR LAST POSITION. BE READY TO TAKE OVER IF THE
             AUTO-PILOT IS INTERRUPTED DURING A VIOLENT MANOEUVRE.

Menu: F1   Auto Rudder
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With Auto Rudder selected, the flight management computer will apply the
necessary rudder input when high roll rate turns are initiated. In Auto Rudder
mode, the pilot's own rudder input is cancelled.

Menu: F2   HDG Rudder/Stick                                               Key C
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This option allows the pilot to modify the AP Auto Heading mode heading with
either rudder or aileron input.

If HDG Rudder/Stick is unselected (no tick) then only rudder input is accepted
as heading change data. Aileron input (side to side mouse movement) will not
affect the heading of the aircraft.

If HDG Rudder/Stick is selected (ticked) then heading data is accepted only
from aileron movement and the rudder (mouse buttons) have no effect.

Menu: F3   Rudder Dynamic/Fixed                                           Key K
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because there is no way of providing proportional rudder input two rudder modes
are allowed.

Dynamic Rudder (unselected menu option: no tick) allows the pilot to move the
rudder bar with the mouse buttons but when they are released the rudder returns
to its centre position.

Static Rudder (selected menu option: ticked) leaves the rudder set at its last
position. When using this mode for manual flight the pilot should guard against
flying with his controls crossed i.e. leaving a permanent rudder input. The
rudder can be centred quickly by momentarily reverting to the dynamic mode.

Menu: F4   Auto Wing and Flaps
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When engaged the auto-pilot will automatically sweep the wings back for high
speed flight and deploy flaps for low speed flight. Manual control of wings and
flaps is strongly recommended when engaging the enemy, as your war time footing
allows you to stress your aircraft more highly and hence extract maximum
performance.

Menu: F5   Auto Stall Limit
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the pilot should exceed the angle of attack limits for the current
configuration of wing sweep and flap angle the auto-pilot will try to unload
the wings of the aircraft. This mode does not guarantee stall free flight but
is a great aid to the pilot considering the absence of control loading. The
pilot should also routinely check his HUD incidence meter.

Menu: F6   Auto Bank Stabilizer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the aircraft is close to 0 degrees of bank the auto-pilot will provide a
small aileron input to level the wings.

Menu: F7   Auto Pitch Stabilizer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the vertical speed of the aircraft is close to 0 the auto-pilot will
provide a small elevator input in order to maintain this situation.


Auto-pilot Navigation Modes ===================================================

Nav Target Mode (TG)                                                 Key Delete
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nav Target, or selected target mode, serves two purposes. Firstly, under
control of the auto-pilot and with TG selected, the aircraft will fly towards
the ground or air target (flashing) currently tracked by the weapons computer.
Bearing to target will be displayed under the radar screen, and the DME will
register distance.

With the aircraft under pilot control, TG must be selected in order to activate
the radar, as the first step in preparing for combat. Bearing and DME values to
the selected target will be given.

TG mode takes priority over any WP or CA navigation mode data. The use of TG
mode in combat is dealt with more fully in that chapter.

Way Point Mode (WP)                                                       Key #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Way Points are any location chosen by the pilot on route to a destination. They
consist of North East and Height data input during the mission planning phase
(see Mission Planning). The ProFlight simulator stores eight pre-programmed way
points, which are selected through their own menu (F1: F6). Press any function
key from F1 to F8 to select a way point. When WP mode is activated (Key #) the
auto-pilot will fly the aircraft to this position.

When the auto-pilot is flying to way points the pilot is expected to select the
next way point just before he passes over the current way point. Unless a new
selection is made the aircraft will circle the current way point.

Way points are created through the Mission Planning menu (F1: F7).

You are in effect looking at a map of the terrain. Way points are depicted as
cross hairs and have a North, East and Height. You can move around the map with
keys ),7,8,9,/,-,+ and the mouse will move the cross-hair for fine position
control of the Northings and Eastings. Your current position is displayed on
the left of the screen.

To change the way point, press height key H, then input the new height which
will be used for subsequent way points using the keys at the top of the
keyboard. When you have entered the correct number press return. If you make a
mistake, press Delete to erase the number.

Use key G to go to a way point. Enter a value from 1 to 8 and press return. The
map will display the position of the chosen way point. The map update rate can
be increased by reducing the scan range (keys 9 and 0). Turning off the
elevated object fill mode (key 3) will often show small detail more clearly.

When programming way points the pilot must take into account the 3 dimensional
distance between them and the performance limitations of his aircraft for speed
and altitude. In other words he should ask himself whether there is reasonable
time for the auto-pilot to adjust to the course.

Coupled Approach Mode
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As previously mentioned, if AH mode is turned off while the auto-pilot is
engaged, then the aircraft will fly towards the selected navigation point.
There is, however, one exception to this which involves the Coupled Approach
(CA) mode.

In CA mode the auto-pilot will fly the aircraft using the ILS radio beam and
land it. The pilot MUST position his aircraft reasonably close to the beam. If
the ILS error is too large the auto-pilot will automatically disengage. The CA
mode is not a full auto-land feature as the pilot must control the approach
speed, lower his gear and take control of the aircraft prior to landing. In
common with most auto-pilots it does not cope with large amounts of wind shear.

The pilot should become familiar with all aspects of the auto-pilot/navigation
system. While it can perform most of the pilots tasks in an undamaged state it
does not replace him or have the ability to pull high 'g' or make tactical
decisions.

Navigation Director                                                       Key N
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ProFlight also has a unique 3-D head-up-display mode which can be used to
direct the pilot to the navigation reference point. Note that this part of the
instrument is somewhat more powerful than the real thing, however with the
restricted field of view in ProFlight this helps to balance any 'unfairness'.

Selecting the 3-D HUD mode will show the pilot where to fly by using an
aircraft symbol which points along the shortest flight path. This path does not
take ground clearance into account so the pilot must decide whether to follow
it's pitch and heading direction together, or it's heading followed by pitch
direction.


			      ._________________.
			      |  Flight Theory  |
			      ``-----------------'

The first part of this chapter in the original manual is full of diagrams and
graphs, and I simply could not be bothered drawing them all, plus this chapter
is not necessary to enable you to fly the aircraft... so this is just a summary
of the points relevant to the simulation. If you want to learn about flight
theory in all it's wonderful intricacies, you better buy the original... or
a good book on the subject!

The Angle Of Attack (AOA) of the wing of the aircraft has a large effect on
the lift created. The higher the AOA (more the nose is pitched up), the more
lift is created. But, if the AOA gets too high and the thrust too low, the wing
will stall, causing disruption of airflow over the wing and a drastic loss of
lift.

The sweep angle of the wings also has an effect on lift; the more pronounced
the sweep, the less lift.

Flaps help to increase lift at low speeds and high AOAs.

Drag is a major force acting against your aircraft; there is @4wing drag@5 and
@4parasitic drag@5. Parasitic drag is generated by non lifting surfaces and
makes itself known more at high speeds. It is created by friction of the
aircraft against the surrounding airflow; the more 'rough' the surfaces, the
more drag.

Wing drag (or induced drag) is a by-product of lift production. The high
pressure air under the wing swirls around the wing tips to produce vortices
of disturbed air which exerts a retarding force on the wing. Wing drag
increases at high speeds, especially with non-swept back wings.

*	For flight endurance the wings must be operated efficiently.
*	Speed can be rapidly lost at high angles of attack.
*	An aircraft will only accelerate rapidly if the wings are unloaded
	(low angle of attack)

Turning the aircraft is best accomplished by banking it over on it's side
and pulling back on the stick to change heading, then rolling back to level
flight. The further you roll over before beginning the turn, the tighter
the turn will be, but speed will be lost, and more thrust will be required
to maintain the angle of the bank. Use of the rudder in a banking turn will
lower or raise the nose in respect to the ground.

Recovering from a stall produced by high AOA/low speed (or both) is
accomplished as follows:

Push the stick forwards if the AOA is positive, pull the stick back if the
AOA is negative. Full engine thrust is always a good idea, but be careful
if the stall is occurring at low altitudes! If a stall continues to develop
the aircraft may enter a spin and it will begin to yaw and roll towards the
stalled wing. Unload the wings with the stick procedure above and centre
the ailerons. Use the rudder to stap the yawing.

High 'g' flight can cause a pilot to 'black out', or lose consciousness.
If you begin to black out, release the controls or move them in the opposite
direction to what you were doing before the black out began.

Controlling the Tornado in flight =============================================

FOR SOME EXERCISES, MENU SELECTIONS ARE REQUIRED. WHERE SEVERAL SELECTIONS ARE
  MADE AS A GROUP, THEY ARE LISTED IN THE TEXT AS FOLLOWS - Fa: Fx: Fy: Fz -
 WHERE x, y AND z ARE THE FUNCTION KEY NUMBERS. FUNCTION KEY F10 ALWAYS EXIT
FROM THE CURRENT OPEN MENU: ONLY COMMAND SEQUENCES ARE GIVEN IN THE EXAMPLES.
  USE THE F10 KEY TO CLOSE EACH MENU. AFTER A FUNCTION HAS BEEN REFERRED TO
  SEVERAL TIMES, NO FURTHER KEY REFERENCES WILL BE MADE. ALL MENUS DISPLAY
 DESCRIPTIVE NOMENCLATURE AND F NUMBERS ON SCREEN. FOR A FULL DESCRIPTION OF
                  THE MENU SYSTEM, REFER TO THE MENU SECTION.

The flying exercises take immediate advantage of the fact that this is a
simulator. Unlike the tentative, erratic first flight with an instructor to
take over when you lose control, ProFlight can place you repeatedly at precise
positions in the air until you have mastered a specific aspect of flying and
are ready to progress to the next task.

The tasks are ordered in a logical manner; learning some control over the
aircraft in flight is necessary before take-offs and landings can be attempted.
Straight and level flight is a mandatory skill that must be acquired before
progressing to turns, climbing, diving, climbing and descending turns, high
speed flight, take-offs and the most critical task of all, landing the aircraft
safely.

Select the training demo from the demonstration menu list (F1: main menu/
F1: simulator/ F6: demo options/ F4: demo training). You do not not need to
press F10 to close the menu; the training demo loads automatically from disk
and starts immediately.

Your aircraft will be positioned in the air for you with your flight controls
and instruments set appropriately. The aircraft is on position hold at this
time to maintain constant points of reference. From the simulator menu (F1) a
bank limit of 60 degrees (F4) and pitch limit of 20 degrees (F5) is set to
start you off. Your movement through the air is inhibited from the training
menu to allow easier familiarisation with the response of the aircraft to the
controls.

Ideally, your monitor should be positioned at head height and directly in front
of you. The mouse should be held so that your wrist remains in contact with the
running surface, thereby creating a datum for it's centre position. It is worth
while considering for a moment that flying an aircraft without the normal stick
forces per 'g' is more difficult. However with practice it will not present a
problem as long as you are aware that over control is a common early mistake.
Maintaining the centre datum and only using small movements to begin with will
help prevent over control.

Straight and level flight =====================================================

Pitch and roll the aircraft (move the mouse forwards and backwards for pitch
movement; side to side for roll). Note the way the Artificial Horizon reflects
the changes in aircraft attitude. Also pay attention to the rate of climb or
descent indicated on the VSI and by the HUD VSI marker.

Turn on the HUD horizon (Key H) which will assist you in telling which way the
aircraft is moving. Now try to fly straight and level, a task more tricky than
it sounds. Straight means wings parallel with the ground, level means no
indicated vertical speed. Check your instruments repeatedly to maintain
attitude but also pay attention to the outside world; a pilot never relies on
instruments when his eyes will tell him what he wants to know. Always aim for a
point just above the horizon, not at it.

If the aircraft is too difficult for you to control, adjust the stick
sensitivity (KEYS: ; and '@@) but remember that although it takes longer for the
aircraft to adopt an extreme attitude it also takes longer returning to
straight and level flight.

Remember to scan the instruments regularly, developing a scanning pattern that
will become second nature to the good pilot. Pay particular attention to your
altitude; during training it is easy to lose a great deal of height without
realizing the extent of the dive, since your thoughts may be diverted to more
pragmatic tasks such as recovering some modicum of control.

If the Auto-pilot (AP) is turned on during flight (Key Insert) but no
navigation data has been programmed (TG, WP or CA showing on the panel) the AP
will attempt to fly the aircraft straight and level at the current heading and
altitude. If you begin to lose control during flight, turn on the AP and watch
it recover the aircraft (usually). Watch the AP fly the aircraft; study the
instruments and note especially how little input is made to keep the aircraft
under control.

After a short while you should be able to intercept the instruments and take
immediate recovery action according to the information they display. Select the
weather menu (F1: F8) and set up some air turbulence by pressing F6. The
turbulence value next to the F2 entry will change to a question mark. Type in a
new value using the keys at the top of the keyboard, and press return. Turn
turbulence on by pressing F2.

Now make sure that you can still maintain straight and level flight. Low
control sensitivity will prevent you from accomplishing this when there is much
turbulence.

Turn turbulence off. Set the AIAS to 160 knots and note the rate of reduction
of airspeed whilst maintaining level flight. Note how the angle of attack,
shown on the AOA meter, increases while maintaining level flight as the
airspeed falls. You will also discover that at slow speeds the sensitivity of
the aircraft controls is reduced.

Turning the aircraft ==========================================================

Turning the aircraft combines several component techniques. First, the correct
amount of control input must be made to bank the aircraft and a small amount of
upward pitch is input to keep the aircraft level, otherwise it will lose
altitude. The correct sequence of input is bank first, then pitch. At the same
time, some rudder input is required to keep the turn coordinated i.e. the tail
is flying round the curvature of the turn rather than being dragged round,
merely following the nose. (Uncoordinated turns are far less efficient in terms
of lift and drag).

Once the correct turn rate has been established by the amount of bank, the
control can be returned to a central position, with only small additional input
required to keep the plane in the turn. Once banked, an aircraft will maintain
the altitude with only slight tendencies to right itself or bank further. Do
not hold the stick over to the side when in the turn, or the aircraft will
continue to bank until all lift is lost, or the aircraft inverts.

Coming out of a turn at the correct heading is the final component of the
turn. Depending on the turn rate, the pilot will have to correct the banking
angle before the aircraft actually reaches the desired heading.

If you are continuing form the previous exercise, set the AIAS to 300 knots.
Select the HUD menu (F1: main menu/ F9: HUD menu) and turn on the Flight Path
(F5) and Auto-Pilot Error modes (F8).

Engage the AP (Key Insert) and alter the aircraft heading with the rudder bar
(mouse buttons). Note the Flight Director fly to line pointing towards the
centre of the turn and the position of the Auto-Pilot error cross. This cross
tells you where the AP is aiming. If you should inadvertently alter the AP
height setting by moving the stick backwards or forwards, just turn the AP off
and then on again.

Remember that the correct way to enter a level turn is bank followed by pitch.
Exiting the turn requires the reverse order. Turn the AP off (Key Insert) and
execute level turns with up to 30 degrees of bank. Almost no pitch adjustment
is required.

Increase your 'g' limit to 3 (KEYS: X and Z) and turn off the bank limiter in
the simulator menu (F1:F1:F4). Now pull higher 'g' turns keeping the fly to
line parallel to the horizon and the vertical speed to zero. Note how more
elevator is required when pulling higher 'g'.

Increase you speed to 550 knots and notice the reduction in turn rate. Increase
the 'g' limits but remember that sustained high 'g' turns will cause your
vision field to reduce as you black out. Release 'g' before you lose
consciousness.

Lastly, perform a level rudder turn by pressing either mouse button to yaw the
aircraft to a new heading without altering the pitch or angle of attack. There
is also a secondary effect of rudder in that the aircraft rolls towards the
turn. By using opposite aileron this may be cancelled.


Taking Off ====================================================================

Before take-off, you must ensure that all pre-flight checks have been completed

From the main menu, select the simulator menu, then demo options and select
Demo Take-Off (F1: F1: F6: F3). Press any key to interrupt the demo as soon as
the aircraft appears on the runway. You will be prompted to confirm you wish to
interrupt the demo. Press Y to confirm, any other key to continue.

Centre the controls, then set the AIAS throttle to the required airspeed for
flight. The engine management computer will apply full power for take-off,
irrespective of the programmed flight speed.

When the engines have developed full thrust, release the brakes. If the
aircraft is lined up with the runway centre line, no steering will be required.
Keep the controls centred. When the aircraft reaches rotation speed, the nose
will lift. Pull the stick back, but only by a small amount or the aircraft will
leap into the air, exceed the maximum angle of attack and stall, probably
ending in a crash onto the runway.

As the aircraft leaves the ground, the HUD altimeter display will show the
height above ground up to 200ft. Raise your undercarriage (Key G) at 40 feet
and concentrate on keeping the rate of climb modest and steady. Do not let the
aircraft bank. When you are confident of taking off in zero wind condition,
select the weather menu and enter some mid-range values for wind velocity and
direction (try 120 degrees for a tricky crosswind), plus a turbulence value if
you feel confident enough. Typically, sudden crosswinds may catch one wing and
bank the aircraft suddenly when only a few feet off the ground.


Climbing/Descending ===========================================================

Turn the bank and pitch limits off (F1: F1: F4 and F5 if selected) and set a
'g' limit of 3. Establish straight and level flight at 500 knots, then pull
the aircraft into a 30 degree climb. Use the instrument panel Artificial
Horizon to establish this angle; the first marker line above and below the
aircraft symbol indicates 10 degrees pitch, the second line 30 degrees, third
line 50 degrees and forth line, 70 degrees. In order to maintain a constant
climb angle, watch the HUD horizon bars; make sure the rate they scroll doesn't
speed up or slow down.

Note the position of the small V.S. mark, which indicates higher ascent/descent
values: this should be constant. Now, keeping the wings level, push the
aircraft down into a 30 degree dive. When you are confident of performing
these manoeuvres without overshooting pull the aircraft into a 45 degree
climb and note your exact heading. Then pull up instead of puching the aircraft
into a 45 degree dive continue the roll in the same direction until the
aircraft is flying in a normal attitude.

Is you heading still the same? No? Well, try the manoeuvre again but as you
roll into inverted flight and then roll out unload the wings to reduce the
heading change. Don't be discouraged if you experience difficulties during a
pulled, inverted dive. It is much harder to control and the change in
orientation takes some getting use to.

Practise these manoeuvres pulling higher 'g' until you can change from a high
rate of climb to a high of descent without undue heading changes. It is
important to grasp the fact that you can alter your flight path more rapidly by
pulling instead of pushing 'g'. The trick is to remember where the inclined
lift is acting and make the correct stick movements. The Flight Path fly to
line should be of great assistance in telling you where the resultant wing
force is trying to move the aircraft.

Climbing/Descending Turns =====================================================

These turns are accomplished in the same manner as level turns except that a
constant vertical speed should be maintained. Try a few, particularly the
descending turns and note that high 'g' climbing turns result in speed loss.

By now you should be developing a fair degree of control over your aircraft.
Select night time on the visual and enable the stars (F1: F2: toggle F1: F7).
Practise flying the nose of the aircraft towards objects in the sky and on the
ground. Using high 'g' you should be able to point your aircraft very rapidly
at any object. You must practise this until you are proficient because if you
can't point the nose of the aircraft where you want you certainly won't be able
to make it fly where you want.

The Zoom Climb ================================================================

The Tornado is capable of reaching an altitude of 30,000 feet 1.7 minutes after
releasing the brakes on the runway. A zoom climb is used to attain the high
rate of ascent required. A zoom climb converts high speed level flight into a
high climb rate in excess of 50,000 feet per minute.

After takeoff, the aircraft is held low (500ft) while it accelerates to about
470 knots with the gear up. During this time the low angle of attack allows
maximum acceleration. The aircraft then pulls about 5 'g' into a 55 degree
climb, unloads the wings and maintains its pitch angle for part of the climb,
then further unloads the wings to level off at 30,000 feet without pushing 'g'.

The aircraft initially uses its inertia to achieve a high climb rate and then
maintains it with engine thrust and low drag. During the high 'g' pull up,
induced drag will slow the aircraft if the manoeuvre is too abrupt, the trick
is to reach the 55 degree climb angle before too much speed is lost.

High Altitude High Speed Flight ===============================================

Slew the aircraft to different heights and practise climbing, descending and
turning at different speeds. In the thinner atmosphere of high altitudes the
aircraft will respond differently to the controls and will not be capable of
sustained high 'g' manoeuvres. It is as well to understand now what happens if
you try to fly a fast jet at speed into the stratosphere.

If an aircraft is flying at Mach 2.2 at 40,000 feet and is pulled into a steep
climb without loosing too much speed, inertia will carry it well beyond its
operational flight ceiling. The aircraft will eventually be pulled back towards
the ground by gravity. During this time the airspeed may well have fallen to
zero with a resultant loss of control surface reaction. Drag and thrust are
also almost non-existent so speed is rapidly gained as the aircraft plummets
back towards the ground. It is important to maintain a low angle of attack as
the controls begin to bite on the air when trying to regain control of the
aircraft.

Flying Without Position Hold ==================================================

Only when you have mastered the controls of your aircraft sufficiently well to
be able to point it in any direction should you release the training menu
position hold options and fly. There are a number of reasons which contribute
to the inability of trainee pilots to effectively fly their aircraft. Check the
list below and if you are having consistent problems with any particular point,
go back to the training exercises and practise.


Landing =======================================================================

This section describes how to land the aircraft. Initially this process is
performed without wind. Landing in windy conditions is described separately at
the end of this chapter.

A successful landing requires that a pilot has learnt all of the basic skills
of aircraft control. Remember that humans are normally used to reacting to a
3-D world in 2-D planes (we are not creatures that fly unaided, more's the
pity). Landing an aircraft is more difficult in that it is a test of 3-D
thought and control.

Before the process of landing is explained some definitions are given which
will be referred to throughout the text.

Approach path
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The classic form of approach towards the airfield during which height, speed
and power are progressively reduced until the aircraft arrives at the touchdown
point with the engines throttled back. The aim is to maintain a constant rate
of descent down an ideal path of descent called the glide slope, and to fly
above a projected ground path called the extended runway centre line.

Final approach
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the descent to the runway which starts from a position some distance
from the airfield. The aircraft must be on the same heading as the runway,
following the approach path.

Round-out
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the change of attitude made from the glide slope to a path level with,
and slightly above, the runway.

Hold-off
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "hold-off" or "float" describes the period when the aircraft is flown
almost parallel to the ground with increasing angle of attack and falling
airspeed until it touches the ground.

Ground effect
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When an aircraft is flown close to the ground a cushion of air forms between
the wings and ground thus further supporting it in the air. A small correction
to the elevators will be necessary.


Instrument Landing System =================================================
The Tornado is equipped with an Instrument Landing System (ILS) which reads a
guiding beam originating at the airfield. The ILS tracks this narrow beam of
radio waves, transmitted up from the runway along the approach path.

`O6711		Fly up, fly right
`P6711
`Q6711
`R6711		Correct course
`S6711
`T6711
`U6711		Fly left, fly down
`V6711

In the Tornado the information from these beams is depicted in three ways, one
on the HUD shown using the ILS bars, and also using two instruments. (See the
section on HUD ILS options).

The Glide Slope Indicator (G/S) shows the vertical displacement of the aircraft
relative to the ILS beam. Negative displacements indicate that the ILS beam is
below the aircraft and hence height must be lost to attain the correct glide
slope. The G/S is located to the left of the artificial horizon.

The Localiser (LOC) indicates the horizontal displacement of the ILS beam.
Displacements to the right signify that the ILS beam is to the right of the
aircraft and so the aircraft should be slewed to the right. The LOC is located
above the artificial horizon.

The ILS receiver only functions when the runway is being navigated to and is
within range of about 20 n.m. Obviously the closer the aircraft is to touchdown
point the more sensitive the receiver is to positional errors.

Demonstration Landings ====================================================
Before attempting to land manually the pilot should become familiar with the
process using the simulator demo landing. Start by selecting the demo landing
from the simulator menu (F1: F1: F6: F2).

Watch the way in which the localiser and glide slope errors are reduced. Note
that as the localiser error becomes less, the heading of the aircraft is being
altered to align with the runway. Particularly notice the small bank angles
required when the localiser error is small. The most common mistake when
flying, let alone landing, is for the pilot to over-control his aircraft. This
is know as pilot induced oscillation and must be guarded against at all times.
(When the auto-pilot is approaching the airfield it deliberately flies below
the glide slope in order to round out with the Instrument Landing System
signals (ILS) still present. Do not copy this aspect of the approach; you
should always fly the correct approach path).

You may either choose to allow the demonstration to finish or end it by
pressing a key and confirming demo abort to take control of the aircraft. It is
best to watch at least one demonstration.

Landing practice ==========================================================
This section describes how the pilot can practise each aspect of landing his
aircraft. All landing exercises utilise the ILS display: instruction for its
operation will be given in the text.

The following is a list of the main objectives:

1	Flying down the glide slope.
2	Flying accurately over the extended runway centre line.
3	Flying along the approach path.
4	The correct approach speed.
5	The round out.
6	The hold off.
7	The touchdown.
8	Bringing the aircraft to a halt on the runway.

Maintaining the Glide Slope

The ideal path transmitted by the ILS, which the pilot should follow, is called
the glide slope, and begins at 600 feet, 2 miles from the touchdown point. It
intersects a point at 300 feet, 1 mile from touchdown and has a 3 degree
slope.

As it is easier to fly down the glide slope than over the extended runway
centre line, this aspect of landing is practised first. Do not attempt to
actually land on the runway; the exercises in maintaining a correct approach
must be mastered first.

Using the demo landing, abort it at the beginning of the final approach. Select
Hold North Movement from the Training Menu (F1: F4: F1) and wait until the AP
has cancelled any ILS errors (it will position the aircraft low on the glide
slope because the AP is unaware of the North hold and is expecting to fly
forward onto the glide slope).

If you wish to make the approach longer slew the plane back away from the
airfield before allowing the AP to position the aircraft. (Select Position Slew
from the training menu (F1: F4: F4) then use Keypad 8 and to move the
aircraft further or nearer the runway. Turn off Position Slew.)

When the aircraft is suitably positioned set East position hold and release
North position hold (F2: F1). You are now flying towards the airfield but
because the East West movement is inhibited you will be free to concentrate on
glide slope with a steady rate of descent. In the first approach, your engine
thrust will be set by the AP before handing over control. In subsequent
approaches ensure that your AIAS is set to 160 knots before you reach 200ft

altitude.

If you are too low reduce your rate of descent until the glide slope error is
zero. If you are too high increase you rate of descent. You will notice that
only small corrections are required. If, during the approach, you feel you need
assistance select the auto-pilot again. When you are about 200 feet off the
ground slew the aircraft back from the airfield and practise until you are
completely happy with your performance.

Before you go on to the next aspect of landing make sure that you can acquire
the glide slope when positioned some distance away and that you have learnt not
to overshoot it. If you are having particular difficulty acquiring the glide
slope hold the North movement until your vertical position is correct,
establish the correct rate of descent and then release the North movement.

Maintaining the Extended Runway Centre Line
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The same technique as for glide slope maintenance will be used but instead of
holding East movements, Height movements are held. Start by selecting the demo
landing, positioning the aircraft on the approach path with the auto-pilot.
Set Hold North Movement from the training selection in the main menu
(F1: F4: F1). So as to keep the runway in view when close to it, you may find
it helpful to slew the aircraft closer to the ground.

Slew to the right or left of the extended runway centre line and start with a
localiser error. To begin with it is probably a good idea to hold North and
Height movement and just practise reducing the localiser error to zero.
Practise deliberately flying off to one side and then back. Unless you are
confident of higher 'g' turns maintain a bank angle of less the 20 deg. When
you have learnt to position yourself over the approach path release the North
movement and fly towards the runway.

It is generally the case that novice pilots find this aspect of landing
difficult at first. There are a number of reasons for this and a brief
discussion about them should help you identify your own problems and how to
deal with them.

1.	Looking at the runway instead of following the ILS directions.
	Imagine that someone is pointing a gun at your head and that the only
	thing stopping them from firing is that the ILS cross hairs are exactly
	centred. You may find it easier by reducing the visual range, and
	thereby simulating a fog or low cloud approach, to concentrate on the
	ILS.

2.	Failure to adjust the aircraft heading to that of the runway by the
	time the localiser error is zero. The aircraft continues along it's
	corrective course for too long resulting in an error in the opposite
	direction. You must be watching the rate that the localiser error is
	reducing and noting the aircraft heading at the same time. You must
	also be aware that progressively smaller corrections are required the
	closer you are to the runway.

3.	Failure to take sufficient corrective action in time to reduce the
	error. If an aircraft, positioned over the extended runway centre line,
	is flown for 1 mile with the following heading errors it will move off
	by these distances:

			      OFF HDG | ERROR 
                              0.5 Deg.|  53 ft
			      1.0 Deg.| 106 ft
			      2.0 Deg.| 212 ft
			      4.0 Deg.| 424 ft
			      8.0 Deg.| 846 ft
			      16.0 Deg.|1675 ft
			      32.0 Deg.|3222 ft
			      
	0	181	363	545	626	909	1091
	|	|	|	|	|	|	|    Max G/S error (ft)
	0	439	878	1317	1756	2196	2635
	|	|	|	|	|	|	|    Max LOC error (ft)

		    Full deflection of I.L.S. indicators

	The illustration above shows how far off the extended runway centre
	line an aircraft is when the ILS indicators are at maximum. Consider,
	therefore, the course to fly over a 2 mile distance to reduce these
	errors to zero and end up on the correct heading. Bear in mind that you
	have 45 seconds in which to do it when flying at 160 knots.

4.	Having reduced the errors to zero, failing to maintain them at zero.
	This is achieved by making a continuous series of minute adjustments to
	the attitude of the aircraft in order to maintain the correct flight
	path. You will notice the auto-pilot doing exactly the same when close
	to the runway.
As before, repeat the exercise and only go on to the next stage when you have
mastered this one.

Flying the Approach Path
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now combine both your glide slope and localiser skills to fly along the
approach path. As before use the auto-pilot if you go too far wrong. A better
alternative to relying on AP help is to interrupt the simulator (Key I) and
move back in time (KEYS: F1 back, F2 forward) to a point where you were in the
correct position and try to avoid making the same mistake again.

Approach Speed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whilst you are learning to land and are building up confidence, 160 knots is a
good starting point. When making a final approach of greater distance you may
prefer to set a higher speed. If you make a high speed approach remember that
your rate of descent will need to be higher and your angle of attack lower. For
both these reasons it will be more difficult to reduce your speed if left too
late.

So far you have only practised flying down the ILS beam to a height of 200
feet. You will have noticed how the ILS receiver output is more sensitive to
errors the closer you are to the runway. When you are about 200 feet above the
runway check your landing gear and set a speed of 140 knots on the auto
throttles. This will allows the speed of the aircraft to bleed off during the
final moments of touchdown. During this time the pilot should be placing less
reliance on his ILS and flying the remaining distance visually.

Rounding Out
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the final moments of landing the pilot should refer to his height above
the runway (displayed by the HUD) and his vertical speed. He should be
levelling the wings of the aircraft, reducing his rate of descent to almost
zero just a few feet off the runway. Only very small rudder inputs are
allowable to correct heading errors. During this time ground effects will
become apparent.

Holding Off
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whilst a few feet clear of the ground the pilot should be reducing his speed to
130 knots and allow the aircraft to sink onto the runway.

Touchdown
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the aircraft is on the ground close the throttles, allow the nose of the
aircraft to settle onto the ground by pushing the stick forwards and apply the
air wheel brakes. Steer the aircraft down the runway using the rudder bar.

Landing with Wind
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only when you have total confidence in your ability to land the aircraft
without wind should you attempt to land with wind. The basic procedure is the
same as landing without wind. If there is a head wind then it is easier because
your speed over the ground is slower thus allowing more time to make any
correction along the approach path. If there is a small tail wind the converse
is true and because of higher landing speed it will take longer to bring the
aircraft to a halt on the runway. Remember that your airspeed is the same but
your speed over the ground is altered by the wind velocity. If there is a cross
wind life becomes interesting!

The correct way to land into a cross wind is to point the nose of the aircraft
towards the direction the wind is coming from, so the forward movement of the
aircraft cancels out the wind drift. Because the nose of the aircraft is not
pointing towards the runway it is important to use the instruments and not rely
on a visual approach. The auto-pilot will not be able to help you when making
cross wind landings. If will help to fly some 15 knots faster during
the approach and to keep slightly up wind of the normal track. This will reduce
wind drift and allow the heading of the aircraft to be more easily aligned with
the runway.

The principal difference concerning cross wind landings occur during the hold
off and touchdown phase. When the aircraft touches the ground it is travelling
forwards along the runway with it's nose pointing to one side. Before the nose
is lowered the rudder should be used to yaw it in the direction of the runway.
The nose should then be lowered and he aircraft steered in the normal manner.
There will be greater tendency for the aircraft to yaw off the runway until the
full weight of the aircraft is being supported by the undercarriage. You will
need to master this technique before you fly combat missions so practise it
now!

Use the same method to practise cross wind landings as for previous landing
exercises, but select from the weather menu a wind direction of 90 or 270
degrees. Set the wind velocity to 5 knots to begin with and gradually increase
it to 30 knots as your confidence grows.

	        Advanced Flying Techniques  

Aerobatics ================================================================
Both offensive and defensive air combat manoeuvres are basically aerobatic
manoeuvres. These are therefore explained before studying the classical air-
combat-specific manoeuvres.

Basic loop=================================================================
In this manoeuvre the aircraft is flown through 360 degrees in the vertical
plane, starting from level flight. Positive 'g' is pulled throughout but the
amount depends upon the amount of speed lost during the first half of the
loop.

To perform a loop note the aircraft's entry heading so that during the loop a
constant compass bar position can be maintained - except when vertical.
Airspeed determines how much 'g' can be pulled during the loop.

Gently pull the stick back and maintain a constant rate of pitch change
throughout the whole loop. The aircraft may attain speeds below the one 'g'
stalling speed so care must be taken not to stall the aircraft be referring to
the angle of incidence.

The stick forces required to maintain a constant pitch change decrease to a
minimum at the top of the loop where the speed is low and increase to a maximum
at the bottom where the speed is high. A correctly performed loop results in
the aircraft exiting the manoeuvre on the same heading and height as the entry.

Aileron roll ==============================================================
During an aileron roll the aircraft is rotated through 360 degrees about it's
longitudinal axis. The speed an aircraft is rolled at is not important provided
the pilot is aware of his height and speed at the start of the manoeuvre. A
higher entry speed will result in less height being lost and greater control of
the aircraft.

Performing a slow roll is more demanding, hence this manoeuvre is explained.
Chose an object on the ground to act as a reference point. Enter the manoeuvre
from level flight by raising the nose of the aircraft, then apply aileron in
the direction of the roll together with a small amount of rudder. As the
aircraft approached 90 degrees of bank progressively apply top rudder to
maintain height and use forward stick to maintain the heading. From 90 to 180
degrees the stick is moved progressively forward to maintain height and the
rudder to maintain heading.

Roll out of the manoeuvre using the same technique. Use the ailerons to
maintain a constant rate of roll. Use the elevators and rudder to keep the nose
of the aircraft pointing at your reference point. With practise a slow roll can
be done at a constant height and heading.

Barrel roll================================================================
In this manoeuvre the nose of the aircraft is made to travel around a spiral
path some distance from the axis of roll. Positive 'g' is applied throughout
the manoeuvre. To do a barrel roll, chose a point of reference and draw an
imaginary circle round it. Dive the aircraft in the opposite direction to that
which you intend to roll and join the circle at the 8 o'clock position if
rolling right or the 4 o'clock position if rolling left.

The aircraft is then pitched and rolled to follow the circle around the
reference point. A constant rate of roll should be maintained throughout the
manoeuvre.

Stall turn ===============================================================

During a stall turn the direction of the aircraft is changed through 180
degrees. Contrary to what the name suggests the wings of the aircraft are not
stalled in this type of turn, but speeds lower than the 1 'g' stalling limit
may be achieved during the manoeuvre.

The manoeuvre is entered from level flight by climbing towards the vertical
with the wings level. As the aircraft reaches the vertical ease the stick
forward and maintain the vertical attitude. Reduce the speed of the aircraft by
closing the throttles. As the speed reduces, apply rudder to cart-wheel the
aircraft around it's wing tip and prevent any roll with the ailerons. As the
aircraft begins to dive centralise the rudder and keep the wings level. Allow
sufficient speed to build before pulling out of the dive.

Aileron turn ==============================================================
The aileron turn is a roll done vertically downwards, and is achieved by
putting the aircraft into a vertical dive with the air brakes out, and
attaining an acceleration such that 'g' is reduced to zero when the vertical
is reached.
Pick a point on the ground and roll the aircraft so that when you pull 'g' out
of the dive the aircraft will be heading towards it. Note that the horizon
surrounds you when in vertical manoeuvre and that speed is rapidly gained in
the zero 'g' state.

Vertical roll =============================================================
This is essentially the same as an aileron turn but the aircraft is in a
vertical climb. Put the aircraft into a vertical climb and roll onto the new
heading when flying vertically. This manoeuvre is best performed at night using
the stars as a reference point.

Four point hesitation roll ================================================
This manoeuvre requires sufficient entry speed to support the aircraft in level
flight when vertically banked and inverted. The aircraft is rolled through 360
degrees but hesitated every 90 degrees. Roll the aircraft 90 degrees, apply top
rudder and push the stick forward to prevent any heading change. Then roll to
the 180 degree position while maintaining level flight by pushing the stick
further forwards. The 270 degree position is the same as the 90 degree
position.

An 8 point hesitation roll may also be made by modifying the manoeuvre. If
correctly performed height and heading will remain constant.

Half roll off the top of a loop============================================
This manoeuvre consists of the first half of a loop followed by the second half
of a roll. In this manoeuvre the aircraft heading changes by 180 degrees,
whilst height is gained and speed is lost.

Half roll==================================================================
The half roll is the opposite of the half roll of the top of a loop, consisting
of the first half of a roll followed by the second half of a loop. In this
manoeuvre the aircraft's heading changes by 180 degrees, whilst losing height
and gaining speed.

Derry turn=================================================================
A derry turn results in an aircraft performing a high 'g' turn in one direction
and then reversing the turn to the other direction by rolling through the
inverted attitude. The control movements are similar to a roll but the wings
are unloaded first to stop the aircraft turning before rolling and pulling 'g'
in the other direction.

Inverted flight ===========================================================
During inverted flight an aircraft responds normally to control movements but
the movement of the aircraft relative to the horizon is reversed. The main
features of inverted flight are:

*	The lift coefficient of the wings is less, therefore greater airspeed
	is required to make up for the loss.
*       Deploying flaps will further reduce the negative lift coefficient.
*	The stalling speed is higher.
*	There is more drag because the wings are less efficient.
*	Aircraft and pilots are not able to withstand high negative 'g'
	loading.

				
			     Combat  				

A pilot must achieve complete mastery of the air if he is to survive the deadly
'kill or be killed' game of aerial combat. He must also develop great tactical
awareness and keep a constant look out for his enemy using his radar. Contrary
to what people might think, there are no definitive tactics or manoeuvres to be
learnt. Although classical dogfighting techniques are studied and practised by
novice fighter pilots, a good pilot will develop his own repertoire of
manoeuvres which will exploit the best characteristics of his aircraft and the
worst of his opponents.

So far, you have used the simulator in training mode. This may be changed to
Combat Ready mode when on the ground and stationary, by selecting 2 in the
simulator menu.

Combat Mission Planning ====================================================

The Mission Planning menu selection (F1:F7) allows a primary target to be
programmed into the nav computer together with relevant way points. Targets are
depicted as boxes and show where your intelligence officers believe they exist
together with their type. As we all know, intelligence information may be
wrong so be prepared! You can move around the map with keys  7 8 9 / - + and
the mouse for fine position control of the Northings and Eastings.
Key P will select the current target you are positioned over as the primary
target. Primary target information is lost each time you land so remember to

select one before you take off.

Way points should be entered during Combat Mission Planning, thus allowing the
pilot to program his navigation computer with the best route towards the
primary target. This may involve a route which avoids ground obstacles, enemy
installations or awkward wind shear problems when he is making his final attack
run. The coupled approach mode is selected from the auto-pilot menu and allows
the pilot to navigate back to his home base or land. Provided the selection is
valid the BRG and DME will also work at this time.
If the auto-pilot is in AP TG mode during an attack run the pilot should
disengage it before the target is destroyed or before he over flies it. Note
that the auto-pilot may not be able to control a damaged aircraft.
Your score, as a percentage of the number of targets destroyed, is displayed
during the mission planning phase.

Target Designation ========================================================

Targets are divided into air and ground, with ground targets sub-divided into
primary and opportunity. The primary mission target must be selected from the
area map during mission planning.
Targets of opportunity present themselves as the aircraft flies over enemy
territory. Multiple air targets may exist, all of which are tracked by the
radar. The current air target list pointer may be incremented or decremented
by pressing keys [ ], which will rotate the selection. When a valid target
is found its radar return will flash on the radar display and a target
designator will highlight will highlight it on the HUD. Keys O and P select
ground opportunity and primary targets.

Stores ==================================================================

The number of missiles and bombs being carried can be displayed on the HUD
(KEY 0 and ). The type of missile selected is also changed by these keys 0
for Heat-Seeking and . for SKYFLASH), the current selection being confirmed by
a tick. The number of cannon shells remaining is displayed on the instrument
panel by the strip gauge (AMUN). When the aircraft is on the ground and
stationary the stores and fuel are replenished. In training mode there is an
unlimited supply of stores.

Available Stores ==========================================================
27mm Mauser cannon, with ammunition for 35 seconds.

4 AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, max range 8nm. This is a fire-and-
forget type of missile and may be used to engage the enemy from any angle.
However less success is achieved with 'beam on' crossing targets.
4 BAe Sky Flash Air-to-air missiles, max range 30nm. This missile is guided to
the target by your illumination radar. You must therefore maintain lock on for
the duration of its flight.
2 500lb high explosive bombs.

Weapons Operation=========================================================

Bomb Delivery System                                     Keypad 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CCIP bomb sight has a fly to line and cross hair. The fly to line indicates
to the pilot where the aircraft will be if the instantaneous course is
maintained. This should be directed towards the ground target. The cross hair
will indicate the point where the bomb would fall if it were to be released
now. The aircraft speed, height and attitude will dictate where the bomb will
fall. The cross hair will not be in view if any limit is exceeded.

A typical bombing run would commence at 300 ft and 400kts. Bomb release is
automatic and will turn off the bomb sight. Check that nav is valid and that
the bomb is armed before the run is started. Aim to place you cross hair over
his target centre cross hair.

Air to Air Gunnery                                       Keypad 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gun sight has a cross hair and ring. The cross hair indicates where the
cannon shells will converge should the gun be fired. This point will be
directly in front of you flying straight and level. When manoeuvring, the
cross hair will move about. The convergence range will be adjusted by an output
from the nav computer. For this reason the target must be acquired first.

If the target is out of range the ring will show as a large cross hair, its
size will diminish as the range closes. When within range the ring will be an
I shape. The pilot can choose at this time to use the deflection cross hair
and position it over the target cross hair and fire the gun. Alternatively he
may move the I shape over the target and radar elevate the cannon. This will
result in the cannon being directed to lead the target by whatever amount is
necessary to score a kill. The I shape will become a box when the radar has
locked on to the target. At this time the gun should be fired. Short accurate
bursts using the deflection sight will generally prove most economical with
ammunition.
Some enemy aircraft can jam your radar signal and prevent the elevated mode
from working.

Air to Air Missiles                                      Keypad 3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The missiles sight is similar to the gun sight but without the deflection cross
hair. In other words you lay the sight over the aircraft target and release the
missile. The size of the sight is larger than the gun sight but even though a
lock may be indicated the missiles cannot be released if your aircraft is
pulling too many 'g'. It is therefore useful to use the g ring together with
the missile sight and lock your enemy as close to 1g as possible before
releasing the missile. A missile is not guaranteed to score a kill - remember
that it has to fly there by leading the target. The AIM-9L can pull up to 30g
but not until it is moving fast enough. Remember that your opponent can jam
incoming missiles almost as well as you can but he can't jam a well placed
cannon shell!

MIssile Deception Jamming                                Key: D
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is important to scan you radar regulary and spot incoming enemy missiles.
During their last moments of flight a warning signal will sound in your head
set. A closing missile produces an ascending tone which changes to a descending
tone as the missile's range begins to increase again. It is sometimes too
late to jam the missile at this stage. The job of the 'jockey' or pilot is to
fly the aircraft whilst the navigator or 'back seat ballast' looks after
navigation and missile deception.

The pilot's 'head up attitude' together with his awareness of the tactical
situation will dictate when he wishes the navigator to jam incoming missiles
before pulling into a high 'g' defensive manoeuvre. This request for deception
jamming is relayed to the navigator by pressing Key D, and holding it down
during the defensive manoeuvre. Ideally missiles should be jammed during their
final 10 seconds of flight.

Air to air missiles can be recognised by the appearance of a high speed blip
leaving an enemy aircraft. Surface to air missiles can be recognised by the
sudden appearance of a high speed blip. Maintaining the correct radar range
setting is therefore vital to the early recognition of incoming missiles.

Combat Training Mode ========================================================

The combat training mode allows you to practise your combat skills against soft
targets. The air targets will use their weapons and you will be able to destroy
them, but unlike combat mode you can set crash inhibit and practise without
being killed.

Set crash inhibit (F1: F1) and take-off towards the bridge North of your
runway. When you are ready, select an air target from the training menu
(F1: F4: F5) and wait until it appears on the radar display. The air and ground
targets always appear from the same place, between the runway and bridge, to
allow you to choose your initial starting point for an attack.

When you have a target displayed on radar, set TG navigation mode (Key Delete)
and select the target. Ground targets are selected with KEY P, air targets with
keys [ and ]. Practise all of your aerobatic and air combat skills, using all
of your weapons, until you feel confident enough to engage in real combat.

Target Acquisition and Weapons Firing====================================

At first it is easy to forget the procedure, particularly in the heat of
battle. The target must be selected if the weapons system is to lock on 
O = opportunity ground target, P = primary ground target, [ ] = air targets).
The NAVWASS system must be suitably engaged i.e. TG mode (Key Delete). At this
time the radar display will highlight the target, BRG, DME become valid and if
the ND is selected (Key N) it will direct the pilot to the target.
The correct weapon must be selected, BOMB/GUN/MISSILE (Keypad 1,2,3). If a
missile is to used, the correct type must be selected. Finally the master arm
switch must be pressed. Bombs are automatically released because pilot reaction
time is too slow. Guns and missiles are fired with the Space Bar. There are
times when the enemy can effectively jam a missile during the critical release
phase.

Combat Objectives=========================================================

The object of your missions is to eliminate the enemy's air and ground
installations. At the end of each successful mission you will be able to save
the current state of the enemy's installations onto your work disk using the
Save Enemy Data Base option found in the Combat menu (F1: F5: F1). You can also
load this data base when restarting ProFlight on another occasion, taking up
the battle where you left off.
If there are any enemy aircraft still in your airspace after you have landed,
your mission will not have finished. You will have to deal with them by taking
off, destroying them, and landing again.
When planning you mission you are provided with intelligence information which
will help you in deciding how best to eliminate the enemy. This information may
not be wholly accurate, so be prepared for secret installations which are not
indicated on your map. Consider the purpose of these installations and how
their destruction will hamper the enemy's job of defending his airspace. Keep
cool at all times and try not to become hopelessly outnumbered. It is generally
better to nibble at the enemy rather than trying to bite off more than you can
chew.
The mission planning mode indicates your percentage kills; when this is low the
enemy will take less notice of you and will be establishing its best defensive
tactics, If you manage to dent his defences severely you can expect the enemy
to engage you with his best pilots and aircraft.
If your aircraft sustains battle damage this will be reported on the screen,
expect to compensate for changes in flight characteristics of the aircraft. A
crash will return you to your home base and reload the current enemy data base
if flying in combat mode.

Dogfighting ==============================================================

These manoeuvres are divided into two catagories, offensive and defensive.
Offensive manoeuvres are used by a pursuing aircraft to maintain the initiative
and to position himself for the kill. Defensive manoeuvres are used by the
quarry to turn the tables and become the pursuer. Both require the pilot to
make a rapid and continual assessment of his position relative to the enemy,
and to select his best course of action. For this reason a pilot is constantly
revising his strategy and is therefore unlikely to complete a text book
manoeuvre. To be predictable is to be dead. Both types of manoeuvre require the
pilot to make rapid changes of direction and speed to gain an advantage.
The following manoeuvres serve only to illustrate some of the possibilities and
may be used in a variety of situations. Remember that you are trying to prevent
your opponent from 'bracketing' you in their sights whilst manoeuvring into a
position where you can. It is more important to understand how you achieve an
advantage through using these manoeuvres, rather than when to use them, because
this will in turn lead to a better understanding of when to apply them.
(The illustrations have not been included for space reasons... maybe some
other time.)
High speed Yo-Yo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this manoeuvre you pull up into a stalled turn to lose speed and then roll
out into a dive behind your opponent. It results in a turn of small horizontal
area requiring a high 'g' pull up to the vertical and therefore a high entry
speed. It is sometimes referred to as a 'high-g yo-yo'. It could be used to
an advantage when an aircraft crosses in front of you and turns towards you to
prevent you from getting onto his tail.
Low speed Yo-Yo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The low-speed or low-g yo-yo again results in a tight turn, however because of
the low entry speed the aircraft is pointed towards the ground with the wings
unloaded to accelerate rapidly. The pilot is then in a position to roll towards
his quarry and pull out of the dive using higher 'g'. This manoeuvre could be
used to break the stalemate of a turning dogfight where both aircraft are close
to stalling and are unable to pull high 'g' without first gaining speed.
Flip Yo-Yo
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This manoeuvre is a variant of the low-speed yo-yo. The diving aircraft first
inverts his aircraft and pulls rather than pushes 'g' into the dive.
Lag pursuit roll
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pursuing aircraft transfers across the track of a turning aircraft by
executing a barrel roll. It may be used when the pursuing aircraft is
travelling too fast on the inside of a turn and wishes to transfer to the
lethal 6 o'clock position.
Break turn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a classic defensive manoeuvre performed by the quarry attempting to
frustrate the pursuers line of attack and make him overshoot. The quarry pulls
a high 'g' turn at the limit of his endurance.
High-'g' barrel roll
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this manoeuvre the quarry attempts to make the pursuing aircraft, which is
overtaking fast, overshoot. The air brakes are used and throttles closed in
order to decelerate rapidly while pulling 'g'.
Scissors
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If an aircraft has a low stalling speed it can be used to an advantage by
flying slow tight turns in order to get behind his opponent. If both aircraft
try this manoeuvre it results in the scissors. Both aircraft fly slowly round
each other trying to position themselves for a shot. The first aircraft to
stall or break away will be the loser. The scissors may be performed
horizontally or vertically downward in which case it is the ultimate game of
Chicken. When flying vertically downward a high AOA is maintained to prevent
the aircraft accelerating.
