=============================================================================

Atari ST Notes

Yuor computer must be in the low resolution mode in order to play.

Due to bugs in some versions of the ST's operating system, use of the
 underscore character when 
entering file names will cause the computer to crash.

To play Omnitrend's Paladin with only one disk drive, copy a quest (.QST)
 file and a paladin 
(.PAL) file from the Quest Disk to the Program Disk before playing. You 
 cannot swap the 
Program and Quest disks when playing Paladin on one disk drive.

To copy files from the GEM desktop with only one disk drive, do the
 following:

1) Insert the source disk in the disk drive. Double-click on the Floppy
 Disk A icon and select the 
file you want to copy by clicking on it and keeping the mouse button held 
 down.

2) With the button still held down, drag this file icon onto the Floppy
 Disk B icon and release the 
button. GEM will begin reading the file from the source disk.

3) When GEM asks you for Disk B, insert the destination disk. GEM may ask
 for either disk 
several times before the copy is complete.

Macintosh Notes

The Paladin program will run automatically when you boot the disk.

Use the "Quit to Quest" option in the Paladin program to run the Quest
 Builder.

Amiga Notes

When you are using the file selector box to enter the name of a file to
 save a paladin, quest, or 
saved game, click the mouse pointer on the file field (the rectangular box 
 to the right of the word 
"file") and type the name you wish to give the file. (Ex.: GAME16)

When running Omnitrend's Paladin with only 512K, some sound effects will
 not be heard.

IBM Notes

The IBM version of Omnitrend's Paladin requires DOS 3.0 or higher.

                                  - 2 -
=============================================================================

Notes

Whenever the manual refers to "the mouse button", and your mouse has more
 than one button, use 
the left-hand button. Omnitrend's Paladin only uses the left-hand button.

"Clicking" means "press the mouse button". "Shift-click" means "hold down
 one of the shift keys 
and press the mouse button at the same time".

The "current member" referred to thoughout the manual is the member who
 appears in the center 
of the Combat Window and whose statistics appear in the Member Statistics 
 Window.

Starting Omnitrend's Paladin

To play Omnitrend's Paladin, boot up the Paladin Program Disk and
 double-click the "PALADIN" 
icon (Paladin will come up automatically on the Macintosh). When the program
 finishes loading, 
the Paladin title screen will appear. To continue, click the mouse or press
 any key on the keyboard.

To start the IBM version of Omnitrend's Paladin, boot up the computer under
 DOS 3.0 or higher. 
Insert the Paladin disk and type "PALADIN" at the prompt.

Security Check

In order to play Omnitrend's Paladin, you must correctly complete a
 security check. To complete 
the security check, enter the word from this manual whose location is given
 by the dialog box. 
"Words" are any string of characters with a space or punctuation at either
 end. Once you have 
entered the correct word, the program will continue.

Starting a New Game

Select "New..." from the Quest menu. An item selector box will appear. All
 of the names that 
appear are 'quest files'. These quest files contain all the data for your
 party, the opponents, and 
maps of the combat area. What you are going to create is a 'game file'. This
 is a combination of a 
quest file and a 'paladin file'. More on the paladin file later.

Once you have selected a quest file, the quest item selector box will be
 replaced by a paladin 
selector box. This is where you select the paladin for your game. A sample
 paladin 
"BRANDON" is included with your game. Later on, you'll probably want to
 create a paladin of your own.

                                  - 3 -
=============================================================================
Now you have to name the game file in which your current game is going to
 be stored.

Once you have done this, the program will save the new game to the disk and
 your game will
start.

Important -  When a game file is created, it erases the paladin file you have
 selected and 
incorporates it into the game file.  This ensures that the paladin file
 can be used only by one quest 
at a time. The only ways to recover the paladin file are to win the game in
 progress or delete the quest with the "Delete..." menu entry. Deleting a
 game file outside of the game will also erase 
the paladin file which has  been incorporated into it.

Order of Play

Game play in Omnitrend's Paladin alternates between moving your own party
 members and the
computer moving its opponents.

The enemy combat phase will not begin until you shift click the Next icon
 or all of your party
members use up their movement points.

Player Phase - Each round begins with the player having the option to move
 all, some , or none of his members.  You can move a member until he runs
 out of movement points or you click the 
Next icon.

To Start the Enemy Combat Phase - shift click the Next icon.  If all of your
 members have used 
up their movement points for the round, the computer will automatically
 enter the Enemy Phase.

Each Player Phase takes 30 seconds of game time.

Enemy Phase - When the enemy attack phase begins, the member statistics 
 window will
change its title to "Attacks" and the legend "Enemy Movement..." will appear.

Enemy troops appear in the combat window only when they are attacking your
 men.

At the end of the enemy phase, the player phase begins again.

Movement Points

Each member is given a certain quantity of movement points (mp).  All of the
 member activities 
except for changing the view scale (more on that later) take up a certain
 number of points.  For 
example, moving onto a clear terrain square costs 2 mp, while swinging a
 sword takes 3 mp.  The 
combat activiites such as taking an object, swinging, moving, and using an
 object can all be 
mixed at your discretion during the same turn.

                                  - 4 -
=============================================================================

If you do not have sufficient mp for the activity you want to perform, the
 computer will inform 
you with an alert box.

If all of the mvement points for the current member have been exhausted, the
 program will
automatically advance to the next member in the party.

Movement points for each member are based on:  the member's character class,
 the vitality of the 
member, and the member's current encumbrance.

Deploying Your party

The members in your party always enter the quest through the entry
 pentagram. The entry
pentagram must be clear in order for your members to enter.  If a member is
 unable to enter, the
program will jump to the enemy combat phase.

You can continue moving a member until he runs out of movement points, gets
 stunned, or you 
click the Next icon.  Each time you click Next, the program will advance to
 the next member in 
the party who is in the combat zone, is not stunned, and has at least one
 movement point.

In addition, you can make any member who is visible in the combat window the
 current member 
by holding down the Alternate key and clicking on the desired member.
 (Macintosh players should 
use the Option key instead of the Alternate key.)

If wands of detection and rings of farsight are available, use them
 whenever possible. By saving
time searching for your objects, you raise the odds of successfully
 completing your quest.

Encumbrance

There are thirteen different types of objects which 
may be found in a quest. Each of those objects has 
an encumbrance value.  Encumbrance is a measure 
of the object's bulk.  Obviously, the bulkier the 
type of object, the fewer of them the member may 
carry.

Carrying a large number of encumbrance points has 
two disadvantages. One ,the weight reduces the 
number of available mp's per turn. Two, members 
carrying a large quantity of encumbrance points are 
more likely to be selected as a target by enemy 
forces.

                                  - 5 -
=============================================================================

Preface

The preface is a short description of your quest.

Prefaces usually include information as to the type and strength of enemy 
 you will be fighting and 
hints as to the location of any quest objectives.

Victory Conditions

The victory conditions are:

Rescue prisoners - You must rescue all of the prisoners in the quest if
 this is one of the victory 
conditions.

Obtain Scrolls - This works the same way as rescue prisoners.

Exit cobat zone - All of the members in your party must find and use the exit
 pentagram if this 
is one of the victory conditions.

Kill n% opponents - At least n% of the opponents in the quest must be
 killed if this is one of the 
victory conditions.

Quest time limit - All of the other victory conditions in the game must be
 satisfied before the 
time limit expires.  All quests have a time limit.

All of the victory conditions are non-exclusive, that is, more than one may 
 be in effect for a given 
quest.  Thus, in order to complete a quest you may have to rescue prisoners
 and move all of the 
party's members through the exit pentagram before the time limit expires.

Making New Paladins

If your party meets a strong foe and your Paladin is killed, you will need
 to create a new one. To
create a new paladin, run the Quest Builder program and select "New
 Paladin..."

Chaining Between Quests

Some quests lead directly into others. That is, when all of the surviving
 members of your party
have departed through the exit pentagram and you have successfully
 completed the quest, Paladin
automatically brings you to the next quest and creates a game file for you
 under the same name as
your previous quest.
                                  - 6 -
=============================================================================

There are two different ways Paladin may chain between quests. If the next
 quest has members for
your party already created, your current party will be replaced by the new
 one. If the next quest
does not have any members for your party, then all of the surviving party
 members from your last
quest are carried over into the new quest. Their health and vitality remain
 the same. None of the
objects they are carrying will be transferred to the new quest.

Quest Status

By using the Quest Status function, you can tell which victory conditions
have been satisfied and 
which need more work.

The possible status displays are:

  Victory Condition          Complete                  Incomplete
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rescue Prisoners      All prisoners recovered   Not all prisoners recovered.
Obtain Scrolls        All scrolls recovered     Not all scrolls recovered.
Kill n%  Opponents    Kill objective completed  More casualties needed.

Fighting the Enemy

If the enemy is using orbs of fire or fireballs, avoid clustering your
 members. Try to keep at least 
one square between each one.  This way, you avoid having three or four 
 casualties from a single blast.

Conversely, orbs of fire and fireballs are most effective against clusters
 of the enemy. Unless you 
have a large quantity of orbs of fire or fireballs, it is wisest not to
 "waste" these weapons against 
single targets.

Improving Your Paladin

Your overall objective is to improve your paladin.  You do this by
 successfully completing 
quests.

The more active a paladin is, the more likely he will see some kind of
 improvement at the end of a 
successful quest.  Accuracy is very important but seeing and detecting
 skills should be honed as 
well.

Paladins who have a fine hand with the sword and possess a superior
 knowledge of seeing and
detecting will achieve knighthood. With knighthood, your paladin will
 receive a superior sword
and armor.
                                  - 7 -
===============================================================================

Saving a Game in Progress

In order to save a game in progress, you must be at the beginning of the
 Player Movement phase.  

You may select menu entires, but clicking any of the icons or the combat
 window will prevent 
you from saving your game.  This is the only point at which you can save
 the game before 
quitting.

Closing a Game Without Saving

Select "Close" from the Quest menu.  When the program asks you if you want
 to save the game, click No.

Quitting Paladin

Use "Quit" from the Quest menu to exit the program.  If you select this at
 the beginning of the 
Player Movement phase, you will be given the option of saving your progress
 before closing.  At 
any other point, the program will quit without saving.

                                  - 8 -
=============================================================================

The Combat Window

The combat window is the largest window on the screen.  During the player
 combat phase, the 
current player member will always appear in the center of the combat window.
 During the enemy 
combat phase, the current enemy member will appear in the center of the
 combat window.

The Statistics Window

The member statistics window has several functions.  During the Enemy Combat
 phase,
information on enemy attacks are shown in the Statistics Window.  During the
 Player Combat 
phase, this window displays the battle statistics for the
 current party member.  These statistics are:

Moves - the number of moves left in the current member's turn.

Vital - the vitality of the current member.  If the vitality drops below 30%, 
 it will be displayed in 
red as a warning (Macintosh version excluded).

Health - the health of the current member. If this goes to 0%, the member is
 dead. When the 
current member's health falls below 50%, it will be displayed in red as
 a warning (Macintosh 
version excluded).

Enc - the current encumbrance of the member (NOT the maximum encumbrance).
  This figure will 
be displayed in green if it is greater than 0.  (Macintosh version excluded).

Accur - the accuracy of the current member's swordmanship.  If the member is
 ranger or a mage, 
this is a measure of his spell casting ability as well.

Detec - the percentage chance the current member has of successfully using a
 wand of detection.

Seeing - the percentage chance the current member has of successfully using 
 a ring of farsight. 

Countdown Timer

The countdown timer displays the amount of time remaining in the quest.

Wideview Display

The wideview display is a 21 by 21 composite map of the terrain surrounding 
 the current member. 
It can be displayed by clicking on the Change Scale icon. Information for
 this wideview is 
provided by other members moving through the area and rangers using wands
 of detection or rings 
of farsight.  When rangers use the wideview, opponents appear as flashing
 green squares on the Atari ST and 
Amiga, nested boxes on the IBM, and as grey squares on the Macintosh.

                                  - 9 -
=============================================================================

DROP OBJECT

Click this icon to drop an object

A dialog box will appear with a list of all the objects the current member is
 carrying.  Note that
the member's sword and armor will not appear on this list as they may not be
 removed.   Click on 
the name of the object you want to drop and then click "OK".

There are several reasons you might want to drop something.  A very good
 reason is that you no 
longer want to carry something because of its encumbrance penalty. You
might want to transfer 
an object from one member to another. In addition, the sphere of deflection
 works only if you 
drop it.

A dropped object always lands directly underneath the current member.  Only
 one object may be in 
a square at a time.

It takes 1 movement point to drop an object.

USE STAIRS    

Click this icon to ascend/descend a staircase.

If the corresponding square above or below the staircase is blocked by
 another member, the mouse 
pointer will change into a stop sign.  If the corresponding square is
 blocked by an opponent, the 
opponent will be killed and your level will be changed.

It takes 5 movement points to use the stairs.

TAKE OBJECT

Click this icon to take an object.

You can take any object directly adjacent to or in the same square as the
 current member. The 
object must be visible; you cannot take an object directly from another
 member.

The mouse pointer will turn into a pointing hand.  Click this on the object
 you wish to take.

Some objects have special messages written on them.  These messages appear 
 whenever the 
object is taken.

                                  - 10 -
=============================================================================

Whenever an object is taken, it increases the member's total encumbrance. 
 Encumbrance affects 
the number of movement points your member will receive at the beginning of a
 turn. Therefore, 
heavily laden members will not move at their highest speed.

It takes 1 movement point to take an object.

USE OBJECT

Click this icon to use an object.

A dialog box will appear with a list of all the objects the current member is
 carrying.  Click on 
the name of the object you want to use and then click "OK".

All of the objects and their uses are detailed in the section "Objects and
 Their Uses."

The objects require varying amounts of movement points to use.  They are:

     Object     	 Movement Points
-------------------------------------------------- 
     Orb of Fire     		5        
     Explosive Crystals         10        
     Potion of Vitality         3        
     Bag of Holding             N/A        
     Potion of Healing          9        
     Bolt 	                5        
     Crossbow		        N/A        
     Ring of Farsight	        9        
     Wand of Detection	        15        
     Sphere of Deflection       N/A 1         
     Amulet of Levitation       10        
     Prisoner       		N/A     
     Scroll        		N/A             

1 Sphere is activated by dropping it.

OPEN DOOR

Click this icon to open a door adjacent to the current member.

The mouse pointer will turn into a small key.  Place this key over the door 
 you want to open and 
click the mouse.  If you have enough movement points, the door will open.

                                  - 11 -
=============================================================================

The doors require varying amounts of movement points to open.  Pine doors
 require 3, Oak doors 
require 5, and Metal doors require 10.

SWING SWORD

Click this icon to swing the current member's sword.

The sword will be wielded in the direction that the member is facing.  If
 the swing does connect, a 
tiny skull wll appear on the target. This holds true for opponent-initiated
 attacks as well.

If the swing hits an opponent, the amount of damage that the sword
 generates is subtracted from 
the opponent's health, minus the amount of protection his armor provides.

           Armor   Non-Magical Attack        Armor     Non-Magical Attack
        Protection     Damage              Protection      Damage

1 Sorcerers only attack magically.

For example, an enemy fighter (armor protection = 30%) is hit by a swing
 from your paladin
(sword damage = 80%). The result is that the enemy fighter would lose 50%
 health (80% - 30% =
50% loss).
                                  - 12 -
=============================================================================

The same holds true for your own members.  Note that it is possible to shoot
 your own troops by mistake, so look before you swing.

Swinging a sword requires 3 movement points.

CAST A SPELL

To case a spell, shift click the Swing Sword icon. This will cause a dialog
 box with radio-type
buttons to appear.

Within your party, both Rangers and Mages can cast spells. Mages have the
 full complement of
spells, while reangers can cast only Detect Secret Doors, Confuse,
 Invisibility, and Speed spells.

NEXT BUTTON

Click this button to switch current members.  This will advance you to the
 next member in your 
party or, if you have just moved the last member in the party, loop back to
 the paladin.  

Shift click the Next button to enter the Enemy Combat phase.

CHANGE SCALE BUTTON

Click this button to get a "wide angel" view of the surrounding terrain. 
 Information for this 
wideview is provided by other members moving through the area and party
 members using rings 
of farsight or wands of detection.  When rangers use the wideview, opponents
 will appear as 
flashing squares on the Atari ST and Amiga, as nested boxes on the IBM,
 and as grey squares on the Macintosh.

ABOUT PALADIN...

The "About Paladin..." entry displays a dialog box with information about
 the program version 
and release date.

NEW...

"New..." is used to start a new game. This is a three stage process.

First, select the quest you wish to play. Next, select a paladin. If 
 there aren't any paladin files on 
the disk, you will have to create a new one with the Quest Builder program.
 Finally, enter the 
name under which this current game is to be saved.

When all this has been done, Paladin will create a game file, which means
 that you now have a 
game in progress on the disk.

RESUME...

Use "Resume..." to continue a game already in progress.

DELETE..

Use "Delete..." to delete game files. An item selector will appear with the 
 names of all the games 
in progress. Select any one of these.

Note that using this function to delete a game file will restore the
 incorporated paladin file.

SAVE

"Save" will save your current progress to the disk and continue play. You may 
 only save at the 
beginning of your Movement and Combat Phase.

CLOSE

Use "Close" to stop a game in progress. If you select this at the beginning 
 of the Combat Phase, 
you will be given the option to save your progress before closing. At any
 other character's point, 
the program will stop the current game without saving.

                                  - 14 -
=============================================================================

QUIT

Use "Quit" to exit the program. If you select this at the beginning of the 
 Combat Phase, you will 
be given the option to save your progress before closing. At any other point,
 the program will quit without saving.

PREFACE

The preface display contains background information for the quest and
 possibly clues as to the 
locations and strengths of your objectives.

VICTORY CONDITIONS

The victory conditions dialog box displays the objectives which must be 
 completed in order to win 
the game.

QUEST STATUS

The quest status dialog box displays whether or not each of the quest's 
 objectives have been met.

                                 - 15 -
=============================================================================

BASIC CHARACTERISTICS

MOVEMENT POINTS - Each member is given a certain amount of movement points at the
 beginning 
of his turn. Almost all of the activities a party member can perform use
 movement points (mp). 
For example, moving onto a clear terrain square costs 2 mp, while swinging
 a sword takes 3 mp.

Combat activities such as taking an object, swinging a sword, moving,
 casting magic, and using 
an object can all be mixed at your discretion.

If you do not have sufficient mp for the activity you want to perform, the
 computer will inform 
you with an alert box.

If all of the movement points for the current member have been exhausted,
 the program will 
automatcally advance to the next or loop back to the paladin if you were on
 the last party member.

Movement points allocated to each member are based on the member's class, the
vitality of the member, and the his current encumbrance.

VITALITY - Vitality is a measure of how well-rested a party member is. The
 higher the vitality, the 
more moves a party member has available in subsequent turns. If a member were
 at the 50% 
vitality level, he would have 50% of his maximum number of moves available.

As a party member moves about, his vitality is reduced at the same rate as
 his movement points. 
So if aparty member with 100% vitality fired a sword (3 mp) his new vitality
 would be 97%. 
Vitality is replenished at the rate of heath% divided by 4, which means the
 maximum rate of replenishment is 25% per turn (100% health/4=25%).

If a member's vitality is 0%, then the member is considered stunned, and he
 may not 
move until the next round.

HEALTH - Health is a measurement of the amount of damage a party member can
 absorb before
dying. When a member's health drops to 0%, he has died.

Above 50% health, a party member cannot be killed while taking hits. Below
 50%,however, a
party member can die while being hit, even if the hit does not drop his
 health to 0%. As the party 
member's health falls closer to 0%, the likelihood of this occurring is
 much greater.

ENCUMBRANCE-This is a measure of how many objects a member can carry

                                  - 16 -
=============================================================================

Carrying a large number of 
encumbrance points has two 
disadvantages. One, the weight
reduces the number of available 
mp's per turn. Two, the party 
member is more likely to be
selected as a target by enemy 
forces.

ACCURACY -  is the measurement of 
a party member's accuracy with a 
sword.  For party members with
spell casting talent, this is also a 
measure of their success rate with
spells.

DETECTING - is the measurement of how well a party member uses a
 wand of detection.

SEEING - is the measurement of how well a party member uses a ring of
 farsight.

MOVEMENT

As with any other function, moving your party member will consume some
 movement points.
Each terrain type (grass, rocks, grating) consumes a different amount of mp
 when it is entered. In 
order to move your current party member into a new square, he must have at
 least as many mp as 
are required to enter the square.

Terrain Type		MP Required	Terrain Type		MP Required
-----------------------------------     -----------------------------------

Clear			2		Bed			5
Dirt			2		Dresser			6
Grass			2		Table			5
Light Vegetation	4		Chair			4
Heavy Vegetation	6		Wench			4

Bard			4


		                  - 17 -
=============================================================================

The current member will always occupy the center of the combat window.

Party members can move in the four compass directions. To move the party
 member to a
particular square on his current row or column, simply click the mouse on
 the square. The party
member will march into the square or as far as is possible before running
 into a wall or running 
out of movement points.

If the party member does not have enough mp to move into the square, the 
 square is not of a type 
that the party member may occupy, the square is occupied by another player 
 party member, or the 
square is already occupied by an opponent, the mouse pointer will turn into
 a stop sign, indicating 
movement is not allowed.

To change a party member's facing without having to move the party member 
 from his current 
square, hold either shift key down and click on the adjacent square you wish
 the party member to face. This takes 1 movement point (mp).

In addition, you can make any party member who is visible in the combat
 window the current
party member by holding down the Alternate key and clicking the desired
 party member.
(Macintosh players should use the Option key instead of the Alternate key.)

COMBAT

SWORDS - All party members carry swords. These swords may not be transferred
 or exchanged. 
Swords cannot be destroyed by combat.

Specialty		Damage Sword Generates
---------------------------------------------
Paladin			80%
Ranger			65%
Swordsman		65%
Thief			45%
Mage			35%


It takes 3 mp to swing a sword.

ORBS OF FIRE - Orbs of fire will explode around friendly troops and it is
 possible to detonate one in
the same square as the current party member. Orbs of fire will also
 detonate oil casks, so caution
must be exercised when using them!

Orbs of fire explode in a 3 by 3 pattern, with the target in the center.
 Each square receives the 
equivalent of a hit from a90% sword.

EXPLOSIVE CRYSTALS - When explosive crystals are activated, they drop into
 the current party 
member's square. The explosive crystals ignore any objects which may already
 be in the square.

				  - 18 -
=============================================================================

Explosive crystals will explode around friendly troops, and it is possible
 to detonate one in the 
same square as the current party member. Explosive crystals will also
 detonate fuel tanks in the 
same fashion as orbs of firs. Caution must be exercised when using explosive
 crystals!

Explosive crystals explode in a 5 by 5 pattern, with the crystals in the
 center. Each square 
receives the equivalent of a hit from a 100% sword.

Caution: Once an explosive crystal has been activated, it cannot be aborted, but
 will explode at 
the end of the current party member's turn.

CROSSBOWS - A party member must have at least one bolt and one crossbow in
 order to fire.

When a bolt is fired, it travels in a straight line until it hits a valid
 target (i.e., a wall, a party 
member, etc.) or leaves the edge of the combat zone.

A target hit by a bolt from a crossbow receives a hit equivalent to a 90%
 sword.
	
Caution: Shooting bolts at targets not readily visible may result in damage
 to other party 
members or destruction of necessary quest objectives.

MAGIC

DETECT DOOR - will reveal any secret doors on previously explored terrain
 until the next Enemy
Combat Phase. All of your part members will be able to see the hidden
 doors.

Casting a detect door spell takes 10 movement points.

CONFUSE - makes approaching opponents think that they cannot cross
 particular patches of terrain. 
In some cases, this makes the enemy thnk that it cannot reach you at all.

Casting a confuse spell takes 8 movement points.

INVISIBILITY - renders the caster invisible for the next 2 rounds. The
 caster cannot be followed or
attacked when invisible.

The invisibility spell cannot be cast on other party members.

Casting an invisibility spell takes 20 movement points.

MIND STUN - brings the affected enemy's vitality down to 0%, leaving it
 without movement points
for the next round. Vitality is returned to the affected at the normal rate
 (health/4% per round).

Mind stuns will not travel through closed doors or walls. 

			          - 19 -
=============================================================================

Casting a mind stun spell takes 10 movement points.

FIREBALL - is a ball of fire (surprise!) that travels along until it hits
 something solid, like an
enemy.

Fireballs explode just like orbs of fire, doing 90% damage to the 3 x 3
 area surrounding the target.

Casting a fireball spell takes 10 movement points.

SPEED - is a spell which allows the user to store up some extra movement
 points for the next
round. The user casts the spell and in the next Player Phase, the user will
 have an extra 15
movement points added to his total.

This cannot be cast on other party memebers.

Casting a speed spell takes 20 movement point.

TYPES OF PARTY MEMBERS

PALADIN - The paladin is your main character. This is the only type of party
 member who is 
created independently of any quests.

The long-range goal of Paladin is to improve this character, so it is very
 important that he (or she) 
does not get killed in combat. If this happens, the paladin's file will be
 erased. On the other hand, as the quest difficulty level rises, you will find it more and more
necessary to use the paladin in dangerous situations.

Paladins have a very sharp sword (80% damage) and heavy protective armor. 

SWORDSMEN - The swordsman is the basic parth member. They carry a heavy
 sword and they have a
fairly high level of mobility.

Swordsmen usually comprise the majority of any party.

RANGER - Rangers have very light, fast armor, and carry the same swords as
 swordsmen.

Rangers have spell casting ability, but they are limited to the Detect
 Secret Doors, Confuse, 
Invisibility, and Speed spells.

THIEF - Thieves have the same armor as rangers but a slightly lighter
 sword.

MAGE - Mages wear the same armor as rangers and thieves but they carry a
 very weak sword.

Mages are the primary magic using character class.

				  - 20 -
=============================================================================

BASIC CHARACTERISTICS

All of the enemies will guard quest objectives that are in their area. For
 example: if an enemy fighter is 
in the same area as a scroll, there aren't any player party members around,
 and capturing scrolls is 
an objective, then the enemy will guard the scroll until a party member
 enters the area.

FIGHTERS

Fighters are equivalent to your swordsmen.

Fighters can use crossbows and orbs of fire against your party. In
 addition, certain special fighters
can also cast mind stuns against your part.

DRAGONS

The dragons you will encounter on your quest are of the smaller, more
 common variety (Dracos
Vulgaris). These stunted versions of the true beast have lost the power of
 flight and have a
relatively weak fire-breathing ability. Dragons attack only adjacent
 squares.

TROLLS

Trolls are the dark rulers of the underground, although they often come to
 the surface to spread
their evil ways.
		                  - 21 -
=============================================================================

Trolls are adept fighters and can use orbs of fire and crossbows.

ZOMBIES

Zombies are the shambling undead created by demented mages to carry out
 their evil deeds.

Zombies are some of the most powerful and durable fighters due to their
 non-living status.

SORCERERS

Sorcerers are mages who have fallen upon evil times. They are dangerous
because they do not
need to be adjacent to a party member in order to attack him.

Sorcerers attack solely by magic, using fireballs and mind stuns.

SPIRITS

Spirits are all that remain of malevolent creatures that died long ago.
 Because they are not totally
attachec to the material plane, they have the unique ability to pass
 through any object or terrain
with no resistance whatsoever.

The spirit attacks by scaring. A scare from a spirit is the equivalent of a
 blow from an 80% damage sword.

				  - 22 -
=============================================================================

ENCUMBRANCE POINTS

There are thirteen different types of objects which may be found in a
 quest. Each of those 
objects has an encumbrance value. Encumbrance is a measure of the object's
 bulk. Obviously, the 
bulkier the type of object, the fewer of them the party member may carry.

Object		Encumbrance Points     Object		Encumbrance Points
----------------------------------    ------------------------------------
Orb of fire		1		Ring of Farsight	1
Explosive Crystals	5		Wand of Detection	3
Potion of Vitality	2		Sphere of Deflection	4
Bag of Holding		0		Amulet of Levitation	2
Potion of Healing	2		Prisoner		1
Bolt			3		Scroll			1
Crossbow		7

Members carrying a large number of encumbrance points are subject to movement
 point loss.

WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW TO USE THEM

ORB OF FIRE - A short-range magical grenade.

When a orb of fire is selected, the mouse pointer turns into a crosshair.
 Place this crosshair 
over any pont on the same row or column as the current member and click. The
 member does not need 
to be facing the target.

EXPLOSIVE CRYSTALS - are a very powerful "time delay" explosive device.

When explosive crystals are used, they are dropped into the same square as
 the current party 
member, ignoring any other objects which may be in the square. When the
 current party 
member's turn is over (running out of mp's, selecting another member, or
 clicking the "Next" 
button) the explosive crystals will detonate.

Explosive crystals explode in a 5 by 5 pattern, with the crystals in the
 center. Each square
receives the equivalent of a hit from a 100% sword.

POTION OF VITALITY - an elixir that restores vim and vigor to the character
 that uses it.

Each time a potion is used it will add 50% to the character's vitality for
 a maximum of 100%.

BAG OF HOLDING - is a magical bag that increases your maximum encumbrance
 by 10.

The effects are cumulative; i.e., 5 bags will provide 50 extra encumbrance
 points.

				  - 23 -
=============================================================================

Each bag will automatically increase your maximum encumbrance if you are
 carrying it. You do
not need to use this object.

POTION OF HEALING - is a special blend of herbs and spices that restores a
 character's health.

Each time a potion of healing is used it will add 50% to the character's
 health for a maximum of
100% health.

BOLT - is an arrow that fits into a crossbow.

In order to use a bolt, the character must also be carrying a crossbow.

When a bolt is fired from a crossbow, it travel in a straight line on the
 current facing until it hits
a valid target (i.e., an enemy, a wall, a party member, etc.) or leaves the
 edge of the combat zone.

A target hit by a bolt from a crossbow receives a hit equivalent to a 90%
 damage sword.

CROSSBOW - is a crank-powered rifle-type bow for firing bolts.

A crossbow by itself may not be used but must be held in order to use a
 bolt.

RING OF FARSIGHT - is a small ring which reveals all man-made structures on
 the same level as the user.

In essence, this will give you the floor plans to any level the user is on.
 You 
must be standing adjacent to a source of water for this object to work.

WAND OF DETECTION - is a magic device that reveals a large area of land
around
the user and any enemies that might be lurking about it.

When a wand of detection is successfully used, it reveals a 17 x 17 area of
 the
current level, centered around the user. If the user is not successful, it
 will
show only the terrain which has already been covered.

Successful detection will only show nearby enemies as flashing squares on
 the 
Amiga and Atari ST, nested boxes on the IBM, and as grey squares on the
 Macintosh.

SPHERE OF DEFLECTION - will absorb any incoming non-magical attacks.

A shield will also cause fireballs and orbs of fire to explode on contact,
 although the blast radius
of these items will remain the same.

When a sphere of deflection is hit, there is a 10% chance it will shatter
 and be destroyed.

				  - 24 -
=============================================================================

This device does not need to be selected from Use Object because it
 activates when dropped.

AMULET OF LEVITATION - allows the user to float above the ground, ignoring
 terrain costs and
movement restrictions. The only terrain types an amulet of levitation will
 not allow you to fly
through are closed doors, solid rock, and walls.

When the amulet is used, it remains active until; the member runs out
 of movement points, you 
click the Use Object icon again, select a different party member, or click
 the Next button. Each 
time a member uses the amulet, there is a 10% chance that he will crash at
 the end of his turn.

Once an amulet has been activated, the user cannot take or drop objects,
 swing a sword, use shafts, 
open doors, use objects, or cast magic. If the party member ends his turn
 over either a blank 
(black) or full water square, he will be killed and removed from the quest.

PRISONER - Prisoners are unlucky people being held hostage by the nasty
 powers-that-be.

A prisoner is not a usable item.

SCROLL - You know what a scroll is!

A scroll is not a useable item.

				  - 25 -
=============================================================================

INTERIOR TERRAIN

WALLS - The walls come in two types: wood and stone.
Explosive crystalss
will destroy any type of wall; orbs of fire will destroy wooden walls.
Swords will not penetrate walls.

Party members canot pass through or fly above walls squares using an amulet
 of levitation.

DOORS - Party members cannot move through closed doors.

Pine doors require 3 mp to open, Heavy Oak doors require 5 mp, and Metal
 doors require 10 mp.

Party members cannot fly above doors squares using a amulet of levitation.

EXTERIOR TERRAIN

WATER - Party members cannot pass through water squares, although they can
 fly over them if they 
are using a amulet of levitation.

If a party member using a amulet of levitation ends his turn over a water
 square, he is killed and 
removed from the quest.

SOLID ROCK - Party members cannot fly over or through solid rock squares.

SPECIAL TERRAIN

STAIRCASES - Staircases require 5 mp to enter, and another 5 mp to use.

THE ENTRY PENTAGRAM - In order for your party members to enter the quest,
 this square must be clear.

THE EXIT PENTAGRAM - If the current party member is on this square at the
 end of his turn, he is 
removed from the quest and will no longer be allowed to fight.

STUN FIELDS - When a party member passes through a stun field, there is a
 chance that he will be 
stunned and unable to move. This chance is inversely proportional to the
 party member's vitality. 
For example, if a party member with a vitality of 78% passes through a stun
 field, there is a 22% 
chance that he will be stunned.

TELEPORT PENTAGRAMS - When a party member enters a teleport square, he is
 teleported to a new
location. This can be anywhere, on any level.

EMPTY (BLACK) SQUARES - Party members cannot pass through these squares,
 although they can
fly over them is they are using a amulet of levitation.

				  - 26 -
=============================================================================

If a party member using a amulet of levitation ends his turn over a black
 square, he is killed.

IMPORT PALADIN - allows you to convert a Squad Leader character into a
 paladin.

First, a file selector box appears. This will list any Squad Leader files
 on the current parth. Select
a file and click Import.

Next, another file selector box will appear. This is to name and save your
 new paladin file. Enter
a new file name. Click Save.

You now have a new paladin. If your old Squad Leader character was STAR
 level, your new
paladin will be a Knight.

OTHER FUNCTIONS

SELECTING A TERRAIN SQUARE - Click any terrain square on the palette to
 select it. Clicking on the 
map window will place that square on the map.

MODIFYING AN OPPONENT - Holding a Shift key and clicking on an enemy
 character will 
display the Modify Opponent dialog window. Use this to change opponent
 attributes.

WRITING A MESSAGE ON AN OBJECT - Holding the Shift Key and clicking on an
 object allows 
you to write a short message which will appear whenever the player picks up
 that particular 
object. This can be used to hide clues within the game.

WRITING A MESSAGE ON A TERRAIN SQUARE - Holding down the Alt (Alternate)
 key and clicking on a 
terrain square allows you to write a short message which appears the first
 time a character passes
through the square. This can be used to name rooms or make terrain-type
 characters (such as the
bard) "talk".

SETTING A TELEPORT DESTINATION - Holding down a Shift key and clicking on a
teleporter square will 
cause a Teleporter Destination dialog box to appear. Enter the destination
coordinates and click OK
when finished.

The program does not check as whether the destination is a valid movement
 square or not. Check
twice or you might end up sending somebody into solid rock or the black
 void!

QUEST DESIGN NOTES

AVOID FEUTURISM

A quest could have 5 levels, 10 party members in the party, 50 opponents, and
 40 objects. Resist 
the temptation! quests are generally more successful if they are quick to
 start and play. Having 
to move 10 party members through a maze for 40 Player phases is NOT fun.

SUPERMEN NOT WANTED HERE

Imagine a party of 10 party members, each with the maximum of everything
 against a band of
normal enemies. Boring! Winning all the time is not the point of the game.
 Try and create
quests in which the player must logically deploy his forces. Good quests
 should be a test of the 
player's decision-making ability, not the random number generator.

				THE QUESTS

============================================================================

The following is a list of the quests included with Omnitrend's Paladin
 that you can play and
modify. Each entry includes the author's name, a difficulty rating, a brief
 description of the quest,
and a strategy tip.

HOUSE by Thomas Carbone

Difficulty Rating: Easy
Synopsis: Recover a deed and a land grant from a haunted house and it's
 yours!
Strategy: Explore every corner. Some of your men be overburdened.

TROJAN HOAX by Bill Leslie

Difficulty Rating: Easy/Medium
Synopsis: Rescue the disguised Princess Anne from King Agoraphobius's
Castle Recluse.
Strategy:There are two routes into the tower, if you look carefully enough.

FRIEND by Haywood Nichols

Difficulty Rating: Easy/Medium
Synopsis: Use supplies of medicine to heal your party and then rescue a
friend from a midnight troll sacrifice.
Strategy: Amulets of Levitation in combination with your rangers can prove
to be very effective for scouting-out areas. Remember that mages possess an
effective ranged weapon. Also, try not to overburdern your members
unnecessarily.

HANGING by Haywood Nichols

Difficulty Rating: Medium
Synopsis: Two ofyour village elders have been captured and sentenced to die
by handing in a short while. You must fo in and save them from the hanging.
Strategy: Your mages are mportant for long-distance firing. Exploding oil
casks will save you a lot of time.

RESCUE by Haywood Nichols

Difficulty Rating: Medium
Synopsis: Two of your men are being held by the evil trolls and a gang of
assorted riff-raff. You only have ten minutes to go in and save them from a
horrible death.
Strategy: At first glance it appears to be an impossible assault, but if
you look closely you will notice that the prisoners make the situation
winnable. Remember to use the mage's ranged firepower wisely.

=============================================================================

ARCHERS1 by Haywood Nichols

Difficulty Rating: Medium
Synopsis: Damaga 80% of the great troll army on the opposite bank of a
river.
Strategy: Use some of your men as advanced scouts so that the mage and
archers can attack from a distance without fear of being damaged. This is
the first of two parts and only the members that survive this battle will
be able to participate in the second half. At all costs, you should be
preserving men for later on.

ARCHERS2 by Haywood Nichols

Difficulty Rating: Medium/Hard
Synopsis: Steal a formula for a brightly burning oil mixture from a small
village.
Strategy: Much of the action takes place in tight quarters where the
indiscriminate use of orbs or fire will destroy the mission objective. In
the wider areas, many of the opponents are hiding just outside your view.
Avoid the temptation to use every last movement point when exploring.

PORTALS by Haywood Nichols

Difficulty Rating: Very Hard - Knighthood Quest
Synopsis: Travel through the four Kingdoms of the Portals and recover
prisoners and scrolls.
Strategy: There is an objective to be found in each of the four kingdoms.
Conserve some of the more important tools, such as amulets or levitation
and fireballs. Do not fire ranged weapons blindly.

INLET by Haywood Nichols

Difficulty Rating: Very Hard - Knighthood Quest
Synopsis: Once again you are out to obtain someone else's documents, this
time, the navigation charts to the prosperous port of HangSee.
Strategy: Almost all of the opponents are hiding outside of your view. Move
your men in such a fashion that they have adequate protection from all
sides. Use your rangers in conjunction with amulets of levitation to cover
extensive areas quickly. It is also very important that you locate the exit
area quickly.

(if you do not have a broken copy of Paladin), I have started each line on
