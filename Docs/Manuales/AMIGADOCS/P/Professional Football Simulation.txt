			THE NEW HEAD COACH
		PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION

READ ME FIRST!

Hi! Boy, are you going to have fun! But before you get started, a few comments:

1) Professional Football Simulation requires you to enter a password from the
documentation before you can play a game. Following the enclosed instructions
after entering "hc" to start a game, you will see:

Enter the word that is on:

	Page: x-xx
	Line: x

	Enter:

Open your manual to the page indicated. Starting with the line containing
"Professional Football Simulation by MicroSearch", which is line number 1, count
down to the line indicated. Type the first word on that line. Press RETURN and
the game will continue. If you misspell the word, you get three chances. If you
do not enter the proper word you cannot play the game.

2)  The documentation system, described in the accompanying instructions, has
chapters for various topics relating to Head Coach. Please note that the chapter
entitled "defense charts" does not include the defensive charts for zone
defenses.

3)  Not documented in the accompanying instructions is the ability for Head Coach
to talk. It is a nifty feature which was implemented after the documentation
was completed. However, the documentation is on the disk and may be read by
using the documentation system and reading the chapter entitled "dot commands", 
the ".SP" command.

4)  You cannot use the speaking capability on either master disk. You must use
the "make" facility to create a game disk that can use the speech feature.

5)  Man in Motion-Another way to adjust your formation before the snap of the
ball is to put a man in motion. To specify a man in motion simply follow your
formation specification with an "M", the name of the player to go in motion, and
the formation "spot" the player will occupy when the ball is snapped. For
example:

	IRYMHBWL.FBOW

This calls an "I" strong right, with a "Y" exchange. The "M" indicates a man in
motion. The HB will go in motion to the left and when the HB arrives at the
wing left position ("WL"), the ball will be snapped. In this case, the play is a
run to the FB through the 0 hole with wedge blocking. Another example:

	FLFLWSMFLFS.HB8+5Q0

This calls a far left formation with the FL in a wing strong (left) spot. The FL
will go in motion to the strong side, and when FL arrives at the flank strong
spot the ball will be snapped. The play is HB run 5 yards outside of the 8
hole, quick toss, and the onside guard pulls to block.

				Good luck and have fun!

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION

			SECTION 1
			INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Head Coach. You will have hours of fun as you enjoy coaching simulated professional football teams. Head
Coach provides exciting games without requiring you to be a football expert. You can be playing a game within minutes of
opening the package, using simplified play-calling capabilities. However, if you are a serious football fan, Head Coach can be
played at a level that requires the utmost in concentration, preparation, and skill.

HISTORY OF HEAD COACH

Head Coach began as an experiment in calculating random numbers and using remote computer terminals. That was 1965.
The computer was a large, main-frame computer system.

For over 20 years, Head Coach has been consistently acclaimed for its realism, ease of use, and level of sophistication. Head
Coach has been installed on two large main-frame computers, three minicomputers, and now two microcomputers.

It doesn't take long to get your first game started. Read this section, then read Section2, Getting Started, and then Section 3, 
Your First Game, will have you calling plays in minutes.

Section 4, The Playbook, describes the two playbooks provided--beginner and standard. You can have lots of fun playing with
the beginner playbook. However, most Head Coach players quickly progress to using the full standard playbook. Section 4
also describes how to modify the standard playbook and make your own playbooks.

Section 5, Calling the Offense, and Section 6, Calling the Defense, describe how to call offensive and defensive plays the way
the professionals do. Head Coach gives you the option of continuing to enjoy games using the playbooks, or learning the
offensive and defensive systems for very sophisticated play-calling.

You are greatly encouraged to read Section 7, Dot Commands. Head Coach has many features that provide a variety of game
playing options.

Section 8, Computer Teams, Section 9, The Game Plan, and Section 10, Team Files, describe how to play the computer, 
and construct game plans, and build your own teams, real or imaginary.

Section 11 League Play, describes the exciting world of league play. Head Coach provides all you need to organize, play, and
keep statistics for multiple leagues.

Section 12 Modem Play, describes how to play computer football in its most exciting form--over a modem. Head Coach
allows you and your opponent to be playing from different Amiga computers. The computers may be across the room
connected with a "null" modem and cable, or across the country connected by modems and telephone lines.

Appendixes are included that summarize the manual.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

Head Coach requires at a minimum an Amiga system with 512K memory and a monitor. However, if you have at least 1
megabyte of memory on your Amiga, many additional features are available. A second floppy disk may also be used to
advantage.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT

Technical Support questions and comments for future editions of Head Coach should be directed to the MicroSearch
HeadCoach Technical Support Group. Phone calls will be accepted Monday-Friday between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM CST. Or

			SECTION 2
			GETTING STARTED

It is very important to make duplicate copes of your Head Coach master disks prior to their use. The copies can be used for all
functions of Head Coach. The master disks should be kept in a safe place.

Duplicating Head Coach using one drive

1. Turn on your Amiga. When the Kickstart prompt appears, insert your copy of Kickstart.

Note: While Kickstart is loading you should check the Head Coach Master Disks to make sure they are write-protected. If
you are looking at the front of a disk there should be a square opening in the upper right-hand corner. If you cannot see through
the opening, the disk is not write-protected and could be accidentally erased. Slide the write-protection tab to the open position. It
should click into place and stay. Your disk is now protected.

2. When the Workbench prompt appears, insert your Head Coach master disk #1 into the internal disk drive (df0:). Your Head
Coach master disk #1 may be used whenever the Workbench prompt appears.

3. When the Head Coach master menu appears, type:

	diskcopy df0: to df0:

The diskcopy utility instructs you to insert the disk to be copied in df0: and press the RETURN key. Because the disk you want
to copy (Head Coach master disk #1) is in df0:, press RETURN. The disk copy utility begins reading your Head Coach
master disk #1.

After a portion of the disk has been read, the disk copy utility instructs you to insert the disk that will contain the copy and press
RETURN. Remove the Head Coach master disk #1 from df0:, insert the disk to receive the Head Coach copy, and press
RETURN. The disk does not have to formatted. The disk copy utility writes the data from the Head Coach master disk to the
copy disk.

The disk copy utility instructs you to alternate disks in the internal drive df0: until the copy operation is complete.

When the disk copy operation completes, the copy of your Head Coach master disk #1 is in drive df0:. Place your Head
Coach master disk #1 in a safe place. Reset your Amiga system by simultaneously pressing the "Ctrl" key and the two "A" keys
that are on either side of the space bar. Repeat the diskcopy procedure (diskcopy df0: to df0:) for your Head Coach master disk
#2.

When both master disks have been copied, insert the copy of the Head Coach master disk #1 into df0:. Reset your Amiga
system by simultaneously pressing the "Ctrl" key and the two "A" keys that are on either side of the space bar.

DUPLICATING HEAD COACH USING TWO DRIVES

1. Turn on your Amiga. When the Kickstart prompt appears, insert your copy of Kickstart.

Note: While Kickstart is loading you should check the Head Coach Master Disks to make sure they write-protected. If you
are looking at the front of a disk there should be a square opening in the upper right-hand corner. If you cannot see through the
opening, the disk in not write-protected and could be accidentally erased. Slide the write-protection tab to the open position. It
should click into place and stay. Your disk is now protected.

2. When the Workbench prompt appears, insert your Head Coach master disk #1 into the internal disk drive (df0:). Your Head
Coach master disk #1 may be used whenever the Workbench prompt appears.

3. When the Head Coach master men appears, type:

	diskcopy df0: to df1:

The diskcopy utility instructs you to insert the disk to be copied in df0:, insert the disk to receive the copy in df1:, and press the
RETURN key. Insert the disk to receive the Head Coach copy in df1:. The disk does not have to formatted. Because the disk

				2-1

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 2: GETTING STARTED

you want to copy (Head Coach master disk #1) is in df0:, press RETURN. The disk copy utility copies the contents of your
Head Coach master disk #1 to the disk in drive df1:.

When the disk copy operation completes, the copy of your Head Coach master disk #1 is in drive df1:. Remove your Head
Coach master disk #1 from df0: and store in a safe place. Remove the Head Coach master disk #1 copy from df1: and insert
into df0:. Reset your Amiga system by simultaneously pressing the "Ctrl" key and the two "A" keys that are on either side of
the space bar. Repeat the copy procedure (diskcopy df0: to df1:) for your Head Coach master disk #2.

Contents of the Head Coach Master Disks

Head Coach comes on two disks. The disks are named Head Coach Master #1 (headcoach1) and Head Coach Master #2
 (headcoach2), and contain:

	Head Coach Master #1:

	1 Megabyte version of Head Coach
	15 Teams
	1 Template team to help you make your own teams
	4 Playbooks
	2 Gameplans
	All data files required to play a game
	DOC utility for viewing Head Coach documentation
	MAKE utility for creating your own Head Coach disks
	STATS utility for using a telephone to exchange
	statistics between two Head Coach systems.

	Head Coach Master #2:

	512K version of Head Coach
	Documentation files
	LO utility for processing league statistics
	VIEW utility for seeing what files are on a disk
	Printer drivers

Head Coach Master #1 is configured so that you can reset your Amiga with Head Coach Master #1 in df0: and play a game.
Reset means simultaneously pressing the "Ctrl" and the two "A" keys that are on either side of the space bar. If you have a
512K memory Amiga, you can reset your Amiga with Head Coach Master #2 in df0: and play a game. However, before you
start a game you MUST make a backup copy of your master disks--it's for your own good!

Head Coach Master Menu

When your Amiga is initialized by inserting your Head Coach master disk #1 at the workbench prompt, the screen displays the
Head Coach commands you may enter. This display is the master menu. Head Coach commands allow you to:

	View the names of files on the disk
	Copy disks and disk files
	Create your own Head Coach disk
	Transfer statistics files to or from another Amiga
	Browse through the Head Coach documentation
	Edit disk files
	Redisplay the master menu
	Start a game

At the end of the master menu display, the following prompt is displayed:

	Enter 'help' for instructions, or a Head Coach command:

This is the master menu prompt. When the master menu prompt is displayed, you can enter commands to play games and
maintain your Head Coach disks. When an operation completes, the master menu prompt is displayed.

Following copying the Head Coach master disks, you can play games using the Head Coach master disk #1 copy as your game
disk. However, there is not enough room to save games, from leagues, and keep statistics. Therefore, Head Coach 2.0 provides
a utility program, "make", which will automatically build Head Coach disks containing only those files you need.

				2-2

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 2: GETTING STARTED

THE MAKE UTILITY

The make program will create your own Head Coach disks complete with the teams you want, optional printer drivers, league
files, statistics files, etc. In order to run the make program enter the following:

	make

Make displays a brief introduction and instructs you to push the left mouse button to continue. Make then asks you to enter the
number of disks you have on your system. If you have at least two floppy disks, be sure to tell make. The disk building
procedure is much faster if two disk drives are available. Make then asks if you would like to format a new disk. By formatting
a new disk, you create a new Head Coach disk that contains only those files that are required to enjoy the game.

After formatting a new disk, make then asks a series of questions about what to copy to the new disk. What files to put on what
disks depends upon how you will be using Head Coach. If you are not going to be supporting league play with its' required
files, you can put all the files you need on one disk. However, if you intend to support league play, it is suggested that you
build a two disk set.

Head Coach allows the following three types of files to be on separate disks:

	Programs
	Game files
	Documentation files

When building disks, make asks if you would like to copy the various types of files to the disk being built. For a two disk set, 
you will need to use make twice. On the first disk, format the disk and include only the program and if desired the printer
support. On the second disk, format the disk and include only the game files. Most Head Coach players simply use their copy
of the Head Coach Master #2 disk for the documentation files.

If you tell make you would like to support a printer, you will be instructed to insert the disk containing the printer drivers, 
normally Head Coach Master #2 into a disk drive. The Head Coach Master #2 disk contains a set of printer drivers. The
drivers are stored in the same format as they are stored on the Commodore Amiga Extras Disk. If you like, you can insert the
Extras disk. If you have your own drivers, you must have your drivers stored in the same directory structure as does
Commodore. That is, the drivers must be in the "devs/printers" directory.

Simply follow the instructions and you will have Head Coach disks customized for your use.

THE STATS UTILITY

For league play, Head Coach maintains a statistics file for each team. When starting a game, current statistics for both teams
must be on a disk. If you are playing an opponent using a modem and telephone line (see Section 12, Modem Play), you may
need to get the statistics file for your opponent from your opponent. You and your opponent must use the stats utility by typing:

	stats

Pre-arrange which computer will place the call. Follow the instructions and the stats utility will transfer statistics files as
required. See also Section 11, League Play, and Section 12, Modem Play.

The rest of this section provides information you need to get the most from your Head Coach system. However, if this is the
first time you have used Head Coach, you may be eager to start your first game. If so, you may type "hc", press RETURN and
turn to the paragraph in this section titled "Playing a Game" for final instructions on getting the game started. If you have a
512K Amiga, reset your Amiga with Head Coach Master #2 in df0:.

At some time however, take the time to read the rest of this section and the rest of the manual. The information will enable you
to get the most from your Head Coach investment.

DATA FILES

Information required to simulate games is stored in disk data files. Because the data files are text files that can be processed
using any text editor, you have the ability to customize your Head Coach system.

There are four types of files you may edit: team files, playbook files, league files, and game plan files. The team files describe
teams. They playbook files give easy to learn names to professional plays. The league files describe the makeup of a league. The

				2-3

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 2: GETTING STARTED

game plan files specify playbook plays that are to be used in specific game situations. The files are stored on your Head Coach
disks.

DATA FILE NAMES

On Head Coach disks the files are named as follows:

	name.type

"Name" is the name of the file (team name for example), and "type" specifies the type of file as follows:

	team	Team file
	pb	Playbook file
	gp	Game plan file
	lf	League file
	sa	Saved game file (saved game files cannot be edited)  
	stat	Statistics file (statistics files cannot be edited)  

For example, the standard game plan file is named:

	standard.gp

The team file for the Bulldogs team is:

	bulldogs.team

EDITING DATA FILES

To edit the files you must use a text editor ("Ed", for example). Use of the Amiga text editor "Ed" is described in the Amiga
DOS Users Manual. A brief description of some of the "Ed" commands is presented in Appendix A, Using Ed.

To edit a file, your Head Coach system must be displaying the master menu prompt. Type "Ed" followed by the file name, 
perform the editing functions, exit from the editor, and the master menu prompt returns to the screen.     

A convenient way to create a new file of a particular type is to copy an existing file of the same type to a file named as you want
the new file to be named. Edit the new file as required. For example, to create a new game plan file named "special.gp":

	1. Get the Head Coach master menu on the screen.
	2. Type:
		copy standard.gp special.gp
	3. Type:
		ed special.gp
	4. Make the appropriate changes in "ed."
	5. Exit the "ed" editor.

Your Head Coach disk now contains a game plan file named "special.gp" that is a modified "standard.gp" file.

TEAM FILE TEMPLATE

To simplify creating a new team file, Head Coach provides a team file template "template.team." The template contains all
the required lines for a team file, with places for data values that you provide. The template also contains comments that
explain the values that are required.

				2-4

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 2: GETTING STARTED

The values that must be provided are either numbers or alphabetic characters. Numbers that must be provided are indicated in
the template file by "xx". To indicate alphabetic characters that must be provided for names, the template uses "nn". For
example, the following is a template file line for a player description:

	xx nn nn xx

As described in Section 10, Team Files, the data values are: jersey number, name, position, and ability. Properly edited, the
required line might be:

	25 "JONES, B" WR 3.6

This indicates player number 25 is a wide receiver (WR) named "JONES, B" with an overall player ability of 3.6. See Section
10, Team Files, for a complete description of the format of team files.

To use the team file template to create a new team file named "pintos.team", perform the following steps:

	1. Get the Head Coach master menu on the screen.
	2. Type:
		copy template.team pintos.team
	3. Type:
		ed pintos.team
	4. Make the changes required.
	5. Exit the Ed editor

Your Head Coach disk now contains a new team file, "pintos.team."

The format of the files are described in the following sections:

	Team files are described in Section 10, 
		Team Files.
	Playbook files are described in Section 4, 
		The Playbook.
	Game plan files are described in Section 9, 
		The Game Plan.
	League files are described in Section 11, 
		League Play.

PLAYING A GAME

To start a game you must have the Head Coach master menu on the screen. If your Amiga is not powered on, turn on your
Amiga. When the Kickstart prompt appears, insert your copy of Kickstart.

If your Amiga is on, but the Head Coach system is not active, remove any disk that is in the internal drive df0: and reset your
Amiga system by simultaneously pressing the "Ctrl" key and the two "A" keys that are on either side of the space bar. How to
start a game depends upon if you have a 512K memory Amiga or at least one megabyte of memory.

Starting, you first game on an Amiga with at least one megabyte of memory.

When the Workbench prompt appears, insert your Head Coach Master #1 copy into the internal disk drive (df0:).

When the Head Coach master menu appears, you may enter any Head Coach command. To start a game, type:

	hc

				2-5

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 2: GETTING STARTED

After pressing RETURN, Head Coach asks:

	Are you starting up a remote Amiga game?

To initiate a game played on two Amigas connected by modems, click the "Yes" box and refer to Section 12, Modem Play, for
instructions on starting a remote Amiga game. To play a game on one Amiga, click the "No" box. Next you will see:

	Are your documentation files stored on a separate disk?

Because the documentation files are stored on the Head Coach Master #2 disk, click the "Yes" box. Next you will see:

	Enter the name of the disk, 
	or the name of the drive (i.e., df0):

Enter "headcoach2" and press RETURN.

Head Coach next asks:

	Are your files (teams, playbooks, etc.) stored on a separate disk?

If you are using the Head Coach Master #1, click "no" because the game files are on Head Coach Master #1. However, by
using the "make" utility, you can create a disk containing only the Head Coach program and printer drivers, and another disk
containing all files. If you are using a disk created by the "make" utility, and if you have your files on a separate disk, click the
"Yes" box, otherwise click the "No" box.

If you click the "Yes" box, Head Coach then displays:

	Enter the name of the disk, 
	or the name of the drive (i.e., df0):

You may enter either the name you gave to the data disk when you formatted the disk, or the drive in which the disk is placed.

The remainder of the procedure to start your first game is the same as that for a 512K memory Amiga. Skip to the section
entitled "Completing the start of your first game".

STARTING YOUR FIRST GAME ON AN AMIGA WITH 512K MEMORY

When the Workbench prompt appears, insert your Head Coach Master #2 copy into the internal disk drive (df0:).

When the Head Coach master menu appears, you may enter any Head Coach command. To start a game, type:

	hc

After pressing RETURN, Head Coach asks:

	Are you starting up a remote Amiga game?

To initiate a game played on two Amiga connected by modems, click the "Yes" box and refer to Section 12, Modem Play, for
instructions on starting a remote Amiga game. To play a game on one Amiga, click the "No" box. Next you will see:
	
	Are your documentation files stored on a separate disk?

Because the documentation files are stored on the Head Coach Master #2 disk, click the "No" box.

Head Coach next asks:

	Are your files (teams, playbooks, etc.) stored on a separate disk?

If you are using the Head Coach Master #2, click "yes" because team files are on Head Coach Master #1. If you are using a
disk created by the "make" utility, and if you have your files on a separate disk click the "Yes" box, otherwise click the "No"
box.

				2-6

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 2: GETTING STARTED

If you click the "Yes" box, Head Coach then displays:

	Enter the name of the disk, 
	or the name of the drive (i.e., df0):

You may enter either the name you gave to the data disk when you formatted the disk, or the drive in which the disk is placed.

COMPLETING THE START OF YOUR FIRST GAME

Next you see:

	Do you want to restore a saved game?:

If you want to start a new game, click the "No" box.

If you have previously saved a game (see Section 7, Dot Commands, the .SA command) and want to restart the game, click the
"Yes" box. Head Coach asks if you would like to see a list of the currently saved games, and for the name of the file that was
used to save the game.

Head Coach then asks:

	Do you wish to process league statistics?

If you want to either create new statistics files for the teams that will play, or update existing statistics when the game is over, 
click the "Yes" box. If you do not wish to process any statistical data, click "No".

Head Coach then asks:

	Do you want to automatically start a two computer team game?

Head Coach provides a special starting procedure if you want to start a game that will be played between two computer
controlled teams. If you click the "Yes" box, Head Coach will ask a few more questions then begin the game. When starting a
game in the automatic mode, Head Coach assumes that both teams will use the standard playbooks and game plans.

Clicking the "No" box starts up a game with neither team being computer controlled.

Head Coach then asks:

	How do you want to select the team files?

To type in your team file selections using the keyboard, click the "Keyboard" box. To use the mouse to select the team files, 
click the "Mouse" box. After the team files have been selected, the playbook and game plan files will be selected by typing on
the keyboard.

If you have at least 1 megabyte of memory in your Amiga, and you have used the mouse mode to select team files, the game
will be played using the mouse for all play calling and decisions. Once the game begins, you can use the ".km" dot command to
switch to the keyboard mode. See section 7, Dot Commands, the .km command.

The above dialog enables prepares Head Coach to start a game. To start your first game turn to Section 3, Your First Game, 
and have fun!

				2-7

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 3: YOUR FIRST GAME

				SECTION 3
			     YOUR FIRST GAME

This section describes how to start your first game, using the ability of Head Coach to allow simplified calling of plays.

A few introductory comments:

Throughout this manual boldface words, such as this, are defined in the attached glossary.

If you have an Amiga with 512K of memory, all of your selections will be made by typing on the keyboard. If you have at least
1 megabyte of memory, you may choose to use the mouse to make choices.

When keyboard examples are shown in this manual, your typed response is underline. All keyboard responses require type a
few characters and then pressing the RETURN key. The RETURN key must always be used. For all keyboard responses, you
may type uppercase or lowercase letters.

Head Coach can be played:

	between two players (player-controlled teams)  
	between a player and the computer (computer-controlled teams)  
	both teams can be computer controlled and you can sit back and enjoy the game!

To play a game, the participants enter play calls and commands. First the offensive team calls the offense, then the defensive
team calls the defense. The probable play results are predicted, the play is executed, and, if desired, the play execution is 
displayed on the screen.

When using one computer to play a game, always have the offensive player at the computer. When two players are playing
each other (neither team is a computer-controlled team), experience has shown that the player who is on offense should sit at
the computer, and the defensive player call aloud the defensive choices. That is,  the offensive player at the computer enters 
both the offensive and defensive choices and commands. Whenever possession of the ball changes, the two players exchange
places.

If, however, you are using audibles (see Section 7, Dot Commands, the .au command), the defense must enter the defensive call
without the offense knowing the call.

Whenever the ball is being advanced toward the opponent's goal, the ball movement is from bottom to top on your screen.

STARTING THE GAME

After following the instructions in the preceding sections, Head Coach displays a series of questions. Your responses direct
Head Coach how to start the game. This section presents the responses you must enter to start a two-player game (no
computer-controlled teams).

If you are playing alone, you must make both offensive and defensive calls.

To quickly start your first game, proper responses are shown with brief explanations. Detailed descriptions are found in the
appropriate sections.

If you are using the mouse for team selections, Head Coach displays the team files available on your disk. Use the mouse to
click first the visiting team, and then the home team, as instructed.

If you are using the keyboard to make team selections, Head Coach begins by asking if you would like to see a display of all
the teams on your game disk. Because there is no need to see the display for your first game, respond by type an "n" as
follows:

Would you like to see the current team files displayed (y or n)?: n

				3-1

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 3: YOUR FIRST GAME

Head Coach then instructs you to type in the name of the team that is the visiting team for the upcoming game. If they are in
the mouse mode, click BULLDOGS. If using the keyboard, type the team name BULLDOGS and press RETURN as follows:

	Enter the team of the VISITING team data file: BULLDOGS

When a team file is read from the disk, you will be given a scouting report summary of that team.

If in the mouse mode, you will be instructed to select both the visiting and home teams. Then you will be asked for the 
playbook and game plan choices. Playbook and game plan information is gathered first for the visiting team and then for the
home team, using the keyboard.

The playbook is a disk file that contains the plays that can be called, by name, for the given team. Head Coach comes with two
playbooks--standard and beginner. For this first game, tell Head Coach to use the beginner playbook:

	The standard playbook file for the BULLDOGS is "standard43"

	Enter 'B' for the beginner playbook, 
	      'S' for the standard playbook, or
              'E' to enter the playbook name: b

Press RETURN.

Next, Head Coach asks which game plan you would like to use.

A game plan is a computer file that defines the plays that will be called in specific situations. Head Coach provides standard
game plans that you can use to get started. Head Coach next displays:

	The normal game plan for this playbook is "beginner"
	
	Enter 'N' for the normal game plan, or
              'E' to enter the game plan name: n

Press RETURN

So far your responses have provided the information Head Coach needs about the visiting team. The same questions are also 
required to get the home team established.

	Getting ready for the HOME team...

	Would you like to see a display of the teams (y or n)?: n

	Enter the name of the HOME team: LONGHORNS

	The standard playbook file for the LONGHORNS is "standard43"

	Enter 'B' for the beginner playbook, 
	      'S' for the standard playbook, or
	      'E' to enter the playbook name: b

Press RETURN.

	The normal game plan for this playbook is "beginner"

	Enter 'N' for the normal game plan, or
	      'E' to enter the game plan name: n

Press RETURN.

You have now instructed Head Coach to start a game between the visiting BULLDOGS and the home team LONGHORNS.

				3-2

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 3: YOUR FIRST GAME

The team file for the LONGHORNS indicates that the LONGHORNS home field is an indoor stadium. Head Coach next asks
if the home field is the location of the game. For this first game it is, so respond as follows:

	Is the game being played in the LONGHORN STADIUM (y or n)?: Y

Because the game is being played in an indoor facility, no weather information is requested.

Next Head Coach asks you to enter a number between 1 and 9999. Enter 1 as follows:

	Enter a number between 1 and 9999:1

It's almost game time now. The winner of the coin toss is displayed. The team winning the coin toss is told the current weather
information and given a choice of receiving, kicking off, or defending a particular goal.

Because weather is not a factor in the indoor stadium of the LONGHORNS team, the team with the choice (for example, 
BULLDOGS)  will choose to receive as follows:

	BULLDOGS you have a choice to receive, kick off, or defend a goal.

	Enter 'R' to receive the kick off
	      'K' to kick off or
	      'D' to defend a goal: R

The BULLDOGS chose to receive the kickoff, so the other team (for example, LONGHORNS) are given the choice of which 
goal to defend:

	Enter 'N' to defend the north goal or
              'S' to defend the south goal: N

From now on, the way to select plays and enter commands depends upon the current selection mode. Earlier you were told that
if you have at least one megabyte of memory of your Amiga, you may choose to enter play calls and commands with either the
mouse or keyboard. If you have 512K memory you must use the keyboard. When making choices you will be choosing
either an offense, defense, or a dot command.

A "dot command" is a special kind of input command, beginning with a dot ("."), that specifies some action to be taken. Head
Coach provides many game playing options in the form of dot commands. A few are described in this section. Dot commands
are described in detail in Section 7, Dot Commands.

Next you are instructed to enter a dot command, either ".KO" or ".RPn." If you are in mouse mode, you see a selection box
with:

	RUN	PASS	PLAY ACTION	MISCELLANEOUS

This is the offensive play selection menu. To enter a dot command (.KO in this case), click the "Miscellaneous". You will then
see a screen display of all the dot commands. To make a dot command selection, double click the desired command "KO". You
must click the KO selection twice.

Later when you are ready to make a play selection, click either "Run", "Pass", "Play Action", or "Miscellaneous" as appropriate.
For the run, pass, or play action, the screen will show all the playbook plays for that type of offensive play. Following the 
playbook choices of that type is a list of the dot commands.

If you are on defense in the mouse mode, you are presented with the following selection box:

	MAN-MAN		ZONE	BLITZ	MISCELLANEOUS

By providing the miscellaneous box, you can always enter a dot command. If you would like to switch between keyboard and 
mouse mode, use the .KM dot command, described in Chapter 7, Dot Commands.

If you are in mouse mode, click "Miscellaneous" and then double-click KO. If you are using the keyboard, respond with the
kickoff dot command as follows:

	Enter either.KO or .RPn (playbook mode): KO

				3-3

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 3: YOUR FIRST GAME

You have decided to kick off. There are three types of kickoffs: normal, short or onside. If you are in mouse mode, click the
appropriate box that is presented to you. If in keyboard mode, make your choice with the following response:

	Press RETURN for a normal kickoff
	or press 's' and RETURN for a short kickoff
	or press 'O' and RETURN for an onside kick:

Press RETURN.

When you press RETURN, you see the kickoff and the kickoff return. The game is under way!

CALLING PLAYS

After the runback of the opening kickoff, you are ready to send in your first play. Take a few seconds to study the scoreboard
that is displayed at the bottom of your screen. You have time to study the scoreboard because the 45-second delay of game
clock is not running. The following are displayed: current score, ball possession, ball position, down, yards to go for a first, and
time-outs remaining.

The beginning playbook that you requested contains a set of basic football plays to call. Section 4, Playbook Files, describes the
two playbooks (beginner and standard) provided in Head Coach. For now, here is a partial list:

	SWEEPR-Running play wide to the right.
	SWEEPL-Running play wide to the left.
	DIVER-Running play inside to the right.
	DIVEL-Running play inside to the left.
	DRAW-Looks like a pass, but it is a run.
	BOMB-The "BOMB" --long pass.
	FLOODS-"Flood" type pass to the strong side (right for this formation).
	FLOODW-"Flood" type pass to the weak side (left for this formation).
	SCREEN-Looks like a long pass, but is a short pass.
	HBPASS-Looks like a SWEEPR, but the halfback throws a pass.

Head Coach requests that you enter your offense. If the game is in mouse mode, use the procedure previously described. If in
keyboard mode, call the play by typing the name of the play and pressing RETURN.

To begin the game, call a SWEEPR:

	BULLDOGS enter offense (playback mode): SWEEPR

The " (playbook mode) "indicates that you may call the offensive plays by using the playbook name (SWEEPR) directly. This is
described in more detail in Section 4, The Playbook.

Now you must make a defensive call. Here are a few defensive calls to try:

	REGL-Normal, "safe" defense with no particular gamble.
	RUSH-Extra good against the rush, but weaker against the long pass.
	ZONE-Zone defense.
	B2-"Blitz" (rush) "two linebackers.
	DOUBLE-Double cover wide receivers--good pass defense against wide receivers.
	GOAL-Strong running defense normally used when the offense is about to score, 
	     or when very short yards are needed for a first down.

You now see the request for a defense. For your first call, start with a REGL defense as follows:

	LONGHORNS enter defense (playbook mode): REGL

With the offensive and defensive plays called, the play will be executed (complete with quarterback calls) and displayed on the
screen. When the play has been executed, the result of the play is displayed.

The cycle of calling offense and defensive plays continues.

				3-4

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 3: YOUR FIRST GAME

DOT COMMANDS

Before you begin to call plays on your own, a few of the dot commands need to be explained. All commands are preceded by a
dot "."--so they are called "dot commands". All of your responses to offensive and defensive plays will be either a play call, 
which does not begin with a dot, or a dot command. Some of the more common dot commands are:

	.CT-Enable or disable a team to be computer controlled.
	.FG-Field goal attempt.
	.PA-Point after touchdown attempt.
	.FK-Free kick following a safety.
	.KO-Kick off.
	.RP-Instant replay.
	.TO-Call time out.

Refer to Section 7, Dot Commands, for a detailed description of each dot command.

PENALTIES

A penalty will probably be called in your first game. When a penalty is called, and the play is over, Head Coach displays the
penalty and the team that committed the foul. The team with the choice must then indicate whether the penalty will be accepted
or declined. The team with the choice must enter either "A" to accept the penalty or "D" to decline, and press RETURN as
follows:

	LONGHORNS: Enter "A" to accept or "D" to decline: A

If you are is mouse mode, penalty choices are made by using simply boxes.

In this example, the LONGHORNS team has decided to accept the penalty. The penalty yards are marked off against the 
opposing team, and the down remains the same. If the LONGHORNS had decided to decline the penalty and have the play
results marked off, you would have entered "D".

You have called one offense and defense and seen the play result. You are now on your own. Call some offenses and defenses--
have fun!

				3-5

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH		SECTION 4: THE PLAYBOOK

				SECTION 4
			      PLAYBOOK FILES

A playbook is a computer file that assigns playbook names to detailed calls (detailed calls are explained in Sections 5, Calling
the Offense, and 6, Calling the Defense). By using a playbook, commonly used plays are given simple names, thereby making
them easy to remember and to call. Further, if you use detailed calls and discover a detailed call that works well, you can add it
to your playbook (while you are playing the game) with the dot command .PM. Adding to your playbook is covered in Section
7, Dot Commands. .PM command.

Head Coach provides two playbooks for your use, the beginner playbook and the more sophisticated standard playbook. Each
playbook comes in two versions. Both versions use the same offensive calls. Only the defense is different. Currently, 
professional football teams use a defensive alignment that is normally either a "43" (four linemen and three linebackers)  or a
"34" ( three linemen and four linebackers). Both playbook versions provide the same offense, but one uses a "43" defense and
the other uses a "34". The names of the playbooks and their versions are:

	beginner34.pb
	beginner43.pb
	standard34.pb
	standard43.pb

Note: the ending ".pb" is a file type. You do not have to enter ".pb" when you start a game.

The type of defense that the team normally uses is stored with each team file, described in section 10, Team Files. Storing the
normal defense for the team enables Head Coach to suggest which standard playbook to use when starting a game.

PLAY CALLING MODES

When Head Coach begins, both teams are in the playbook mode. In this mode, you call plays by entering the playbook name
of the plays. To call an offense or a defense, enter the name of the play, as described in Section 3, Your First Game. As you gain
more playing experience, either team may enter the detailed mode, which allows complete professional-styled play calling.

While in the playbook mode, each playbook call is converted into a detailed call. If you would like to see the detailed call that
is programmed, use the .DP command. Section 7, Dot Commands, for a description of the .DP command.

THE BEGINNER PLAYBOOK

The beginner playbook contains basic plays for offensive and defensive calls. The beginning offenses are:

	SWEEPR-Running play wide to the right
	SWEEPL-Running play wide to the left
	DIVER-Running play inside to the right
	DIVEL-Running play inside to the left
	DRAW-Looks like a pass, but it is a run
	BOMB-The "BOMB"--long pass
	FLOODR-"Flood" type pass to the right
	FLOODL-"Flood" type pass to the left
	POP-Quick pass which attempts to open a back "popping" out of the backfield
	SCREEN-Looks like a long pass, but is a short pass
	HBPASS-Looks like a SWEEPR, but the halfback throws a pass
	SNEAK-Quarterback carries ball over the offensive center
	OBPASS-Quarterback throws a pass out of bounds, to stop the game clock
	KNEE-Quarterback drops to a knee, to keep the clock running
	ROLLR-Roll out pass to the right
	ROLLL-Roll out pass to the left
	REVL-Reverse run to the left
	REVR-Reverse run to the right

THE BEGINNING DEFENSES ARE:

	ZONE-Zone passing defense
	B1-Blitz one linebacker
	B2-Blitz two linebackers

				4-1

	B3-Blitz three linebackers
	REGL-Regular (normal) defense
	DOUBLE-Double cover wide receivers
	GOAL-Goal line defense
	RUSH-Rushing defense
	PREVENT-Prevent the long pass

THE STANDARD PLAYBOOK

	STANDARD OFFENSE

The standard offense provides a complete offense with which you may attack any weakness in the defense. The offense
provides a variety of formations, runs, passes, reverses, and even provides plays with a player in motion before the snap. When
you have called an offense, the formation has already been chosen when the playbook was designed. For a description of the
Head Coach offensive formations available, see Section 5, Calling the Offense.

RUNS

Running plays are plays whose name begins with an "R". When you specify a run, at least two things must be provided:

	1. Who is carrying the ball
	2. Where to carry the ball

The ball is carried by one of the following backs:

	HB-HalfBack
	FB-FullBack

The place where the ball will be carried is called the point of attack, or hole. As shown in Figure 4-1, the holes are in the gaps
between the offensive linemen. The holes are numbered with the even-numbered holes to the right of the offense, and
odd-numbered holes to the left of the offense. Therefore, the holes to the right are the 2, 4, 6, and 8 holes. The holes to the left
are the 1, 3, 5, and 7 holes. The zero (0) hole is directly over the offensive center.

When you advance to detailed play-calling, you can specify the hole to be directly at an offensive lineman, or even outside
the 7 or 8 holes; see section 5, Calling the Offensive.

                         O
SE	7  5 LT 3  LG 1  CR  2  RG  4  RT  6  TE  8
			 QB					FL

	     HB                        FB

	FIGURE 4-1:  POINTS OF ATTACK  (HOLES)  

The names for the standard playbook running offenses begins with an "R" for run, followed by the ball carrier of either "HB" or "FB"
and specifies the hole by a digit from 0 to 8. For example:

	RHB8-Run, HalfBack, 8 hole
	RFB3-Run, FullBack, 3 hole
	RFB0-RUN, FullBack, 0 hole

This provides 18 running plays: two backs, nine holes each. For each of the ball carrier-hole combinations, the standard
playbook has selected a formation and type of blocking to use.

In addition to the basic 18 running plays, you can place an "M" at the end of the name and the play will include a player in
motion before the snap of the ball. For example:

	RHB8M-Run, Halfback, 8 hole, a player in motion
	RFB6M-Run, Fullback, 6 hole, a player in motion

So far 36 basic running plays have been described. All of the 36 basic running plays use formations that have the quarterback
immediately behind the center. For a running play executed from the "shotgun" formation, the play name begins with "GR"
(gun run). Following the "GR" is the ball carrier-either QB or FB. Following QB or FB is the hole, 0 through 8. For example:

	GRQB4-Gun run, quarterback, 4 hole
	GRFB8-Gun run, fullback, 8 hole
	GRFB7-Gun run, fullback, 7 hole

				4-2

There are no shotgun running plays with a player in motion. Therefore there are 18 shotgun running plays: two backs, nine
holes each.

The final type of running plays provided in the standard playbook are the reverse runs. In a reverse, the QB hands the ball to a 
running back who then hands the ball to second running back who "reverses" the flow of the play. The reverse run play names
begin with "RR". Following the "RR" is the final ball carrier-either "FL", "SE", or "HB". Last specified is the hole which is
either a "7" or an "8". This provides a total of six reverse runs:

	RRFL7-Reverse run, flanker, 7 hole
	RRFL8-Reverse run, flanker, 8 hole
	RRSE7-Reverse run, split end, 7 hole
	RRSE8-Reverse run, split end, 8 hole
	RRHB7-Reverse run, halfback, 7 hole
	RRHB8-Reverse run, halfback, 8 hole

One final run":RQB0". The ball carrier on this run is the QB, carrying the ball over the offensive center-the famous
"quarterback sneak". The above describes the running plays in the standard playbook. Note that the standard playbook includes
61 runs:36 basic runs, 18 shotgun runs, and 6 reverses, and the QB sneak.

PASSES

Passing plays are plays whose name begins with an "P". Following the "P" is a basic pass type. Four of the basic pass types are
designed to attack either the strong ("S") or weak ("W") side of the offensive formation. These four are:

	R-Rollout-Quarterback "rolls" out
	F-Flood-A number of receivers "flood" a side
	S-Screen-A pass completed in the backfield, with a blocking "screen" in front
	U-Under-A number of receivers clear out an area, and another receiver attempts to become open "under".

To specify one of these passes, the "P" is followed by either an "R", "F", "S", or "U". Next must be specified if the attack is
toward the strong side ("S") or the weak ("W") side. Next is the side of the field, left ("L") or right ("R"). For example:

	PFWR-Pass, flood, weak, right
	PRSL-Pass, rollout, strong, left
	PUWL-Pass, under, weak, left
	PSSR-Pass, screen, strong, right

This gives 16 basic passes. For passing deep, two pass types are provided. One places four receivers deep ("4D") and the other
places three receivers deep ("3D). Also, these passes can be thrown with a man in motion before the snap. The playbook
names for the "3D" and "4D" passes are:

	P3D-Pass, 3 receivers deep
	P3DM-Pass, 3 receivers deep, man in motion
	P4D-Pass, 4 receivers deep
	P4DM-Pass, 4 receivers deep, man in motion

The last pass type is executed from formations which place three offensive receivers on the same side of the formation this 
type of formation is call a "triple" formation. The "triple" passes are specified either to the right ("R") or left ("L"), and with or
without motion, as follows:

	PTR-Pass, triple, right
	PTRM, Pass, triple, right, man in motion
	PTL-Pass, triple, left
	PTLM-Pass, triple, left, man in motion

The passes described so far (24 passes) are all run out of formations with the quarterback under the offensive center. The
standard playbook also provides a set of passes from the shotgun formation. The passes run from a shotgun formation are called
"gun passes". The gun pass names are the same as the previously described 24 passes except they begin with "GP" instead of
simply "P". For example:

	GPFWR-Gun pass, flood, weak, right
	GPRSL-Gun, pass, rollout, strong, left
	GPUWL-Gun, pass, under, weak, left

				4-3

	GPSSR-Gun pass, screen, strong, right
	GPTR-Gun pass, triple, right
	GPTRM-Gun pass, triple, right, man in motion
	GPTL-Gun pass, triple, left
	GPTLM-Gun pass, triple, left, man in motion

This provides the same number of gun passes as there are non-shotgun passes-24. There are also two halfback passes. PHBR
and PHBL have the halfback running either right (R) or left (L) and then throwing a pass. This completes the description of the
playbook passing offense. With the basic passes (16 passes), the deep passes (4 passes), and the triple passes (4 passes), and the
same number of shotgun passes, plus two halfback passes, the standard playbook provides 50 passes.

CONTROLLING THE CLOCK

The standard playbook also includes two plays that allow the offense to manipulate the clock. To stop the clock, at the expense
of a down, the OBPASS play throws an incomplete pass. To keep the clock running, the KNEE play is used. In the KNEE play, 
the QB takes the snap from the CR and drops to a knee. This stops the play, but keeps the clock running.

This completes the description of the standard playbook offense. The standard playbook offense provides 61 runs, 50 passes, 
and 2 clock manipulation plays for a total of 113 offensive calls.

STANDARD DEFENSE

The defenses provided in the standard playbook provide defensive calls to meet any situation. Before describing these
defensive calls specifically, pass coverage, run coverage, and blitzing are described.

PASS COVERAGE

There are two ways to protect against a pass:

	Man coverages
	Zone coverages

In man (also called man-to-man) coverages, defenders are assigned an offensive receiver, 
regardless of the path the receiver takes. Man coverages always have each receiver covered, except in cases of mistakes, but
they are vulnerable wherever a defender is assigned to cover a receiver of better ability. These "mismatches" are particularly
vulnerable deep (long pass).

Zone defenses assign each defender a zone (area) to cover rather than a receiver. The defender covers any receiver that comes
into the area. Zone defenses protect against the deep pass better than man coverages, but they become vulnerable when more
than one receiver approaches an area. Placing multiple receivers in an area is known as flooding a zone.

When a defender is assigned a zone, there are actually four types of zones that may be assigned:

	Pick Zone-Area to cover is a circle around the defender.
	Side Zone-Area to cover is a circle extended to the sideline.
	Deep Zone-Area to cover is a circle extended down the field.
	Corner Zone-Area to cover is the outside corner of the field.

Often pass defenses are combination defenses, including both man and zone coverages.

Pass defenses are also improved when the defensive linemen ignore the possibility of a run and rush the passer. This pressure
applied to the passer can do as much to stop a pass as superior pass defenders.

RUN COVERAGE

Protecting against the run involves line play that ensure defensive presence at each hole and assigns defenders to each
potential ball carrier. Added strength against the run is accomplished by assigning more than one defender to potential ball
carriers.

BLITZING

"Blitzing" occurs when defenders that do not normally penetrate the offensive line or backfield attempt to do so. The defenders

				4-4

assigned to blitz will attempt to put additional pressure on the ball carrier or passer, at the expense of fewer defenders to protect
against a pass. Blitzing is almost always done in a man pass coverage to ensure that all receivers are covered.

THE DEFENSES

The defenses in the standard playbook begin with a letter that describes the basic nature of the defense, as follows:

	Z-Zone coverage defense
	M-Man coverage defense
	D-Double coverage defense
	R-Run defense
	B-Blitzing defense
	G-Goal line defense

ZONE DEFENSES

The zone defenses begin with a "Z". Next is specified the number of "deep" zones that the defense uses. The number of deep
zones is either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Therefore the basic zone defenses are:

	Z2-Zone with 2 deep zones
	Z3-Zone with 3 deep zones
	Z4-Zone with 4 deep zones
	Z5-Zone with 5 deep zones

This provides four zone coverages. Additionally, you may follow the basic zone defense with one of the following:

	D-Defenders play deeper than normal
	S-Defenders play shorter than normal

This allows a strengthening of the zone defense either deep ("D") or short " (S"). For example:

	Z3S-Zone, 3 deep zones, short
	Z5D-Zone, 5 deep zones, deep
	Z4S-Zone, 4 deep zones, short

This makes a total of 12 zone defenses.

MAN COVERAGE DEFENSES

The man coverage defenses assign man pass coverages. These coverages work well if the defensive player abilities match up
well with the defenders. Also, the man coverages work better against runs than do the zone coverages.

The man coverages begin with an "M". The next thing that must be specified is what defenders are going to cover the interior
receivers (receivers that are not wide receivers). To have the linebackers cover the interior receivers, use an "L". To have
defensive backs cover the interior receivers, us a "B". For example:

	MB-Man cover, defensive back interior
	ML-Man cover, linebacker interior

Man coverage allows you to provide some additional optional calls for alignment of defensive lineman. To make the additional
call, append an additional letter as follows:

	G-Defensive linemen play in gaps, rather than directly over the offensive line.
	O-Defensive linemen shift to the offensive strong side-this is called an "Overshift".
	U-Defensive linemen shift to the offensive weak side-this is called an "Undershift".

For example:

	MBG-Man cover, defensive back interior, linemen gapped
	MLU-Man cover, linebacker interior, linemen undershifted
	MBO-Man cover, defensive back interior, linemen overshifted

Man coverage also allows the use of the deep ("D") and short ("S") letter as was described for the zone coverage. The "D" and
"S" move the defensive backs and linebacker alignment for more effective coverage deep and short, respectively. If you would

				4-5

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH			SECTION 4: THE PLAYBOOK

like to specify both linemen assignments and deep or short assignment, use both letters with the linemen assignment first. For
example:

	MLD-Man cover, linebacker interior, linebackers and backs deep
	MBUD-Man cover, defensive back interior, linemen undershifted, linebackers and backs deep
	MBS-Man cover, defensive back interior, linebackers and backs short
	MLGD-Man cover, linebacker interior, linemen gapped, linebackers and backs deep

The above man coverage play calling results in a total of 24 man coverage defenses.

DOUBLE COVERAGE DEFENSES

When the defense is confronted with an offensive receiver of greater ability than the defender normally covering the receiver, 
double coverage may be used. Double coverage means that more than one defender is assigned to cover a particular receiver.

Double coverage play names begin with a "D". Following the "D" must be the type of defender that will be used to provide the 
extra defender. The "D" is followed by either:

	B-Double cover with a defensive back

			or

	L-Double cover with a linebacker

Finally the play name must specify the offensive receiver that will be double covered, as follows:

	F-Flanker
	S-Split end
	T-Tight end
	H-Halfback

For example:

	DLT-Double cover with linebacker, tight end
	DBF-Double cover with defensive back, flanker

In order to double cover more than one receiver, one of the following must be used:

	FS-Flanker and split end
	TS-Tight end and split end
	TF-Tight end and flanker
	TSF-Tight end, split end, and flanker

For example:

	DLFS-Double cover with linebacker, flanker and split end
	DBTF-Double cover with defensive back, tight end and flanker

The standard playbook provides 16 double coverage defenses.

RUSH DEFENSES

The following defenses are designed to be particularly effective against the rush, or run. Al use man defenses with extra
defenders covering potential ball carriers. The basic rush defenses are:

	R1
	R2
	R3

Each level provides additional keying to stop the run. The R3 defense is much stronger against the run than R1. As you would
expect, however, as the defenses get stronger against the run from R1 to R2 to R3, the defenses get increasingly weaker against
the pass.

				4-6

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH			SECTION 4: THE PLAYBOOK

The rush defenses also support making special assignments for the defensive linemen, linebackers, and defensive backs. The
use of "G", "O", "U", "D", and "S" have the same meaning as described above for the man defenses. A few examples:

	R1G-Rush 1, gapped linemen
	R2OS-Rush 2, linemen overshifted, linebackers and backs short
	R1UD-Rush 1, linemen undershifted, linebackers and backs deep
	R2U-Rush 2, linemen undershifted
	R3GS-Rush 3, gapped linemen, linebackers and backs short
	R1D-Rush 1, linebackers and backs deep

This provides a total of 36 rushing defenses.

BLITZ DEFENSES

As previously explained, blitzing is an attempt to put extra pressure on the offense by "blitzing", or rushing, players who do not
normally do so. The standard playbook provides four blitzes:

	B1-Blitz one linebacker
	B2-Blitz two linebackers
	B3-Blitz three linebackers
	BB-Blitz at least one linebacker and one defensive back

GOAL LINE DEFENSES

Goal line defenses begin with a "G". Following the "G" is an optional specifier for defensive linemen alignment as follows:

	G-Goal line, no defensive alignment adjustment
	GG-Goal line, linemen gapped
	GO-Goal line, linemen overshifted
	GU-Goal line, linemen undershifted

The above four are the basic goal line defenses. You may choose to append an optional specifier for double coverage, as
follows:
	
	GDT-Double cover tight end
	GDW-Double cover both wide receivers

For example:

	GDT-Goal line, double cover tight end
	GDW-Goal line, double cover both wide receivers
	GGDW-Goal line, linemen gapped, double cover both wide receivers
	GODT-Goal line, linemen overshifted, double cover tight end

The standard defense provides a total of 12 goal line defenses.

This completes the description of the standard playbook defenses. The standard playbook provides:

	12Zones
	24Man coverages
	16Double coverages
	36Rushing defenses
	4Blitzes
	12Goal line defenses

This is a total of 104 standard playbook defenses.

MAKING YOUR OWN PLAYBOOK

There are several reasons why you might want to alter the standard playbook.

	You have started making your own detailed calls and want to include some favorite calls in your playbook.
	
	You have started making your own detailed calls and wish to use formations other than the ones in the
		standard playbook.

				4-7

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH			SECTION 4: THE PLAYBOOK

	You may wish to give another name to an existing playbook play.
	
	Having scouted an upcoming opponent, you may want to add special plays you feel will be effective
		against that opponent.

The playbook is a text file that can be processed like any other text file within your Amiga system. You may:

	Copy
	Rename
	Delete (be careful!)  
	Type
	Print
	Edit
	etc.

PLAYBOOK FILE NAMES

The playbook files provided with Head Coach are named "beginner34.pb", "beginner43.pb", "standard43.pb", and
"standard34.pb". As you learned in section 3, Your First Game. Head Coach makes it easy to use these playbook names.
However, you may use any file name you like when building your own playbook files. The ".pb" at the end of the name is used
to specify the file type ("pb" means playbook), but it is optional. To use your own playbook file of any name, respond to the 
Head Coach playbook file name request as follows:

	The standard playbook for the (team name) is "standardxx"

	Enter 'S' for the standard playbook, 
	      'B' for the beginner playbook, or
	      'E' to enter the playbook name: e

Enter and "e" (or "E") and press RETURN. Head Coach then requests:

	Enter the name of the playbook file: file

This instructs Head Coach to retrieve a playbook file named "file.pb". Head Coach assumes that playbook file names will end
in ".pb". If you do not type a period in the file name, Head Coach assumes that ".pb" is part of the name. However, if you
would like to use a period with something other than "pb", Head Coach will not assume the end ".pb". For example:

	Enter the name of the playbook file: whatever.something

This example will cause Head Coach to retrieve a playbook file named "whatever.something". Because you provided a period
and a file type, Head Coach does not assume an ending ".pb".

Any time you are entering the name of a file, you may precede the filename with the disk drive containing the file, as:

	df1: whatever.something

MODIFYING PLAYBOOK FILES

There are two ways to alter your playbook. During a game, you may add or delete plays, and write the playbook back to the
disk. When you are not playing a game, you may use any text editor (ED, for example) to modify the playbook. See the PM
command description in Section 7, Dot Commands, for instructions for modifying your playbook during a game.

To use a text editor, you must first understand the format of a playbook file. The playbook file consists of a series of one-line
entries, each of which defines a play. The play definition consists of two parts--play name and play contents. Here is an entry
from the standard playbook:

	"SWEEPR"OR.HB8PF.FBL

The name of the play, SWEEPR, is enclosed in quotes ("). Following the play name are the play contents, which can be either a
detailed play call (as above) or another playname. In the SWEEPR example above, the name (SWEEPR) has been followed by
a detailed play call (OR.HB8PF.FBL), which defines the SWEEPR play.

				4-8

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH			SECTION 4: THE PLAYBOOK

You might like to add the ability to call a play by another name. For example, some Head Coach players prefer to use numbers
for play calls rather than letters. To assign another name to an existing play, follow this example:

	"1"'SWEEPR'

This playbook entry defines a play named "1". Enclosing SWEEPR in apostrophes tells Head Coach that SWEEPR is the
name of another play in the playbook. SWEEPR will be used to define the play named "1". During a game, the contents of
the play will be acquired from the playbook play "SWEEPR" whenever the player enters "1" as a play call. In this manner you may
assign multiple names to existing plays. DO NOT REMOVE the existing play from the file. It is used to provide the detailed
call.

To remove a play from your playbook using a text editor, delete the line that defines the play.

Building your own playbook is easily accomplished by using a text editor to add new play calls, delete old ones, or add new
names to existing calls.

Enter each playbook entry (play) on a separate line.

				4-9

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH			SECTION 5: CALLING THE OFFENSE

			    SECTION 5
			CALLING THE OFFENSE

In Section 3, Your First Game, you were guided through getting a game started. You called defenses and offenses using the
playbook mode, which allows simplified names to be attached to detailed professional style play calling. To make your own
details calls, switch to the detailed mode by entering the following dot command:

	.PB

Head Coach places your team in the detailed mode. Entering another ".PB" returns your team to the playbook mode. The mode
of calling is set for each team individually. One team could be in playbook mode, and the other in detailed mode.

If your team is in playbook mode. You have used the .DP command to enable the displaying of playbook contents, you are
using the beginner playbook, and you enter a SWEEPR offensive call, the following characters are displayed:

	OR.HB8PFQ.FBL

These characters are the actual detailed call for the SWEEPR play as recorded in the playbook. The detailed call consists of a
series of letters and numbers, separated by dots ".". When entering characters, you may use either uppercase or lowercase, and
blanks are ignored. Enter blanks wherever you like to make the calls easier to read.

Each character means something specific, is easy to learn, and provides the flexibility of real professional play calling. A
complete offensive play call consists of the following parts, some of which are required and some of which are optional.

	FORMATION		REQUIRED
	BASIC PLAY		REQUIRED
	PASS PATTERNS		OPTIONAL
	PLAY ACTION		OPTIONAL

FORMATIONS

In order to describe the formations, the following names are used:

	Linemen:
		Left Tackle (LT)  
		Right Tackle (RT)  
		Center (CR)  
		Right Guard (RG)  
		Left Guard (LG)  

	Basic 3 Receivers:
		Tight End (TE)  
		Split End (SE)  
		Flanker (FL)  

	Backs:
		Halfback (HB)  
		Fullback (FB)  				LT	LG	CR	RG	RT
		Quarterback (QB)  
						     Figure 5-1: Offensive linemen
The linemen (LT, RT, CR, RG, LG) are always aligned as
shown in Figure 5-1; no variations are possible.

The Basic 3 Receivers are positioned by specifying the		SE	LT  LG	CR  RG	RT  TE
strength of the formation. The strength, which is either Right					FL
(R) or Left (L), is the side that contains the Tight End (TE) and
the Flanker (FL). Figure 5-2 shows a strong right formation, 	    Figure 5-2:  Strong Right
and Figure 5-3 shows a strong left formation (without the
backs). Once the formation strength has been specified, the		TE  LT  LG  CR  RG  RT		SE
strong side of a formation is the side toward the TE and FL, 	FL
and the weak side of a formation is the side away from the TE
and FL (the side toward the SE).					    Figure 5-3: Strong Left

				5-1

The Backs are positioned by specifying one of the following back alignment types (note that is some cases, one or more of the
basic 3 receivers are reassigned):


	O--"Open"--QB behind CR, FB behind strong side tackle, HB behind weak side tackle.

	I--"I"--QB behind CR, FB behind QB, HB behind FB

	N--"NEAR"--QB behind CR, FB behind QB, HB behind strong side (near) tackle

	F--"F"--QB behind CR, FB behind QB, HB behind weak side (far) tackle.

	1--"One Back"--QB behind CR, FB behind QB, HB outside weak side tackle.

	G--"ShotGun"--QB away from CR, HB between weak side tackle and SE, FB beside QB, TE split (set
	        wide) to the strong side, FL between strong side tackle and TE ("in the slot").

	4--"4 Receivers"--QB behind CR, FB behind QB, TE, split (set wide) to the strong side, FL between strong
	      side tackle and TE ("in the slot"), HB between weak side tackle and SE ("in the slot").

	5--"5 Receivers"--QB behind CR, TE split (set wide) to the strong side, FB outside strong side tackle, FL
	      between strong side tackle and TE ("in the slot"), HB between weak side tackle and SE ("in
	      the slot").

	W--"Wishbone"--QB behind CR, FB behind QB, nearer than other formation HB behind weakside tackle.
	      FL behind strongside tackle.

	D--"Double TE"--QB behind CR, FB behind QB, FL alongside weakside tackle ("tight weak") HB outside
		weak side tackle ("wing weak").

Figures 5-4 through 5-23 show all formations possible with the specifiers defined so far.

 (THESE ARE NOT TYPED IN DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF TRYING TO LINE UP THE POSITIONS)  

				5-2

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH			SECTION 5: CALLING THE OFFENSE

With the specifiers you know so far, twenty formations are possible--ten back alignments with two strengths for each. These
twenty offer quite a few choices, but not enough to simulate a professional team. More options are needed to position your
offensive players (not linemen, however) in the most advantageous spots.

All offensive formations begin with the back alignment and strength. Following the back alignment and strength, you may
optionally specify that you would like either the HB and FB or the SE and FL to exchange positions. To exchange the HB and
FB YOU USE AN "X". TO EXCHANGE THE FL AND SE, USE A "Y". You can use one or both in any order. Place the exchange character
or characters immediately following the back alignment and strength as follows:

	IRX--specifies an I Right, with the HB behind the QB and the FB behind the HB. The HB and FB
		have exchange their normal positions for an I formation.

	OLY--specifies an O Right, with the FL playing as a SE on the weak side (right), and the SE playing as a
		FL on the strong side (left).

				5-3

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH			SECTION 5: CALLING THE OFFENSE

	1RXY--specifies a 1 back offense Right, with the HB and FB exchange and the SE and FL exchange.

If you have use a "Y" exchange, the names of the FL and SE have been exchanged for the duration of that play. For example, 
you have called an ORY formation. The FL is now playing SE on the offensive left side of the formation, and SE is now
playing FL on the offensive right side. If you want to assign a pass pattern (described later) to the FL playing as a SE on this play, 
you have to refer to that player as SE.

Figures 5-24 through 5-26 show example formations that specify an exchange.

 (THESE ARE NOT TYPED IN)  

Now you can specify 80 formations, but still more are needed to provide full professional simulation. Following the back
alignment, strength, and optional exchange, you may place specific players in specific spots. For each formation there are
fourteen "spots" designated, seven to the strong side and seven to the weak (shown in Figure 5-27). The seven on the strong
side and the seven on the weak side consist of three spots on the line of scrimmage and four in the backfield. The spots on the
line of scrimmage are:

	T--"Tight"--2 yards outside the tackle
	L--"Loose"--4 yards outside the tackle
	O--"Out"--14 yards outside the tackle

The spots in the backfield are:

	W--"Wing"--1 yard outside the tackle
	S--"Slot"--6 yards outside the tackle
	F--"Flank"--14 yards outside the tackle
	R--"Running back"--Behind the offensive tackle

When calling these positions modifiers, specify the player and the spot that is to be occupied. The player is specified by either
the offensive position being played (TE, FL, etc.) or by the player jersey number (81, 26, etc.). The formation spot for the
player is indicated by the spot name (T, W, etc.) and the side. Specify the side by entering one of the following:

	R--"Right"
	L--"Left"
	W--"Weak"
	S--"Strong"

For example:

	ORFLWL--Open Right, Flanker Wing Left
	ILXSETW--I Left, Exchange, SE Tight Weak
	1RFBWS--1 back Right, Fullback Wing Strong

Figures 5-28 through 5-30 show formations that include position modifiers.

 (THESE ARE NOT TYPED IN)  

				5-4

The formation portion of the play call ends with a period. Therefore, in the SWEEPR playbook example that began this section
(OR.HB8PF.FBL), the formation is an Open Back strong
Right (OR). The period after the OR tells Head Coach that
the formation call is complete.

Head Coach offers many formations possibilities so that you can gain an advantage for a particular play call by knowing your
offense and the defense you are attacking. The alignment for the linebackers, corners, and deep backs depends upon the
offensive formation. For example, the cornerbacks (RC and LC) always align, and usually cover, the widest receiver to their
side. In a normal OR formation for example, the widest receiver to the offense's left (defense's right) is the SE. If the following
formation is called:

	ORSETWFLFW

The SE has been moved tight weak (left) and the FL has been moved flank (wide, in the backfield) weak (left). This makes FL
the widest receiver to the defense's right, and the RC that against the OR formation aligns on SE is now aligned on FL. This had
forced coverage RC to FL, which may be more favorable to the offense.

Use of the "Y" exchange allows you to have either your SE or FL always play on the same side of the field, regardless of the
offensive strength. For example, if the defensive LC, who normally plays on the widest receiver to the offensive right side, is
rather weak compared to the offensive FL, using a strong left formation would place the FL on the offensive left side. By using
a strong left formation with a "Y" exchange, the FL is still on the offensive right side, playing against the weaker defensive LC.

The ", MU" dot command (Section 7, Dot Commands) establishes the matchup mode and provides the ability to call plays 
against your opponent and see the matchups that result. The matchup mode is very useful for evaluating the effect of various
formations against your opponent.

BASIC PLAY

After you call the formation (as indicated by the period), you must specify whether the play is a run or a pass. If the two
characters following the period specify a pass type, the play is a pass. If the two characters do not specify a pass type, they
must specify a ball carrier. The play is run.

The pass types are:

	PK-Pocket pass
	RR-Roll right
	RL-Roll left
	RS-Roll strong
	RW-Roll weak
	SR-Screen right
	SL-Screen left
	SS-Screen strong
	SW-Screen weak
	OB-Out of bounds

For example, in the SWEEPR playbook call
(OR.HB8PF.FBL) the formation is Open backs strong
Right, with the HalfBack (HB) carrying the ball. Since a
ball carrier followed the formation specification, the play is
a run. The call:

	IL.PKSEDHBPFBWTEAFLA

This example specifies an I Left formation, followed by a 
PK pass type. The two letters following the formation
specify a pass type (PK), so the play is a pass.

The "OB" pass type is a special case. In the OB pass, the
ball is thrown out of bounds. For example:

	OR.OB

				5-5

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH			SECTION 5: CALLING THE OFFENSE

This calls an OR formation, the QB steps back and throws the ball out of bounds. The OB pass can be called from any
offensive formation.

PASSING PLAYS

If a pass has been called, the pass type specified the blocking for the interior linemen and the movement of the QB, as shown in
Figure 5-31. Figure 5-31 shows movement, with "R" or "L" as the direction. For the RW, RS, SS, and SW pass types, the "W"
means to the weak side, and the "S" means to the strong side.

For example:

	RW--If in a strong Right formation, RW means Roll Left.
	SS--If in a strong Left formation, SS means Screen Left.

What you must enter following the pass type specifier depends upon if you have called a screen pass or not. The screen pass
input is different from the others.

SCREEN PASSES

Unlike the other pass types, the screen pass has only one receiver. If you have called a screen pass, the screen pass specifier
must be followed by the receiver that will be thrown the ball.

Following the screen pass receiver you may press RETURN or type a 
dot ("."). If you do type a dot, the dot is followed by additional 
pass receivers and pass routes they will run (assigning receivers and
routes is discussed in the following paragraphs). The passer (QB) will
not throw to these secondary receivers, but they influence the 
movement of pass defenders. For example:

	OR.SWHB.SEPTEOFLH

This example calls for an Open Right formation, with a screen pass to
the weak side (SW). Because the offense is in a strong right
formation, the weak side is to the left of the offense. The pass will be
thrown to the HB, with the SE running a Post route, the TE an Out, 
and the FL a Hook.

NON-SCREEN PASSES

If you are not calling a screen pass, follow the pass type with a list of
receivers and the pass routes that the receivers will run. A pass route
is defined by two items.

	Where the player will end up relative to his
	formation position (the end point)  

	The path taken to arrive at the end point

The end point is defined by two items:

	The yards downfield from the formation position

	The lateral movement in yards from the
	formation position

The lateral direction of the lateral movement yards is either:

	Minus yards-Move toward the center of the field.
	Positive yards-Move toward the sideline.

The path names are diagrammed in Figure 5-32. The path names
indicate the shape of the route. A "T" route, for example, means that
the receiver will travel the full distance downfield and then make a
90-degree turn either inside or outside. The "I" path means that the

				5-6

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH			SECTION 5: CALLING THE OFFENSE

receiver moves straight toward the end point with no turns.

SPECIFYING A PASS ROUTE BY NAME						Table 5-1. PASS ROUTE TABLE

You may specify a pass route by its name. Head							DOWNFIELD	LATERAL

	TE-Angle- (TEA)  						Y
	FL-Angle- (FBA)  						Z	Zip		I	2		-4

SPECIFYING A DETAILED PASS ROUTE				hole number--assigned player goes to hole number specified

You may also specify a pass route by making a detail
pass route call beginning with the slash character "/", followed by the path shape, the downfield yards, the lateral movement, 
and ending with a final slash character. All fields are separated by commas:

	/Y, 28, -15/

This example specifies a "Y" shape route that takes the receiver 28 yards downfield and 15 yards toward the inside (middle) of
the field. To send a receiver on a "U" path 9 yards downfield and 10 yards to the outside, specify:

										       O	
	/U, 9, 10/						SE	7  5 LT 3 LG 1 CR 2 RG 4 RT 6 TE 8
										       QB			FL
FOR EXAMPLE:

	OL.PKSEFFLAFBATEAHB/U, 12, 15/					     HB                  FB

This calls an Open left formation, PK pass with the		      Figure 5-34: Points of Attack (Holes)  
following pass routes:

	SEF-SE Fly
	FLA-FL Angle
	FBA-FB Angle
	TEA-TE Angle
	HB-HB "U" path, 12 yards downfield, 15 yards to the outside

RUNNING PLAYS

If a run has been called, you must specify the spot where the ball carrier will carry the ball. The place where the ball will be
carried is called the point of attack, or hole. As shown in Figure 5-34, the holes are in the spaces between the offensive

				5-7

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 5: CALLING THE OFFENSE

linemen. The holes are numbered with the even-numbered holes to the offense's right, and odd-numbered holes to the offense's
left. The zero (0) hole is directly over the offensive center.

One special call does not use the hold number, but specifies the quarterback dropping to a knee. To call a "knee" play, follow
this example:

	OR.QBK

Instead of a hold being specified, use the "K".

In the SWEEPR beginner playbook example (OR.HB8PFQ.FBL), the ball carrier is the HB (HalfBack), and the point of attack
is the 8 hole.

If you follow the hole specifier with a plus sign ("+") the hole is moved one-half a hold position to the outside of the specified
hole. Using a minus ("-") moves the point of attack one-half a hole position to the inside of the specified hole.

For example:

	1R.FB4-

Normally the FB would run to the 4 hole, between the offensive right tackle and right guard. Specifying the "4-" hole places the
point of attack directly over the offensive right guard.
									Table 5-2 Blocking Assignments
If you use either a "-" or a "+", you may follow the
character with a number of yards you would like the hole	A
moved either inside or outside, respectively. For		B
example:							C--Cross block; linemen at point of attack cross
								D
	OR.HB8+12P						E
								F--Far block; Off-side tackle pulls to point of attack
This calls an open right formation, with the HB carrying		G--Go block; On-side guard pulls away from point of attack
the ball 12 yards outside the 8 hole. The "+" or "-"		H
MUST be placed immediately after the hole. If you also		I
specify yards, the yards must be placed immediately after	J
the "+" or "-".							K
								L
So far you have specified the formation, ball carrier, and	M
point of attack. Two more items can still be specified:		N--Near block; On-side tackle pulls to point of attack
blocking and assignments for the remaining backs and		O--Onside trap; On-side guard pulls to point of attack
pass receivers.							P--Power block; Both guards pull to point of attack
								Q--Quick toss; QB tosses ball to ball carrier
If a blocking assignment is not called, all linemen (LT, 		R
LG, CR, RG, RT) will block defenders in their area. This		S
is called zoneblocking. If a special type of blocking is	T--Trap block; Off-side guard pulls to point of attack
desired, a series of single character blocking assignments	U
can be included in the play call after the point of attack.	V
Table 5-2 lists the blocking assignments that can be		W--Wedge block; All blockers move toward point of attack
called.								X
								Y
In the SWEEPR example (OR.HBIPFQ.FBL), the first			Z--Zone block; All blockers block nearest man (default)  
blocking type specified is the "P", or power block. Table
5-2 describes power blocking as both offensive guards
pulling to the point of attack and blocking. The "F" or
far block indicates that the offside defensive tackle also
pulls to the point of attack.

Table 5-2 defines the blocking assignments you may make; two need special explanation. The "G" or go block is used to make
the defense think that the offense is running to a hold that is wide (7 or 8 hole). The guard who is on the side of the point of
attack (onside guard) pulls to the widest hole on that side. When the "G" block is used, the actual hole is the place the guard
just vacated. The "G" block is used to defeat the guard keying that the defense may use (described in Section 6, Calling the
Defense). In guard keying, the defensive tackles key the guards and go where the guards go. With "G" blocking, the defensive
tackle follows the guard away from the hole. However, if you call "G" blocking and the defense is not guard keying, you have
no blocker at the point of attack.

				5-8

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 5: CALLING THE OFFENSE

The letter "Q", which means quick toss (see the preceding SWEEPR example), does not actually specify a block. With a "Q"
call, the quarterback quickly tosses the ball to the ball carrier.

You now know how to set your formation, call the ball carrier and the hole for a run, and specify the blocking. These calls make
assignments to all offensive players except the backs who are not carrying the ball and the two ends.

If you do not specify an assignment for the backs who are not carrying the ball, the backs will stay in their formation spot and
will serve as zone blockers to any defended that comes into the area.

If the tight end (TE) or split end (SE) is in a tight position (not "loose" or "out"), and the hole is to their formation side, the end
will zone block. If the hole is to the opposite side of the formation spot, or if the end is in either a "loose" or "out" spot, the end
will run a corner pass route.

Table 5-1 lists an additional assignment that can be made for the off backs and ends, the "L" assignment. This assignment, like
the blocking assignments, is a single-letter assignment character that follows the name of the player being assigned. For
example, in the SWEEPR playbook call
(OR.HB8PFQ.FBL), the Fullback (FB) has been given an
"L" assignment. As shown in Table 5-1, that means the FB 
"leads" the ball carrier at the point of attack. If you had
called:

	OR.HB8PFQ.FBLFLL

You would have told both the FB and the Flanker (FL) to
lead at the point of attack.

Following the ball carrier, hole, and blocking, you may
place another period and specify pass route assignments, 
or a lead, or you may specify a back to go to a particular
hole. These assignments are made by specifying the player
position or jersey number and the single character route
specified in Table 5-1.

Figure 5-35 shows a final running play example:

	IR X SELW.FB5TQ.SEL HB8 FLO TEC

This calls for an I Right formation with HB, FB exchange; SE Loose Weak. The FB carries the ball through the 5 hole, with trap
blocking (RG pulls to the 5 hole), and the QB makes a quick toss to the FB. The SE leads the play (block at the 5 hole), the HB
decoys by running to the 8 hole, the FL runs an Out route, and the TE runs a Corner route.

PLAY ACTION PLAYS

Another class of offensive plays that add excitement to your games are the play action plays. A play action play attempts to
make the defense expect a certain play, which suddenly turns into something else. For example, the beginner playbook includes
a run called the "DRAW". A draw is a play that starts out by trying to make the defense think a pass play is being executed. The
ball is then handed to a ball carrier, and the play turns into a run.

Head Coach provides a simple method of calling one play
and then turning the play into something else. Start by
calling the play that you want the defense to think you are
running. For example, assume you want the defense to 
think you are running the HB through the 8 hole with trap 
blocking. Begin by making your detailed call as follows
(do not press RETURN yet):

	OR.HB8ST.FBO SEP TECH FLO

So far, the play call is normal: Open Right formation, HB
ball carrier through the 8 hole with Trap blocking. In
anticipation of actually running a pass play, the example
above includes pass routes for the FB, SE, TE, and FL.
Enter a semi-colon (";") and a pass type as follows:

	OR.HB8T.FBO SEP TECH FLO; RR

				5-9

The ending "; RR" indicates that all players are to do whatever has been assigned, but the ball is NOT handed off on a run. The
QB rolls out to the right and throws a pass. This example is shown in Figure 5-36.

There are three types of play action plays:

	Runs that turn into passes
	Passes that turn into runs
	Runs that the ball carrier hands the ball
	to a second ball carrier--this is called a
	"reverse"

When calling a run that turns into a pass, the following pass types are valid:

	PK-Pocket pass position
	RR-Roll right
	RL-Roll left
	RS-Roll strong
	RW-Roll weak
	BC-Ball carrier will throw the ball

The BC pass type means that the QB hands the ball to the ball carrier, who runs a few steps and then throws the ball. In a BC
pass, the QB may actually go out as a receiver.

When calling a pass that turns into a run, call the pass as normal, enter ";" followed by the second ball
carrier and the new point of attack. For example:

	IRFLSW.HB7Q.FB7;FL8

This calls an I Right formation with the FL slotted weak. The HB will carry the ball to the 7 hole, with the quarterback making
a quick toss. The FB leads at the 7 hole. The ";FL8" means that the FB who received the ball from the quarterback hands the
ball to the FL running toward the eight hole. Head Coach will examine the path taken by both ball carriers and will make the
handoff at the closest point. Important: if the ball carriers do not get within two yards of each other, a fumble will result (after
the tackle)! So designing reverses takes practice.

COMBINING PLAYBOOK AND DETAILED CALLS

Playbooks are very handy. Many times while in detailed mode you would like to call a play just like it is in the playbook. To
call a playbook play while in detailed mode, use the playbook name enclosed in apostrophes:

	'SWEEPR'

Any time an apostrophe (') appears, while in detailed mode, Head Coach assumes you are specifying a playbook name. Head
Coach searches your playbook looking for the specified playbook name. When the playbook name is located, the contents of
the playbook entry are substituted for the name enclosed by the apostrophes. In the SWEEPR example, entering 'SWEEPR' is
treated just as if you had typed:

	OR.HB8PFQ.FBL

Head Coach has replaced the apostrophes and the playbook name with the playbook contents. If you have modified the
playbook contents of the SWEEPR entry, your modified SWEEPR play will be used.

This substitution can be used to quickly call a play action play. For example:

	'SWEEPR';RR

Because Head Coach will replace the apostrophes and everything in between with the playbook contents for the play
SWEEPR, the line above is treated as if you had typed:

	OR.HB8PFQ.FBL;RR

				5-10

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH			SECTION 5: CALLING THE OFFENSE

This is a play action pass off of a SWEEPR play. Anything you type after the second apostrophe (";RR" in the example) is still
present in your line, after then contents of the playbook name have been substituted.

Using this substitution, you can create special formations as playbook names. If, for example, you have a formation that gives
favorable matchups, you can place the formation into your playbook (see Section 4, The Playbook, Making Your Own
Playbook) and give it a name. For example, if you have created a playbook entry as follows:

	"SPFORM"ORSETWFLSW

Entering the following:

	'SPFORM'.FB4W.HB7

Produces:

	ORSETWFLSW.FB4W.HB7

If you want to use a playbook play while in detailed mode, you can omit the ending apostrophe (') as follows:

	'SWEEPR

This is treated just like:

	'SWEEPR'

In this manner, the playbook can be used to hold substitution calls as well. Any command that is entered on one line can be
placed into the playbook, given a name, and called up at any time.

For example:

	"SUBTEFB".SU87.TE;25.FB

This playbook entry allows you to substitute #87 for the TE and #25 for the FB entering:

	SUBTEFB

For an explanation of the .su dot command, see Section 7, Dot Commands.

				5-11

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 6: CALLING THE DEFENSE

				SECTION 6
			   CALLING THE DEFENSE

As described in Section 5, Calling the Offense, placing your team in detailed mode allows you to make offensive and defensive
play calls in a manner consistent with professional football. A defensive call consists of these parts:

	FORMATION		REQUIRED
	FORMATION SHIFTS	OPTIONAL
	COVERAGE		OPTIONAL
	STUNTS			OPTIONAL
	SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS	OPTIONAL
	BLITZES			OPTIONAL
	INDIVIDUAL MAN		OPTIONAL
	COVERAGES

Only the defensive formation is required. However, if nothing else is called, the players won't do anything. You may enter a
series of blocks, each of which specifies some aspect of the defense to be used.

The following paragraphs describe each of the defense blocks.

FORMATION

The defensive formation consists of two digits followed by an optional shift character. The first digit specifies the number of
defensive linemen, and the second digit specifies the number of linebackers. The number of defensive linemen must be either
3 or 4. The number of linebackers must be either 2, 3, or 4. These are the legal defensive formations:

	32		33		34
	42		43		44

Because there are eleven players on a team, the defensive formations specify from three to six players other than linemen or
linebackers. The players that are not either linemen or linebackers are divided between:

	Corner Backs
	Safeties
	Backs

There are always two corner backs. The number of safeties and backs depends upon the formation. The defensive positions are
named as follows:

	Linemen:
		Right End--RE
		Left End--LE
		Right Tackle--RT
		Left Tackle--LT
		Nose Tackle--NT

	Linebackers:
		Weak Outside--WO
		Strong Outside--SO
		Weak Inside--WI
		Strong Inside--SI
		Middle Inside--MI

	Cornerbacks:
		Right Corner--RC
		Left Corner--LC

	Deep Backs:
		Strong Safety--SS
		Weak Safety--WS
		Strong Back--SB
		Weak Back--WB
		Middle Back--MB

				6-1

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 6: CALLING THE DEFENSE

Right and left refer to the defense's right and left. Figures 6-1 through 6-6 show the alignment of the six basic defensive
formations.

The normal defensive alignment of linemen and linebackers generally follows that shown in Figures 6-1 through 6-6. The
alignment of the corner backs is on the widest offensive receiver to each side. The alignment of the remaining deep backs
(safeties and backs) is evenly distributed between the corner backs.

The normal defensive alignment for the linebackers and deep backs can be affected by the type of coverage that is called. If
zone coverage is called, the alignment is not changed from the normal defensive alignment. However, if man coverage is
called, the defenders may shift to align with the receivers they are assigned to cover. If the normal defensive alignment
positions the defender close enough to cover the receiver, no shift is performed. However, if the distance to the man to be
covered is excessive, the alignment of the defender is shifted closer to the receiver.

Before describing the optional shift character, the definition of the offensive strength must be reexamined. As described in 
Section 5, Calling the Offense, the offensive play call includes a strength--right or left. However, the offensive play call may
specify receivers shifted from the normal offensive strength position.

As far as the defense is concerned, the offensive strength is the side which contains the most receivers. This is not necessarily
the strength that was specified when the formation was called. When the defensive alignment is being determined, Head
Coach evaluates the number of receivers to the right and left of the offensive formation and sets the strength accordingly.

After specifying the basic alignment (34, 43, etc.) you may specify an optional shift character. The shift character specifies a
shift of the defensive linemen in one direction, with a corresponding compensating shift of the linebackers in the opposite
direction. The shift characters are:

	O--Over, toward offensive strong side
	S--Strong, toward offensive strong side
	U--Under, toward offensive weak side
	W--Weak, toward offensive weak side

				6-2

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 6: CALLING THE DEFENSE

	L--Left, toward defensive left side
	R--Right, toward defensive right side

For example, a"430" (43 with "O" or Over shift) means a 43 alignment with the linemen shifted to the offensive strong side, 
and the linebackers compensating to the weak side. Figure 6-7 shows a "43O" applied to an "OL" offensive formation.

Figure 6-8 illustrates the offensive formation of ORHBWL (Open Right, HalfBack Wing Left), defensive formation of 34R.
The "R" instructs the linemen to shift to the defense's Right and the linebackers to compensate by a shift Left.

The O, U, L, or R can be applied to any defensive formation.

Following the basic alignment and the optional shift, you may specify a "G" to have the defensive linemen play in the "gaps"
between the offensive linemen. The linemen will choose a gap, either further inside or outside. You cannot control which gaps
will be played. For example:

	34G--34 alignment with linemen in gaps
	43SG--43 alignment, shifted to strong side, with linemen in gaps

PASS COVERAGE

After you specify the defensive formation, there is a series of optional assignments called blocks, each preceded by a period.
The first block that you must call is the pass coverage block. This ensure that you have specified an assignment for all
defensive players.

As explained in Section 4, The Playbook, there are two basic types of pass coverages: man (or man-for-man) and zone. The
block specifying man coverage begins with ".M", and the block specifying zone coverage begins with ".Z". Many coverages are
combination defenses that include both man and zone coverages.

When a defender has been assigned a zone, the zone is usually a circle, with possible extensions, either deep or toward the
sideline. The size of the circle and the width of the extensions depend upon the ability of the defender. The better the defender, 
the bigger the area that can be covered. With extensions, the defender is responsible for receivers within the circle, as well as a 
rectangle that extends to the sideline or down the field deep.

The zone is centered about a point known as the zone drop. When the ball is snapped, the defender moves to the zone drop to
establish the zone.

Head Coach provides four types of zones:

	Pick Zone--Area to cover is a circle around the defender.
	Side Zone--Area to cover is a circle extended to the sideline.
	Deep Zone--Area to cover is a circle extended down the field.
	Corner Zone--Area to cover is the outside corner of the field.

These zone types are shown in Figure 6-9.

MAN COVERAGES

A man coverage specifies one defender for each offensive receiver. Normally the cornerbacks (CB) cover the receivers that are
the widest to each side, leaving three receivers. You may choose how to cover the remaining three receivers. These choices
allow for desirable or undesirable matchups, or present different coverages to the offense.

Head Coach provides four man coverages that can be used for each of the six basic defensive alignments. The basic difference
between the four coverages is which defenders cover the interior receivers.

				6-3
PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 6: CALLING THE DEFENSE

The four types of man coverages are:

	O-Outside LB cover interior two receivers.
	I-Inside defenders cover interior two receivers.
	L-All receivers are covered by linebackers.
	B-All receivers are covered by backs.

All defenses have more than five pass defenders. With the five
offensive receivers covered, some defenders still need an
assignment. The standard O, I, L, and B coverages assign zones to
those pass defenders that do not have a receiver to cover
man-for-man. Because some defenders do not have a specific
receiver to cover, special assignments can be made to those
defenders, removing the zone. For example, a defender in a man
coverage defense that is assigned a zone may be reassigned to
blitz without leaving a receiver uncovered. A zone man within a 
man coverage also may be instructed to double cover a receiver (
be assigned to a receiver covered by another player).

To determine which defenders will be covering which receivers
with the multiple offensive formations possible, Appendix C, 
Defense, presents charts for all combinations of defense and pass
coverage. For each defense and pass coverage, the pass defenders
are shown assigned to the pass receivers as the receivers line up in
an offensive "OR" formation. The assignments are made to
provide effective coverage, regardless of the type of offensive
formation used.

Figure 6-10 shows two of the man coverages from Appendix C. As
shown in Figure 6-10, the coverages are really specified by
assigning a defender to a receiver based upon the receiver's
relative position on the field. "#1L" means to cover the receiver
that is the first receiver in from the sideline on the defense's Left.
"#3S" means to cover the third receiver in from the sideline on the
Strong side. "#2W" means to cover the second receiver in from the
sideline on the Weak side.

For example, you have called the following defense:

	43.MO

This calls a "43" basic defensive alignment (four linemen, three 
linebackers) with Man Outside coverage (".MO"). If the offense
has called a "1L" formation, the resulting coverage is shown in
Figure 6-11. The coverages are determined as follows:

PLAYER	FIGURE 6-10	FIGURE 6-11
RC	#1R		FL (1st receiver in on defense's right)  
WS	Deep Zone	Deep Zone
SS	#2S		TE (2nd receiver in on strong side)  
LC	#1L		SE (1st receiver in on defense's left)  
WO	#2W		HB (2nd receiver in on weak side)  
MI	Pick Zone	Pick Zone
SO	#3S		FB (3rd receiver in on strong side)  

You can now specify 24 different combinations of formations and
man coverages, each with specific assignments of receiver
coverages.

Zone Coverages

There are four zone coverages that may be specified for each of the six basic defensive alignments. Each of the four is
identified by how many deep and corner zones are used. A "5 deep" zone, for example, means five defenders are playing deep
(deep zones or corner zones)  , and the remaining pass defenders are playing short zones. Head Coach provides the following
four zone coverage blocks:

				6-4

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 6: CALLING THE DEFENSE

	.Z5--5 deep zones
	.Z4--4 deep zones
	.Z3--3 deep zones
	.Z2--2 deep zones

The number of short zones used depends on the number of defenders available for pass coverage, which depends on the basic
defensive alignment called. In a 43 defense, there are three linebackers and four deep backs for pass coverage, a total of seven
pass defenders. In a "43.Z5" defensive call, the 5 means five deep zones, leaving two short zones. A "32.Z3" uses three deep
zones and five short zones, because there are 8 pass defenders.

In a zone coverage block, all pass defenders have a zone to cover. Reassigning a pass defender to something else with a
subsequent block results in an undefended zone.

Appendix C, Defense, diagrams all zone coverages. There are four zone coverages for each of the six basic defensive
alignments, resulting in 24 zone coverages.

SHIFT BLOCK

The shift block allows you to specify of formation position of defensive players. In a long yardage situation, for example, 
you might want to shift all pass defenders back 5 yards. This would shift all zones 5 yards deeper and thus make man coverages
more effective against the deep pass. The shift block begins:

	.S

This ".S" indicates a shift block. Next, you must call the player or players to be shifted. One of these must follow the ".S":

	LB--Shift linebackers
	CB--Shift cornerbacks
	DB--Shift deep backs
	AL--Shift all: linebackers, cornerbacks, and deep backs
	Player position--Shift the player specified (ex: RE or MI)  
	Jersey number--Shift the player whose jersey number is specified (ex:36)  

Following the ".S" and the specification of player or players to be shifted, you must specify the shift itself. To place the defender or
defenders a certain distance from the line of scrimmage, specify the distance in yards.

For example:

	43.Z5.SALB5

This calls a basic defensive alignment of "43", 5 deep zone pass coverage, with all pass defenders shifted Back 5 yards. This
causes the pass defensive zones to be 5 yards deeper than normal, providing extra pass defense deep.

Next:

	34.MO.SCBO

This specifies a "34" defense, Man Outside coverage, with the cornerbacks shifting up to the line of scrimmage.

You can use more than one shift block in a defensive call:

	34.ML.SWOU1SOW1

This takes a basic 34 with Man Inside coverage and moves WO Up 1 yard, and moves SO one yard to the Weak side.

				6-5

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 6: CALLING THE DEFENSE

A final example:

	43.MB.S2410

This calls a "43", Man Back coverage, with player number 24 10 yards off the line of scrimmage. If a player to be shifted has a
jersey number less than ten (a single digit), the digit must be preceded by a "0" as follows:

	33.Z5.SO6B5

This calls a 33 defense, Zone 5 coverage, with defender number 6 shifting Back 5 yards.

ASSIGN BLOCK
With the assign block, you can make special assignments to
defensive linemen and linebackers. The assign block begins
with:

	.A

The ".A" is followed by one or more one-letter assignment
specifiers. The assignment specifiers are:

	I--Linemen stunt inside
	O--Linemen stunt outside
	P--Linemen pass rush
	G--Guard keying
	F--Linebacker force

LINEMEN STUNT INSIDE

The "I" assignment instructs the linemen to charge to the
inside of the formation when the ball is snapped. This is
called when the defense anticipates a run inside, typically
the 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 hole. For example:

	43.MO.AI

This calls a "43" defense, Man Outside pass coverage, 
assigning an inside charge to the linemen. See Figure 6-12.

LINEMEN STUNT OUTSIDE

The "O" assignment instructs the linemen to charge to the
outside of the formation when the ball is snapped. This is
called when the defense anticipates a run outside, typically
the 5, 6, 7, or hole. For example:

	34.MB.AO

This calls a "34" defense, Man Back pass coverage, 
assigning an outside charge to the linemen. See Figure 6-13.

LINEMEN PASS RUSH

The "P" assignment is used when the defense expects the offense to pass. In the lineman pass rush assignments, the defensive
linemen charge the QB. The "P" assignment is very effective in reducing the chance of completing a pass, but if the offense has
called a run, the effectiveness of the defense against the run is greatly reduced. Figure 6-14 shows the following call:

	33.Z5.AP

GUARD KEYING

To improve the offense's rushing performance, the offense can choose to have linemen that are not at the point of attack pull
and block at the point of attack. The blocking assignments used by the offense for this type of trap blocking are: T, P, N, F, and
O blocking (see Section 5, Calling the Offense). If an offense traps a lot, the defense may specify the "G" or guard keying

				6-6

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 6: CALLING THE DEFENSE

assignments. The guard keying assigns two defensive linemen to key the two offensive guards. When a guard pulls to block at
the point of attack, a defensive linemen will follow the guard to the hole.

This "G" assignment is an effective defense for an offense that does a lot of trapping in their running offense. The offense has a 
blocking assignment specifically designed to combat the defense that does a lot of guard keying--the "G" block (see Section 5, 
Calling the Offense).
For example:

	43.MI.AG

This calls for a "43" defense, with Man Inside pass
coverage and the defensive tackles keying on the offensive
guards. See Figure 6-15.

LINEBACKER FORCE

The final assignment is the "F" or linebacker force. In the
linebacker force, the linebackers ignore the pass and step up
to the line of scrimmage at the snap of the ball. This helps
stop an offensive run. For example:

	44.MB.AF

This calls for a "44" defense, with Man Back coverage and
all linebackers force. Beware--this leaves the offensive HB
and FB unassigned as shown in Figure 6-16, but it puts
eight players on the line of scrimmage.

BLITZ

A blitz occurs when defenders that do not usually penetrate
the offensive line or backfield attempt to do so. The
defenders assigned to blitz try to put additional pressure on
the ball carrier or passer, at the expense of fewer defenders
to protect against a pass. Blitzing is usually done in a man
pass coverage to ensure all receivers are covered.

Blitzes are very effective in passing situations to put
pressure on the passer. Against runs, luck is involved. If the
blitzing players are on the side of the point of attack, the run
is very effectively defended. However, if the offense runs
away from a blitz, the offense usually has the advantage.

To specify defenders to blitz, enter the blitz block as
follows:

	.B

The ".B" is followed by one or more players that will blitz.
For example:

	34.MB.B WO WI 55

This calls for a "34" basic defensive alignment with Man
Back pass coverage and that WO, WI, and player number
55 blitz the QB. See Figure 6-17.

In designing a blitz, you must first decide which basic defensive alignment to use. As previously stated, blitzing is normally
called from man coverage. In Figure 6-17, a "34.MB" covers all receivers and assigns zone coverages for WO, WI, and SO.
Therefore, WO, WI, and SO could be blitzed and still have all receivers covered.

Blitzes can be called from zone coverages as well. Because zone coverages do not overlap zones to a great extent, the blitzing
player leaves a "hole" in the zone where no coverage is assigned. For example:

	34.Z3.BSI

				6-7

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 6: CALLING THE DEFENSE

This calls a "34" basic defensive alignment, with three-deep Zone coverage and SI blitzing. The "34.Z3" SI assignment is a
pick zone in the middle of the field. However, because of the blitz a "hole" in the zone coverage is created in the middle of the
field. See Figure 6-18.

To call a "safety blitz", which is a blitz involving a deep
back, the recommended approach is to call a man coverage
that has the deep backs not assigned to particular receivers:

	43.ML.BWS SS

This calls a "43" basic defensive alignment, with Man
Linebacker pass coverage, and a blitz by SS and WS. In this
"43", SS and WS do not have specific receivers to cover, 
only corner zones. Therefore, SS and WS can be blitzed and
still have pass coverage on all receivers. See Figure 6-19.

SPECIAL MAN COVERS

Sometimes the defensive coach needs to assign a defender
to cover a particular receiver man-for-man that a standard
defense and man coverage does not provide. The most
common need to specifically assign a defender to a receiver
occurs when double coverage is desired. Double coverage
means having two defenders cover a receiver man-for-man.

To use double coverages, call a basic defensive alignment
and pass coverage that leaves some pass defenders free for
additional assignments. Then specify the Cover block:

	.C

The ".C" is followed by one or more cover assignments
consisting of a defender and the receiver to cover. For
example:

	33.MO.CWS SE

This calls a "33" basic defensive alignment with Man
Outside coverage, and WS covers SE man-for-man. This
call has placed two defenders, RC and WS, on the SE, 
thereby double covering SE. See Figure 6-20.

Another example:

	33.MICSOFL MBTE WOSE

This calls a "33", Man Inside coverage, with double
coverages on FL (LC and SO), TE (SS and MB), and SE
(RC and WO). See Figure 6-21.

COMBINING BLOCKS

More than one block can be specified for the defensive calls. Consider this final example:

	43U.MO.SWS3.AG.CMITE.BWS

This specifies "43U" ("43" with Under shift, or shift to weak side), Man Outside coverage, WS to shift to 3 yards off the line of
scrimmage, guard keying, MI to cover TE man-for-man (creating double coverage on TE)  , and a WS blitz. See Figure 6-22.

            		      SECTION 7
			DOT COMMANDS DESCRIPTION

The dot commands request special operations. The following paragraphs describe each of the dot commands, in alphabetical
order. If you are playing the game in mouse selection mode, click the desired dot command from the display twice. Any
additional choices will be obtained by using self-explanatory boxes. This remainder of this section is written for a game in the
keyboard selection mode.

Each command is specified by typing a dot "., typing the two-letter command, and pressing the RETURN key. Some
commands require additional information on the dot command line, some ask for additional information, and some require no
additional information.

1R

When Head Coach begins, you are in the playbook mode. After entering a play call, either offense or defense, you need to
press the RETURN key only once to complete the call. This mode is the "1 Return entry mode." If you enter the ".1R"
command, Head Coach disables the 1 Return mode. When the 1 Return mode has been disabled, Head Coach will continue to
ask for a call until you press RETURN without having typed anything.

The 1 Return mode is disabled until another ".1R" command is entered. At this time, the 1 Return mode switches.

If you are in the mouse selection mode and not in the "1R" mode, you must click the "OK" box in the lower right hand of the
menu display to complete a play call.

This mode is particularly useful for more advanced players who use multiple entries per call. For example, the offense may
want to make a detailed call, set the snap count (.ON command), and specify receivers (.RL command).

45

In professional football, the offense generally has 45 seconds in which to begin the offensive play. Head Coach permits you to
either enable or disable a 45 second delay-of-game clock. When the game begins, the 45 second clock is disabled. Entering 
".45" enables the clock.

When the offense is instructed to enter a play call, the 45 second clock is displayed, but does not actually show 45 seconds.
This is because in a real game, the 45 second clock is begun when the previous play has stopped. Head Coach estimates what
the 45 second clock will be when the offense gets into the offensive huddle and the quarterback can actually call the play. In
this manner, Head Coach gives the player an amount of time very consist with real professional football. If the offense does
not complete a play call before the 45 second becomes zero, a delay of game penalty is assessed.

The delay of game penalty is not assessed until the offensive play call is complete. The offense is not interrupted out of
calling the play.

Entering ".45" alternates between enabling or disabling the delay of game clock.

AU

Head Coach provides a much more realistic game environment by using the audibles mode. When in audibles mode, just like
in professional football, the offense may decide to change the called play while at the line of scrimmage. This is usually done
because the defense has apparently called a defense which will be very effective against the offensive play called. Sometimes
the offense may be looking for a particular defensive setup, for which the offense has a good play to use.

While in audible mode, after the offense and defense have made their play calls, the offense will see on the display the
defensive alignment against the offensive alignment. If the offense does not wish to change the play, simply press RETURN (or
click OK if in mouse mode). The play will be executed normally.

However, if the offense would like to change the play, simply make another play call. The defense will then get a chance to 
make another defensive call. In this manner, the game is very realistic. The offense must get the ball snapped before the 45
second clock elapses, if used, and the defense must be prepared for the offense to snap the ball at any time.

				7-1

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 7: DOT COMMANDS

Remember, if the offense makes any play call after the first, the defense is given a chance to change the defense. Some
experienced Head Coach players have noted that be reentering the same offensive call, the defense is given a chance to change
but cannot be sure that the offensive play call was really changed.

CJ

Sometimes, the colors being worn by one of the teams needs to be changed. Most often, this happens when the home team uses
a light jersey at home (most teams wear a dark jersey at home). When a team needs to change jerseys, enter ".CJ". You are 
asked to enter then name of the team that must change jerseys.

CT

The ".CT" command is used to enable a team to be computer controlled or to disable a team from being computer controlled.
After either entering .CT and pressing the RETURN key or double clicking the CT, you are asked to enter the name of the team
to be processed.

Next you are asked to enter "E" to enable the team as a computer-controlled team or "D" to disable the computer-controlled
team, returning the team to player control.

DC

When a team is placed in computer mode, the computer selects the offenses and defenses. If Head Coach is in "Display Call"
mode, the computer generated calls are displayed. Entering ".DC" alternates between or not displaying the computer
play calls.

DP

When you begin a game, Head Coach does not display the contents of playbook calls (the detailed call). To enable the
displaying of detailed calls, enter ".DP'. Entering ".DP" alternates between displaying the detailed call associated with a
playbook call and not displaying the detailed call.

DR

When players are displayed on the screen, either one or two digits are displayed on each player. The numbers displayed can be
either the jersey number of the player or the rank of the player. Whenever the ".DR" command is entered, the mode of display
is switched between jersey numbers or ranks. You are told which mode of display will be used. This mode is in effect until 
another ".DR" command is entered. At this time, the mode switches.

Because of limited display space, when a player rank, from 1.0 to 5.0, is displayed without a decimal point. For
example, the rank for a 3.0 player is displayed as 30.

FG

To attempt a field goal, enter ".FG", and the field goal attempt is executed.

FK

When your team is tackled behind your own goal line for a safety, the ball is placed on your 20-yard line, and you are instructed
to enter ".FK" to kick your free kick. When the computer requests the free kick, you may also enter ".RP" (described later) to
replay the previous play, which resulted in the safety.

GR

You can consult Head Coach for a play recommendation at any time by entering ".GR". Head Coach evaluates the current
situation (down, distance, score, etc.), and based upon the game plan, displays a recommendation.

				7-2

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 7: DOT COMMANDS

HE

Entering ".HE" activates the documentation system. You will be presented with a list of the subjects documented. Click the
subject desired, click the "OK" box and your document is on the screen. Using the mouse you may browse up and down a line
or a page at a time, go to the first or last page, and search for characters, either forward or backward. Just follow the
instructions.

IN

Head Coach permits players to be injured when operating in the "injuries possible" mode. When the game starts, injuries are
not possible. To enable injuries, use the ".IN" dot command. To disable injuries, enter ".IN" again.

If an injury occurs, both teams are informed of the nature of the injury, and for how many plays the player must remain out of
the current game or subsequent games. When the amount of plays has elapsed, both teams are informed that the injured player
may now reenter the game. The player may be placed back into the game by using the ".SU" dot command, described later.

If the team is computer controlled, the player will automatically be substituted.

A player may be injured for more than the remainder of the current game. If league statistics are being maintained, the players'
injury status is saved at the conclusion of the current game. When that team plays again, and the league statistics are read in, 
the player will continue to heal over the required number of plays.

KM

As described in Section 3, Your First Game, if you have at least one megabyte of memory, plays and commands may be
selected by using either the keyboard or the mouse. The ".KM" dot command switches between the two methods.

KO

Whenever a kickoff must be executed, you are notified. You are notified by a special message if in keyboard mode, or in the
window title bar if in mouse mode. Enter ".KO" to execute the kick-off.

LC

To recall the last call that the offense or defense made, enter ".LC". The last call that was made is displayed and treated as if the
offense or defense had entered the call again.

MG

If you are playing a remote Amiga game, you may transmit a message of your choice to your opponent. After entering the
", MG" command, you are instructed to enter your message. Enter the message and the message is transmitted to your opponent.

MP

If you are using the keyboard mode of play and command selection, the mouse is not used. Therefore if you are in the keyboard
mode Head Coach can turn off the mouse pointer. Entering the ".MP" command alternates between displaying the mouse
pointer or not displaying the mouse pointer.

MU

Because the outcome of plays is based upon player abilities, it is very helpful to be able to see your team lined up against your
opponent's team with the player abilities displayed. Then you can evaluate how your two teams "match up".

To get the player abilities displayed rather than jersey numbers, use the ".DR" command, as previously described.

Entering ".MU" then places the game in a special matchup mode. You are asked to enter an offensive play and a defense

				7-3

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 7: DOT COMMANDS

play, but the play is not executed. The formation is displayed so that you can look for favorable or unfavorable matchups. When
you have finished examining the matchups, press RETURN.

Matchup mode is a very useful tool for evaluating the matchups that result from the use of special offensive formations.

You remain in the matchup mode until entering another ".MU" command, which restores normal play calling. You might want
to use the ".DR" command again to cause the player jersey numbers to again be displayed.

ND

Normally after messages are displayed on the screen, Head Coach delays an appropriate amount of time. If you are in a hurry, 
use the ".ND" command to eliminate the time delay on messages. This makes for a faster game.

This is especially useful if you want to have two teams play as two computer controlled teams. By eliminating the delays, and
by also turning off all plotting, a complete game will be played automatically in approximately 20 minutes.

ON

Normally the Coach sending in the play (you) does not specify the count on which the ball is snapped, leaving that decision to
the quarterback on the field. However, in certain situations the coach dictates the snap count for the offense. To specify the snap
count, enter ".ON", followed by a single digit snap count (1 to 9) as follows:

	.ON1 Snaps the ball on the first "hut"
	.ON5 Snaps the ball on the fifth "hut"

If you leave off the single digit count Head Coach will asks for the snap count as follows:

	Enter snap count (1 to 9):

Respond by typing in a single digit from 1 to 9 and pressing RETURN.

If you are in the mouse mode, double click the "ON" command. You next see a requester displayed on the screen. Using the
mouse, click the desired snap count.

PA

Whenever a point after touchdown attempt must be executed, you are notified. You are notified by a special message if in the
keyboard mode, or in the window title bar if in the mouse mode. Enter ".PA" to execute the "point after" attempt.

PB

When the game started, you called your plays from your playbook by entering the name of the play. This is the playbook
mode. For more detailed, professional-style play calling, you make detailed play calls. When making detailed play calls, you
are no longer in playbook mode.

If you wish to use only the names of plays from your playbook, Head Coach must be in the playbook mode. If you wish to
make detailed play calls, Head Coach must not be in the playbook mode.

The .PB command is used to alternate the play calling mode between playbook mode and detailed mode. The game begins with
both teams in the playbook mode. While in playbook mode, call a SWEEPR play by entering the play name as follows:

	SWEEPR

If you enter a .PB command, the team is switched out of the playbook mode into the detailed mode. If you are currently
selecting plays with the mouse, you will be switched to keyboard play selection. You may still call a play by name, but the
name must be enclosed in apostrophes (') as follows:

	'SWEEPR'

				7-4

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 7: DOT COMMANDS

PC

Use the ".PC" dot command to control use of the printer. At any time, the printer is in one of three possible modes:

	Never print
	Always print
	Inquire before printing

In the never print mode, the printer is never used. If in always print mode, appropriate information (usually statistics) is sent to
the printer when displayed on the screen.

If in the inquire before printing mode, you will be asked if it is desired to send the display currently on the screen to a printer.

When you enter a ".PC" command, Head Coach will ask you in which mode you want the printer to operate. Also, Head
Coach will ask if you are using a single sheet printer. If you use a single sheet printer, Head Coach will pause at the proper
times to allow the insertion of a new sheet into the printer.

PM

To add, delete, save, or list plays in a team playbook, enter ".PM". A list of the three-letter commands is displayed. If you press
RETURN without having entered anything, the playbook maintenance mode is terminated.

To see a listing of the plays in your playbook, enter LIS. You can request a listing of all the plays, or enter the name of an
individual play to be listed. The contents of your playbook are displayed on the screen, 20 lines at a time. When 20 lines have
been displayed, the display operation will pause. To continue looking at the playbook contents, press RETURN. If you have
seen enough, press X, then RETURN.

To add a play to your playbook, enter ADD. Head Coach asks you to enter the name to be used for your entry. Enter the 
name, press RETURN, and Head Coach asks you to enter the contents of the play entry. After entering the contents and
pressing RETURN, the new playbook entry is stored.

To delete a play from your playbook, you are instructed to enter the name of the play to be deleted.

When adding a new entry to your playbook, your entry does not have to be a detailed play call. As explained in Section 5, 
Calling the Offense, the entry can be a formation, a dot command, etc.

To save (write) your playbook on a disk, enter "SAV". Head Coach asks you to enter the name of the file to write. The current
playbook for your team is written on the file you specified.

PO

Three plotting options are available. If you are in the mouse selection mode, appropriate self explanatory boxes are displayed.
Use the mouse to click your choices.

If you are in the keyboard mode, after entering ".PO", the computer displays:

	Do you want to see the teams come from the huddle (y or n)?:

Press "Y" or "N" and RETURN. Next you are asked:

	Do you want to see the play being executed (y or n)?:

Press "Y" or "N" and RETURN. Finally you are asked:

	Do you want the defense to be able to see the formation (y or n)?:

Press "Y" or "N" and RETURN.

				7-5

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 7: DOT COMMANDS

PS

When the game is started, all plotting is done as fast as possible. If you would like all plotting to be done at a different speed, 
enter ".PS". At this point, the computer displays:

	Enter plotting speed 1 (slowest) to 10 (fastest):

Respond by entering the plotting speed, a number from 1 to 10.

If you are in the mouse selection mode, click the desired speed from the display.

PU

Whenever you would like to punt (it doesn't HAVE to be fourth down), select a ".PU", and a punt is executed. You may choose
to actually punt or to fake a punt.

If in mouse selection mode, appropriate boxes will be displayed to allow you to make your choices. If using keyboard mode, 
select a fake punt by one of the following:

	.PUF-Fake punt
	.PUFL-Fake punt, to the left
	.PUFR-Fake punt, to the right

In the fake punt, the punter runs either to the right or left. If you do not choose either direction, the punter make the choice.

You may choose from two options if actually punting the ball. You may choose either one, both, or neither. The first option is
the "S" option, which means that you want the punter to punt short, fearing that a normal punt would travel into the end zone.
The second option is the "O" option, which means you that would like your punter to punt out of bounds to prevent a punt
return. For example:

	.PU-Normal punt
	.PUS-Punt short.
	.PUO-Punt out of bounds.
	.PUSO-Punt short and out of bounds.
	.PUOS-Punt out of bounds and short (same thing as .PUSO).

As with the other commands, if you are in mouse selection mode, appropriate boxes are displayed to allow you to make your 
punting choices.

QU

If you would like to quit playing the game before the game time expires, enter:

	.QU

RL

Use the ".RL command to specify which eligible pass receivers the passer considers when throwing the ball. After entering
".RL" and pressing RETURN, you are asked to enter the receivers, either by position or jersey number, that you want the passer
to consider. Enter the list as follows:

	TE 21 FL

This line instructs the passer to look at the TE (tight end), player number 21, and the FL (flanker). To force a throw to a 
particular receiver, such as the SE, enter:

	SE

After entering your receiver list, you are asked if the first receiver named is a primary receiver. If so, that receiver is given
special attention. You must enter either 'Y' or 'N' to indicate whether the first receiver is or is not a primary receiver.

				7-6

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 7: DOT COMMANDS

RO

Entering ".RO" displays a team roster. You are asked which team to display. For each player, the following items are displayed:

	Jersey number
	Position
	Name
	Rank

The players that are currently in the game are marked with an asterisk "*". Any player currently injured is indicated with "I".
The rank of the injured player is replaced by the number of plays that must elapse before that player may return to the game.

Press RETURN when you are ready to continue calling plays.

RP

To see an instant replay of the previous play, enter ".RP". This plots the replay at the current plotting speed (set with .PS, 
described previously). To see a replay slowed down enter ".RP", followed by a number from 1 (slowest action replay) to 10
(current plotting speed), as follows:

	.RP Plots a replay at one-half (speed 5) plotting speed.

RT

Using the ".RT" command enables you to play a game with your opponent seated at a "dumb" terminal plugged into the serial 
plug on the back of your Amiga. A player at the dumb terminal cannot see any plotting on the terminal screen, but play
selections can be made and play results are displayed. This works out very well if the remote terminal is in the same room with
the Amiga, situated so that the player at the dumb terminal can see the Amiga screen when the play is being executed.

If the player at the remote terminal cannot see the Amiga screen, the game can still be played, but it is a bit awkward. For
example most Head Coach players will agree that the same offensive formation must be used, as the player at the remote
terminal cannot see the plays.

When the ".RT" command is entered, you are presented a series of questions about the nature of the serial connection to the
remote terminal.

SA

To save the status of the current game for continuation at a later time, enter ".SA". You are asked to enter the name of a file to
use to save the current game conditions. If you do not enter a file type (a period followed by the file type; see Section 2, Getting
Started), Head Coach will provide a file type of ".sa".

Later, when starting a game, you can enter the name of the file (you do not need to enter the ".sa") and the the saved game will be 
continued.

SC

If you would like to practice your play calling, Head Coach has a special "scrimmage mode". While in scrimmage mode, you
run plays against your own defense (with the defense wearing jerseys reversed from the offense). The play is not run to a
normal conclusion, only to the point of attack. For a run, the play stops when the ball carrier arrives at the hole. On a pass, the
play stops when the receiver either catches or misses the pass.

The play results are not counted in the statistics. Entering ".SC" alternates between scrimmage mode or normal playing mode.

SE

The ".SE" command displays questions so that you can specify a new offensive situation--ball possession, down, distance, 

				7-7


PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 7: DOT COMMANDS

position on field, score, and time remaining. This is not usually used during a game. It is primarily used for setting up special
practice situations.

SM

Want to play a computer team opponent that gets smarter as the game progresses? The ".SM" (smart mode) dot command
alternates between smart mode in which the team learns from the progress of the game, and dumb mode in which the game
plan is followed but never modified.

In the smart mode at the completion of each play, the play that was called (either offense or defense) is evaluated as to the
effectiveness of that call in that situation. The game plan is then modified to alter the probability of making the same call again
in the same situation.

SP

How about an announcer? If you are playing with a disk that was built using the "make" program, and if you requested speech
to be included, your Head Coach can talk. The messages are divided into three categories:

	All messages
	Major messages
	Remote Amiga messages

After entering ".SP", Head Coach asks for your choice of messages to be included. Of course, if "All messages" are requested, 
major messages are automatically included. The "Remote Amiga message" is asked only if you are playing a Remote Amiga
game.

ST

Entering ".ST" displays the current game statistics for both teams. When you are ready to continue play calling, press
RETURN.

SU

The ".SU" command is used to substitute a player or players for players currently in the game. There are two modes for
substituting players: normal mode and roster mode.

In the normal mode, the jersey number of incoming players is a part of the command. In the roster mode, the team roster is
displayed on the screen and the jersey number of the incoming player must be typed. If in mouse mode, incoming and outgoing
players are selected by the mouse.

To substitute a player in the normal mode, enter ".SU", the jersey number of the player coming in, a period ("."), and the
position or jersey number of the player being replaced. For example, to bring in number 23 to play halfback, enter:

	.SU23.HB

To substitute number 77 for number 73, enter:

	.SU77.73

To use the roster mode enter the ".SU" only (no jersey numbers). The roster of the team is displayed on the screen and you are
instructed to enter the jersey number of the player coming out. Enter the jersey number of the outgoing player. You are next
asked for the jersey number of the player coming in. Enter the incoming player jersey number.

If you are using the normal mode, you can substitute more than one player at a time, as follows:

	.SU14.07;81.88;65.RG

This substitutes number 14 for number 7 (note the use of the leading "0" in "07"), number 81 for number 88, and number 65
will play RG. Multiple substitutions can be placed in the playbook. The substitution can then be made by entering the playbook
name of the substitute command.

				7-8

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 7: DOT COMMANDS

This is particularly useful when playing a remote Amiga game, as this permits the defense to call a time-out before the offense 
has used time off the game clock by making an offense call.

TV

How about stopping the game for that all-important trip to the kitchen? Using the ".TV" time-out will stop the game and all
game clocks. Press RETURN to continue the game.

WX

Entering ".WS" displays the current weather conditions. After the weather is displayed, you must answer the following:

	Do you wish to change the weather conditions (y or n)?:

If you enter a "Y" and press RETURN, you are asked to provide new weather conditions.

				7-9

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 8: COMPUTER TEAMS

			    SECTION 8
			  COMPUTER TEAMS

Head Coach allows either or both teams to be controlled by the computer. This enables you to play a game against the
computer, or have the computer control both teams and watch the game!

Three steps are required in order for a team to be computer controlled:

	1. A playbook must be provided when starting the game.
	2. A game plan must be provided when starting the game.
	3. The ".CT" dot command must be used to initiate computer control.

Providing the playbook and game plan were described in Section 3, Your First Game. Section 7, Dot Commands, explains the
use of the ".CT" dot command with which you place a team into computer-controlled mode.

PLAYING THE COMPUTER

To play a game against the computer, begin the game as instructed in Section 3, Your First Game. Be sure to provide a
playbook and game plan. Following the opening kickoff and kickoff return, Head Coach asks for the first offensive play. Enter:

	.CT

Head Coach asks for the name of the team to be processed. As instructed, you may enter an "O" for the offensive team, a "D"
for the defensive team, or the name of the team you wish to be computer-controlled, and press RETURN. You are requested to 
enter an "E" to enable a computer-controlled team or "D" to disable. Enter "E" and press RETURN.

At this point, the team you have selected is being controlled by the computer, calling plays as directed by the game plan.

COMPUTER VERSUS COMPUTER

If you would like both teams to be computer controlled, begin a game as previously explained. Head Coach requests the
first offense, initiate computer control on one of the teams. When the next input is required, either offense or defense, initiate
computer control of the other team.

After placing both teams in computer-controlled mode, you are a spectator--enjoy the game!

When Head Coach was started, you were presented the option of automatically starting a two computer team game. If you 
chose to do so, the starting of the game is simplified. You may still interrupt the game, as described next.

RETURNING TO PLAYER CONTROL

If both teams are playing a game under computer control, you may regain player control of the team currently on offense by
pressing and holding the CTRL key and the C key simultaneously. The next time an offense is required, the offensive team will
be switched to a player controlled team.

				8-1

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 9: THE GAME PLAN

			     SECTION 9
			  THE GAME PLAN

In order to be able to make offensive and defensive calls, Head Coach uses a computer file called a game plan. The game plan
states which plays are used in specific situations. When it is time for an offensive play call, for example, Head Coach consults
the team's offensive game plan and determines which offensive play to call.

The game plan is a computer file that provides a list of up to fifteen offenses or defenses that can be called in each play-calling
situation. A situation is defined by:

	Offense or Defense
	Down--1, 2, 3, or 4
	Distance--Short, Normal, or Long

When Head Coach must provide a play call, first the situation is determined. Within that situation, the game plan provides for
up to 15 plays that can be called.

Each play provided must be an entry in the team's playbook.

Which play to call depends upon the play percentage. The play percentage states how many times out of 100 chances in that
situation each play will be called. The total of all percentages for a given situation must add up to 100. For example, consider
the following game plan line for offense, 1 down and short:

	20 DIVER 20 DIVEL 20 SWEEPR 20 SWEEPL 10 BOMB 10 FLOODS

This game plan line for 1 down and short offensive situations specifies:

20% of the time call a DIVER	20%of the time call a DIVEL	20%of the time call a SWEEPR
20%of the time call a SWEEPL	10%of the time call a BOMB	10%of the time call a FLOODS

Note that the sum of the percentages is 100, and that up to fifteen plays can be provided. Fewer than fifteen is fine (in this case, 
six play possibilities).

PROVIDED GAME PLANS

Head Coach provides two game plan files--"standard.gp" and "beginner.gp". The standard game plan is used with one of the
standard playbooks. The beginner game plan is used with one of the beginner playbook. Using any of the provided game plans, 
as explained in Section 3, Your First Game, enables Head Coach to generate play calls that are very realistic. On both offense
and defense, the provided game plans are conservative, without taking a lot of risks.

The provided game plans require that the provided playbooks, as delivered with your Head Coach system, must be provided
when you start the game. The play names in the game plan must correspond with the play names in the playbook. Of course, 
you can edit the provided game plans and playbooks, or create entirely new files, but you must ensure that any play named in
the game plan is included in the playbook.

MAKING YOUR OWN GAME PLAN

The game plan file is a text file that can be processed like any other text file within your Amiga system. You may:

Copy		Rename		Delete (be careful!)  
Type		Print		Edit			etc.

GAME PLAN FILE NAMES

The provided game plan files provided with Head Coach are named "beginner.gp" and "standard.gp", as previously explained.
As you learned in section 3, Your First Game, Head Coach makes it easy to use either provided game plan. However, you may

				9-1

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 9: THE GAME PLAN

use any file name you like when building your own game plan files. The ".gp" at the end of the name is used to specify the file
type ("gp" means game plan), but it is optional. To use your own game plan file of any name, respond to the Head Coach game
plan file name request as follows:
											Table 9-1
	The normal game plan for this playbook is "standard"			ORDER OF GAME PLAN FILE ENTRIES
								
	Enter 'N' for the normal game plan, or					The table is divided into two halves:
	'E' to enter the game plan name: e
										    Offense		Defense
Press "E" and RETURN. Head Coach then requests:
										Each half is divided into four Downs
	Enter then name of the game plan file: file		
									  	1	2	3	4
This instructs Head Coach to retrieve a game plan file named "file.gp".
Head Coach assumes that game plan file names will end in ".gp". If you		Each down is divided into three Distances:
do not type a period in the file name, Head Coach assumes the ".gp" is	
part of the name. However, if you would like to use a period with			SHORT	NORMAL	LONG
something other than "gp", Head Coach will not assume the ending ".gp".
For example:									The complete order of data line entries
											in a game plan file are:
	Enter the name of the game plan file: whatever.something			Offense		1Down		Short
 										Offense		1Down		Normal
This example causes Head Coach to retrieve a game plan file named		Offense		1Down		Long
"whatever.something". Since you provided a period and a file type, Head		Offense		2Down		Short
Coach does not assume an ending ".gp".						Offense		2Down		Normal
										Offense		2Down		Long
MODIFYING GAME PLAN FILES							Offense		3Down		Short
										Offense		3Down		Normal
You may use any text editor (ED, for example) to build or modify a game		Offense		3Down		Long
plan file. However, to use a text editor you must first understand the format	Offense		4Down		Short
of a game plan file. The game plan file consists of a series of entries, each	Offense		4Down		Normal
of which either:								Offense		4Down		Long
										Defense		1Down		Short
	Begins with "$"--A comment line						Defense		1Down		Normal
	Does not begin with "$"--A data line					Defense		1Down		Long
										Defense		2Down		Short
The comment lines allow you to place notations of any sort in the game		Defense		2Down		Normal
plan file. Whenever a comment line is encountered (the first character is a	Defense		2Down		Long
"$"), the remainder of the line is ignored. If the first character is not a "$",Defense		3Down		Short
the line must be a data line.							Defense		3Down		Normal
										Defense		3Down		Long
The provided game plan files ("beginner.gp" and "standard.gp") includes		Defense		4Down		Short
comment lines that indicate the format of the file. These comments can be	Defense		4Down		Normal
used as a guide when creating your own game plan files.				Defense		4Down		Long

The data lines within the files are grouped as shown in Table 9-1. Within each data line are a series of play percentage and play
name pairs, each of which states the probability that the play named will be called in the situation. For example, the following
is an example of a portion of the defensive half of a game plan, third down, short situation:

	$DEFENSE 3 DOWN SHORT
	15 GOAL 15 RUSH 15 GOALDW 15 GOALDT 15 REGL +
	15 ZONE3 10 ALLB

This entry consists of seven play percentage-play name pairs, with the percentages adding up to 100%. Therefore, for each
defensive third down and short situation, one of seven plays will be called. The percentages state that:

15% call GOAL		15% call RUSH		15% call GOALDW		15% call GOALDT
15% call REGL		15% call ZONE3		10% call ALLB

The seven pairs presented are distributed over two input lines. The "+" at the end of the first line indicates that the line
following is to be treated as a continuation of the first line. The "+" must be preceded by at least one space. In this manner you
may place up to fifteen pairs over as many lines as necessary. Each line that is to be continued must end with a "+".

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 10: TEAM FILES

			     SECTION 10
			     TEAM FILES

Much of the realism of Head Coach is a result of having all probable play results calculated based upon player abilities. Player
ability is just one type of information that is provided in each team file. Within each file is stored a great deal of information
that allows Head Coach to model many factors of the team and of the team performance.

TEAM FILE FORMAT

										LF	jn jn jn...jn	11 Jersey numbers for field goal
If however, the name requires blanks ("COUNTRY								team players
STADIUM", for example), the name must be enclosed in
quotation marks:

	"COUNTRY STADIUM"

COMMENTS ON DATA LINES

Head Coach also allows you to place comments on a data line. Placing a dollar sign ("$") after the data instructs Head Coach
to ignore the remainder of the line. You may therefore place comments on any data line, after the data. For example:

	.ND 34 $ This team uses 34 mostly, but some 43

This line specifies that the normal defense for this team is a "34". Head Coach will ignore all characters following the dollar
sign ("$"), which allows you to place a special comment on the line.

				10-1

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 10: TEAM FILES

SPECIFYING COLORS

In Head Coach, the team file specifies the team color information for both home and away jerseys. For both the home and
away jerseys, colors are recorded for the jersey and for the letters on the jersey. Therefore, four colors must be recorded:

	HOME JERSEY
	HOME LETTERS
	VISITOR JERSEY
	VISITOR LETTERS

The colors are recorded as a series of three numbers, each of which must be a number 0 and 15. The three numbers
represent the amount of:

	RED
	GREEN
	BLUE

For example, black contains no color, so the color value for black is:

	RED=0
	GREEN=0
	BLUE=0

Therefore, to build your own team, you must determine the values for the red, green, and blue that constitute the color you wish
to see. On your Amiga, a simple procedure to determine color coding is to use the "Preferences" program.

Following the instructions in your Introduction to Amiga, activate the Preferences program and use the mouse to set the color
bars for one of the color blocks. When you have obtained the color you like, you can determine the amount of red, green, and
blue by counting the number of "clicks" from the left that each color slide bar is set. The slide bar at the left end represents a
color value of zero (0); the extreme right is a color value of 15.

Perform this procedure four times to determine the four colors that you want.

The following paragraphs describe each of the types of data lines.

	NA

The ".NA" line contains one field of information, the name of the team:

	.NA REBELS
	.NA "FIGHTING MAVERICKS"

HF

The ".HF" line contains three fields of information:

	1. Name of the home field
	2. Type of stadium:
		"I"--Indoor Stadium
		"O"--Outdoor Stadium
	3. Type of surface:
		"N"--Natural Grass
		"A"--Artificial Grass

For example, if the home stadium name is "BROWN MEMORIAL STADIUM", which is an outdoor stadium with artificial
grass, enter:

	.HF "BROWN MEMORIAL STADIUM" O A

				10-2

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 10: TEAM FILES

ND

The ".ND" line specifies the normal defense that the team uses. This allows Head Coach to recommend a standard playbook
when the game begins. There is only one field of information, and the value must be either "34" for a "34" normal defensive
alignment of "43" for a "43" normal defensive alignment. For example:

	.ND 43

This specifies that the team normally uses a "43" defensive alignment.

HJ, HL, VJ, VL

The ".HJ", ".HL", ".VJ", and ".VL" lines each contain three fields of information: the amount of red, green, and blue for the
colors of the home jerseys, home letters, visitor jerseys, and visitor letters. For example:

	.HJ 0 4 10
	.HL 7 6 7
	.VJ 15 15 15
	.VL 0 4 10

These specify a jersey that is blue with gray letters at home, and white jerseys with blue letters on the road (away, visiting).

PU

The ".PU" line specifies the statistics of the team punter. This line contains two fields, the jersey number of the punter and the
average yards per punt:

	.PU 8 39.9

This line indicates that the punter wears jersey number 8 and has a 39.9 yard average.

FG

The ".FG" line specifies the statistics of the team field goal kicker. The field goal statistics are also used to predict extra point
and kick-off performance. The line contains three fields of information:

	Kicker jersey number
	Number of field goals good
	Number of field goals attempted

For example:

	.FG 3 18 22

This line indicates the jersey number of the team field goal kicker is 3, and the kicker has been successful on 18 of 22 attempts.

KR

The ".KR" line specifies a jersey number for a kick-off return player, and the team average kick-off return:

	.KR 28 18.9

This line specifies that player number 28 is considered the team kick return player, and that the team averages 18.9 yards per
kickoff return.

PR

The ".PR" line specifies a jersey number for a punt return player, and the team average punt return:

	.PR 14 12.3

This line specifies that player number 14 is considered the team punt return player and that the team averages 12.3 yards per
punt return.

				10-3

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 10: TEAM FILES

PL

The ".PL" line indicates that the following lines contain the player information. There must be at least 22 lines, and at most 45
lines. Each player line contains, at a minimum, the following fields of information:

	1. Player Jersey Number
	2. Player Name
	3. Position
	4. Overall Rank

The position can be one of the following:

	OT--Offensive Tackle
	OG--Offensive Guard
	CR--Offensive Center
	TE--Offensive Tight End
	WR--Offensive Split End and Flanker
	HB--Offensive HalfBack
	FB--Offensive FullBack
	QB--Offensive QuarterBack
	DE--Defensive End
	DT--Defensive Tackle
	NT--Defensive "Nose" Tackle
	LB--Defensive LineBacker
	CB--Defensive CornerBack
	DB--Defensive DeepBack

The player name field may contain a player name without blanks, or, if blanks are required, a player name surrounded by
quotation marks.

The overall rank is a rating of the players' ability. The lowest ranking is 1.0, the best is 5.0, and an "average" player ranked 3.0.
For example:

	71 "James, B" OT 3.6

This specifies player #71 is named "James, B", is an offensive tackle and has an overall rank of 3.6

Internally, Head Coach uses eleven player abilities:

	1. Ability to pass block
	2. Ability to run block
	3. Ability to catch a pass
	4. Running speed
	5. Running strength
	6. Passing strength
	7. Passing accuracy
	8. Tendency to scramble while passing
	9. Ability to defend the run
	10. Ability to defend the pass
	11. Ability to rush the passer

You can place only the jersey number, name, position, and overall rank on a player line. If that is all you place on the line, 
Head Coach takes each player's overall rank and, based upon the position, determines the categories listed above for each
player.

If you would like, after the minimum player information, you may place at least one space, the character "+", another space, 
and the eleven ranks for the player. In this manner, you may more accurately describe a player. For example:

	7 Jones, W QB 4.0 + 1.1 1.1 1.3 3.8 2.8. 4 4.0 3.0 1 1 1

This assigns Jones, W an overall rank of 4.0 and specifies all eleven categories. For example, the passing accuracy is 4.0, and
the tendency to scramble is 3.0. The "template.team" file on your "headocoach1" master disk includes comment lines to help you
in completely specifying player abilities. You may choose to described all ranks on any, some, or none of the player lines. Each
line is processed separately.

				10-4

LO, LD, LK, LP, LQ, and LF

These lines specify player lineups:

	LO--Lineup for offense
	LD--Lineup for defense
	LK--Lineup for kick-off
	LP-Lineup for punting
	LR--Lineup for kick-off return
	LQ--Lineup for punt return
	LF--Lineup for field goal attempt

Each of the lineup lines contains 11 jersey numbers, representing the players in the lineup. The lineup entries must be placed
after the .PL and the player entry lines.

Following are descriptions of the player positions stored in each of the 11 jersey number positions for the various lineups, with
an example for each:

	LO--Offensive Lineup:
		LG LT CR RG RT TE SE HB FB FL QB
		.L0 74 61 60 53 55 17 80 34 32 81 9

	LD--Defensive Lineup:
		For a 43 defense:
			RE RT LT LE WO MI SO RC WS SS LC
		For a 34 defense:
			RE NT LE WO WI SI SO RC WS SS RC

			.LD 75 99 93 97 56 50 27 34 43 41 29

	LK--Kickoff Lineup
		Players from left-to-right, ending with kicker:
			.LK 74 61 60 53 55 17 35 34 43 41 29

	LP--Punt Lineup
		Players from left to right, ending with kicker:
			.LP 75 99 93 97 56 27 34 43 29 80 6

	LR--Punt Return Lineup
		Players from left to right, 3 rows, starting with row 1, then row 2, and row 3:
			.LR 75 61 60 53 55 17 34 35 27 80 32

	LQ--Punt Return Lineup
		Players from left to right, ending with kicker:
			.LQ 75 75 99 60 17 56 41 43 35 32 80

	LF--Field Goal Attempt Lineup
		Players from left to right, ending with kicker:
			.LF 60 61 53 55 99 97 74 75 35 1 3

Remember each line, except the player lines, must begin with either a dollar sign ("$") or a period (".").

CREATING TEAM FILES FOR REAL TEAMS

To create team files that represent actual professional teams, you need to obtain:

	Team statistics
	Player rankings

Team statistics are widely available from a number of publications, usually appearing on newsstands in late summer. These
publications will usually include the statistics you need for Head Coach team files:

	Team punting average
	Team field goal performance
	Team punt return average
	etc.

					10-5

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 10: TEAM FILES

Obtaining realistic ratings of offensive backs and receivers is not difficult, because league standings of these categories are
normally published. However, obtaining player ratings for linemen and defensive players is a bit more difficult.

Fortunately, some publications, while not providing an actual player ranking number, do discuss at length individual players
and their abilities. Therefore, to build real professional team files:

	Collect some publications that list team rosters, statistics, and discuss all categories of players.
	Determine, usually from the publications, the name of the home field, and the colors the team uses at  home
		and on the road.
	Publications usually provide information to determine the lineups required.

Collect your data, and with the Head Coach master menu on the screen, enter a command to edit the file. Suggestion: make a
copy of an existing team file or the template team file, naming the copied file the name of the team you want to build. Use a
Head Coach editing command to edit the new team file.

Remember, player rankings:

	1.0 represents the worst ranking of players that play.
	3.0 is for "average" players.
	5.0 is for the best players.

				10-6

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 11: LEAGUE PLAY

			     SECTION 11
			    LEAGUE PLAY

Supporting league play is accomplished by:

	The "make" utility
	Statistics maintenance while playing games
	The "lo" (League Office) utility

The "make" utility (see Section 2, Getting Started) includes the capability of creating a league file. A league file is a file that
describes a league:

	The name of the league
	The names of the conferences in the league
	The names of the divisions in each conference
	The names of the teams in each division

When playing a Head Coach game, you may choose to have league statistics read in when the game starts, and updated when
the game is over.

The "lo" utility accesses the league file to determine the makeup of the league. After determining your choice of how to process
statistics (by league, by conference, etc.), "lo" collects the team statistics files for all required teams. Then you may examine
the statistics for teams, statistics for players, team standings, etc.

GETTING A LEAGUE STARTED

To play a league, begin by resetting your Amiga and inserting your Head Coach disk. When the master menu is displayed, 
enter:

	make

As described in Section 2, Getting Started, you may format a new disk or simply place new files on an existing disk. When the
"make" utility asks if you would like to form a league, click the "Yes" box.

The "make" utility then asks a series of questions in order to define the league. When finished, the "make" utility writes a
league file onto the disk being "made".

You may also use a text editor ("ed", for example) to build a league file. A league file is a text file containing a series of lines.
Each line specifies one of the following:

	LEAGUE NAME			CONFERENCE NAME
	DIVISION NAME			TEAM NAME

Here is an example of a league file:

	.LN hcfl.
	.CN hcfl.
	.DN east.
	.TN bulldogs.
	.TN rebels.
	.TN hawks.
	.TN buffalos.
	.DN central.
	.TN crusaders.
	.TN longhorns.
	.TN redbirds.
	.TN hornets.
	.DN west.
	.TN tigers.
	.TN panthers.
	.TN mustangs.
	.TN cobras.
	.EN .

				11-1

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 11: LEAGUE PLAY

Each line begins in column one (1) with a period ("."). Following the period are two characters which identify the name being
defined:

	.LN League Name
	.CN Conference Name
	.DN Division Name
	.TN Team name.

The upper case letters must be used. After the identification of the name being defined must be at least one space, the name, 
and finally another period ("."). The last line of the file must be the ".EN ." line, indicating the end of the file. You must begin
the file with the league name, a conference name, a division name, followed by the teams in that division. The remainder of the
file defines the remaining teams, divisions, and conferences.

You must have one league name. You may have from one to three conferences. Each conference may have from one to three
divisions. Each division must have either three, four, or five teams.

When beginning a game, Head Coach will ask if you would like to process league statistics--click the "Yes" box. The
statistics files for the two teams will be read. If any team does not have a statistics file, Head Coach will create a new statistics
file, if you wish.

When the game completes, you may instruct Head Coach to update the statistics files.

To view team standings and league statistics, execute the "lo" utility from your Head Coach disk. By using the mouse, you can
specify the league to be examined, and how the statistics are to be processed. Simply follow the instructions to get the complete
statistics picture for your league.

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				SECTION 12: MODEM PLAY

				SECTION 12
			        MODEM PLAY

Modem play is also called "remote Amiga" playing. This means you have the ability to play a game against an opponent seated
at another Amiga, at some remote location. There are two different forms of remote Amiga:

	Null modem
	Modem

The "Null modem" mode means that two amigas are connected by a standard RS232 cable with a "null modem" adapter. The
RS232 cables and null modem adapter are standard equipment available at your Amiga store. The null modem mode eliminates
the necessity of using a telephone line, but limits the distance between the two Amigas to the length of the cable. If you have
two Amigas in the same room or house, the null modem is a good way to play remote Amiga games.

If you want to play with a friend across town or across the country, the modem mode is required. The modem mode means that
each Amiga is connected to a modem device with a standard Amiga modem cable. Head Coach supports Haynes compatible
modems.

The null modem may be used at speeds up to 19, 200 baud (1920 characters per second). When used with a modem, speeds are
limited by the modem being used.

STARTING A REMOTE AMIGA GAME

When you begin a Head Coach game, Head Coach asks if you are starting up a remote Amiga game; click the "Yes" box.
Head Coach then begins the process of establishing the communication between the two Amiga computers. Head Coach first
needs to know if you are starting up a null modem game. Enter either "N" or "M", as instructed.

Head Coach then directs you through a series of questions that will enable Head Coach to establish communications. Before
beginning a remote Amiga game, you and your opponent must decide:

	Which mode to use (null modem or modem)  
	Baud rate to use (you are given a list of choices)  
	Which team will do the calling  The other team will answer)  
	Which team is home team and which team is the visiting team

After answering the questions, if you are in the modem mode, the calling computer will place a call to the answering computer
(during the dialog, you have already typed in the telephone number of the receiving computer).

The calling computer will send a special message to the answering computer, and await a special response. If the answering
computer does not answer in one minute, the calling computer will repeat the request.

After the communication has been synchronized, starting the game continues normally. When a team file is needed, the file is
taken from the computer for that team (either home or visitor) and is sent to the remote Amiga. In this manner, it is not
necessary for each computer to have the files of the opposing team.

The home team will provide the weather and starting number. At this point each player sees a normal Head Coach game, with
responses for the opponent being taken from the remote Amiga and transmitted to the local Amiga computer. Each player will
see the notice "Waiting..." when the local computer is waiting for the remote player to provide some information.

The communications processing in Head Coach is sophisticated. All data is transmitted in small sections, with validation
information transmitted with each section. If a transmission is bad, due to line noise for example, the transmission will be
retried. Furthermore, at the beginning of each play, the down, distance, game time, and score is compared between the two
computers. This guarantees that the two computers remain fully synchronized.

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				APPENDIX A: USING ED

				APPENDIX A

				USING ED

Ed is a text editor provided by Commodore for use on your Amiga. With Ed you can create new files or modify existing files. A
complete description of the Ed editor is in your AmigaDOS User's Manual. For your convenience, Ed is stored on your Head
Coach disk, and this Appendix presents a description of the basics of using Ed.

The basic functions you need to know are:

	1. Starting Ed
	2. Moving the cursor
	3. Adding characters
	4. Deleting characters
	5. Finding characters
	6. Exiting (ending) Ed

COMMAND MODES

Ed supports two types of commands: immediate and extended. Immediate commands are performed when requested. Extended
commands are executed from the extended mode which requires pressing the escape (ESC) key. Pressing ESC places Ed in the
extended mode as indicated by an asterisk ("*") in the first character position of the bottom line.

STARTING ED

To process a file using Ed, follow the instructions in Section 2, Getting Started, to get the master menu prompt on the screen.
To use Ed on a file, you need to type "Ed", a space, and the name of the file to be processed. For example, if you want to edit a 
file named "blues.team, enter the following:

	Ed blues.team

If "blues.team" exists, you will be modifying the existing file. If "blues.team" does not exist, you will be creating a new file.

MOVING THE CURSOR

When in immediate mode, you may position the cursor one character at a time by using the cursor control keys:

	<up-arrow>	Move cursor up.
	<down-arrow>	Move cursor down.
	<left-arrow>	Move cursor left.
	<right-arrow>	Move cursor right.

The cursor may be moved a word (series of characters surrounded by at least one space) at a time:

	CTRL-R Move to end of previous word.
	CTRL-T Move to start of next word.

CTRL-R means pressing and holding down the "CTRL" key and pressing the "R" key. CTRL-T means both "CTRL" and "T"
being pressed.

The cursor may be positioned to the left or right end of a line:

	CTRL-] Alternate between start and end of line.

The cursor may be positioned to the top or bottom of a screen:

	CTRL-E Alternate between top and bottom of screen.

				A-1

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				APPENDIX A: USING ED

The data being displayed can be scrolled a page at a time, and the cursor correspondingly repositioned, by:

	CTRL-U Scroll text up.
	CTRL-D Scroll text down.

In the extended mode you may position the cursor to the beginning or the ending of a file. Get into the extended mode by
pressing the "ESC" key. An asterisk ("*") appears at the bottom of the screen. You are now in extended mode. To get to the top
or bottom of the file, press the following followed by the RETURN key:

	b Positions to the bottom of the file.
	t Positions to the top of the file.

Summarizing: To position to the bottom of a file type:

	ESC b RETURN

To position to the top of the file:

	ESC t RETURN

After pressing the RETURN key, Ed switches to the immediate mode.

ADDING CHARACTERS

To add characters, Ed must be in the immediate mode. As you type, characters are inserted following the cursor. Characters to
the right of the cursor are shifted right to accommodate the new characters. Characters are not replaced as you type. If you want
to replace characters, the characters must be deleted (described next) and the new characters typed. Or, you may type the new         
characters, then delete the old characters.

DELETING CHARACTERS

In the immediate mode, the following keys delete characters:

	BACKSPACE Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
	DEL Delete the character at the cursor.

Words and groups of spaces may be deleted:

	CTRL-Y Delete all characters to the right of the cursor on the line.

To delete the line containing the cursor:

	CTRL-B Delete the line.

FINDING CHARACTERS

It is very useful to be able to position the cursor at the beginning of a character, word, or phrase. This "find" function is
requested from the extended mode. For example, if you are modifying a team file and want to change the name of the team, 
you need to position the cursor at the ".NA" data line of the team file. Execute the following steps:

	1. Get into extended mode by pressing ESC.
	2. Type the following:

		f/.NA/

	3. Press RETURN.

Ed will begin to search forward, starting at the current cursor position, until the string ".NA" is found. If found, the cursor is
positioned at the beginning of the string. If not found, an error message is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

				A-2

PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SIMULATION BY MICROSEARCH				APPENDIX A: USING ED

To locate a string that may be anywhere in the file, first position the cursor to the top of file as previously explained. This will
ensure the search starts at the beginning of the file.

To search from the current cursor position in the reverse direction (toward the beginning of the file), use "bf/" instead of "f/."

Another example: to locate the characters 42.9					TABLE A-1. BASIC ED FUNCTIONS
type the following:
