                            INSECTS IN SPACE DOCS

SCENARIO
Once upon a time, deep in the heart of Germany, there lived a big breasted
angelic woman called Helen Bak (Ha Ha Ha - Geddit?? - TORCH).

Thousands of years later, long after she had passed away, Earth was invaded by
a strange race of insects intent on populating the planet.  They had reached
every corner of the world, but for this remote valley in the middle of
Rhineland.

What happened was that the insects' deadly poison did not affect small babies
in this area due to their diet of local grape juice, so they still survived. 
Saint Helen, arch-leader of the Motherhood, heard the distant impoverished
cries of the poor babies from space and has travelled to Earth, in a last,
desperate bid to 'save mankind'.

Equipped with her laser eyes, and your skill and judgement, you are to help St.
Helen in her task to rid the planet of the awful insect menace.

GAMEPLAY
St. Helen has to stop the bees from grabbing the babies, taking them to a great
height and dropping them to the ground and making a nasty mess on the floor. 
If she shoots a bee while it is carrying a baby, the baby will fall to its
death unless it is caught by Helen and returned safely to the ground.  She has
to return 'top' babies to the top landscape, and 'bottom' babies to the bottom
lsndscape.  If she leaves the bees to carry the babies for too long they will
drop the babies to their death and also give birth to a fly in their excitement
which will cause Helen extra hassle.

St. Helen has two weapons.  One is her superb 'laser vision' to combat the evil
forces of the universe (use this by pressing FIRE for a short
time).  The second gift bestowed upon her by the Gods on High is the ability to
conjure up a magical circle of space-time continuum dust (do this by holding
down the FIRE button longer than usual).  This will enable Helen to travel
through space by continuing to hold down the FIRE button as she enters the dust
circle.

St. Helen can be carrying more than one baby at a time, and if she has enough
babies at one time she can temporarily 'save' them them by entering a dust
circle without holding the FIRE button down, thereby keeping them out of the
clutches of the evil insects (at least until another wave descends).  At this
time she is also gifted with Extra Bonus Feature Capability, dependant
upon the number and combination of Top and Bottom babies she holds:

extra laser from their eyes giving Helen extra firepower.
