[IKARI Warriors] 

This is basically an upwards scrolling shoot-em-up and is full of sound and
graphics.  Your character or characters (one or two can play) have crashed
landed and now must run the gauntlet.  

The view is from above and the graphics are nice.  The enemy, which attacks
in literally waves is not very smart, but numbers seem to overcome their
stupidity (for example, they do not shoot you when you are besides or above
them).  

Moving your character to the middle of the screen makes the computer move
the screen down 1/3 the way to show more of what's above you.  A good
technique I have used is to move till the screen shifts and then move back
down to plan my attack. 

You start with a repeating type rifle that also shoots a grenade if you
hold down the fire button.  The bullets seem to have a life of only 1/3rd
of the screen.  

Watch for special areas that light up when destroyed that give you more
ammunition.  Also don't forget to make use of the occasional tank that you
may happen upon.  Don't forget to get out of it when it catches fire.

Be prepared, for this is a long game.
