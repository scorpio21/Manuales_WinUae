ABOUT INDIANA JONES AND FATE OF ATLANTIS

The year is 1938, Indiana Jones, famed archaeologist adventurer, has
come across two artifacts -- a minotaur statuette and a mysterious
bead -- that he believes might be evidence that Atlantis did, in fact
exist.  When the artifacts are stolen, Indy discovers that the thief
has been carrying a magazine article about a psychic specializing in
the lore of Atlantis.  "Madame Sophia" turns out to be Sophia Hapgood
a long-ago colleague of Indy's.
Indy finds Sophia in New York City, where the thief appears again, this
time relieving Sophia of her Atlantean artifacts.  Despite his skepticism
about Sophia's mystical approach to Atlantis, Indy agrees to let her
acompany him in his search for the fabled island.
Indy and Sophia have no way of knowing that the thief is Klaus Kerner,
a top Nazi agent working for Dr.Hans Ubermann.  Using the stolen 
artifacts and one of the beads (called `orichalcum'), Ubermann confirms
his theories regarding the incredible energies stored in the beads.
Kerner is dispatched on a hunt for the presumed source of orichalcum:
Atlantis.  He is determined to succeed in his quest, and isn't about
to let Indiana Jones stand in his way.
Meantime, Indy and Sophia have made their way to Monte Carlo, seeking
on Alain Trottier, a dealer in antiquities who, they hope, can help
them in their race against the Nazis to discover... THE FATE OF ATLANTIS!

GETTING STARTED

To start the game on your computer, please use the reference card 
included with the game.  It contains all the instructions specific 
to your computer.  
The game opens with a series of stills depicting the events leading 
to the arrival of Indy and Sophia in Monte Carlo, followed by the
credits screen, the high score table, and a "movie" showing gameplay
hints and highlights.  During the movie, you can change the camera
angle, or you can press the space bar to restart the sequence.
Pressing the space bar during the title screen will load the actual
game.
Once you've started the program, a screen will appear displaying a 
two character code and a window designation.  Align the first and 
second characters onj the outer and inner sections of the code wheel
and enter the corresponding code revealed in the designated window
The game will begin after the correct code is entered.
At anytime during the title, credits or high score screens, you can
press the F3 key to access the Options Screen and use the game's
default control settings.  Check your reference card for a list of
the default settings on your computer.

THE DISPLAY

The display consists of the following elements:

-> The ACTION SCREEN is the largest part of the display.  This is
   where the animated actions takes place.
-> the HEALTH METER appears in the upper right-hand corner of the 
   display.  It shows the currently selected character's health, and
   will drop if the character is hurt (health can be partially restored
   by eating chocolate).  If the health level drops to a critical level
   the character is knocked out, captured and imprisoned by the Nazis
   it will then be necessary for the remaining character to rescue him
   or her.  If both characters are captured the game ends.
-> The COMPASS is located in the upper left-hand corner of the display
   It shows the direction of the exit from the level, relative to the
   Current character's position.  The compass needle will spin when you
   are at the exit point.
-> The TIMER appears on the left hand side of the screen.  It is activated
   when certain time sensitive events are set in motion -- if it completes
   a full sweep, the game is over.
-> The SELECTED CHARACTER ICON indicates which character you are currently
   directing, and appears in the lower left-hand corner of the display.
-> OTHER CHARACTER STATUS is shown on the bottom of the display.  The
   moving sine wave represents the health of the other character: green
   indicates that health is good, yellow means that health is critical.
   If the sine wave turns red, the other character has been captured.  The
   sine wave begins to flash when the other character is engaged in a 
   fight.  The green button means that the other character is in `go' mode
   a red button indicates that you have told the other character to `stop'
   for further information see controlling the camera action and characters
   below.
-> The INVENTORY, located in the lower right hand corner of the display,
   shows the item currently in use.

CONTROLLING THE CHARACTERS AND THE CAMERA ANGLE

As the game begins, you are directing Indy in Trottier's casino in Monte
Carlo.  Sophia is elsewhere in the building.
You can move either Indy or Sophia by using the Keyboard, joystick, mouse
The keyboard is always active; other devices must be selected on the
Options Screen prior to starting the game.  See your reference card for
a description of the keyboard, joystick and mouse settings for your 
computer.
By pressing the SWITCH CHARACTER key, you can switch control to Indy or
Sophia.  You have full control over the character to whom you have 
switched (the `current character'); the other character's actions are
determined by the mode in which they have been set.
`Go' mode allows the other character to wander freely through the location
under computer control.  `Stop' mode limits the range to a smaller area.
To change the current character's mode, select the appropriate button
(red for `stop' or green for `go') in his or her inventory, and press
USE key.  To quickly change the other characters mode, select the 
appropriate button and press the USE key twice.
Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis features the ability to view
the action from any of four angles.  Using the cameras, which are 
placed north, south, east and west of any game action, will give you a
better idea of the areas you're exploring, and can sometimes reveal
objects -- even doorways -- that would otherwise remain concealed.  Your
reference card lists the keys that control camera angle switching.
During their quest, Indy and Sophia will often find it necessary to
defend themselves when attacked.  To fight with an opponent make sure
you have a weapon selected, then face your opponent and press the USE
key.  At first, Indy can USE only his fists or his whip, while Sophia
delivers a surprisingly effective kick if you have selected the shoe
in her inventory.  As the game progresses you'll find other, more
effective weapons.
If you fight well enough, you will knock out your enemy.  This can be
your chance to escape the conflict, though your opponent might have
dropped useful items such as chocolate or money.  But be careful: an
unconscious enemy will soon recover and renew his attack.
Remember, the OTHER CHARACTER might wind up in an altercation while
your current character is engaged elsewhere.  Keep an eye on the other
character status display; if the sine wave begins to flash, you might
need to switch characters and take over the fight.

MESSAGE ICONS

From time to time, characters in the game will need to communicate
with you.  Since neither Indy nor Sophia speak the local languages, the 
messages appear in the form of icons which you will have to translate
using the following chart:
