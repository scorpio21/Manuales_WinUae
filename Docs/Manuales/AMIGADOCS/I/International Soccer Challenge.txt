OF CHAMPIONS.ONCE AGAIN,IF YOUR FAVOURITE ISNT INCLUDED,YOU CAN REMOVE ONE OF
THE 16 AND PLAY FOR YOUR OWN TOP TEAM.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRACTISE-SESSION (OPTION DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE WORLD AND INT OPTIONS)

ONCE YOU HAVE SELECTED TO PRACTISE,THE FIRST PRACTISE DISCIPLINE,`PASSING` WILL
BECOME HIGHLIGHTED. TO SELECT ANOTHER PRACTISE DISCIPLINE,MOVE THE JOYSTICK UP
OR DOWN,UNTIL THE DISCIPLINE YOU WISH TO PRACTISE IS HIGHLIGHTED.THEN PRESS THE
FIRE BUTTON TO START THE PRACTISE SESSION.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ONCE YOU HAVE SELECTED TO PRACTISE PASSING,THE MATCH DISPLAY WILL BE SHOWN.THE
MAIN WINDOW WILL SHOW THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE.

`PRESS BUTTON TO START PRACTISE`...(ESC) TO EXIT
PRESS FIRE TO REVEAL THE PITCH.

INT SOC CHALL IS VIEWED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE UNIQUE TO COMPUTER SOCCER
GAMES,YOU ARE AT PITCH-LEVEL,LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR OPPONENTS GOAL
DURING PASSING-PRACTISE,THE MAN NEAREST TO YOU IN THE MAIN WINDOW IS UNDER YOUR
CONTROL,AND HE WILL HAVE THE BALL NEAR HIS FEET.
BY REFERRING TO THE RADAR MAP ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN.YOU WILL SEE
THE POSITION OF THE BALL(A BLACK DOT) AND A MAN UNDER YOU CONTROL(A RED DOT
NEXT TO THE BALL).THERE IS ANOTHER RED DOT,SHOWING THE POSITION OF YOUR
TEAM-MATE AWAITING A PASS.

YOUR AIM IS TO PASS THE BALL O YOUR TEAM-MATES FEET BY BALANCING THE 3 FACTORS
WHICH COMBINE TO AFFECT THE PASS;POWER,DIRECTION AND HEIGHT.

ALL THREE FACTORS ARE CONTROLLED BY JOYSTICK FUNCTIONS;


       LOW AND LEFT            MINIMUM HEIGHT           LOW AND RIGHT


                              `FIRE AND POWER`
       SWERVE RIGHT            (FIRE BUTTON)            SWERVE RIGHT



       HIGH AND RIGHT           MAXIMUM HEIGHT          HIGH AND RIGHT

DO NOT EXPECT TO HIT AN ACCURATE PASS AT THE FIRST ATTEMPT-PRACTISE MAKES
PERFECT!!!, AND YOU CAN PRACTISE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE POWER:

THE FIRST FACTOR TO CONSIDER IS THE STRENGTH OF KICK YOU WISH TO USE IN THE
MAKING OF THE PASS.BELOW THE MAIN WINDOW YOU WILL SEE TWO HORIZONTAL INDICATOR
BARS,HOLD THE FIRE BUTTON DOWN,AND WATCH THE BARS. THE LOWER INDICATOR WILL
SHOW A YELLOW BAR EXTENDING LEFT TO RIGHT,AND THE PLAYER WILL KICK THE BALL.
THIS IS THE POWER INDICATOR,AND HAS 4 GRADATIONS ALONG ITS LENGTH. IF YOU HELD
THE FIRE BUTTON DOWN,THE YELLOW BAR WILL HAVE FILLED THE INDICATOR TO THE
FOURTH GRADIATION,AND YOU WILL HAVE STRUCK THE PASS WITH MAXIMUM POWER. THE
LONGER YOU HOLD THE FIRE BUTTON DOWN,THE GREATER THE PASS.

THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE WILL NOW BE DISPLAYED IN THE MAIN WINDOW;

`PRESS;-BUTTON TO TRY AGAIN
(SPACE) FOR NEW PASS
(ESC) TO EXIT

PRESS THE FIRE TO TRY AGAIN, THE PITCH WILL REAPPEAR.
THIS TIME,HOLD THE FIRE BUTTON FOR A SHORTER PERIOD,ATTEMPTING TO PUT LESS
POWER INTO THE PASS.
THE POWER LEVEL YOU MUST USE FOR THIS PASS IS HALF POWER(2 GRADATIONS OF THE
BAR)CONTINUE PRACITICING THE SAME PASS UNTIL YOU CONSISTENTLY GET THE POWER
LEVEL CORRECT,WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT OTHER JOYSTICK MOVEMENTS.
ONCE THE POWER LEVEL IS CORRECT,THE BALL WILL TRAVEL IN A STRAIGHT LINE,TAKEN
FROM YOUR PLAYER,THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE BALL,BUT WILL STILL BE WIDE OF YOUR
TARGET. BUT WITH A LITTLE SWERVE ON THE BALL, YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH OF KICK TO
MAKE A PERFECT PASS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIRECTION:

NOW TRY THE SAME PASS AGAIN WITH THE PERFECT POWER,AND THINK ABOUT THE
DIRECTION NEEDED TO PLAY THE BALL TO YOUR TEAM-MATES FEET.
THE DESTINATION OF THE STRAIGHT PASS IS SHOWN BY THE CIRCLE,AND ITS PATH BY THE
SOLID LINE.TO REACH THE TARGET PLAYER,THE BALL MUST LEAVE ITS CURRENT PATH AND
SWERVE RIGHT, THE DIRECTION OF THE SWERVE IS CONTROLLED BY MOVING THE JOYSTICK
TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT-IN THIS EXAMPLE IT MUST BE MOVED RIGHT.

THE TIMING OF THE SWERVE:

IMAGINE YOU ARE ACTUALLY KICKING A BALL.ONCE THE BALL BREAKS CONTACT WITH YOUR
FOOT,IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ALTER THE SPEED OR DIRECTION OF ITS JOURNEY.INT SOC
CHALL,UNLIKE OTHER COMPUTERS FOOTY GAMES,DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO MAKE DECISIONS
ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF THE BALL AFTER HITTING IT-ITS LIKE REAL LIFE FOOTBALL.
THE TIME CONSTRAINTS ON DECISION MAKING WHEN MAKING A PASS ARE THE SAME IN INT
SOC CHALL AS THEY ARE IN REAL FOOTBALL.
FROM THE MOMENT YOU FIRST PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON TO THE TIME THE PLAYER KICKS
THE BALL IS ALL YOU HAVE-ITS NOT LONG!. IN THAT TIME YOU MUST MOVE THE
JOYSTICK(TO THE RIGHT IN THIS EXAMPLE).DONT BE SURPRISED IF YOU FIND THE
TECHNIQUE A DIFFICULT ONE TO MASTER AT FIRST. THATS WHAT THE PRACTISE SESSIONS
ARE FOR.
TRY TO GET THE TIMING RIGHT WITH A FEW PRACTISE PASSES.DONT WORRY IF YOUR POWER
GOES SLIGHTLY ASTRAY,GIVEN PRACTISE,POWER AND DIRECTION WILL COME TOGETHER
TAKING THE BALL ON A PERFECT PATH TO YOUR TEAM-MATES FEET.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HEIGHT:

ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED POWER AND DIRECTION,ALL THAT IS LEFT TO PRACTISE IS
GETTING THE BALL TO FLY THROUGH THE AIR AT THE CORRECT HEIGHT,OR TO SKIM THE
GRASS AS YOU WISH. IN PRACTISE MODE,WITH ONLY TWO PLAYERS ON THE PITCH,THERE IS
NO NEED TO ALTER THE HEIGHT OF THE BALL IN FLIGHT-SO LONG AS IT ARRIVES AT THE
TARGETS FEET. IN A MATCH,HOWEVER,YOU WILL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HIT ACCURATE
PASSES OVER INCOMING OPPONENTS,OR SLIDE THE BALL LOW UNDER A DIVING GOALKEEPER.
ONCE AGAIN,THE TIME SPACE AVAILABLE IN WHIC TO PUT HEIGHT ON THE BALL IS
SHORT.THE HEIGHT OF YOUR PASSES IS DETERMINED BY MOVING JOYSTICK BACKWARDS OR
FORWARDS WHILST YOUR PLAYER IS SWINGING AT THE BALL.HEIGHT AND SWERVE CAN BE
PUT ON THE BALL SIMULTANEOUSLY BY USING THE DIAGONAL MOVEMENTS OF THE JOYSTICK.
PRACTISE SENDING THE BALL TO YOUR TEAM MATE VIA A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
TRAJECTORIES.

FINALLY,ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THAT PARTICULAR PASS,PRESS THE SPACE BAR ON THE
KEYBOARD TO TRY A DIFFERENT ONE.YOUR STARTING AND TARGET POSITIONS WILL BE
DIFFERENT,AND ONCE AGAIN YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THE THREE
FACTORS;POWER,DIRECTION AND HEIGHT.
WHEN YOU HAVE PERFECTED A NUMBER OF PASSES,PRESS ESC TO RETURN TO THE GAMES
SCREEN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEASURING YOUR SUCCESS:

ONCE YOU MAKE THE PERFECT PASS,YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE UPPER OF THE TWO
INDICATOR BARS TURNS RED,AND A WHISTLE WILL BLOW. THE TOP INDICATOR IS THE
POSSESSION INDICATOR,AND TURNS RED ON COMPLETION OF A GOOD PASS TO SHOW THAT
THE TEAM IN RED(IE;YOU)ARE NOW IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL.YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED
THAT AS YOU STRUCK THE BALL INITIALLY,THE BAR ALSO FLASHED RED,SHOWING THAT FOR
A SHORT TIME YOUR FOOT WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE BALL,YOU HAD POSSESSION,WHILST
THE BALL TRAVELS THROUGH THE AIR,AND IS NOT UNDER ANY ONE`S CONTROL,THE
INDICATOR WILL BE BLACK.
THIS INDICATOR BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT DURING MATCHES.IT WILL ALWAYS SHOW YOU AT
A GLANCE WHICH TEAM IS IN POSSESSION.
AS YOU PRACTISE ANY OF THE DISCIPLINES,THE SCOREBOARD ON THE RIGHT OF THE
SCREEN WILL SHOW YOU HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED IN EXECUTING THE
EXERCISE PERFECTLY(THE LOWER RED NUMBER) AND THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU HAVE
FAILED(THE UPPER BLUE NUMBER).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXTENDING THE PRINCIPLES:

THE BASIC PRINCIPLES BEHIND PASSING THE BALL CAN THEN BE EXTENDED TO COVER
SHOTS AT GOAL.AT ITS IMPLEST,A SHOT ON GOAL IS LIKE PASSING TO AN IMAGINARY
POINT IN THE BACK OF THE NET. MORE ACCURATELY,IT IS A PASS THROUGH THE
IMAGINARY POINT,AS YOU WILL PROBABLY TRY TO HIT THE BALL AS HARD AS YOU CAN.
ALL METHODS OF APPLYING POWER,SWERVE AND HEIGHT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME FOR
SHOOTING AS THEY ARE PASSING.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PENALTY KICKS:

ONCE YOU HAVE SELECTED TO PRACTISE PENALTIES.THE MAIN MATCH DISPLAY WILL BE
SHOWN.THE MAIN WINDOW WILL SHOW THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE;

`PRESS BUTTON TO START PRACTISE`

(ESC) TO EXIT.......PRESSING FIRE REVEALS THE PITCH

YOU WILL SEE THE PENALTY AREA AND GOAL,WITH YOUR PLAYER READY TO TAKE THE
PENALTY,AND THE OPPOSITIONS GOALKEEPER ON HIS GOAL LINE.PENALTY TAKING IS
EASIER THAN NORMAL SHOOTING,AS YOU NEED ONLY CONCERN YOURSELF WITH THE
PLACEMENT OF THE SHOT. THE POWER IS AUTOMATICALLY CONTROLLED FOR YOU.

TO TAKE A PENALTY,PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON.YOUR PLAYER WILL BEGIN TO KICK THE
BALL,AND  IN THE SAME WAY AS BEFORE YOU HAVE A S[PLIT SECOND DECISION TO ALTER
THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHOT.MOVE THE JOYSTICK LEFT OR RIGHT TO SWERVE THE SHOT
LEFT OR RIGHT. YOU CAN ALSO SHOOT FOR THE CENTRE OF THE GOAL. THE `KEEPER` MAY
DIVE THE  RIGHT WAY,THE WRONG WAY,OR NOT AT ALL. SO LONG AS YOU GIVE NO
INDICATION OF WHERE YOU`RE GOING TO PUT THE BALL,HE`LL ONLY BE GUESSING.
HOWEVER,IF YOU MOVE THE JOYSTICK TO EARLY,HE`LL USE HIS INTELLIGENCE AND TRY TO
MOVE IN THE DIRECTION YOU ARE SHOOTING.TIMING IS EVERYTHING!
ONCE AGAIN,YOU MAY PRACTISE AS MANY PENALTIES AS YOU WANT,IN BETWEEN PENALTIES
YOU WILL SEE A MESSAGE IN THE MAIN WINDOW. INVITING YOU TO PRESS FIRE TO TRY
AGAIN..OR (ESC) TO EXIT BACK TO THE GAME OPTIONS SCREEN.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOALKEEPING:

DURING PLAY THE GOALKEEPER WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CONTROLLED FOR YOU,AND A HIGH
DEGREE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMMED INTO THE GAME WILL TAKE CARE OF
MOST SITUATIONS.
THERE IS HOWEVER,ONE EXCEPTION.`PENALTIES` WHEN IT COMES TO FACING THE
GOALKEEPERS NIGHTMARE,YOU`RE IN CHARGE.
ONCE YOU HAVE SELECTED TO PRACTISE SAVING PENALTIES. THE MAIN MATCH DISPLAY
WILL BE SHOWN. THE MAIN WINDOW WILL SHOW THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE.

`PRESS BUTTON TO START PRACTISE`

(ESC) TO EXIT......PRESS FIRE TO REVEAL THE PITCH.

YOU WILL SEE THE PENALTY AREA AND GOAL,WITH AN OPPOSING PLAYER READY TO TAKE
THE PENALTY,AND YOUR GOALKEEPER ON HIS GOAL LINE.
THE CONTROL METHOD FOR SAVING PENALTIES IS SIMILAR TO THAT FOR TAKING THEM.THE
PENALTY TAKER WILL AUTOMATICALLY TAKE HIS SHOT WHEN HE READY.TO DIVE TO THE
LEFT FOR THE BALL PUSH THE JOYSTICK LEFT,TO DIVE RIGHT PUSH THE JOYSTICK
RIGHT.TO STAND STILL,DONT TOUCH THE JOYSTICK.
IF YOU MOVE BEFORE THE BALL IS STRUCK,THE OPPOSING PLAYER WILL HAVE TIME TO SEE
WHICH WAY YOU ARE DIVING,AND WILL PROBABLY AIM FOR THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF
GOAL.ONCE AGAIN SUCCESSFUL PENALTY SAVES REQUIRE PRECISE TIMING.
WHEN YOU HAVE PERFECTED A NUMBER OF SAVES,PRESS [ESC] TO RETURN TO THE GAME
OPTIONS MENU.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORNERS:
USUAL THING WHEN SELECTING TO PRACTISE CORNERS..THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE.

`PRESS BUTTON TO START PRACTISE` [ESC] TO EXIT..PRESS FIRE TO REVEAL PITCH.

CORNERS VARY FROM NORMAL PASSES IN TWO RESPECTS,FIRSTLY,YOU CANNOT PASS AWAY
FROM YOUR GOAL,AS YOU ARE RESTRICTED BY THE BYLINE.AND SECONDLY,YOU ARE LIKELY
TO BE PASSING INTO A CROWDED PENALTY AREA,SO ACCURACY IS PREMIUM.
THE POSITION OF THE PLAYER TAKING THE CORNER(WHOM YOU CONTROL) AND THE
DIRECTION OF THE BALL IF KICKED STRAIGHT IS SHOWN BELOW,FOR A CORNER FROM THE
RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE PITCH.
AS WITH THE OTHER PASSES,YOU CAN VARY THE POWER,DIRECTION AND HEIGHT OF THE
PASS VIA THE JOYSTICK.POWER AND HEIGHT WORK EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS BEFORE-THE
LONGER YOU HOLD DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON,THE HARDER YOU KICK THE BALL,AND HEIGHT IS
VARIED BY PULLING BACK ON THE JOYSTICK FOR MAXIMUM HEIGHT AND PUSHING FORWARD
FOR MINIMUM HEIGHT.
THE DIRECTION IS VARIED BY MOVING THE JOYSTICK LEFT OR RIGHT,TAKING THE BALL
AWAY FROM ITS `STRAIGHT` PATH. IF THE CORNER IS FROM THE LEFT,PUSHING THE
JOYSTICK RIGHT WILL MAKE THE BALL SWING OUT,AND LEFT WILL MAKE IT SWING IN.
AS WITH OTHER PASSES,TIMING IS ESSENTIAL,YOU HAVE ONLY A SHORT TIME TO GIVE THE
BALL SWERVE AND HEIGHT,YOU SHOULD PRACTISE CORNERS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE
PITCH,ISING THE RADAR MAP TO AIM FOR ONE OF YOUR TEAM MEMBERS IN OR AROUND THE
PENALTY AREA.
ONCE YOU HAVE PRACTISED A NUMBER OF CORNERS..PRESSING [ESC] TAKES YOU TO THE
GAME OPTIONS MENU.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT DIFFICULTY LEVEL:

INT SOC CHALL OFFERS 3 LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY..EASY;MEDIUM;HARD...THE LEVELS GIVE
PROGRESSIVELY HARDER PLAY AS THE INTELLIGENCE OF OPPONENETS INCREASES AT EACH
LEVEL.HOWEVER THERE IS ANOTHER FACTOR INFLUENCING DIFFICULTY;THE TYPE OF
PASSING.
AT `EASY` LEVEL,AN `EASY` PASSING FUNCTION IS AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATED.THIS
HELPS BEGINNERS BY MAKING THE BALL INTELLIGENT,IN ADDITION TO THE INTELLIGENCE
OF THE PLAYERS.IF YOU PASS THE BALL,IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SEEK OUT ONE OF YOUR
TEAM-MATES,WITHIN REASON,MAKING TEAM WORK EASIER,AND THE GAME FLOW
QUICKLY,AVOIDING THE FRUSTRATION OF SEEING YOUR PASSES WILDLY OFF TARGET,GIVING
THE BALL AWAY.THE FUNCTION OF THE POWER BAR IS ELIMINATED WHEN THE `EASY`
PASSING FUNCTION IS ACTIVE.THE STRENGTH OF YOUR PASSES IS
`AUTOMATICALLY`CALCULATED BY THE COMPUTER SO AS TO TAKE THE BALL NEAR,OR TO,A
TEAM-MATE.
HOWEVER,THE EASY PASSING FUNCTION IS AUTOMATICALLY DEACTIVATED WHEN THE BALL IS
IN YOUR OPPONENTS PENALTY AREA,ALLOWING YOU TO SHOOT AT GOAL,AND TO CONTROL THE
POWER OF THE SHOT BY PRESSING AND HOLDING THE FIRE BUTTON FOR THE DESIRED
LENGTH OF TIME.
AT `INTERMEDIATE` LEVEL THE BALL IS SEMI-INTELLIGENT.IF YOU MAKE A PASS WHICH
WILL LAND CLOSE TO A TEAM-MATE,THE BALL WILL CORRECT ITSELF OVER THE LAST FEW
FEET OF THE PASS,ENDING CLOSE ENOUGH TO YOUR TEAM-MATE FOR HIM TO TAKE
CONTROL.YOU MAY SHOOT FROM ANYWHERE ON THE PITCH.
AT `ADVANCED` LEVEL THE BALL IS ONLY INFLUENCED BY THE DIRECTION,POWER AND
HEIGHT YOU GIVE IT AS YOU KICK IT.IT IS THE BEST TEST OF TRUE FOOTBALLING
ABILITIES,BUT TAKES TIME TO MASTER.
ONCE YOU HAVE SELECTED YOUR DIFFICULTY LEVEL,YOU WILL BE SHOWN THE TEAM LISTS
FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE ONE OF THE COUNTRIES COMPETING IN `ITALIA 90`
PLAY IN GROUP A,B OR C WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED AT THE TOP OF SCREEN,AND THE LIST OF
THOSE TEAMS IN GROUPS A,B AND C ARE SHOWN BELOW IT.TO SEE THE TEAMS IN GROUPS
D,E OR F,HIGHLIGHT `PLAY IN GROUP D,E OR F`,BUT DO NOT PRESS FIRE. ONCE YOU
HAVE DECIDED WHICH GROUP YOU WISH TO PLAY IN,SELECT THE APPROPRIATE GROUP
OPTION AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN BY HIGHLIGHTING IT AND PRESSING FIRE.
THE LIST OF NTEAMS IN THOSE THREE GROUPS WILL BE SHOWN,WITH THE OPTIONS TO

PLAYING A MATCH:

EACH MATCH BEGINS WITH A PANORAMIC CAMERA VIEW OF THE STADIUM ZOOMING DOWN
PITCH LEVEL.THE INFO DISPLAY TELLS YOU WHICH TEAMS ARE PLAYING,AND WHICH
COMPETITION YOU ARE PLAYING IN.THE TEAMS EMERGE FROM THE TUNNEL,AND TAKE UP
THEIR POSITIONS FOR THE KICK OFF. THIS OPENING SEQUENCE CAN BE SKIPPED BY
PRESSING FIRE.

REMEMBER THAT THE RADAR MAP SHOWS YOU THE POSITIONS OF THE PLAYER AND BALL,THE
BALL IS SHOWN BY A BLACK DOT.THE PLAYER UNDER YOUR CONTROL IS SHOWN BY A
FLASHING DOT.
THE CAMERA VIEW THROUGH THE MAIN WINDOWN SHOWS THE PITCH,LOOKING TOWARDS YOUR
OPPONENTS GOAL,THE VIEW WILL CHANGE AS THE ACTION MOVES UP AND DOWN THE
PITCH,ACCORDING TO TWO FACTORS,MOST OF THE TIME,IT WILL SHOW THE PLAYER UNDER
YOUR CONTROL AS THE FIGURE IN THE CENTRE OF THE WINDOW.IT WILL TRACK THIS
PLAYER WHEREVER HE IS ON THE PITCH,UNLESS THE BALL IS NEARER TO YOUR GOAL THAN
THE PLAYER IS.WHEN THE BALL IS `BEHIND` YOUR PLAYER,THE CAMERA VIEW WILL TRACK
THE BALL,WITH YOUR PLAYER VISIBLE IN THE DISTANCE.THIS ENABLES YOU TO
CONSTANTLY SEE THE BALL,AS WELL AS YOUR PLAYER.

THE ACTION MAY BE PAUSED AT ANY TIME BY PRESSING THE `P` KEY ON THE KEYBOARD.TO
RESTART THE ACTION,PRESS `P` AGAIN.
INT SOC CHALL HAS TWO TYPES OF PLAY,`TEAM` OR `PLAYER` ONE OF WHICH YOU WILL
HAVE SELECTED EARLIER.ALTHOUGH MANY FEATURES ARE COMMON TO BOTH,THE CONTROL
METHOD DIFFERS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYER:

INT SOC CHALL WAS DESIGNED TO BE PLAYED IN THE `PLAYER` STYLE.YOU CONTROL ONE
PLAYER,WHEREVER HE IS ON THE PITCH,AND WHEREVER THE BALL IS.THIS STYLE ALLOWS
YOU TO DEVOLP YOUR GAME IN ONE POSITION .ON THE PITCH.REAL FOOTBALLERS ARE NOT
PLAYING AS A SWEEPER ONE MINUTE AND WINGER NEXT.ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOTHING TO
STOP ANY PLAYER TEMPOORARILY MOVING OUT OF POSITION TO JOIN AN ATTACK OR ADD
STRENGTH TO THE DEFENCE. YOU MUST PLAY AS ONE OF A TEAM.OTHER PLAYERS ON YOUR
TEAM WILL SCORE,MAKE CRUCIAL TACKLES,AND HIT PERFECT PASSES. YOU HAVE YOUR ROLE
IN THE TEAM,WHICH AT ONETIME OR ANOTHER WILL INVOLVE PERFORMING IN ALL ASPECTS
OF PLAY,BUT LIKE REAL; FOOTBALLERS,YOU CAN OFTEN CONTRIBUTE MORE TO A GOAL BY
INTELLIGENTLY RUNNING INTO SPACE AND CALLING FOR THE BALL THAN BY ATTEMPTING TO
DRIBBLE THE BALL OUT OF YOUR OWN PENALTY AREA.
AS THE GAME KICKS OFF,YOU WILL SEE THAT ONE OF YOUR TEAM HAS A WHITE ARROW
ABOVE HIS HEAD-HE IS THE PLAYER UNDER YOUR CONTROL-AND ANOTHER HAS A FLASHING
YELLOW QUESTON MARK-HE IS THE PLAYER NEAREST THE BALL.
SOME OF THE TIME,THE PLAYER UNDER YOUR CONTROL WILL BE THE PLAYER NEAREST THE
BALL.AT OTHER TIMES THE PLAYER UNDER CONTROL MAY BE HALF A PITCH LENGTH OR MORE
AWAY FROM THE BALL! WHEN THE PLAYER I\UNDER YOUR CONTROL IS THE NEAREST MAN TO
THE BALL,THE YELLOW QUESTION MARK WILL DISAPPEAR.

THE MOVEMENTS OF THE PLAYER UNDER YOUR DIRECTION IS CONTROLLED BY A VARIETY OF
JOYSTICK FUNCTIONS.WHEN HE IS NOT IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL,THE JOYSTICK MOVES
HIM IN ONE OF EIGHT DIRECTIONS;

          UP AND LEFT            MOVE UPFIELD           UP AND RIGHT



          MOVE LEFT                                     MOVE RIGHT



          DOWN AND LEFT          MOVE DOWNFIELD         DOWN AND RIGHT


WHEN HE HAS GAINED POSSESSION OF THE BALL,THE JOYSTICK MOVEMENTS WILL MAKE HIM
RUN WITH THE BALL IN THE SAME WAY AS HE RUNS WITHOUT THE BALL.
PRESSING SPACE ON THE KEYBOARD WHEN YOUR TEAM,BUT NOT YOUR PLAYER HAS THE
BALL,IS IN POSSESION,WILL `CALL` FOR THE BALL.YOUR TEAM-MATE WHO HAS THE BALL
WILL PASS TO YOU AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY,HE WILL PASS THE BALL TO THE
POSITION FROM WHICH YOU CALLED FOR THE BALL.IF YOUR MAN IS MOVING,KEEP
CALLING!.
THE EFFECTS OF PRESSING THE FIRE BUTTON ON THE JOYSTICK DIFFER ACCORDING TO THE
SITUATION THE PLAYER UNDER CONTROL IS IN;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: CONTROLLED PLAYER IS NOT NEAREST TO THE BALL.

IF THERE IS A TEAM MATE CLOSER TO THE BALL THAN YOUR CONTROLLED PLAYER,PRESSING
FIRE WILL AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE CONTROL TO THAT TEAM MATE NEAREST THE
BALL.JOYSTICK MOVEMENTS NOW AFFECT THE NEW PLAYER.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2: CONTROLLED PLAYER IS NEAREST TEAM MEMBER TO THE BALL.

IF THE CONTROLLED PLAYER PLAYER IS THE NEAREST TEAM MEMBER TO THE BALL,BUT NOT
IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL,PRESSING FIRE WILL INITIATE A SLIDING TACKLE IN THE
DIRECTION IN WHICH HE IS MOVIMNG.HOWEVER,A SLIDING TACKLE WILL NOT BE INITIATED
IF HE IS NOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO SUCCEED WITH THE TACKLE.
TACKLING IS THE ONLY WAY TO DISPOSSES OPPONENTS,AND THE TIMING OF THE TACKLE IS
CRUCIAL IF YOU WISH TO AVOID SLIDING PAST THE BALL, OR CRASHING INTO YOUR
OPPONENT AND COMMITTING A FOUL.C
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3: CONTROLLED PLAYER IS IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL:

IF THE CONTROLLED PLAYER IS IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL,PRESSING FIRE WILL
INITIATE A PASS(OR SHOT).THE POWER OF THE PASS/SHOT IS DETERMINED BY HOW LONG
YOU HOLD DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON,AND DIRECTION AND HEIGHT ARE CONTROLLED BY MOVING
THE JOYSTICK IN THE TIME BETWEEN INITIATING THE PASS/SHOT AND STRIKING THE
BALL.REMEMBER THE POWER INDICATOR(BELOW THE MAIN WINDOW) SHOWS THE STRENGTH OF
THE PASS/SHOT.THE JOYSTICK MOVEMENTS AVAILABLE,IN SUMMARY ARE:

   
          LOW AND LEFT         MINIMUM HEIGHT         LOW AND RIGHT

 

                                [FIRE BUTTON]

          SWERVE RIGHT          FIRE AND POWER         SWERVE RIGHT




          HIGH AND LEFT         MAXIMUM HEIGHT         HIGH AND RIGHT

REMEMBER THAT THE JOYSTICK MOVEMENTS ARE RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT RUNNING PATH
OF THE PLAYER UNDER YOUR CONTROL.THAT IS TO SAY,IF THE PLAYER IS RUNNING ACROSS
THE FIELD FROM RIGH TO LEFT,PUTTING `LEFT` SWERVE ON THE BALL WILL BEND IT
TOWARDS YOUR OWN GOAL LINE,AND DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE LEFT HAND TOUCHLINE.
IF YOU ARE PLAYING ON `EASY` LEVEL,`EASY PASSING` MODE WILL BE ACTIVE AND YOUR
PASSES WILL SEEK OUT TEAM-MATES.REMEMBER THAT IN `EASY PASSING` MODE,YOU MUST
BE IN THE OPPONENTS PENALTY AREA BEFORE SHOOTING,AND UNLESS YOU ARE
SHOOTING,THE POWER BAR IS NOT ACTIVE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEAM:

YOU MAY ALSO PLAY INT SOC CHALL BY CONTROLLING THE WHOLE TEAM.THE COMPUTER WILL
ALWAYS CALCULATE WHICH OF YOUR PLAYERS IS NEAREST THE BALL,AND CONTROL WILL
ALWAYS SWITCH TO GIVE YOU CONTROL OF THE NEAREST PLAYER.THERE IS THEREFORE NO
YELLOW QUESTION MARK OVER ANY PLAYER,WITH A WHITE ARROW CONSTANTLY DENOTING THE
PLAYER CLOSEST THE BALL,WHO IS UNDER YOUR CONTROL.AS YOU PASS FROM ONE PLAYER
TO ANOTHER,CONTROL WILL AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFER FROM PASSER TO RECEIVER.
`CALLING` THE BALL,BY PRESSING THE SPACE BAR,HAS NO EFFECT,AND PRESSING FIRE
CAN ONLY INITIATE A SLIDING TACKLE OR PASS/SHOOT THE BALL. THE ABILITY TO SWAP
BETWEEN PLAYERS BY PRESSING THE FIRE,IS NOT AVAILABLE.
MOST ASPECTS OF PLAY ARE COMMON TO BOTH TYPES OF GAME,AND THE FOLLOWING
SECTIONS DETAIL EVENTS WHICH MAY OCCUR DURING EITHER TYPE OF GAME.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KICK-OFF:

ONCE THE TEAMS HAVE RUN ONTO THE PITCH AND TAKEN UP THEIR POSITIONS FOR
KICK-OFF(ONCE YOU HAVE PRESSED FIRE DURING THE STARTUP-SEQUENCE) THE REFEREE
SCREEN WILL BE DISPLAYED,AND THE REF WILL BLOW HIS WHISTLE.
YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS THE PLAYER TAKING KICK OFF,IF YOU ARE PRESS FIRE TO TAKE
CONTROL OF THE BALL.IF YOU ARE NOT,PRESSING FIRE WILL START THE ACTION,AND THE
PLAYER NEAREST TO THE BALL WILL KICK-OFF.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOAL-KICKS:

IF THE BALL TRAVELS OVER THE BYLINE AFTER BEING PLAYED BY THE ATTACKING
TEAM,THE DEFENDING TEAM TAKES A GOAL KICK.THE REFEREE SCREEN WILL APPEAR
INFORMING YOU THAT IT IS A GOAL KICK.
GOAL KICKS ARE AUTOMATICALLY TAKEN BY THE COMPUTER-CONTROLLED GOAL-KEEPERS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THROW-INS:

IF THE BALL TRAVELS OVER THE TOUCHLINE AFTER BEING PLAYED BY THE OPOSING
TEAM,YOU MUST TAKE A THROW IN.THE REFEREE SCREEN WILL APPEAR INFORMING YOU THAT
IT IS A THROW IN.YOU ALWAYS CONTROL THE PLAYER TAKING THE THROW IN.THE PLAYER
CAN MAKE HIS THROW IN ANY ONE OF THREE DIRECTIONS.
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS REFER TO THE RADAR MAP TO SEE THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF
TEAM-MATES AND OPPONENTS.ONCE YOU HAVE MOVED THE JOYSTICK IN THE DESIRED
DIRECTION.PRESS FIRE TO MAKE THE THROW.THE LONGER YOU HOLD DOWN THE FIRE
BUTTON,THE MORE POWER YOU WILL PUT INTO THE THROW.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
