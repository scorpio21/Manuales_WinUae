                     INSECTOR HECTI IN THE INTER CHANGE
                     ----------------------------------

               Typed by NEC and supplied by, erm....... NEC!

Insector Hecti, the HI-TEC hero, the worlds first computerised detective has
been sent to the INTERCHANGE, Victor Virus and his gang have invaded this 
highly sensitive area and its up to you to put matters to rights.

You take the part of Insector Hecti, you must free the whole of the fifty 
areas of the INTERCHANGE by re-aligning all the junction blocks and at the
same time rid the area of Victor and his vicious gang.

An audible noise shows when a block is in the correct position.

A number of different types of bug exist, each with its own pattern of 
movement.  Study these patterns carefully or they could be your undoing.

You have a small number of weapons at your disposal.

NOTE: Some weapons are teleported in from W of the Special weapons HQ.

There is a time limit for each area, and if you clear that area faster than
your predecessor, then you will be notified.

Should you run out of time or hit a bug, or worse still fall out of the area,
you will lose one of your five lives.  Lose all five lives and it is the end
of the game.

You can however restart the game to within four areas from the furthest area
you have reached using the access codes given every five levels.

This is the background to the mission.  Its all up to you now INSECTOR HECTI.
