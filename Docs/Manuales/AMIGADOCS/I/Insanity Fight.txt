                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~
You tightly clutch the controls as your mind constantly scans the control
panel. This is always the most gut wretching time for you - the time on
standby. "Relax", you tell yourself, because soon you won't have time to
think! Suddenly you are launched into space for the initial combat. You
must survive the combat in space and face the evil Death Ship - but can you
defeat its Insane power?
