                                Warlock

	          Walk Softly and Carry a Big Scepter
	Forget about that nap. Turn off the TV. Put away the potato chips.
The Karna, that precious jewel which grants its possessor infinite power,
has been stolen.
	To recapture it you'll face unfriendly ghosts, winged rodents,
fire-breathing zombies and chomping piranhas. Be prepared. The Underworld
is not place for a couch potato.
	Your quest will take you through twenty levels of clammy ruins,
infested cemeteries and dangling skeletons. Equipped with only your wits
and your scepter you'll defend yourself from as motley an assortment of
ghouls, goblins and gobbling gargoyles as ever stalked a computer screen.
Along the way you'll locate the eight magical objects that will guide and
assist you. And you'll need all the help you can get. Because there at the
earth's core you'll meet and do batthe with HE who has stolen the Karna.
His evil is unspeakable. His power unimaginable. his name, unpronounceable.
And he doesn't negotiate.

	This journey is not for the faint of heart. Or the faint of
stomach. You'll acutally hear scurrying spiders, slithering snakes and
skulking spirits. You'll see the full color graphic reporduction of havoc,
destruction, mayhem and devastation. Besides, the weather down there is
terrible. But you have no choice. You alone have been selected. The fate of
the world hangs on your joystick.

Have a nice day.

	You can play WARLOCK on an Amiga Color System with at least 512K,
one disk drive and a joystick.

            Errata To Warlock Amiga User's Instruction Card

Dear Amiga Owner,

Please note the following corrections to your user instruction card:

1.	If your Amiga has an external disk drive, you will need to power
	off your computer and disconnect the disk drive before starting
	Warlock.

2.	If you use the keyboard control rather than a joystick, the "Space
	Bar" will make the Warlock fire.

3.	The "P" or "Return" key will pause the game.

Thank you,

they reach you first, you will loose Vitality points. Some "Bad Guys" may
cause a "freezing" or "stunning" effect if you are caught with your guard
down. One more catution - be very careful when traveling between levels -
evil lurks around every corner. May the Lords of Light protect you on your
quest.
