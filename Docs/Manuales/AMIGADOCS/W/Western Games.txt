Armwrestling

 Control
 (also by keyboard)

 1. accumulate strength:
    This can be done by pulling the joystick back whenever the arm in the
    central display area has entered an especially "strong" phase.

 2. Prop up arm:
    press joystick button

 Tottle's remarks:
 Let's go. Beanpole Fred is going to be referee and will make sure that
 no-one props up his free arm. Unfortunately Fred nods off once in awhile,
 therefore stay alert! Oh yeah, just before you win it might be useful to
 rattle, as we say in the west.

Beershooting

 Control
 (also by keyboard)

 1. draw guns:
    player 1 moves joystick to the right
    player 2 moves joystick to the left

 2. aim guns:
    direct crosshairs by joystick

 3. shoot:
    press joystick button

 Tottle's remarks:
 Don't get nervous, or your little hands will be a-shakin'. Oh, before I
 forget, there is an old westerners' trick: Wait until your opponent has
 missed, then pull your trigger calmly. But don't wait too long, because
 we all want to see some fun this day. Remember that you have not won until
 you hit all 5 targets faster than your opponent. That means if you are
 faster than him four times but don't hit the fifth target, the game starts
 all over again.

Quid-Spitting

 Control
 (also by keyboard)

 1. lift arm and bite off quid - push joystick forward

 2. chew - pull joystick fast left and right

 3. stop chewing - joystick forward

 4. determine angle of spitting - pull joystick back
    determine strength of spitting - press joystick button

 5. spit - let go of joystick button

 Tottle's remarks:
 Well, I think you all chew quids of tobacco regularly, dont you? - What do
 I hear, you never tried it before? Well, then listen to some of good old
 Sam's tips: The greatest risk with quid-chewing is swallowing. It tastes
 awful, so don't swallow it! Remember not to bite off too big a piece from
 the quid and don't chew too long or too short. So, kids, chew until the
 quid is a good shape. You might try to hit your opponent. On his face would
 look best...

Milking

 Control
 (also by keyboard)

 1. Milk:
    Move joystick rhythmically corresponding to the following:
    down, right, up, diagonally down to the left, up, right, down,
    diagonally up to the left, then start it all over, again and again

 2. Knock the opponent:
    Move joystick to the right and press joystick button

 Tottle's remarks:
 Hey, hey, hey! It's no problem to elbow your opponent, of course, but make
 sure the referee doesn't notice it...

Dancing

 Control
 (also by keyboard)

 1. starting position - joystick in initial position

 2. lift and bend right leg - joystick diagonally to the lower left

 3. lift and stretch right leg - move joystick diagonally to the lower left
    and press joystick button

 4. lift and bend left leg - joystick diagonally to the lower right
 
 5. lift and stretch left leg - move joystick diagonally to the lower right
    and press joystickk button

 6. undo jacket (=lift skirt) - joystick forward

 7. raise hands to the right at shoulder level, turn hips to the left (=lift
    skirt and turn to the right) - joystick diagonally to upper left

 8. raise hands to the left at shoulder level, turn hips to the right (=lift
    skirt and turn to the left) - joystick diagonally to upper right

 9. bend forward - joystick back

10. bend forward - simply press joystick button

 Tottle's remarks:
 It's all very simple. Just follow the girl - but keep the beat! Remember
 that our guys are very spoiled, and if you miss the beat they will get more
 and more upset until they give Joe the piano player a bash on the nut. And
 then Joe will not continue playing unless the one who missed the beat buys
 him another beer.

Eating Competition

 Control
 (also by keyboard)

 1. Dip spoon in:
    joystick back

 2. Balance spoon:
    move joystick to the left and to the right

 3. Slurp

 4. Chew:
    move joystick left and right

 5. Swallow:
    pull joystick back and press joystick button

 6. Drink:
    joystick forward (only possible before you dip spoon in)

 Tottle's remarks:
 Boys, eat carefully! If you swallow all the stew without chewing you will
 find yourselves belching. That takes time and it's bad manners into the
 bargain. Oh yeah, and keep stopping for a drink in between times: it helps
 to swallow more easily. Now tuck in! Beans are excellent stuff!
