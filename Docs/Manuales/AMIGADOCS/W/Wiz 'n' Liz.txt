                                   THE STORY
                                   =========

   In another solar system...
                             WIZ & LIZ live on a planet far far away.  It's a
 planet with a strange and mystical name which holds a fabulous secret.  You
 see, the planet PUM (OK, perhaps its not such a strange and mystical name) is one
 of those rare places where magic is a reality.  Where people roam around casting
 spells and where even the fruit on the trees holds magical ingredients.
   WIZ & LIZ enjoyed their magic immensely and liked nothing more than mixing
 new potions in their cauldron and seeing what outrageous new concoction they
 had invented.
   In fact, thats a lie.
   They did in fact enjoy caring for and tending their pet wabbits slightly
 more than they enjoyed making potions.  And since they had many, many pets,
 this took up more of their time than making potions....

   One day WIZ & LIZ were messing about near their cauldron, busy throwing
 ingredients together and watching the potion hubble and bubble in the heat of
 the fire, when they remembered they'd left the kettle on the hob.  They raced
 back inside.

   Meanwhile, the potion bubbled away.  It billowed and plumed and kerplopped.
 It spluttered and glumped and falloped.  And then, all of a sudden, out of the
 cauldron came a swirling blue light.  (oh no, it's the pigs!)
 WIZ & LIZ'S wabbits stared at it as it broke up into millions of dancing pin
 pricks  of  light  and  swept down upon them, carrying them away into distant
 parts of the planet.
    WIZ & LIZ returned, they saw that the wabbits had gone and set off to look
 for them...


                                   CONTROLS
                                   ========

    WIZ & LIZ can be played as either a 1 player game or simultaneous 2 player
 game.  In a 1 player game, control is by a joystick in port 2.  In a 2 player
 game, control is by joysticks in both ports.

                           JOYSTICK UP  -  LOOK UP 

                          JOYSTICK DOWN  -  LOOK DOWN

                          JOYSTICK LEFT  -  MOVE LEFT

                        JOYSTICK RIGHT  -  LOOK RIGHT 

                            FIRE BUTTON  -  JUMP UP

                           DOWN & FIRE  -  DROP DOWN


                                   THE GAME
                                   ========

   WIZ & LIZ have to scour the world in search of their beloved wabbits which
 are scattered through the many different lands of PUM.  
   The problem is that they have only a small amount of time to do this before
 the spell that casts the wabbits across the land begins to destroy them.  
   As WIZ or LIZ, you must enter the many lands and save the wabbits.


                              ONE PLAYER OPTIONS
                              ==================

 with the same amount of lives and time.  BUT BEWARE, fruit and stars will not
 be saved !!!

   PLAY
   ­­­­
   Jump into the homeworld and start the game.  

                                   HOMEWORLD
                                   =========

                 The following relates to the one player game

  Homeworld is where WIZ & LIZ live and where they mix their spells.  When you
 start the game, you will find yourself here.  Also, when a magic ingredient
 (in the form of a fruit or vegetable) is collected, it will be found hanging in a
 tree in homeworld.
   To exit the homeworld, jump through the door marked "EXIT".  Note that on
 your first visit to homeworld on apprentice level, the door needs to be
 created.  To do this, simply collect one of the magical fruits and put it in
 the cauldron.  Repeat this using the second fruit, Wait for the spell to be
 mixed and the exit door will materialise near to WIZ & LIZ'S house.

   THE CAULDRON
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   When you have 2 ingredients, you can mix a spell.  To do this, you collect
 an  ingredient and put it in the cauldron.   Repeat  this  with  the next
 ingredient, wait a second  and the spell will be created.  The result of the
 spell could be anything  from a weird game bonus to a wonderful sub-game but
 it's  up to you to discover exactly how to play or use each bonus.  To place an
 ingredient  in  the  cauldron,  simply jump at the fruit to pick it up and then
 jump  towards  the  cauldron.  The ingredients for each spell always remain the
 same.

                       ROLLERCOASTER WORLD SELECT SCREEN
                       =================================

   After leaving the homeworld, you will enter the roller coaster world select
 screen. Here, you will see all the lands you must enter to save all the bunny
 wabbits.  Choose a world by jumping through the entrance door.  Once a land
 has been cleared of wabbits, the door will be nailed closed.

                         A DAY OUT IN THE LAND OF PUM
                         =============================

   The wabbits are hopping throughout each land.  So you must race around
 grabbing them all up.
   Each time you save a wabbit, it will be replaced by a floating widget (!).
 At first, the widget's will be letters.  The letters will correspond to the
 letters of a magic  word  at  the  top  of  the  screen.  On level 1 of the
 apprentice level, the word will be SNARF.  Jump up and collect all the letters 
 and you  will have completed the magic - the door from the level will now 
 appear. If it's not boarded up - you can exit. If it is, you're obviously on
 a later level and have to save more wabbits before you'll be allowed to exit -
 the number you have left to save will be shown below the completed magic word.

   WABBITS
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   As an apprentice, the wabbits do not explode.  On later levels they do.  If
 a wabbit is in danger of exploding, it will flash.  This means that you have
 only a few seconds to rescue him - if you don't rescue him and he explodes,
 then you will lose all the letters you have collected so far.  The direction in
 which the flashing wabbit lies is shown by a little sprite that appears
 hovering around either Wiz or Liz's head.  If the sprite is hovering to their
 left, then the wabbit is to their left.  If the sprite is below, then the
 wabbit is below...

   JUICY FRUIT
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Plus, each level contains a magical fruit.  At first, saving wabbits will
 release magic word widgets.  Once the magic word has been completed, saving
 wabbits will release fruit.  Collect enough fruit to fill up the magic bar at
 the bottom of the screen and the magic fruit will follow you back to homeworld
 with them ready for you to use in a spell. Simply mix 2 fruit in the cauldron
 and the spell will be mixed.  Remember the spell for future reference.
   All the widgets are described below :

   LETTER : Collect each magic letter to complete the spell.

   TIME : Gives 3 seconds extra time after each level.
 
   STAR : Stars can be traded for more ingredients or game hints on homeworld.
          However, you must first find the spell that opens a shop for you to
          spend them in.

   FRUIT : Used to create spells in the cauldron.  If you leave fruit stored
           on the homeworld, be careful not to leave them too long otherwise
           they'll spin quicker and quicker and then disappear.

  GLOWING SPHERE : Gives thirty seconds extra time but you'll have to be quick
                    to find it as it's only released when you have 10 seconds 
                    left to go.

  INVISIBLE LETTERS : Removes that letter from the name of the spell.

   Save all the wabbits from the lands (thats all!!!) 
   Oh, and defeat all the monsters you'll occasionally come across.
   
  MONSTERS
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   After each set of lands you'll have to defeat a hideously deformed monster.
 To defeat them, Wiz & Liz have a magical beam which will automatically fire
 towards the nearest vunerable spot on the monster. However, the beam only has
 a limited range of fire and it is your job to get Wiz or Liz as close to the
 monsters vunerable spot as possible.  If there are no such vunerable areas
 within range, then the beam will stop firing.  Once these areas have been
 destroyed, then the monsters on his way out!


                              TWO PLAYER OPTIONS
                              ==================

   In  this  mode, the screen is split horizontally with player 1 on the top
 screen.
   Select 2 PLAYER START from the menu option to view the double player options
 menu :

   SWAP : Chooses who plays WIZ or LIZ.

   LIVES : Select 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 lives per world.

   BEST OF : Play the best of 3, 5, 7 or 9 lands.

   SKILLS : 1 is easy, 9 is ultra difficult.

   SPEEDS : slow - walking, fast - running.

   PLAY :  Enter the lands won screen and then the game.  The object of the 2
 player game is to  beat  your  opponent  in collecting all your wabbits and
 exiting a level through your exit (WIZ & LIZ have their own wabbits to save
 and their own colour coded exits). If you do exit the level, Your opponent 
 has then just 10 seconds to exit before losing a life.
   If you lose all your lives, you lose a land - plus if you fail to get out
 within the 10 second limit, you also lose the land. Lose as many lands as you
 specified in best of (between 3 and 9) and lose the overall game.  Note that
 jumping through the homeworld door before your opponent means that you have a
 head start over them on the world select screen.
   NOTE :  WIZ ALWAYS RESCUES THE BROWN WABBITS AND LIZ, THE GREY ONES.

   
                              KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
                              ==================

   P = pause.

   Esc = reset the game.

   Spc = use to exit some subgames.

   And there you have it, Complete all the levels on all the skill levels and
 WIZ & LIZ will have rescued all their bunny wabbits and live happily ever
 after....or WILL they...?????
