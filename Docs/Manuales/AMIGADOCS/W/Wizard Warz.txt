                         WIZARD WARZ

Apprentice, I have taught you as well as I know how and can offer no
more advice.  Alone you must proceed into the World without my guidance
or protection.  Before you embark on your quest you have one final
ritual to perform--the choosing of spells from the range that I have
built-up over the centuries.  Choose with great care, since each one has
special powers to combat your foes.

Now that we are forever parted, I can finally reveal the history of
this once glorious land.  Before the arrival of the evil Wizards and
terrible monsters, we had a thriving port, sending our produce to every
corner of the known world.  Great wealth was bestowed on the land and we
used it wisely.  No one was poor.  No one suffered in the way that the
whole population does now.  With wealth, we offered great hospitality to
all who visited our lands--and that was our downfall.  Invaders
masquerading as friendly travellers alighted one day.  A good looking
race, we bestowed gifts generously, giving them free access to all our
lands. A great feast was organised to celebrate their arrival with a
spectacular banquet, and we prepared every dish known to the chefs.

The banquet started as a splendid success.  As the wine flowed freely,
merriment ensued.  Unknown to us the massacre was about to begin.  The
leaders had stolen away to  mass a band of warriors.  At the strike of
midnight they descended upon us, each man armed with vicious weapons,
the like of which we had never experienced.  With bloody swords they
slashed through our men, women and children.  Amid the carnage I managed
to slip away and escape.

The next day our guests ransacked the port destroying all that stood in
their way. News of the treachery spread to our allies who immediately
rose up in arms.  An armada of ships arrived several weeks later to
vanquish the treacherous enemy.  Led by the princes of our allies, a
splendid army landed and a great battle ensued.  As the forces of evil
retreated form the valiant onslaught, news of glorious victories
abounded.

The invaders, knowing that the tide was turning, called upon the dark
forces to rally and help them in their evil quest.  The seven evil
empires sent their greatest wizards with an array of terrible monsters.
Overpowered by the awesome night, our allies were beaten back despite
valiant battling.  The land fell into darkness and misery as starvation
and dIsease followed.

For many decades our people have existed in terror, memories of the
treachery shown by their guests still fresh in their minds and the
desire for freedom utmost.  It was not my destiny to free these people--
but it is yours.  You must travel the land with your spell book as a
badge of your vocation.  You will find, as I did that on a visit to the
cities I was rewarded with a gift of food, but be cautious, your
generosity is soon forgotten and to regain their favour it will be
necessary to return with valuable artifacts collected from around the
world by our ancestors and seized by the oppressors.  The artifacts
however are closely guarded by monsters.  There is only one way to
obtain this treasure--out-manoeuvre the monsters and ultimately kill
them.  Only then will you be able to collect the treasure and return it
to the cities.

The capital city, the most repressed of the once glorious cities, will
not receive you since they are fearful that their last chance of
salvation will be lost forever.  As your mission progresses, as is your
destiny, return the artifacts to each city and this will convince them
that your work is done and they will at last allow you to take your ship
to the mainland.

It was on the mainland that I spent many years studying, fighting
monsters, collecting new enchantments and building my strength.  I
fought several battles and accumulated many items, some of which didn't
seem to have a use.  Once I gained a third talisman it all became clear.
The seven masters of the arcane arts watch all practitioners of magic
and deal harshly with any who gain sufficient power to present a threat
to their evil empire.  Their vigilance had seen my rise in power and as
I gained the third talisman they met in dreadful congress and now deem
me a threat to all that they have created.  As I write, the envoys wait
to take me off to be judged by the Wizards.  I know that after many
years of strife, I don't have the strength to defeat the awesome foe.  I
Pray, that when your time comes you will have developed the skills and
strength to combat the seven wizards.

I can tell you little of the Wizards.  Each is a master of a branch of
magic and possesses the secret of drawing Manna from the air.  None is
tied to his own power reserves, and each has a band of minions dedicated
to his defence.

I hear the sound of footsteps approaching and fear that I must leave you
to your destiny.  Pursue your art, but beware.  If you grow strong and
rise among the ranks of your trade, you will be seen and, once noticed,
will have little option but to struggle on in the ongoing...Wizard Warz.

OBJECTIVE
the Player starts as a 'junior' wizard with relatively little power and
few spells to start the game with.  His ultimate aim is to  become the
chief wizard by beating the seven greatest magicians in the world.

When a monster is close its picture is displayed on the right hand side
of the screen.  The player picture on the left hand side is always
visible.  There are three different player illustrations showing at
which level play has reached.  When the player comes into contact with a
monster in levels one and three, or selects a monster in level two, a
combat arena is displayed in place of the map.  The combat arena shows
the player and enemy sprites and has obstacles in the form of holes in
the patterned playing area.

Combat shows the two forms.  The player and monsters cast and throw
spells (monsters are also able to cause damage by touching the player
character).

Spells can alter the vision of the target making movement and combat
more difficult, cause damage to the target, prevent damage from some
enemy attack, delete or steal enemy spells, alter the movement ability
of the target.

The player or monster has a limited maximum number of spells.  As he
progresses, the player will fill up his spellbook and will have to make
certain decisions as to which spells are most useful.  This will depend
on how skillfully the game is played.  Both the player and his enemies
have energy in three areas being used up by movement and spells:

PHY--PHYSICAL
SPI--SPIRITUAL
MEN--MENTAL

Energy may be regained during the game in a number of ways, such as
eating food, winning combats and by transferring from category to
category.

LEVEL 1
The player moves around a large scrolling map on which are found seven
cities and six monsters.  Each monster is a treasure guardian and each
treasure belongs to a city.  When the player visits a city for the first
time he will receive one food.  If the player returns a treasure to the
city to which it belongs he will get two food.  When all six treasures
have been returned to the relevant cities the player can go to the
second level by visiting the seventh city.

LEVEL 2
A series of combats which are intended to decide if the player is
suitable to challenge the seven wizards.  This level will allow the
player to gain more spells which will be needed in the final battles.
There are approximately 30 different monsters on this level that have
widely differing strengths and vulnerabilities.  Three of the monsters
each have in their possession a magic item that any wizard must possess
and only when these have been gained can the player proceed to the third
and final level.  The player can choose to combat the monsters in any
order and as he gets to know the game, the player may decide not to
fight certain monsters at all, if his strategy or style of play does
not use the spell that a monster will give him as a reward for victory.

LEVEL 3
This level will take the player in turn to the strongholds of the seven
wizards.  The player will explore the wizards' den and encounter the
creature that the wizard in question keeps as guards. These monsters are
new and unfamiliar to him. Eventually when the guardians have been
defeated the player will meet and fight the wizard.  The wizards are
arranged in order of toughness.

for LEVEL 2.
PHY points are deducted at a rate determined by the type of terrain
currently occupied by the player.

VISITING TOWNS
Visiting the (unidentified) port has no effect unless all six items have
been returned.  Visiting a town, other than the port, for the first time
without the relevant item, the player gets one food.  If the player
visits with the relevant item, it is exchanged for two food.
There are six monsters to be found on the map, each possessing one of
the six items.

COMBAT
Unless a player has caSt 'FLY' he will fall through gaps in the combat
map, suffering PHY damage and leaving the combat.
The player will receive no contact damage, but all opponents will reduce
his PHY and/or SPI to some extent on contact.
the player will die if any of his attributes fall to zero.
Press FIRE to start a new game.  (Level 1 only)
Monsters are killed if any of their three attributes fall to zero.
Note that most monsters begin combat with one or more of their
attributes already at zero.  This means that they are immune to damage
in these categories and do not count them in the above condition.

spell book to a blank page or unwanted spell.  Then either press X to
accept--the spell will then be copied to the current page of the spell
book (any spell already on that page is lost) or press V to reject it,
getting an appropriate attribute bonus as compensation.
N.B.  A spell cannot be accepted if the spell book in on the familiar
page.

2.  A FAMILIAR--displayed on the right hand spell book.  Either press X
to accept it (any current familiar is lost) or press V to reject it,
