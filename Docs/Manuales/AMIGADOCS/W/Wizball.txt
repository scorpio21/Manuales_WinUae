                              WIZBALL
                              -------

   For many years, Wiz and his fantastic Cat lived happily in brightly
   coloured Wizworld. All was not well however as a malevolent force
   had discovered the vista and indended to stamp out brilliance once and
   and for all.
   The evil Zark and his horrible sprites have moved in to eliminate the
   spectrum and render all landscapes drab and grey.
   So jump in your transporter and with the help of your faithful servant
   Catelite restore Wizworld to its former glory.
   Collect icons for special effects as you manoeuvre to shake off the
   alien forces. Stunning graphics create the mood for a thrilling and
   compulsive game with hordes of hidden features and extra controls.

                              GAME PLAY
                              ---------

   The landscapes in Wizworld are comprised of three colours each. Your
   objective is to restore these original colours by shooting the RED,
   GREEN and BLUE colour bubbles and then use Cat to collect the droplets
   of chemicals as they fall to the ground. Droplets collected will be
   stored in the cauldrons displayed at the bottom of the screen, until
   such time as you have enough of each colour to make the target colour
   displayed in the cauldron to the far right.
   In the three levels which have aliens on; one has red, on has green and
   one has blue. It is therefore necessary to move between the three
   levels using the tunnels to collect all three colours.
   To complete a level you must colour in all three shades of grey, darkest
   first. After each type of colour is completed there is a bonus stage.

                              ICONS

   When certain aliens are killed they will deposit a green pearl which
   will remain stationary on the screen. If Wizball passes over this pearl
   and picks it up the first icon on the top of the screen will glow, this
   indicates Wiz has the option to select the feature represented on the
   icon. If you want to select to another feature collect more pearls until
   the icon you want is glowing.

   it left or right.

   guardian angel. You may select one weapon or control which will be
   magically endowed upon all subsequent Wizballs from bird or opt for the
   bonus of 1000 points * Wiz-Level number.
