                                  GAMEPLAY
              --------
"The most disturbing aspect of this conflict is that we do not know out
enemy. We do not know their reasons for attacking us. We do not know who
they are."

It is the middle of the 21st Century and Earth had been violently attacked
by an insect-like nation from a near star system, killing billions of
Humans, swiftly wiping out countrues and collapsing world states, throwing
the Planet into the merciless hands of a nuclear winter.

"We intend to turn the tables. We intend to protect ourselves by fighting
back. At last we have a weapon: THE FOE-57 SPACECRAFT..."

As the remaining Humans turn to each other for combined strength and
support, the Fist of the Earth world government turn to you to lead the
ultimate battle.

"The safety of the peoples of Earth rests in your hands..."

THE MOUSE

Mouse operates in two modes.

As a conventional mouse pointer, or as the spacecraft yoke.

1. As a mouse, there is a circular crosshair resembling a gunsight serving
as the on-screen mouse pointer. Moving the mouse moves the pointer -
pressing the left button selects whatever is being pointed at. The mouse
Pointer is centred on the screen before mouse operations.

2. As a yoke, the movements of the mouse control the ROLLing and PITCHing
of the vessel.

As a yoke the LEFT mouse button operates the ship's main engines, giving
6.3 Gs of forward thrust. The RIGHT button operates a 1G retrothruster.

                                KEY CONTROLS
                                ------------
The keys are bunched into sections....Numeric key (NOT on the keypad)
select autopilots.

Alphabetic keys select screens and modifiers....Function keys launch
weapons.

F - Forward View (through viewscreen, looking forward). For most of the
    game this screen is the default. It shows the forward view of the 
    FOE-57 pilot looking forward from the front of his craft.

This display may be modified as follows:

H - Headup display (toggle on or off)

The headup display is superimposed on the outside view. A crosshair appears
at the centre of the display and flecks which represent fixed spatial
points in the outside world permitting the pilot to visually understand his
velocity.

W - Weapons headup (toggle on or off)

The weapons display is another layer of headup. A graphical representation
of the ship, showing the position and the number of remaining weapons
appears.

The crosshair is modified to also show weapons and MDC Ammo.

Identification tags appear on any vessel visible.

Z - Zoom in

X - Zoom out

These keys alter the magnification of the forward-view image.

T - Tacticle screen

The ship's computer knows the position and orientation of every vessel in
the surrounding space. Therefore it is possible for it to generate a
real-time image of space from any vantage point. Including (not
surprisingly) the vantage point of the front of out own ship. Pressing 't'
initially does just that. It brings up the computer generated view of space
from the front of your FOE-57. Planets are not shown. Like screen 'F', the
weapon display can be toggled on or off and the zoom keys still work. The
headup flecks cannot be removed.

Unlike screen 'F' this image is generated by the ship's computer and can
therfore be presented looking from any arbitary vantage point.

ENTER (on the numeric keypad) will alter that vantage point. What it will
do is give the image from the nose of any other object or vessel. Repeated
pressing of 'ENTER' will cycle through all objects in the vicinity. You can
see what the space station sees - see what an attacking alien sees or even
look out from an asteroid or the nose of a missile. If the object you are
viewing from 'dies' in the course of viewing from it - then the screen will
flash and the next object will be selected. The technical term for the
object-you-are-viewing-from is the Eye-Particle.

The computer has another way of depicting space around the vessel. Pressing
't' again from within the tacticle screen will bring up the Tank screen. At
the centre of the screen is the token representing the Eye-Particle. Space
around the vessel is shown as a sphere of points - other vessels are shown
as tokens. As the Eye-Particle rotates the ship at the centre appears to
stay still but the sphere around it rotates. 'Enter' still works, allowing
any ship to become the Eye-Particle.

A zoomed-in view of the Eye-Particle ship is shown in the centre of the
circle at the bottom left of the screen.

The Z and X keys work in this screen but in a slightly different manner.
Bringning the sphere closer and further away. The tank-screen enables the
pilot to have an overview of three-dimensional space.

The tacticle screens and the forward screen both feature annunicators.
These flashing mnemonics are superimposed on the display to inform the
pilot of some matter.

Annunicators:

PwS   - meaning Proceed with Sortie

NOr   - meaning New Orders recieved

IcM   - meaning Incoming Missile II

FMO    - meaning Fresh Message Outstanding

NOr and FMO both prompt the pilot to consult the message screen. In fact,
close examination of some annunicators will reveal a small letter M. This
is to suggest to the pilot that he consults the message-display screen.

Pressing the M key... M - Brings up the message screen.

Message screen (read orders and incoming messages).

the message screen is shock-mounted electoluminescent display mounted
beneath the main viewing screen. Its purpose is to display incoming
messages - both from Solbase and from other vessels.

D - Data on other vessels

The D screen brings up a menu of names of all known vessels. As we learn
about our alien adversaries this list grows to include them. Pointing and
clicking on any of these will bring up a technical description sheet of
that vessel.

N - Navigational starchart

This navigational screen shows a three-dimensional representation of all
the known star systems around the Earth's Sun. A flashing blue highlight
indicates our present position. The mouse pointer can be used to select any
of the control buttons to manipulate the screen.

Clicking on any star will select it.

Selecting a star - will track this screen onto that star - such that it now
appears at the centre of the screen. Selecting a star has the effect of
locking it into the navigational computer - hence making it the destination
of any future quad-jump.

There is another way to select a desired star: by name. Pressing the
space-bar brings up a small dialogue box. Typing the name - or the first
part of the name - followed by return will select the named star, exactly
as if it were clicked upon.

Text at the bottom of this screen shows present location and selected
destination.

S - Solar system chart

This is the other complementary half of the Navig screen, permitting fine
destination control.

Pressing 'S' will display the solar system of the Navig screen Selected
Star. If no such star has been selected - then the solar system shown will
be the current one.

This screen displays the planets and their orbits. Satellites (moons) and
their orbits are also shown. because of the huge difference in scales, this
screen dynamically alters scale.

Selecting any body makes it the destination for the quad-jump.

                            NAVIGATIONAL CONTROLS
                            ---------------------
The Fist-Of-Earth interstellar attacking craft is piloted, employing a
fly-by-wire system. All the pilot has to fly is the computer - the computer
flies the ship. The ship may operate a selection of automatic pilot
options. Some offer full manual control whilst others are fully automatic -
permitting the pilot to attend other tasks. Experienced pilots employing
manual modes will be able to out-perform the computer on basic manoeuvres.

The mouse-yoke controls the rotational movement of the vessel. Left-right
movement proportionally determines the roll. Up-down controls pitching.
There is no direct yaw control.

The Mouse buttons activate primary and retro-thruster, this way the vessel
either accelerated exactly along the forward axis or accelerates along the
reverse axis. Pilots of terrestrial craft are often disorientated when
first flying a spacecraft. There is no necessity for a spacecraft to point
in the direction of motion. Often in combat it is advantageous to be
travelling in one direction and pointing in the weapons in another.

The piloting computer has ten operation modes which the pilot may select,
depending upon the circumstances.

Numerical keys (not those on the keypad) select different piloting modes
(autopilots):

               Orientation/Thrust

1. Manual operation - mouse   
   piloting            MANUAL/MANUAL

2. Point ship at the primary target   COMPUTER/MANUAL

3. Pursue primary target      COMPUTER/COMPUTER

4. Fine positioning (creep mode)   MANUAL/MANUAL

5. Auto creep and halt         COMPUTER/COMPUTER

6. Auto fly and halt         COMPUTER/COMPUTER

7. Point in direction of motion      COMPUTER/MANUAL

8. Point opposite to direction of
   motion            COMPUTER/MANUAL

9. Stop (then drop into pilot mode 4)   COMPUTER/MANUAL

0. Re-centre yoke.

Mode 4 is most important when trying to establish an exact position. It
simulates an inertialess movement system where the ship only moves when
under thrust and stops instantly. Only low velocity movement is possible in
this mode. This mode cannot be entered unless the ship is stationary.

L - When in Solbase launch bay. This key initiates the launch sequence.

Q - Quad jump

This key initiates the quadspace jump to the selected location. This will
not operate in the launch bay. If Quad Space motors are not attached, this
key will not effect a quad jump.

ESCAPE - Launch the pilot recovery vehicle. If the explosive bolts have
been primed, this key will fire the cockpit and primary life support pod
out of the nose of the ship and hopefully to safety. The micro-quad leaper
pack will automatically return the pod back to Solbase. The intelligence
division have insisted that an aboandoned ship be destroyed to prevent it
from getting into enemy hands - so this procedure will also initiate the
self-destruct sequence in the fusion system.

                               WEAPON SYSTEMS
                               --------------
There is provision for five classes of weapon aboard the vessel. Each class
is tied to a seperate launch circuit. Each launched weapon may have an
independant target.

WEAPON SYSTEM OVERLAY

The W key - in tacticle or forward screens brings up the display from the
wepon system computer. This display shows number of wepons remaining as
well as their position on the hull pylons. This display also shows possible
targets known to the system.

Target tokens appear as green boxes and are placed over possible targets.
Symbols - within the boxes aid identification of the target type:

If a vessel is overlaid with a gunsight symbol, then that is the current
primary selected target. The primary target. To select a new primary
target, point the ship at a new vessel and press the space bar.

When a weapon is launched - the current primary target is what that weapon
will be attempting to destroy.

Skilled pilots will be able to rapidly launch three missiles at three
different vessels by targetting, firing and rapidly re-targetting and
refiring. Once a weapon is launched it cannot be recalled or re-targetted.

FUNCTION KEYS LAUNCH WEAPONS

F1   Pseudo-Stellar missile

F2   Stinger missile

F3   Reconnaissance missile

F4   Mine

F5   Target drone

Missiles are launched at any selected target. Missiles are piloted like
mini-spacecraft. They take time to orient themselves and fly a path to
their targets. When launched they are accelerated forwards by
mini-thrusters. It may take some seconds for the missiles to orient itself
towards their chosen path before their main thrusters are ignited. It is
therefore useful but not essential to launch a missile in the direction it
wants to go. Missiles can be even launched at other missiles.

Each vessel class is unique. Some vessels are heavily armoured and can only
be destroyed with the appropriate weapon.

Pseudo-Stellar Missiles are the most powerful and the most dangerous. Not
only will they destroy the Target Vessel but it will also destroy any other
vessel within the kill-radius including the vessel which fired it. If you
fire-off one of these - get well away.

Stinger missiles are general purpose missiles and are identical in most
respects to the Ship-to-Ship missiles used by the alien forces.

The probe or reconnaissance missile simply gathers data on its target. On
impact, it deep-scans the target and relays the data back to the ship. Once
scanned in this way the examined vehicle will appear in the data-screen.

RETURN fire MDC

The MDC or Mass-Driver Cannon provides limited anti-missile fire, as such
it is classified as an entirely defensive weapon. It fires iron slugs at
high-kinetic energies wich vaporize any small targets. Beam and particle
weapons have proved ineffective for this task. Effective use of this weapon
demands that the pilot attempts evasive manoeuvres before trying to shoot
down a missile.

GAME OPERATION

The game starts with the pilot inside the FOE-57 which is docked in one of
the four launch bays of Solbase.

Solbase is rotating to proved artificial gravity. Text on the headup
display prompts the player to read the message screen. This can be viewed
by pressing the 'M' key. After the orders have been recieved - the player
can launch the craft. It is launched by dropping out of the bottom of the
launchbay. If weaponry is loaded onboard - then the ordiance screen
appears, showing the weapons as they are loaded. Once in space - the yoke
controls motion. Pilot mode 1 is selected by default. The player can tumble
the craft around and view the large Solbase structure rotating. A series of
four blue-flashing Navig Markers indicate the Solbase decking axis.

Solbase is in a polar orbit around the Sun, some 90 million miles out. Turn
on the headup-display to see movement queues. Turn weapon systems on and
off. Accelerate the craft up to blue speed (the headup queues turn bluw to
indicate a higher speed). Use autopilot 9 to stop the craft. Practice
stopping and turning. This is not an aaircraft! Turning without
acceleration does not result in a change in velocity! The 'S' key brings up
the solar system chart. The mouse now operates a cursor. Clicking on the
buttons results in rotation or zooming. Clicking on a planet causes the
planet to be selected as a quad space destination. The name of selected
planets appears on the screen. The screen tracks so as to place the
selected planet in the centre of the display. The 'N' key brings up the
Star navigation screen. This permits the selection of other star systems as
destinations. The present selected destination is shown flashing. The 'M'
key brings up the message screen. This is the pilot's way of recieving text
information from the outside world. Ignoring the messages will result in
game penalties being incurred.

                                   DOCKING
                                   -------
Docking with Solbase is not difficult but demands patience and attention to
deatil. So pay attention. Dynamic magnetic buffers prevent slight
inaccuracies from damaging the ship or Solbase. It is important that the
ship is on the precise axis and moving precisely along it. The orientation
of the ship is unimportant. There is an easy way to dock. There are four
flashing Navig Markers which indicate the exact docking axis of Solbase.
The outermost of these is important. For some people it helps if they
select it as primary target. That way it is always marked with a cross and
is harder to lose.

                 MISSION ONE 'WALK THROUGH'/GUIDE TO DOCKING

save it. Destroy all ships which come.

MISSION 28
Investigate activity in Tau Ceti System. Start from Mote and work your 
way to Foot. Before you quad to Mote, make sure that you are 
stationary, otherwise you will go up in smoke. When the mines are 
destroyed, continue and quadspace every so often towards FOOT. When 
you get there you will be told to return.

MISSION 29
Investigate single vessel in the Barnards/Ptolemy.

MISSION 30
Follow the other FOE-57's to Kruger-60 space. Be ready for a suprize 
attack from a H-Wing. Use all weapons on it, even the MDC and it will 
blow up. Follow flight leaders instructions.

MISSION 31
Destroy all vessels in tau Ceti/Gift system. Egg carriers must all be 
destroyed.

filter out interferance from the Nebula. You will also come accross a 
Syrian cloaking device. Destroy as much as possible.

MISSION 33
Test the new X-Ray laser Mines in Venus space.

MISSION 34
Destroy some of the massing ships in Saturn/Titan space. Use all weapons.

MISSION 35
Sirian fleet has penetrated through to Solbase and is outside the 
base. Get the H-Wings first. Otherwise they will destroy the station. 
Once the ships have been destroyed, dock.

MISSION 36
Test Pseudostallar warhead missiles in Venus space. Be careful, they 
are dangerous.

MISSION 37
Destroy the reminants of the Sirian fleet with the weapons you have. 
They can be found in earthspace.

MISSION 38
Follow super freighter from Pluto to Sirius Five and destroy the clone 
ship. Sit back and enjoy the final sequence.
 
GENERAL NOTES
To evade enemy missiles, fly backwards in front of the enemy and make 
sure you stay at least 3000m in front of him. That way his missiles 
run out of fuel before they can get anywhere near you.
On mission 27 make sure that before you go to Mote you are not moving. 
If you are you will hit a mine and be destroyed. Do not fire any 
weapons unnecessarily or you will not go to the next mission. Solbase 
will not call you back, so when you quad space and dock you will be 
told to do it again because you made unautherised jumps.
When firing Proximity mines the first two come out from the bottom and 
the second two from the top of the ship. When you fire at something, 
raise the nose slightly and fire the first two. Then lower the nose 
slightly, and fire the second two. Laser mines do not need the 
procedure.
If you make any unnecessary quad jumps then you have to do the mission 
again.
To finish the Bezerker, you must hit him with everything each time you 
see him. Fly backwards in front of him and fire weapons. Follow 
mission tips he will eventually be squashed by the Black hole.

End.
