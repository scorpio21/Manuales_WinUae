  ADVICE
  ------

  Dont be afraid of the important number of characters; just concentrate 
  on the "bad guyz" who shoot at you and be aware of your munitions.
  They are counted! Avoid hurting the nice fellows such as the little 
  girl, the baby etc... The act of capturing outlaws gives you life points 
  (the candle) and by getting the little thief you'll earn bonus points : 
  dont miss him !!

  Look carefully at the windows and roofs.  Inside the mine, be careful: 
  the ceiling is fragile and if you shoot at the TNT boxes, they might 
  explode at your face.  After having captured many desperados, the 
  portrait of the outlaw you are looking for flashes on the right hand 
  corner of your screen.  Be careful! this means he is arriving.
