                WHAT IS IT? WHERE IS IT? - (COUNTIES)

BEFORE YOU START
================

Before  using  any of the programs, please make backup copies of your disks
and  lock  away  your master disks.  That way, if you ever damage your disk
you can always make a fresh working copy.

Computer Viruses
----------------

Sharing  disks with friends has become the major cause for the rapid spread
of  computer  viruses.   Some of these are fairly harmless but nevertheless
annoying.   Others  are  very  nasty  and  will  show varying symptoms from
diskettes   not   loading  unless  not  write  protected,  diskettes  being
destroyed,  programs  not  loading  or  crashing.  Once you have a virus in
amongst  your  disks  they  are  difficult  to  get rid of, not to say time
consuming.   imagine  spending  hours creating a story only to lose it all.
Imagine collecting a years worth of data for a project and losing all that.
Don't  risk  it.   Be extremely careful who you take disks from.  And don't
give  disks  away.  If you already have a virus in amongst your disks, your
friends will not thank you for corrupting their disks

NOTE:
----

If  you  have  a 512K Amiga with an additional external disk drive, you may
have  to  disconnect  that  drive  before you can load some of the enclosed
programs.

TERMINOLOGY
-----------

In  this document, to click on something means to move the mouse pointer to
and item and then press the left mouse button.  To double click is to press
the left mouse button twice rapidly.

Some  of  the  programs take quite some time to load, please be patient and
NEVER take a disk out if the green disk light is on


REMEMBER,  some  of  the  programs  take  up to a minute to load and whilst
loading,  the  screen  may not show any activity for a while.  If the green
"drive" light is still on, your program is still loading.

Getting going
-------------

Simply turn your Amiga on, put in the disk and wait for it to load.

The  instructions for What is it?  Where is it?  (Counties) are included on
the screen with each activity you choose

You  will  note  that the two largest Scottish counties seem to be split in
two  horizontally.   This  is  deliberate  - it has been done to ensure the
accuracy of positioning with the larger shapes.

Clicking  on the Exit box will, as it says, take you back to the Workbench.
If  you  want  to  restart the program from here simply double click on the
disk icon and then on the "WhatWhere" Program icon.

Note:   The  main  map and the county shapes are held as IFF files, ie they
can be used in Deluxe Paint to make your own drawings.  They are in the "G"
directory on the disk.  Don`t forget to make copies of the files before you
alter them.  Don't work on the ones on your disk.
