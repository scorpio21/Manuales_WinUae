INTRODUCTION
It's just not easy to get very far in the rounds of the Intergalactic
Hoverboard Challange. You may laugh, but few Sapiens have reached the Hall
of Fame.  Training on water-based surfaces is no substitute for the real
thrill of hoverboarding.  While wind-surfacing, skiing, skating and scree-
riding are good for balance training, they are no preperation for the
phenominal speeds attainable on hover-boards.  Sapiens are not considered
good contenders or to have the right temprament to take on the best high
hoverboard stages.
Of course, there are three exceptions - one in particular, a chap called
Olbane Woldmunsey-Brickett III, caused a sensation many tournaments back by
acturly spelling his name in the wake left behind his board.  A real crowd
pleaser.
Don't be put off, but when you're up against things like Cyborgs,
Archeoptra, Amboids, Thermoids, Photanians, Mechanoids, you've got to be
good, damn good.  Or even better.

THE GAME
Welcome to the Intergalactic Hoverboard Challange.  You've locked in an
area against a hostile opponent.  As you move around the area, you make a
crystallised wake behind you.  So does your opponent.  To win you must
force your opponent to make a mistake.  Likewise, your opponent will be
looking to sink you.  Contact with any wall is a big mistake.  First one to
wipe out loses.

AFTER THE MATCH
After the match you will be shown the paths you both took.
