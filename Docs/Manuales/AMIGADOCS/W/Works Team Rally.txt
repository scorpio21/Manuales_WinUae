Racing in Works team rally takes place over the internationally renowned
circuits of HOLLAND, Germany, Italy, SPAIN and Britain. Before each race
proper, each human controlled cars drive a solo lap. This lap, against the
clock will determine the order on the starting grid. The faster the lap the
better the positioning on the grid.

At the side of the screen (left player one, right player two) is a panel
showing important information about the status of the rally car.

1.Time   : elapsed time in seconds

2.Lap    : current race lap

3.Pos    : current race position

4.Revs   : revs per minute.AT maximum revs the gears auto change

5:Gear   : current gear position

6.Damage : indication of bodywork damage


After a race (or in a one player mode if too much damage is sustained) the
results and league tables are displayed.

The points are allocated as follows

      First place  - six points
   
      Second place - three points
  
      Third place  - one point


There is also price money for the car that wins and/or drives the fastest lap.

Between each race there is a screen displaying any repairs needed to the car.
There are six onscreen information boxes, four for each tyre, one for the
gears and one for general bodywork damage. Using the joystick to control a 
cursor, repair those elements of the car that are most damaged by clicking
on the damage estimate text in each box. However each repair costs money, and
you only start of with £1000.

PITS

If fuel is running low, or damage is too high, it is advisable to enter the 
pits. Driving over your team colours refuels and repairs certain amounts
of damage.

CONTROLS

See diagram below for joystick controls.

NOTE: the keyboard option uses the cursor keys to replace joystick directional
controls and the right shift key as fire / select.
