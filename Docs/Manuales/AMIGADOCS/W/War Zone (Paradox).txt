			     Warzone

Welcome to Warzone, a smooth scrolling, all action arcade type game that
uses the full color graphic capabilities of your machine to the fullest. 
The downward scrolling takes your tank through many different cities and
landscapes.

How far can you progress through without being blown apart?  Will you be
able to reach your final objective?

To survive for long you will need nerves of steel and have all your wits
about you.

Best wishes and good luck from The Paradox Software Team.

Program and Music - Janko Mrsic-Flogel

SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS

To run the program you will need one AMIGA machine with disk drive and one
joystick and color monitor.  The joystick should be in the joystick port
(No. 2).

The disk is autobootable.  To load the game insert the master disk in drive
1 and reset the machine.  

This game is midi-compatible.  For super sound just connect a
midi-compatible synthesizer to the midi-out port of the computer.

BRIEFING INSTRUCTIONS

The year is 2090.  The world has just been devastated by a nuclear
holocaust.  Mankind is piecing together what is left of civilization, but
already a power-crazed Warmonger is trying to start it all over again...

Your mission is to search, find, and destroy this person, then deactivate
the bomb he is assembling.  On your mission you will be attacked by his
henchmen - he has destruction and death on his side, you have the good of
all mankind on yours.

The people of earth are with you... fail and ... who knows?
