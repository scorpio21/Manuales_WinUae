    patterns.  These  persons  may experience seizures while watching a TV
    picture or playing video  games.  Even  players  who  have  never  had
    seizures  may  nonetheless  have  an  undetected  epileptic condition.
    Consult your  doctor  before  playing  video  games  if  you  have  an
    epileptic  condition,  or immediately should you experience any of the
    symptoms described  below  during  play:  dizziness,  altered  vision,

    Game Options

    General Settings

    Throughout the  option  and  information  screens,  you  can  use  the
    joystick  or  mouse  to  move  the cursor, and the fire button or left
    mouse key to select.

    The main features of the options screen are detailed below.

    Game Mode

    There are three types of game mode for you to choose from.

    Tournament - 64 players take part in a tournament, up to four of  them
    can be human players.

    Practice - Consists of 1-4 human players only.

    Skins  -  2  human  players only. In a skins game, you play for money,
    rather than trying to improve your score. The player who holes out  in
    the  least  number  of  strokes  wins the purse for that hole. If both
    players hole out in the same number of strokes, the purse  is  carried
    forward to the next hole.

    Number Of Players

    Click to select the number of human players to take part in  the  next
    game.

    Course name

    This option selects the course wheer the next  game  will  be  played.
    Five courses are available at any one time.

    Computer skill level

    Shown  as  "pathetic",  "novice",  "average",  "good"  or  "pro". This
    setting is effective for tournament games only and has  no  effect  on
    human players.

    Number of rounds

    Select 1,2 or 4 rounds to be played for the next game. A  round  is  a
    complete  18  hole  circuit  of the course, so 4 rounds would mean you
    playa total of 72 holes. Defaults to one round in skins mode.

    Auto-caddy

    A very useful option for beginners! When this is activated, your  club
    is  chosen  for  you,  and  the  computer  points  you  in the general
    direction of the hole  automatically.  If,  however,  you  fancy  your
    chances  ans  wish  to  do  everything on your own, set this option to
    "inactive".

    Start

    Begin a new game using the current settings.

    Load

    Loads a previously saved game from disk, and  automatically  continues
    from where you left off last time.

    Ambience

    No,  it`s not one of those white vans they take people to hospital in!
    It is, in fact, the background noise (birds and so on).

    Exit to DOS

    Exit from the game completely.

    Player Details

    This area shows the current player settings.  Click  on  the  player`s
    name  to change it (see" Character entry", below), or click on colours

    of  the  screen. Select "OK" to confirm and return to the main options
    screen.

    Character Entry

    To enter a players name, you can either click on the letters displayed
    on the screen or use the keyboard to type your name as normal. Up to 8
    letters are allowed. Click on "OK" to confirm.

    If you wish to save your player`s details,  click  on  "Save",  rather
    than  "OK"  whilst in the character entry section. You`ll be presented
    with a new screen, showing the names of all previously saved  players.
    Click  on  the  box  where  you  want to store your player details, or
    select "Cancel" if you change your mind. If you select a box which  is
    already  occupied,  the previous data will be overwritten with the new
    data. Make sure your program disk is write enabled  before  attempting
    to  to save data to it. Data for up to 40 players can be stored at any

    list shown. Select "Cancel" if you change your mind.

    NOTE: Character entry  is  only  possible  when  the  character  entry
    buttons are shown in white.

    Playing the game

    When the main game loads, you will see the main  playing  area,  which
    occupies  most  of  the  screen  and an information panel right at the
    bottom of the screen (we`ll take a  closer  look  at  the  information
    panel later).

    Use  the  joystick  to play the game. Push up/down to selct your club,
    and use left/right to aim. holding down the fire button for one second
    calsl  up  the  map screen which shows the entire hole, as well as the
    flag and current player positions. Press fire again to leave  the  map
    screen.

    Taking a shot

    Tap the fire button and a small marker will appear on the  power  bar,
    which  is  located  at  the  top  of  the  information panel. Move the
    joystick in any direction to cancel the shot.


    HOOK/SLICE                          ABORT SHOT

    I I I        I        I        I        I I

        0%      25%      50%      75%      100%

    The yellow are on the power meter is used for setting the  shot  power
    (0%  to  100%),  while the red aree at the bottom of the scale is used
    for setting hook and slice (curve).

    The smallest red block at the top of the scale will cancel the shot if
    you allow the power marker to enter it.

    press  fire  once  more  to start the power marker. Once it enters the
    yellow area, you may press fire to set the power  level.  The  further
    the  marker  is  allowed to travel to the right, the harder the player
    will hit the ball.

    Once the power has been set, another marker will begin  to  move  back
    down  the  scale.  This is the curve marker. You should try to stop it
    inside the red block at the bottom of  the  scale,  as  close  to  the
    centre  line  as  possible  in order to ensure a straight shot. If the
    marker is stopped on either the left or the right side of  the  centre
    line,  the  ball  will  hook  (left),  or slice (right) in flight. The
    severity of the curve depends on how far away the marker is  from  the
    centre line.

    NOTE: You don`t have to set hook and slice while using a putter.

    Information panel
    Across the top of the panel is the power bar, described above.

    The rest of the panelis divided into four parts.
