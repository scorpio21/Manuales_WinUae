  evil warriors.

  ViTaLiTy BaR
  ++++++++++++

  This is located in the top centre of Display.  The function of this bar
  is central to the game and determines Saul's current form.  It is 
  therefore very important to understand how this indicator operates.
  When the game commences, Saul is in human form, and the vitality bar is
  filled up to the maximum for Salu's human form.
  Should you, by the collection of vitality bonuses fill up the vitality
  bar beyond this limit, then Saul will transform into his Man-Wolf form.
  Saul will then stay in his Man-Wolf form until the vitality bar has been
  degraded (by taking hits from enemy weapons and punches) to below the
  limit.  At that point he will transform back into his human form, until
  sufficent vitality bonuses can be collected to make him transfrom into
  his Man-Wolf form again.
  Should Saul suffer enough hits to empty the bar, then Saul will lose a
  life, he will start his next Human form with the maximum vitality for
  his Human Form.  The maximum length of the bar may be extended by the 
  collection of EXTEND bonuses throughout the game.  This will allow Saul
  to take more hits in his Man-Wolf form by increasing the portion of the
  bar in which Saul is in his Man-Wolf Form.

  The icon represents Saul's current weapon, and the number of shots he
  has left.  In human form, the icon depicts a fist, since he is unarmed
  as a human, and the shots indicator is empty.
  In Man-Wolf form, the icon depicts his current psychic weapon.

  different psychic weapons that Saul may use in his Man-Wolf form.

  BOOMER RANG.

  SmArT BoMbS
  +++++++++++
  
  These are collected as bonuses, and have limited supply as displayed by
  the smart bomb indicator.  When Saul throws a smart bomb at the floor
  below him, it will shatter, triggering a massive burst of energy which
  takes ten hits on every enemy that is on screen at the time when the 
  explosion occurs.  A smart bomb will not activate if it does not shatter, 
  so you must be careful to choose where you throw them.

  BoNuSeS AnD ColLeCtAbLeS
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++

  These may be collected throughout the game and appear dotted around the 
  landscape, hidden behind breakable scenery or in secret bonus areas.
  Also, they can be invisible, scattered throughout the game & requiring
  a hit from Saul's fist or Man-Wolf form's psychic weapons to make them
  appear.  However, such collectables will only appear for a limited time,
  so it is important to collect them before they disappear permanently.
  With so many hidden objects throughout the game, it is vital to explore
  everything.  Check out anything that appears slighty out of place, and
  dont forget to make Saul jump up and down on floors in his Man-Wolf form,
  they are not always what they seem.
