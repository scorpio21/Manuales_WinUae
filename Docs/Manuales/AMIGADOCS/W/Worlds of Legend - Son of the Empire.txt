THE CHARACTER CLASSES

BERSERKERS

IN THE FORBIDDING WASTES OF THE FAR NORTH LIVE THE
BERSERKERS,A RACE OF
WARRIORS WITHOUT EQUAL WHO NEVER TIRE OF SLAYING THE MINIONS
OF CHAOS,IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE SOME HEROES OF THE NORTHERN
CLANS CAN ENTER A STATE OF BLOOD LUST KNOWN AS THE
"BERSERKER RAGE". THIS TURNS THEM INTO WILD AND FURIOUS
KILLING MACHINE WHO FOAM AT THE MOUTH AND ARE COMPLETLEY
UNSTOPPABLE UNTIL ALL THEIR FOES ARE SLAIN.

TROUBADOURS

A TROUBADOUR IS A CLASS OF WARRIOR/MUSICIAN WHO TRAVEL FROM
PLACE TO  PLACE HIRING THEMSELVES OUT AS FIGHTERS OR
ENTERTAINERS,WHICHEVER IS THE MOST LUCRATIVE. THE SONGS SUNG
IN BATTLE BY A TROUBADOUR ARE,ANCIENT MELODIES STEEPED IN
MAGIC THAT BOLSTER CHARACTERISTICS LIKE STRENGHT,SPEED OR
HEALING. THIS ABILITY WORKS ON THE WHOLE PARTY,NOT JUST ON
THE  SINGER,(ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MORE STRONGLY AFFECTED).

ASSASSINS

TO THE EAST OF THE ANCIANT REALM LIES THE EMPIRE OF THE
MOONCOMPRISING AS IT DOES OF NUMEROUS FEUDING PROVINCES, IT
ISNOT,SURPRISING THERFORE THAT THE WAY OF THE ASSASSIN IS A
POPULAR CAREER CHOICE FOR MANY YOUNG ADVENTURERES
THERE.ASSASSINS ARE HIGHLY TRAINED FIGHTERS WHO
SPECIALISE,IN
THE BACK ATTACK WHICH CAN TRIPLE THE DAMAGE THEY INFLICT
WHEN THEY ATTACK FROM BEHIND.HEAVY WEAPONS,SUCH AS SWORDS OR
STAVES ARE TO CUMBERSOME FOR THE ASSASSINS TO INFLICT
CRITICAL DAMAGE WITH,BUT SMALL WEAPONS LIKE DAGGERS ARE
IDEAL.

RUNEMASTERS

THE MOST POTENT FORM OF MAGIC FOUND IN THE ANCIENT REALM,AND
THE SURROUNDING LANDS ENTAILS THE USE OF RUNES TO CAST
SPELLS.ARCANE REAGENTS ARE MIXED INTO A BOWL WHILST INVOKING
THESE RUNES TO GIVE THEM THE POWER ALL RUNEMASTERS MUST HAVE
SERVED AN APPRENTICESHIP UNDER AN OLDER AND MORE
POWERFULL MAGE KNOWN AS A "MANTRIC"USUALLY GRANTS THE
WOULD-BE RUNEMASTER THE KNOWLEGDE OF A FEW RUNES AND THEN
SENDS THEM INTO THE WORLD NEVER TO RETURN.RUNEMASTERS MAY
LEARN OF THE NEW RUNES AND THEIR REAGENTS BY FINDING ANOTHER
MANTRIC WHO WILL SELL THEM THE KNOWLEDGE IN THE EMPIRE OF
THE MOON,ONLY THE MAD MONKS KNOW OF SUCH THINGS.

MONSTERS

THIS IS A GENERAL TERM REFERING TO ANY CHARACTERS WHO ARE
NOT MEMBERS OF YOUR OWN PARTY.THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES
OF MONSTER TO BE FOUND IN THE DUNGEONS,BUT THEY ALL HAVE ONE
THING IN COMMON-AN OVERPOWERING NATURAL INSTINCT TO ATTACK
YOUR PARTY AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY.SOME MONSTERS WILL BE
AXE FODDER FOR THE BERSERKER,WHILST OTHERS ARE CAPABLE OF
USING MAGIC
AND MUST BE DEALT WITH IN THE SAME WAY. A GOOD GENERAL RULE
WHEN FIGHTING MONSTERS IS THAT THE SMALLER THEY ARE,THE
EASIER THEY ARE TO DESTROUY.FOR EXAMPLE,KOBOIDS ARE TINY
HUMONOID CREATURES WHO LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN HANGING
AROUND WITH THE MORE POWERFULL ORCS OF RATMEN.
FORTUNATLY,THEY CAN BE DESTROYED WITH THE MINIMUM OF EFFORT.
INTELLIGENT AND VERY DANGEROUS MAGIC USING MONSTERS CAN BE
EASILY SPOTTED BY THEIR TENDENCY TO WEAR FLOWING  ROBES OR
SHROUD THEIR FACES UNDER DEEP COWLS . THEY CAN ALSO  BE
RECOGNISED BY THEIR CONSTANT ATTEMPTS TO BLAST YOUR PARTY
WITH SPELLS RATHER THAN ENGAGE THEM IN PHYSICAL COMBAT!


WELCOME

HAVEING VIEWED THE GRAPHIC INTRODUCTION,PRESSING ANY KEY
WILL DISPLAY ANOTHER SCREEN. THIS WILL ALSO ASK YOU TO PRESS
A KEY FOR A NEW GAME OR PRESS F1 TO LOAD IN A SAVE GAME. NEW
PLAYERS SHOULD PRESS ANY KEY AND SKIP THIS SECTION AND READ
"WHAT TO DO WHEN THE GAME HAS LOADED".IF YOU HAVE A SAVE
GAME FROM SON OF THE EMPIRE PRESS F1 AND SELECT F8 TO LOAD
IT IN.YOU CAN CARRY ON FROM WHERE YOU WERE WHEN YOU LAST
SAVED THE GAME.


VETERAN LEGEND PLAYERS

HOPEFULLY ONLY VETERAN LEGEND PLAYERS ARE LEFT THIS
PART.HELLO. ITS NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. YOU WILL BE PLEASED
TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN TRANSFER YOUR EXPERIENCED PARTY OF
ADVENTURERS FROM LEGEND INTO SON OF THE EMPIRE BY SELECTING
F1 (TO LOAD A SAVE GAME) AND THEN F4. YOU WILL ALSO BE VERY
PLEASED TO DISCOVER THAT NOT ONLY ARE THEIR EXPERIENCE
POINTS AND LEVELS INTACT,BUT SO IS THEIR GOLD.WHATS
MORE,THEIR HIT POINTS WILL BE DOUBLE THE STRENGTH THEY WERE
IN LEGEND AND YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT THE RUNEMASTER HAS
RETAINED HIS SPELLBOOK,HIS INGREDIENTS AND ALL HIS RUNES!


TO TRANSFER YOUR PARTY YOU MUST CHOOSE THE SAVE GAME NUMBER
FROM LEGEND THAT YOU WISH TO LOAD IN. YOU WILL THEN BEGIN
THE GAME AT THE START JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,BUT WITH YOUR
LEGEND PARTY INTACT.

YOU SHOULD ALREADY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE GAME SYSTEM,BUT YOU
MIGHT NOTICE A FEW DIFFERENCES.THE EAST DOESN`T CARE MUCH
FOR TAVERNS,AND THE ONLY WAY OF FINDING THOSE FACILITIES
OFFERED BY THE GUILD IN TRAZERE IS TO VISIT THE MAD
MONKS.THEY CAN ALSO OFFER YOU RUNES TO BUY AND INFORMATION
ON MAGIC ITEMS,JUST LIKE THE ANCIENT COULD. IF YOU`RE
LOOKING FOR THE MINSTREL,HE DOESN`T USUALLY TRAVEL THIS FAR
EAST.DON`T WORRY TOO MUCH THOUGH,AS A CLOSE RELATION OF THE
ASSASSIN CAN TEACH YOU ANY SONGS YOU DON`T ALREADY KNOW.
VISITING PLACES ISN`T AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS BEFORE,MAINLY
DUE TO THE VARIOUS FEUDING PROVINCES THAT ARE ROAMING THE
LAND AND OCCUPYING VILLAGES,TOWNS ETC.TO GAIN ENTRY TO
OCCUPIED LOCATIONS YOU WILL NEED PASSES,AND TO GET A PASS
YOU NEED TO DEFEAT AN ENEMY BANNER.FOR MORE DETAILS ON
PASSES SEE BANNER ENCOUNTERS.MANY OF THE ITEMS TO BE FOUND
IN THE GAME WILL BE FAMILIAR,BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME NEW AND
DIFFERENT ONES WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED.AS IN LEGEND,IGNORE
THE USEFULNESS OF OBJECTS AT YOUR PERIL.
