Bio-Yoghurt      - Poor grip on track, very hard going off-track
Jumping Nitro    - if you switch on NITRO, the car shoots forward
Pinball          - Collisions between cars produce rebounds, as on a
                   pinball table

PRACTICE MENU:

Here you can practice on any track with any car. You will be allowed to spend up to $500.000 in the "Spinparts" shop (we'll explain about this later) so you can try out your car modified to all available specifications. Note that the number of players and laps will be as already set in the Main Menu. You may choose the track, and any type of car. Press "GO" to start practice. To quit practice, just press SPACE + ESC.
LEAGUES MENU:

The game is split into LEAGUES. A LEAGUE involves racing on seven different tracks in one of the four available types of car. The LEAGUES are arranged in order of difficulty, but you can win the first three in any order. You must win all three to be eligible for the WORLD LEAGUE.
CHARACTERS MENU:

The personality of the driver you choose will make a great deal of difference to how your car performs. In this menu, you can choose between eight drivers of different nationalities, each with his own strengths and weaknesses. Detailed descriptions are in APPENDIX A.
SPINARTS:

Before tackling each track, you may check and modify your cars specification by using the SPINARTS Menu. The components you can change are the engine, tyres and suspension. You can also buy Nitro.

In the column of boxes on the left of the screen, the various components are shown in order of potency. You can scroll through them by using the arrows on the right. If you want details of a component that you are interested in, just place the cursor on the picture. A brief description will appear in the lower part of the screen, and its price in the box entitled COST. If you want to buy it, press the FIRE button and answer YES when asked to confirm your choice.

In the boxes on the right, you will see the components you have bought. The ones you are using are marked with a pink dot. If you move onto one of these boxes, details will come up of the component and its second hand value. This is so you can sell any parts you don't want, to increase your credit. But bear in mind that you'll only get back half the price you originally paid. If you want to do this, press FIRE and answer YES in confirmation. You can't sell a part unless you've already got at least two.

In the bottom left there is a picture of the Nitro tank, showing how much it holds. You may buy a bigger tank by using the arrows to the side and choosing the size you want. To find out the price, just go back to the box. If you want to buy it, press FIRE.

Also shown are the measures of nitro available. Again using the arrows to the side, choose how much you want. Find out the price by going back to the box. You can make your purchase by pressing FIRE. At the bottom centre there's a list of options. Here's what they do:

Buy/Sell mode - When this is ON, you may buy and sell spare parts, as already
                described.

Setup mode    - This allows you to choose which components you plan to use
                for the next race. The ones in use are marked with a pink
                dot.

Track         - Provides a brief description of the track on which you are
                going to race.

Exit          - Quit SPINPARTS. You may also quit by pressing ESC.

Note: In Appendix B you'll find the details of every component that is available
MAKING A DATA DISK:

We've already mentioned using a DATA DISK to save best times as well as games. To make a DATA DISK you just need to format a disk with the title WSDATA.
THE RACE:

The aim of the game is to win the first three leagues and get into the final the WORLD LEAGUE - and then become the outright champion of WHEELSPIN. This is no easy challenge. You'll have to drive on every type of surface: snow,sand, desert, tarmac, ice and shingle. Each has to be tackled in a different way, and you must also take account of your car's engine,tyres and suspension.

Your starting capital is $5.000. If you prove to be a good driver you'll soon increase this and start investing it to develop your car's capabilities to the absolute ultimate.

At the end of each race you'll be shown a screen with all the results:

    * The first page shows the finishing order and the total times.
    * The second page shows the provisional points allocation and the money won in this race.

Points and money are allocated thus:

    * 1st place - 9 points - $9.000
    * 2nd place - 5 points - $5.000
    * 3rd place - 3 points - $3.000
    * 4th place - 1 point - $1.000

The last four pages will appear only if you've selected RECORDS ON in the OPTIONS MENU. These show each players times for each lap. the name of the driver who has achieved the fastest lap is marked BL (Best Lap). He gets $2.000 extra. If he also beats the world record, WR (World Record) will appear beside his name.

To win a League, you must be in the overall lead after you've raced on seven tracks. Once you've achieved this, a Menu will come up inviting you to choose another League. You cannot have another go at the one you've just successfully completed. Against its name there will now be a little cup.

If you don't get to first place, the game ends and you're asked if you want to go right back to the beginning (restart) or repeat the league which you've just lost (Retry). In the second case, any other leagues which you've already successfully completed will still be valid. You'll also be allowed to keep the credits and the spares which you've acquired in SPINPARTS.
SAVING THE GAME:

After you've won a league and got your prize, you'll see the Save Screen. If you want to save the game, put the DATA DISK into a drive and choose one of the eight available slots. If you don't want to save the game, press ESC.
