Reference Card                   Amiga
--------------------------------------
Getting Started

You Need:

- An Amiga computer with at least 512K
- Single disk drive
- A color monitor or TV

A mouse or joystick is optional.

Loading Instructions

1. If you are using a joystick, make sure that the mouse is plugged into 
   Port 1 and the joystick is plugged into Port 2.

2. Turn on your monitor or TV and the computer. If necessary, insert
   Kickstart 1.2 into the disk drive.

3. When you are prompted for the Workbench disk, insert the Willow disk,
   label side up, into the disk drive.

4. The program will load automatically.

The Controls 

Willow can be played using any one of three control devices-mouse,
joystick, or keyboard. A general description of each is given below.
Detailed instructions for each game follow.

Mouse

The mouse is normally used to drive a small, wand-shaped cursor around
the screen. Selections are made by  pointing to the choice and pressing
the far left button. Occasionally, specific games may require you to use
the mouse more like a joystick. In these games, simple motions of the
mouse in the direction you wish the on-screen figure to go will do the
trick.

Keyboard

When using the keyboard, you'll have several options. The cursor keys are
always active and map the motions of a joystick.

 ______ ______ ______
|\    ||  |  ||    /|
|  7  ||  8  ||  9  |
|_____||_____||_____|
|     ||     ||     |
|--4  ||  5  ||  6--|
|_____||_____||_____|
|     ||     ||     |
|  1  ||  2  ||  3  |
|/____||__|__||____\|


If you have a separate cursor cluster, you may need to press two keys
simultaneously to cause diagonal movement.

          ______
         |  /\  |
     \---|  ||  |---/
   ___\__|______|__/___
  |      |      |      |
  | <--  |  ||  |  --> |
  |______|__\/__|______|   
       \    /\    /
        \  /  \  /
         \/    \/
         /      \


In both cases, the space bar will act as the fire button.

Joystick

The joystick does exactly what you would expect. Moving it in any of the
eight directions causes corresponding movement on the screen. Whenever the
fire button is called for, use button #1. Button #2 is never used in Willow.


Specific Game Controls

Each game in Willow has its own way of using input devices. The following
details each game's control system.

and select highlighted words to enter specific games.

To Scroll Forward and Back:

   to move backward. The closer to the bottom or top you move the cursor,
   the faster the scroll will move.

Special Keys

F1 - Allows the game sequence just played to be replayed without first
     returning to the scroll. Works only in the Practice mode.

ESC - Exits a game and returns to the scroll. Works in both Practice and
      Quest modes.

P - Pauses the action. Press this key again to continue. Works in both
    Practice and Quest modes.

Space Bar or Button - Whenever the game pauses, pressing the mouse button,
                      joystick button, or the space bar will continue the
                      game.

Game Reset

Clicking on the Mindscape logo in the scroll will cause a dialog box to
appear asking if you want to reset the game. Answering YES will cause all
maps to be randomized, all spells to be scrambled and the cages in the
Daikini Crossroads to be varied. You will then return to the scroll, ready
to begin your new adventure. If you choose NO, you will return to the
scroll without making changes.
