                       WARLOCKS QUEST
                       ==============
                                               TYPED BY SHARD - N&B


Deep,  deep  within  the  boiling  entrails  of  the Earth, where dwell the
accursed powers of darkness, squats HE whose name must never be prononnced.

HE  has  stolen  the  KARNA  from mankind, a magical stone which grants its
holder  infinite  power.   You  have  been  chosen  to recapture the stone,
However,  HE  will  not  give up his prize lightly.  Creatures of the night
have been dispatched intent on your total destruction.

All of humankind and several elves are counting on you.  May the four Lords
of Light guide and protect you on this very dangerous quest.
 
The foul master of misrule has stolen the KARNA from mankind.

The KARNA is the ultimate precious jewel, granting infinate power to he who
learns its secrets of its workings.

To prevent such chaotic events as light becoming darkness in the world, the
KARNA  must  be  wrested  from  the Lord of Wrongdoing, and only you can do
this.

In  the  steaming  pits  of the abyss, amongst grotesque demonic beasts and
cruel traps you must find eight objects that will lead you to the KARNA.

BUT!   Expect  no  respit  from Him, and be ready for the final combat that
must surely decide the future of the world.

May the lords of light be with you as you prepare for the greatest quest of
all.
