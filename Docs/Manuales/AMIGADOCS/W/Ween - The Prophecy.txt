WEEN - THE PROPHECY

ON THAT DAY, EVIL OMENS WERE CARRIED IN ON THE STORM, THE RUMBLING OF THE
THUNDER SEEMED TO PREDICT THE END OF THE KINGDOM OF BLUE ROCKS. THE
APPROACH OF THE GREAT ECLIPSE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE HEAVENLY FURY. ,ONLY 3
DAYS REMAINED BEFORE THE MOON WOULD VEIL THE ASTRAL LIGHT. BUT OHKRAM, MY
GRANDFATHER, BRAVING THE ANGER OF THE HEAVENS, PAID ME A VISIT. THE KINGDOM
OF THE BLUE ROCKS WAS IN DANGER.

AS YOU KNOW `WEEN` I`M A MASTER SORCERER AND PROTECTOR OF OUR PEOPLE, MY
POWERS FORMIDABLE - UNTIL NOW. IT WAS WRITTEN THAT TODAY I WOULD LOSE MY
POWERS, FOR MY GREAT AGE HAS EXHAUSTED MY FORCE.

FROM NOW ON COUNTRY IS AT THE MERCY OF THE POWERFUL KRAAL. HE IS A
SORCERER, THE MOST AMBITIOUS, THE GREEDIEST AND MOST DANGEROUS OF THEM ALL,
BECAUSE HIS THIRST FOR VENGEANCE FIRED HIS HATE. YOU WERE NOT YET BORN INTO
THIS WORLD WHEN I DEFEATED HIM AND BANISHED HIM FROM THE KINGDOM. NOBODY
KNEW WERE HE HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF BUT THOUGH PETROY, MY FAITHFUL FRIEND, I
HAVE HEARD THAT KRAAL HAS LEARNED OF MY WEAKNESS AND PLANS TO RETURN TO
RULE AS A TYRANICAL MASTER. I CAN NO LONGER STAND UP AGAINST HIS HATRED.
ONLY YOU CAN DO THIS `WEEN` BECAUSE YOU HAVE A NOBLE HEART, JUST AS HE WAS
FOR ME, KRAAL WILL BE YOUR MOST FERVENT ADVERSARY.

ONLY FEAR OF THE PROPHECY KEEPS HIM AT BAY AND OUT OF THE KINGDOM. IT IS
WRITTEN IN THE PROPHECY; `ON THE DAY OF THE GREAT ECLIPSE, THREE GRAINS OF
SAND WILL BE PLACED IN THE `REVUSS` BY THE VALIANT HERATED AND THUS THE
ENEMY WILL BE ANNIHILATED`.

OUR ONLY HOPE IS THAT YOU FIND THE THREE GRAINS OF SAND. IN ORDER TO DO
THIS YOU WILL NEED TO FIND AN ACCESS TO THE SECRET TEMPLE IN MY HOME.THIS
HOUSES THE HOUR-GLASS OF POWER,NAMED `REVUSS` IN THE PROPHECY. YOU HAVE 3
STEPS TO COMPLETE. YOU WILL BE REWAARDED A GRAIN OF SAND FOR EACH SUCCESS.

YOU MUST OPEN THE STELE WHICH SEALS THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAVE WHERE THE
TEMPLE STANDS.
YOU MUST VANQUISH THE DRAGON WITH A HUNDRED FACES. YOU MUST CONVINCE THE
GUARDIAN TO OPEN THE SANCTUARY.

THUS YOU WILL OBTAIN THE 3 GRAINS OF SAND ,WHICH, ON THE DAY OF THE GREAT
ECLIPSE, YOU WILL FIND PLACE IN THE `REVUSS`. SO THE PROPHECY WILL BE
FULFILLED AND `KRAAL` WILL BE VANQUISHED, GO `WEEN`, YOU ONLY HAVE 3 DAYS
LEFT!.

OHKRAM ONCE AGAIN ASSURED ME THAT HIS SPIRIT WOULD BE WITH ME. I GATHERED
SOME PROVISONS TOGETHER IN A HAVERSACK AND IMMEDIATELY LEFT FOR HIS HOME...

WHAT WOULD I COME ACROSS IN THE COURSE OF THIS ADVENTURE?..WHAT BATTLES
WOULD I HAVE TO WIN?..AS YET I COULD NOT KNOW,BUT ONE THING I WAS SURE- I
WAS DETERMINED THAT AGAINST HIS STRENGTH I WOULD USE MY ONE ADVANTAGE - MY
MIND.
