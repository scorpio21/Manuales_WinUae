1 ) HOW TO START THE PROGRAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE MANAGER supports installed memory expansion as well as any
existing external disk-drives (i.e. DF1:) or hard disk.

1.1 AMIGA WORKING CAPACITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have an AMIGA 500 with only 512K of memory, you cannot really
enjoy all the functions of THE MANAGER. Attention: If you are using an
Amiga 500 with 512K remove all external drives! For reasons of space
you would have to forgot the marble background, the animated sequences
and the subsequent newspaper headlines. Apart from that, this program is
exactly the same as the 1 MB version. You just have to load menu items from
disk from time to time.

If you have 1 MB of memory, all the necessary data are loaded into the
memory before you start; you will not have to reload during the game. The
only exceptions are the animated sequences and the newspaper screens,
although the latter are also loaded into the memory if you have more than
1 MB at your disposal.

While loading, the program automatically recognises RAM capacity of
more than 51 2K. It then loads the appropriate version of THE MANAGER.

1.2 STARTING THE GAME WITH ONE OR TWO FLOPPY DISK
DRIVES OR A HARD DISK DRIVE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have more than one disk drive, this will be recognised and supported
by THE MANAGER. You only have to insert Disk 1 into drive DF0: and Disk
2 into the external drive.

But even if no other disk-drive is available, you'll never be asked to be
a disk-jockeywhen using the 512K version, as the data is organised on the
disk in such a way that very few changes need to be made. If you have only
one drive, please insert Disk 1 until you are asked to replace it with 
Disk 2.
If a change of disk is necessary, THE MANAGER will inform you. As soon
as you have changed the disks, the program will automatically continue
loading.

There is, of course, also a hard disk installation program on Disk 1, so
you can easily copy THE MANAGER onto hard disk. To do this, click on the
hard disk installation icon from the Workbench; (the hard disk
must be turned on).


1.2.1) HARD DISK INSTALLATION (AMIGA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to install THE MANAGER on to hard disk. Start as usual by
booting your hard disk. Then insert the Manager Disk 1 into drive DF0: and
use the Workbench by clicking on the HD Install icon. The program will then
ask you for the name of the directory on your hard disk in which you want
THE MANAGER to be loaded (e.g. DH0:Games).

IMPORTANT!

Make sure that the directory exists and there is enough space available.
Press the mouse button (with Disk 1 still in drive DFO:) and the data 
will be transferred. After this is completed the program will request 
Disk2. Another click on the mouse will start copying Disk 2 onto the hard 
disc. THE MANAGER is now installed on your hard disk and can be started 
by simply clicking on its icon.

1.2.2) HARD DISK INSTALLATION (PC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You will find the program in a compressed form on your disks. To play THE
MANAGER you will need a hard disk.

First switch on your PC. At the DOS prompt, insert the Manager Disk 1
in your disk drive (for example A) and type:

INSTALL (source drive): (target drive): (e.g.: INSTALL A: C:)

You can replace drive A and C with other valid source or target drives
according to your machine's configuration.

IMPORTANT! You need to type in both drives (source drive and target
drive)! If not, your PC can't install the program correctly!

If installation was correct THE MANAGER starts automatically. To restart
THE MANAGER later on, type BMP when in subdirectory BMP.

1.2.3) GENERAL HINTS FOR PC USERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use the program CHKDSK to check the available memory. Your machine
needs a minimum of 565K free memory to start THE MANAGER. Deactivate
all memory resident utilities from CONFIG.SYS if there is not enough free
memory available.

THE MANAGER supports SOUNDBLASTER music card only. You will
hear different sounds during animated game scenarios. The program will
start the Soundblaster card automatically.

If you happen to have problems with your sound card load, load the
game by typing:

BMMain 0

The sound will be switched off.

1.2.4) LOADING A SAVED GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you wish to load a saved game directly after loading THE MANAGER, click
on the Title of the Selection screen. You can now load a saved game as
described in Chapter 2.3.5 on page 32.


2) INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MANAGER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE MANAGER has a clearly laid-out, attractive and easy-to-follow user
interface. It uses graphic symbols (or icons) for all the important 
operating instructions, so that there are no confusing lines of text. 
The positioning of the menu icons allows the user to choose options in a 
much more efficient way.

2.1 START SELECTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After loading, you'll see the selection screen , where the numbers (1
to 4), and names of the Managers and their clubs are to be entered.

First enter the other players by clicking on the black space below the
Managers' heads, type in the names and press the Return key.

The logo is selected by clicking on the arrows on the edges of the logo
menu bar, or by clicking to the left or the right of the emblem in 
the middle (i.e. the currently selected logo).

The logos will be scrolled through horizontally. If you now click
on the black rectangle above a Manager's head, the logo in the 
middle will move to the corresponding Manager (provided that he has
already been given a name).

If you should like the look of one Manager more than another, that's no
problem. First click on head A, then head B, and there you are with the head
you wanted. Have fun! And to avoid letters to the editor enclosing passport
photos, may we advise you that we will ignore all requests for a specially
personalised version of TH E MANAG ER with your digitised head in it! If you
are a fan of a 4th Division team which isn't in the selection, you may
purchase the Editor Disk (see Chapter 6, Editors). With this you can insert
your special club or team, for example, with its own logo and team
members.

Click the right mouse button to complete the Selection. This is the point
of no return....

The following shows the selection of the different modes (beginning
at the top):

a)Level 0-5
------------
Choose a low number if you are an absolute beginner or love success
without having to do too much for it. The Manager has an easy job here,
partly because of a higher starting capital, 'amicable' team management,
and a lenient attitude towards beginners' mistakes.

b)Continuous game
------------------
Managers start in the 3rd Division and have to struggle forwards through
many tough seasons to get up to the 1 st Division. As the name implies, this
mode has no time-limit!

c)1 season game
---------------
The 1 -year mode starts in the 1 st Division, but you have much better
teams, so you aim for the Championship. These teams are also represented 
in the European Cup (UEFA-Cup). In the 3 season or 1 season modes, the
Manager's achievement at the end of the game is judged according to
various criteria and will appear in the High-Score Table (if he was good
enough to get there...).

d)3 season game
----------------
Managers start in the 1st Division and have to stay in this league for 
3 years.
As the teams' strength is relatively low at the beginning, this isn't always
easy.

One more click on the right mouse button completes the selection.

The computer now takes the real names of players in the League and
enters them in your team. The teams' strengths are read from a file,
converted and entered, so that the strengths of your teams in THE
MANAGER correspond more or less to those of actual divisions.

The topical interest depends on the file 'mana.dat' on Disk 2. The
players' names, clubs' strengths, logo, etc. can easily be changed and
topicalized with the help of an Editor program (see Chapter 6, Editors) This
means that at any time you have the opportunity of reproducing the current
League events on the screen. If you choose a club from the Second or Third
Divisions, but start in the First Division (1 or 3 season modes), a team 
from the First Division (instead of your club) will be relegated to a 
lower division to restore the proper League structure.

2.2) FA-CUP/EUROPEANCUPDRAWS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For these events see Chapter 3.

2.3) MAIN MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Main Menu which now appears on the screen is divided up as follows:

    ________________________________________________________________
   |			T H E   M A N A G E R 		(A)	    |

			Figure 2: Main Menu

a) Title

Click on the title to display the Credits.

b) Calendar (top right)

This is a real time calendar in so far as it follows the rules of a normal
calendar (i.e. 31 days in January; 30 days in April etc.); but you cannot 
use it to look for the actual day of the week corresponding to a 
certain date, as it will probably not be accurate. The calendar is very 
useful for estimating the interval of time between fixtures.

The date is also important for preparing for the end of the season . Within
the scheme of realistic match programming, you have to remember that
while there are no matches at all within the period from the last day of 
play in the first season to the first day of the second season, salaries 
still have to be paid and training has to carry on.

c) Manager's head, League Position Graph, Club logo

The head and logo will be your identification throughout the game. The
League Position Graph shows all the previous positions of the season as
a line graph representing the global trend.

d) Messages

By clicking on the empty marble field in the centre of the screen you can 
call up news items that occur during the game (see also Chapter 3d Messages).

e) Main Menu items:

on the left: 'Manager', 'Clubs', 'Players'
on the right: 'Cups', 'Disk/Div', 'End'

If you click on the Main Menu icon, the screen will show you nine sub-menu
items that can also be activated by clicking with the mouse. Cobwebs
indicate an empty sub-menu box. If there is a cobweb over a sub-menu item
that is normally filled, this means that it cannot be selected for the time
being, (for example, after visiting a training camp), or that it is blocked 
in the the current game mode (e.g. the High-Score Table in the continuous 
game mode).

f) Continue game

You finish your turn by clicking on the calendar (see b in fig. 2). If 
there are other Managers waiting, they can play now; if not, the next 
day's play will begin.

2.3.1) MAIN MENU ITEM MANAGER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As soon as you activate the Manager menu item, the following sub-menu
items will appear on the screen.

a) Statistics

This menu item provides all kinds of statistical information about your 
club. The 'runs' (on the upper left) indicate your team's results in 
sequence: won/lost/drawn/not won etc. The number in brackets represents 
the record from the start of your game, the number before it shows the 
present state of the match.

T, H, A indicate the columns Total, Home, Away. For example: '4(7)' in
the 'No goals conceded' line and in Column A means that for a series of
four away matches the opposition did not score a single goal. The record 
is seven matches.

These runs refer only to ordinary league matches, not to FA Cup or
European Cup matches.

Your record results from the start of the game are kept under Records;
both opponents and results are saved here.

For example: '5 versus X' in the line 'A goals' means that you have
scored your highest number of away goals (5) against the team X.

Income/Expenses indicates the income and outgoings currently handled
each month. Some of these sums are fixed and can be only indirectly

modified by you: (e.g. travelling expenses, donations, money from TV-
broadcasts). They can be altered only indirectly, because here your team's
strength and your current position are also taken into consideration.

The 'floating' part of your money, which is determined by you, consists
of footballers'salaries, expenditure on youth work, advertising costs, income
from sponsorship, loans etc.

Outgoings are usually much higher than income. The deficit has to be
made up by admittance fees. Under the heading Spectators (on the right),
you will find, amongst other things, how many spectators you must have to
make up the difference between income and expenditure.

The average crowd needed to break even might appear rather high, but
you have to consider the summer break with no takings from the gate, but
continuing outgoings (salaries, loan interests, etc...)

The average given is totally reliable, as all expenses/income including
interest on loans and credits at the bank are balanced over a one-year
period.

Another important aspect is the admission fee which you determine for
your stadium. (See also 2.3.1 d, Stadium.) With higher admission prices,
the average number of spectators decreases, since more money is paid per
person. Conversely, the number increases as ticket prices drop. The other
spaces below Spectators indicate the total number in the crowd (adding all
home and visiting spectators), the average number for each match and the
figures for record attendance as well as for worst attendance. Cup matches
are not analysed, as this would give a false impression of the League
matches.

In the space below Worst attendance abar graph indicates the number
of spectators on all days of play. The horizontal bar displays the home
matches in order and the vertical bar indicates the number of spectators at
a single home match . The display is approximate: i .e. a full bar means 
100% (completely full attendance) and serves as the top measure for 
subsequent days of play.

In the column Finances, you can see the statement of your own account
as well as your debts to all creditors (the bank and other Managers). The
state of your finances is presented to you in one more way: the further the
vertical bar falls into the red zone, the worse they are!

b) Previous League Table/Results so far (fig. 3)

This table indicates your long-term achievements in THE MANAGER. As
well as your position in the League, other successes in the FA Cup,
European Cup, championships, etc. are taken into account. After each
season this table is up-dated.

The 'Past Data' column shows you at a glance all the championships
and cup matches you have won since the start of the game. In addition, you
can constantly see in which Cup matches you are still playing: a red circle
around the current Cup (bar on the left) means'You are OUT';a green circle
indicates that you still have a fighting chance.

Immediately below this you'll find the total scores, goals, wins, defeats
and draws, added up from all the seasons and divided into Total, Home and
Away.

In the long term you can observe the 'home strength' of your club merely
by analysing the 'Home' section of 'Past Data'.

c) Victories

The menu item 'Victories' also gives you a long term estimate of your club's
development. The upper (blue) window indicates what division you are in
and what rounds you have reached in the League, as well as the FA Cup
and the European Cup forthe respective season. The lower (black) window
has a bar graph giving you an idea of how you've done in the League so far.
The horizontal one shows the current season, the vertical one the position
you have reached in the League. The significance of the bar colours are as
follows:
    dark brown    - 3rd Division
    mid brown     - 2nd Division
    light brown   - 1st Division

The height of the bar indicates your league position in the current season.
All wins from the past 50 years have been recorded. You cannot see all
seasons at once, so click with the mouse to move onto the next one. If you
have been in the league for more than 50 years, the first entry will be
replaced by the most recent season.

d) The Stadium

When you play THE MANAGER you can enjoy looking at your own stadium
on the screen by choosing the Menu option Stadium. As well as different
figures for stadiums, flood-lighting and score-boards, their current state of
repair (from very poor to excellent) is graphically portrayed.

In this menu item you can chose from the following options:

Extending stadium capacity (with either seats or terraces)

Roofing in the already existing seats or terraces

Installing floodlights or an electronic scoreboard

Improving the stadium's condition and facilities

Determining the average entrance fee

You just have to click on the items you wish to select (which are then
displayed at the bottom of the screen).

In the upper left window a dialog box appears, along with information on
improvement costs and your current financial possibilities. ('Max. Size'
means the maximum credit you are able to arrange. Underneath, in
brackets, you find the estimated costs.)

If you should change your mind because of the unexpected costs, press
the right mouse button to return to the previous selection.

But if you decide to go ahead with the extension, enter the number of
seats by clicking on the upper (+ 1,000) or lower (-1,000) triangle of the
input box.

The maximum number of seats in the stadium is 130,000. When you
have reached the number you wish to erect, click the right mouse button.

Your instructions will now be displayed once more, and you learn the
expected construction time. You simply orderthe renovation/reconstruction
by confirming the 'Safety inquiry'. If you change your mind, the contract is
cancelled - but you are not allowed to carry out that kind of construction
work for a certain time (as the construction company is no longer interested
in dealing with indecisive Managers like you!)

When installing floodlights or scoreboards, or improving the general
state or facilities of your stadium your selection options are 
slightly different. Instead of the dialog box you find the different 
degrees of expansion ('small', 'medium', 'large' for scoreboard and 
floodlights; 'very poor' to 'excellent' for the state of the stadium 
and its amenities) with the financial alternatives highlighted on 
the screen. Click on one of these options to continue as described above.
If you have signed a contract with a building company, the new value will
appear under 'After reconstruction' in the lower window in light blue
characters. You can always survey all current building activities; only the
date of completion is not available, since this cannot be precisely 
calculated .

By clicking on the last line you can decide the average entrance fee
which should correspond to the average value of seats, standing places or
covered areas. The prices range from œ1 to œ6 in steps of 50p, but changing
them even slightly may have disastrous consequences on the attendance
numbers. The rule of thumb is: the stronger the next home opponent and
the better your own side, the more people will be prepared to dig a little
deeper into their pockets for a match. If your team gets promoted to 
the next division, you should think about increasing prices, as 
increased fixed charges demand higher takings from spectators.The 
furnishment of your stadium will be paid for by the increased number 
of spectators and better sponsorship, even when this is not immediately 
apparent.

e) Loans

Of course, in THE MANAGER, you can borrow either from the bank or from
other Managers.

The upper left window shows the different interest rates for the various
options. Interest rates are only favourable if you have raised a loan 
from the bank; they can also change during the game. You can choose 
where to raise the money by clicking on the appropriate space on the 
right-hand side of the screen. If you play by yourself, naturally the 
bank is your only option!

If you'd like to raise loan from the bank, click on the duration/interest 
rate you have chosen and enter the amount of money using the keyboard. The
details of the contract appear in the lower window on the left: the 
date of the loan, amount, interest rate, due date and interest per month.

Raise a loan from another player (if there is one) by clicking on the
chosen Manager's head at the right-hand edge of the screen.

Just click on the upper window on the right-hand side and enter the
amount of the loan, its duration and interest rate.

The maximum loan from a bank would be £1 million, from a Manager
£250,000. In the loan window (bottom left), you will see the total amount
borrowed as well as the total interest for each creditor.

Warning: Interest is deducted monthly, not annually! This may not
seem very realistic, but when playing for high stakes you would
otherwise scarcely notice the interest payments.

A Manager is paid 1.5% interest on surplus capital. If the account is
overdrawn interest rates are high at 10%. If a repayment is due, this is
announced before the other player starts a new round. The money will be
debited, even if this causes a deficit.

f) Sponsorship/Advertising Contracts

This is not available in the 1 season game. Sponsors are automatically
assigned to the Managers, since the duration of the contract with them has
no importance in this mode (as everything changes after one year anyway)
so negotiation of advertising contracts would be distorted.

Advertisements can be assigned to six billboards inside the stadium or
the team's shirts. Good sponsors are extremely important for the club, as
much of the budget has to be financed by advertising.

You choose these sponsors by clicking first on the footballer (for ad on
shirts) and then on one of the six stadium ads. The chosen object is edged
in white. Now click on the brown rectangle in the middle, and the logo 
of the relevant company will appear. Using the arrow symbols to the right 
you can scroll through the list of the ten available advertising firms. If 
a sponsor is interested, you will see their offer (monthly payment and 
duration of contract). You accept the offer by clicking on OK.

A signed contract cannot be cancelled during the period of the agreement.
Once you have made a contract, you can always find out how much longer
it has to run (in months) by clicking on the relevant hoarding or shirt. 
If an advertising contract expires, the billboard/shirt becomes available 
again but you receive only a tenth of the previous amount that the 
ex-sponsor still has to pay you for any remaining stickers, torn 
posters etc.

On the right-hand side of the screen you can examine all costs and
income from advertising. Revenue comes from the shirt and stadium ads
as well as from TV broadcasting rights. The latter cannot be directly
controlled - it depends on the general public interest in your club.

You can decide the cost of advertising within certain limits. Click on the
figure beside the 'Advertising costs' box. These expenses are fixed at 
œ625 intervals: you can choose from œ1,250 to œ12,500. If the cursor is 
in the left half of the black field, the amount is reduced; if it is 
in the right half, the costs will increase each time you press the key. 
Money spent on advertising improves your club's public image and can 
therefore be thoroughly beneficial to the team. Every four weeks or so 
you can reckon on new offers from advertising agents, so you should try 
to sign on with the very best sponsors as quickly as possible. On the 
other hand, bad advertising contracts might harm your financial situation 
in the long run. Sometimes it is worth waiting for a really good offer.  

2.3.2) MAIN MENU ITEM CLUBS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As soon as you activate the the item, the following sub-menu items appear
on the screen;

h) Strength chart 2nd Division

c) 3rd Division Table

Figure 4: Sub-menu items in Main Menu Item Clubs

a) 1st Division Table
b) 2nd Division Table
c) 3rd Division Table

The menu item League Table provides the Manager with detailed information
at his/her request, besides indicating the current positions in the League.
The columns show the following (from left to right):

-- League position
-- Name of club

Results so far: the last 8 matches have been saved;

Home matches: 'W', 'D', 'L' = Won, Drawn, Lost
Away matches: 'w', 'd', 'I' = Won, Drawn, Lost

(the last match is shown to the right)

Matches played so far

Won, drawn, lost matches of the current season

--Points, goals, goal difference

The coloured background of some league positions mean the following:

      light green        - Championship position
      dark green         - UEFA Cup position (1 st Division only)

- Promotion position (2nd and 3rd Division)

       red               - Relegation position

The league table can be set to 'Home', 'Total' and 'Away' using the three
lower buttons. With 'Home' and 'Away', only the relevant matches are taken
into consideration, so you can see yourteam's position with regard to home
and away matches.

d-f) Programme Schedule of 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions

The programme schedule of the relevant divisions indicates who plays
when against whom. As well as the team names, you can check their
current league table positions and learn more about each club's strength.
This is shown by four figures, the first of which gives the average, while 
the three in brackets break the information down according to fitness, 
skill and form. With the help of the arrows on the bottom left, you can 
page backwards and forwards through the match days.

g-i) Strength charts of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd divisions

This menu item allows you to make a direct comparison between the
relative strengths of the clubs in a Division . The teams are graded 
according to their average strength (max. 99, min. 0). Individual 
assessments are broken down into the three columns: Fitness, Skill and 
Form. By clicking on the lower button you classify the charts by Total, 
Defence, Midfield or Forward strengths, as in points a-c in 2.3.2, League 
Table. As well as giving important information on the League, the 
information about your own club provides useful tips to overcome 
potentially weak areas in the team (for example, obviously weak defence). 
It is up to the Manager to do away with these negative aspects, by buying 
a stronger defender or by varying training, perhaps.

2.3.3) MAIN MENU ITEM PLAYERS

As soon as you activate Players, the following sub-menu items will appear
in the centre of the screen:


	_________________________________________________
       |		|		|		|
       |       A        |	D	|	G	|
       |________________|_______________|_______________|
       |		|		|		|
       |	B	|	E	|	H	|
       |________________|_______________|_______________|
       |		|		|		|
       |	C	|	F	|	I	|
       |________________|_______________|_______________|


a) Selection of players

In this menu item you can position your team and decide the formation for
the next match.

The information in the columns means the following (from left to right):

    Player's number Numbers 1 to 11 show that the player is
    selected in the current team, numbers 12 and 13 indicate the 
    substitutes.

    Type of player (goalkeeper, defence, midfield or forward)
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    If a player is on loan from another club, the words 'on loan' appears.


     Player's name
     --------------
     In the status line (lower edge of the window) you can see his age and
     whether a player is a left-footer ('1'), a right-footer ('r') or an 
     all-rounder ('I + r').
     This is important for positioning the players (see below).

     Completed matches (league and cups)
     ------------------------------------

     Strength (Fitness, Skill, Form) - 
     The number in brackets gives the average.

     Status:

      Scored goals (league and cups)

      Yellow and red cards

      Selected - the player is selected
      Substit - the player stays as a substitute
      Injured - the player is injured.

       The diagnosis is displayed in the status
       line, too. Depending on how serious the
       injury is, the player will not be available
       for anything from a week to several
       months.

Suspended (x) - the player in unable to
play because of a red card. The number
'x' in brackets gives the number of days
for which he is still suspended.

This indicates whether the player is on
a physical high ('+'), or if his biological
rhythm predicts that he's going downhill
('-'). A '0' means that his form is
developing normally.

The different colours in this item mean the following:

Form red

The player is pretty exhausted. The
exact degree of tiredness can be
ascertained from Players' Info (see
Chapter 3 f, Players' Info).

To reduce exhaustion, give him a
recreation break or adapt his training to
his needs (see Chapter 2 d, Training).
A high degree of exhaustion makes
injuries more likely.

Player's name in white He has had an offer to move to
anotherclub. The club's bid can only be
seen in the transfer list (see Chapter 2
c Transfer List)

Blue number - Indicates a substitute.

Status Red - Suspended owing to red card or injury.



Eleven players will be picked and a maximum of 2/4 players nominated as
substitutes (2 for League matches and 4 for European Cup matches).

You can select players for your team by clicking the left mouse button,
and substitutes by clicking the right button. If a player has 
been incorrectly positioned or placed on the reserve list, you 
can reverse the selection by left-clicking again.

The dedication of your team can be graded with the bar on the upper
right of the screen (but the higher the dedication, the higher the 
probability of injuries, cards or exhaustion).

If you want to keep the exact formation of the selected players, press the
second button on the top right-hand side of the screen (pitch). Now you can
see the players on the pitch. During this display, players can be changed,
replaced or tactically positioned (see above), and only the status and the
trend from the eleventh player on are no longer visible.

At the beginning of a match an automatic setting (AS) is activated. You
can see this because one of your AS symbols at the lower left-hand edge
of the screen is highlighted.

The Manager can now set one of three Auto Settings with the help of
these AS symbols:


1) 2-4-4 (2 forwards, 4 midfield, 4 defenders
	  = defensive play)

2) 2-5-3  (2 forwards, 5 midfield, 3 defenders
	   = normal play)

3) 3-4-3   (3 forwards, 4 midfield, 3 defenders
	    = offensive play)

If AS is activated, the computer will pick the strongest and most useful
players, regardless of his positioning. At the beginner's level this doesn't
matter much, as mistakes in the setting are of no consequence. But at the
normal level you should at least keep in mind the following rules that are 
not always fully taken into account by the AS option (otherwise it 
might all be too simple...):

Left-footers should play on the left and right-footers should play on the 
right.

Vertical rows in the setting should be not be left empty.

Always place the goalkeeper in the middle of the lowest
line, otherwise the goal would be wide open to the
opponent's shots...

Place at least 2 players in defence, 2 in midfield and
another 2 as forwards.

If AS is activated, no more changes can be made. By clicking on one of the
ball icons or on the marble background, this option will be de-activated.

You will see the message 'Auto-Team selection is deactivated'. Now
you're in charge again...

The manual positioning of a player is done as follows:

First you click on the particular ball icon on the pitch, (outlined in blue),
inside which you find the number of the player who appears in the window
on the left. Then you choose the desired position. If the position is 
already taken by another player, they simply swap places.

b) Contracts (fig. 5)

The Contracts Sub-menu item can also be selected from Selection of
players. In the same way, the symbols or icons on the right allow you to 
go directly to the menu option Selection of players.

Now it is time to negotiate. Each player has a fixed duration contract with
the club (of between one and four years) and a monthly salary.

After clicking on the player you can choose the length of contract and
specify his monthly salary. Click on the relevant figure in the lower 
Contract window and enter the new data using the keyboard. This is 
confirmed by clicking on New contract. Abort finishes your negotiations 
(as you might have guessed). You will then be informed whether the player 
has accepted your offer. If the player has rejected it, he won't be 
interested in any further negotiations for a few weeks. But if you wish, 
you can try negotiating with him again later in the season.

A lengthy contract ensures that a player will stay in your team for a long
time. If you then wish to sell him, (because of poor performance or 
financial problems), your proceeds from the sale will be greatly reduced, 
due to the compensation you have to pay to 'release' the player. In 
addition, the longer the contract, the higher the salary demanded, (it 
increases progressively, not proportionally!) as the player's performance 
also improves.

The Manager will soon learn from experience exactly what leeway he
has when negotiating contracts; the first salary can serve as an initial,
minimum basis for negotiation.

If you wish to extend a player's contract, the computer will help you to
some extent. After you have entered your chosen period of time,
an appropriate salary will be suggested in the line above. (This 
can only act as a fairly generous guideline - the player may have 
different ideas!). The player's salary is determined according to careful 
calculation of his age, strength, etc.

After each season the length of the contract is reduced by one year.
For example, if you sign a two year contract on the 38th day's play (in the
3rd Division) with player 'A', he will be 'bound' to the club for one (the 
last) match day of this season plus the whole of the following season.

At the end of the season you are automatically allowed to re-negotiate
a new contract for each player individually (see also Chapter 4, End of
Season).

If there's no positive agreement and the contract expires, the player will
leave your club and you will receive only a modest transfer fee.

You should therefore be sure to:

  arrange extended contracts as early as possible;

  be generous in offering good salaries to players you
  definitely want to keep.

The different colours in this menu item symbolise the following:

  Red line      After his contract expires, the player
                will retire, i.e. you can no longer count
                on him;
  
   Blue line    The player doesn't want to negotiate at
                present. This occurs when a player has
                rejected a bid - (see above);

Player's name in white The player himself offers to extend his
contract.

c) Transfer List (fig. 5)

The Manager can buy/hire new players, or sell/lend his own players, when
they are on the transfer list. You can alternate between the two modes with
the help of two buttons 'Loan' and 'Buy' in the upper right-hand window. In
the 'Lend' mode the price of a player on the transfer list is be divided 
by 3; the player on loan will leave your club at the end of the season. 
There is never any further negotiation with players on loan: the computer 
fixes the monthly salary according to the player's ability.

-> Buying or hiring players

Those players offered by other clubs can be seen in the upper right-hand
window (the transfer list). After clicking on your chosen player, you can
make an offer to his club. The 'asking' price will be shown on the transfer
list, along with the type of player, his name and strong points.

The sum of money shown is not a definite offer, more of an estimate. This
means that an offer of this amount will not necessarily be accepted. To be
quite sure of acquiring a player, you should a bid a little more than the
suggested figure.

If the player's former club agrees, all you have to discuss with him is the
length of the contract and his monthly salary. If you accept the default 
terms given under 'New contract', you can be fairly sure of the player 
being under contract now (although it is always possible for him to 
change his mind) . You can also try right from the start of negotiations to 
fix the contract for more than one year at a higher salary. If the player 
doesn't accept the contract despite these terms, the contract falls through.

In that case, the player's club won't accept any other bid you would like
to make for the next few days (so, please be careful with offers and
contracts). The maximum number of players in your squad is 24, including
those on the transfer list.

Selling or lending players:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you click on a player in your squad he is put onto the transfer list. 
Each Manager can have up to three players on the transfer list. A 
transferred player is indicated by a small dot in front of his name. In 
the lower status line the Manager's name, the player's age and his 
'strong foot' will be given. To cancel a transfer, click on him again and 
he'll return to your team. If you really want to sell someone who is on 
the transfer list, you have to wait until another club makes a bid for him. 
If there is currently such an offer, it will be announced within the next 
few days of play (see also: Chapter 3 d, Messages).

Loaning out is only possible between Managers. At end of a season all
players on the transfer list will be automatically returned to your squad.

When there are negotiations between Managers about transfers, the
Manager of the player to be transferred has to decide whether or not he is
going to accept the bid. To ward off dishonest Managers, the bid must
comprise a reasonable offer (e.g. selling for œ3 is inadmissible).

d) Training (fig. 5)

The best is yet to come... Weekly training sessions are advisable and
essential for your team to improve. You may follow the information in the
'Strength chart' (see also: 2.3.2, g - i, Strength charts) to provide the 
best plan for efficient training of your team.

According to your needs, you can emphasise fitness, skill, shooting or
tactics (left hand side of the screen).

On the right hand side of the screen you'll find specific players in your
team (goalkeeper, defence, midfield, forward) who you can train as 
necessary.

For both training sessions, a limited number of balls is available to
represent the training session. On the left you have twenty balls, on 
the frighten, to distribute as you please. Click on the appropriate 
space within a particular row.

The value of a setting can only be raised if balls are 'free' (displayed in
the vertical tubes at the sides of the screen). More balls are released 
when a value is lowered.

The intensity of the training (the bottom row on the left) depends on how
many balls you put into it. The range is from one ball (lax) up to 10 
balls (10 hours per day). But remember, the harder you train, the more 
exhausting it'll be for your team, and the greater their susceptibility 
to injuries. On the other hand, though, it can be advantageous in the 
short-term for the abilities and strength of the whole team.

The three green bars below left represent:

-> F/S - Fitness and Skill

These two bars reflect the relationship between fitness and skill in your
team and make it easier for you to adapt their training accordingly. This
correlation should be more or less balanced, although a certain advantage
in skill is desirable from time to time.

IMPORTANT: If the Fitness bar extends much beyond the Skills bar,
there will rapidly be greater danger of injuries as well as rougher soccer.
Take care that this situation does not last very long, otherwise your team
will probably turn into a 'sick bag'!...


-> E - Exhaustion

This bar displays the exhaustion level of the whole team as an absolute
value. So, keep an eye on this bar and don't allow it to get too high (by
reducing the intensity of training for example).

There is another special feature, labelled 'Youth', which determines how
much money you wish to spend on the youth team per month. If you do this
properly you may eventually have the chance to integrate talented young
(and inexpensive) players into your team (see also Chapter 4, End of
Season).

The different types of training (fitness, skill, shooting or tactics) each
have a special influence on the team's performance and strength. With a
little reflection and practice, the Manager will soon be able to 
establish the most appropriate training program to solve his team's 
individual problems.

The default settings are relatively balanced: i.e., fitness, skill 
and form are dealt with almost equally.

e) Training Camps (fig. 5)

THE MANAGER provides you with eight different training camps in which
your team can be revitalised.

They are not all open all year round, depending on the season.

Moreover, you are not allowed to use these camps too frequently to
strengthen your team or the menu option will become blocked.

Different places have their own specialities such as recuperative
atmosphere, fitness-equipment, superior pitch, comfortable accommodation
and nutritious food. The grading in a certain category is similar to that 
of hotels, where the awarding of one to five stars indicates their quality 
(here balls are used). Your team will be affected (skill, strength, 
exhaustion, etc) according to the speciality of the chosen training camp.

The costs depend on the size of your squad (players on the transfer list
do not attend) as well as the type of camp.

Training camps represent a successful method of improving the strength
of your team. When the players are home again aftervisiting one of the 
eight camps, the difference should be immediately apparent on the 'Strength
chart' (see also 2.3.2, g-i, Strength charts). However, you should bear in
mind that a stay at a training camp could waste the players' energy
(depending on the type of camp!).

--> F) Scorer Table (fig. 5)

This item was inserted to draw attention to the most successful scorers in
the league. After the player's name and club you'll find the number of goals
he has scored so far in the league (cup matches are not included). Next on
the right, you can see how many goals he scored per match.

Below are two buttons, enabling you to toggle between "League" and
"Player". In the first mode all the league scorers are listed, whilst 
in the second the computer takes only the top scorers of each Manager's 
team into account, so that they can make a straight comparison.

If one of your players is top scorer at end of a season, you'll be awarded
a cash prize.

2.3.5) DISK & MISCELLANEOUS MAIN MENU ITEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As soon as you activate Disk & Miscellaneous, the following sub-menu
options will appear:

a) Loading a game

b) Saving a game

Both items are for loading/saving current games.

The appropriate window (or icon) allows you to use several devices (e .g.
diskdrives, hard disk, RAM disk). THE MANAGER automatically recognises
all of them and displays them as the lower six buttons.

7th button, Delete By using this button, you can delete a
match you no longer need. Just click on
the appropriate game and then click on
Delete.

8th button, Root Dir. With this button you can change the
current directory. For example, if you
are in the directory DF0: currentgame,
and click on Root Dlr, you'll now be in
the directory "DF0:".


The colours of the file icons in the top part of the window represent the
following:

dark blue   Directory
light blue  File
orange      THE MANAGER

THE MANAGER Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When there are more entries than can be shown on one page, use the
button on the right to go to pages 2 and 3.

You go into a sub-directory (shown in dark blue at the top of the window)
by clicking on it. You can Load/Save either by entering the name (click on
the space next to 'Filename', then type it in) or double-click on one of 
the file-names in the window).

A MANAGER game always has the suffix ".MAN". The program will
automatically add this for you. When saving a game, you'll need Disk 2 of
THE MANAGER (unlock it first).

IMPORTANT NOTICE!

Please make copies of the three disks before you start playing.
Remember to use the copies - save the originals and keep them for
future reference!

THE MANAGER has an in-built security system: i.e., you are not allowed
to change a saved game. Any cheating, such as copying games, manipulating
games with disk editors etc, will fail. 'Honesty is the best policy'. 
You should try to earn your success as a Manager, rather than get it by 
cheating! The Manager does an autosave every third year. The name of this 
saved game is AUTOSAVE.MAN (so don't use this name for your own saved games
and have a blank, formatted disk ready). If you are playing from hard 
disk the game will be saved there. If a program error occurs it will try 
to save the current game as ERROR.MAN. Correct saving cannot be guaranteed. 
If you wish to continue playing one of your saved games with a friend or
colleague, you'll need the original Disk 2 of THE MANAGER as well as the
floppy containing the saved match.

c) High scores (fig. 7)

A High scores table is available for the 3 Season mode.

In the Highest scores 'Hall of Fame', are the names of the best twenty
Managers who have ever played THE MANAGER.

Points are awarded according to several important categories, such as
improvement in theteam, cup successes, league position, financial 
situation, etc. The name of the Manager, his club and their score are 
saved in the High scores table. In addition, the number of championships, 
FA Cup victories and European Cup wins are shown in brackets after the 
scores.

There are separate Highest scores tables for the three modes, as there
are different start conditions for each mode.

All modes are sub-divided into levels 1-5, so you'll have 18 separate
High Score tables.

You can even clear these tables by deleting the corresponding file on
Disk 2 (see also 2.3.5, Disk). The names of the High Scores tables have the
following meaning:

	HlGH.xy

	"x" = 1 for 1 Season mode, 3 for 3
	Season mode, 0 for continuous mode.
	"y" = level (0 - 5)

Caution: Deleting this file will irretrievably destroy all the records
         achieved so far!

d) Settings (fig. 7)

This menu item helps you to choose a variety of settings that will allow 
you to switch most of the available information displays on or off at will. 
For example, you probably won't be interested in the state of the 1st 
and 2nd Division as long as your club is only in the 3rd Division. If so, 
you simply 'switch off' the display of the half-time results, full-time 
results and league tables of those divisions.

Furthermore you have the possibility of deciding whether you would like
to watch animated highlights (instead of just an announcement), or a
display of FA Cup matches, European Cup matches and replays. Although
if your team is taking part in any of these matches, that game will 
always be shown, no matter what the setting is.

'News' switches the newspaper report at the end of each match on or
off. 'Fading' refers to the transitions when transferring to a 
different screen.

Fade in means that fading in or out is occurring, Fade out switches off the
screen for a while between menu items and then on again.

At the lower right of the window you can continuously vary the speed of
the game. In very thrilling matches, for example, you may wish to choose
a slower game. On the upper left side of the window appears the year when
the game finishes, so you can tell the game mode. The selected mode is
also indicated here: '0 - 5' gives the level, 'NEV' indicates the continuous
game mode.

e) New Manager (fig. 7)

This item allows you to welcome a new Manager later in the game. He is
entered in the same way as described in 2. 1, Start Selection. There is only
one handicap for the new Manager - the newcomer is initially not allowed
to participate in Cup matches.

2.3.6) QUIT GAME (SEE ALSO FIG. 2 ON PAGE 12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Right-click on this item and you will be asked to confirm that you 
want to quit.
If you do, you will be released once more into the grey, dreary, every-day
world you inhabited before THE MANAGER existed...

2.4) IT'S MATCH DAY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When all Managers have finished their turn, the match day (League or FA
Cup) will follow.

If one of the Managers' teams is taking part in a match, the relevant
encounter will be shown 'live'. If not, the program continues with the 
first Manager's menu options (e.g. after a match day for the 2nd or 3rd 
Divisions in the 1 Season mode, when 1 st Division teams have a day off).

For each match in which a Manager is involved an electronic display
appears on screen with the names and logos of both sides, as well as other
current information. This would include the number of yellow and red cards,
players' injuries, selected players and the number of scoring chances. If 
the clubs of two Managers are playing against each other, this 
information will appear for both teams, with the home team on the left and 
the away team on the right. In the lower left corner of this display board 
you'll see the number of spectators, if the Manager's team is playing at 
home. If the number of the crowd is given in red, you have a full house.

NOTICE: If you've decided to watch the animated games, you can find
out the name of the designer of each animation by clicking the right mouse
button after the final whistle.

Substitions or tactical changes are possible by clicking on the logo of
your club.

You now have the opportunity to position or reposition players by
clicking the pitch icon on the right-hand side of the screen (see also 2.3.3
a, Position Players). Similarly, you can vary your team's dedication by
clicking the appropriate bar. These are sensible measures to take when
you're down by a narrow margin before the final whistle and staking
everything on more offensive tactics (but, as in real life, there's a certain
risk...) On the other hand you can, of course, decide to strengthen your
defence in the hope of retaining your lead until the end of the match.

A further possibility of intervening in your team's game is provided when
you substitute a player. You do this as follows: first of all, click on the player
to be substituted. He'll now be marked as a substitute. Then click on the
player on the substitutes' bench who will replace the one in the team. He
is now marked 'selected'. To position him correctly, click on the pitch icon
(third button) and assign him his place on the field.

In accordance with Football Association laws, only one goalkeeper and
two other players may be substituted.

NB: "AS" (Automatic Selection) can't be chosen during the match!

During the match you will be kept informed about scored goals, yellow
or red cards as well as players' injuries that prevent you from 
continuing the game.

If a player is injured, the program will automatically return to the
'substitution screen' giving you the possibility of replacing him 
immediately. If a player has been given his fourth yellow card 
(disqualifying him from the next match), it will be shown by a 
'right arrow' in the message box.

After 45 minutes the half-time scores are displayed. At the end of the
match you see the final results of your division as well as the current 
league table.

2.5) NEWSPAPER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After each day's play you will see headlines from the Sports section of your
local paper, commenting on your team's performance. The players will also
be assessed, with marks ranging from 1 (excellent) to 6 (poor).


3) FURTHER SPECIALITIES AND FEATURES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a very special feature, the program will supply you with lots of 
information about all the English clubs and teams, at all stages during 
the game.

a) Team info
-------------
Information on a certain team is always available when the name of the 
club is highlighted (e.g. in the score-table, programme, Cup matches, not
including the Historical league table).

Left-click on the club's name and you will now see an amazing screen,
showing:

Position and current division of the team

Home/away results as well as the results of the past eight matches

Average goals scored/conceded per match Best Worst result

Highest score/worst defeat

Results of the last three home and away matches with details of the 
opponent.

Points the club has scored so far in the League table

In the item, Runs, you are presented with especially valuable statistics;
e.g.: '3 matches in a row with no goals conceded'; or: '438 matches in 
a row not won at home'.

All data in this window refer to either home or away matches of the club
in question. This depends on whether the team is listed as home or away
on the screen of your present menu item.

For example: in the item schedule, if you click on the first club in 
the line 'Manchester United vs Arsenal', the information in the Team 
info window will refer only to the home statistics of Manchester United.

If you go into Team info whilst in the league table, you'll get all the
required information (home, away, total) for your team.

So it is guaranteed that you'll always get the best and most useful
information.

If you choose the button Rest of Season, your  club's remaining opponents
are shown in chronological order. After their name, and whether
These messages are extremely useful for your tactics in the current round.
You can, for example, ease off on the training of the team, let 
someone relax or have a different line-up if you are in the UEFA Cup and 
the championship is along way off.

d) Messages

At the beginning of each round, the computer gives you the latest news
about your team on:

* Players injured during training

* Bids for your players by other clubs

 * Offers from your own players to extend their contracts on
   the same terms as before.

  * Notice given by your own players thay they wish to end
    their contracts.

Renovation of the stadium completed/Hooligans in the
stadium

The latest news will be displayed in the top line of the message window.

Previous reports can be seen by using the arrow icons.

e) Cancelled matches
---------------------
Occasionally matches are cancelled, particularly in winter. This is 
indicated in the Schedule, where, instead of a result, you find the new 
date of the postponed match.

If your team is lining up for a postponed match, this is displayed in the
main menu. You can find out who your opponent is as follows: look in the
item Match Schedule for the date of the rescheduled match. You can also
trace your opponent using Team info.

f) FA Cup
----------
Thirty-two teams qualify for the first round of the Cup in THE MANAGER.
If a match is drawn after 90 minutes, there are 2 periods of extra time, 
each lasting 15 minutes. After extra time, if the match is still 
undecided, you'll go for penalties.

The rules are as follows: each team competes with five players, who
shoot alternately.

If there's still a draw after that, one more player from each team 
carries on the attempt until one of the opponents wastes his penalty kick 
and the other converts it into a goal.

You can experience the FA Cup Draw 'live' on screen (but be careful,
the suspense can reach dangerous levels!) The first draw is made as soon
as your game starts. After that, it follows each FA Cup day.

A 3rd Division team always hosts a match when playing a 1 st Division, n
club.

The income from a Cup match will be equally distributed between the
two parties.

g) European Cups
-----------------
There are three different European Cups:

Championship Cup

Cup-winners' Cup

UEFA Cup

In contrast to the FA Cup, there are first and second leg games in the
European Cup. If the results are equal (e.g., first leg: won 2-1; second 
leg: after 90 minutes 2-1 for the opposing side) there will be extra time.

If after 120 minutes the score remains the same, you go for a penalty
shoot-out (see also FA Cup).

If the score is level after the two matches, the decision will be based on
the number of away goals scored.

For example: If you win the first round 3-1 (at home) and lose 0-2 away,
you are out of the Cup, because the opposing team scored one goal on
foreign soil.

The individual strengths of the European Cup teams are based closely
on the real teams - for example, it is much easier to defeat Malta's
Cupwinner than AC Milan.

The European Cup, like the FA Cup, provides a welcome source of
income for the Manager, since it attracts large numbers of spectators. This
naturally has a positive effect on your financial situation...

h) Income/Expenses
-------------------
Monthly income and expenses are added to, or deducted from, your
account on the last day of the month. There will be a temporary increase in
your account balance during the course of the month, owing to spectator
admission charges. But this is often deceptive, and is evened out again
after the end of month when the expenditure is deducted.

4) END OF SEASON
-----------------

a) League Position

First of all you'll learn the league position of your team and 
its division, as well as special events, which may be any of the 
following:

Promotion/Relegation

Licence revoked (either because of debts of more than
£500,000 or relegation from the 3rd Division. Both events
lead to a new game with œ125,000 in the bank).

You won the championship (cash prize)

One of your players is top-scorer (cash prize)

Promotion of a player from your youth team

b) Retirements
---------------
After you have pressed the left mouse button, the time arrives at last 
to say Farewell to those players who have formally announced their 
retirement.
These players, leaving the club because of advancing years, are indicated
one after another.

If you should be lucky enough not to have any elderly players in your
squad, THE MANAGER skips the item Retirements.

c) Contract negotiations
-------------------------
At the end of the season there are again talks with those players whose
contracts have ended. This is the last chance for you to keep the player in
your squad. If your offer is not accepted, the player leaves your club, and
you get only a very modest transfer fee for him.

If no contracts are about to expire, THE MANAGER leaves out the item
Contract negotiations, too.

5) COMMENTS

5.1) A FEW COMMENTS ON THE CALCULATIONS
----------------------------------------
The excellent analysis capability of THE MANAGER provides detailed and
precise calculations. So, the individual 'value' of a player on the 
transfer list, for example, depends on various factors, such as fitness, 
skill, form, age, goals scored, matches completed, yellow/red cards etc.

Of course, there is also a random factor, but it reflects the trials and
tribulations of real life. The success of a team depends largely on the
qualities of the Manager.

We are proud to claim that the difficulty level has been finely tuned by
months of 'test matches'. This game is very addictive and is sure to retain
your interest for avery long period of time.
