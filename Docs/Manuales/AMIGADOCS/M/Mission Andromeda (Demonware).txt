The Game:  Goal - trying to save human race by getting to last planet
capable of sustaining life.  Level 1 appears to be hardest; try to avoid
ships attacking you but also keep firing lasers as you will hit those ships
long distance.  If enemy crashes into you, you die. Their shots weaken your
shields.  To gain shield strength, LISTEN for WHISTLE then shoot
sphere-like object which will give you more shield power AS you kill enemy
or additional fire power.  Level 1 ends with Main ship attacking you from
RIGHT of screen. Rock from left to right to avoid it while firing at it. 
Amount of hits to destroy it depends on how many of the enemy you killed to
start.
