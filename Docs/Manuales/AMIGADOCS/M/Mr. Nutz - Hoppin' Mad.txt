                  FULL DOCS FOR MR.NUTZ

THE MAP

THE MAP SHOWS PEANUT PLANET,MR.NUTZ'S HOLIDAY HOME.THE BACKGROUND
SHOWS THE CONTINENTS OF THE PLANET AND FOCUSES ON MR.NUTZ'S ISLAND.
MR NUTZ MOVES ON THE PATHS THAT CAN BE FOUND EVERYWHERE ON THE ISLANDS.
TO REACH A DIFFERENT ISLAND HE CAN USE RAFTS AND TRANSPORTERS.
SOME OF THE TRANSPORTERS HAVE BEEN DEACTIVATED BY THE CHICKENS,
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO ACTIVATE THEM DURING THE GAME.
ON EACH CONTINENT THERE ARE 5 IMPORTANT BASES.
MR.NUTZ MUST CHASE AWAY THE CHICKENS FROM THESE BASES.
AN IMPORTANT BASE CAN BE RECOGNIZED BY A RED
PENNANT OR A CAVE ENTRANCE.
BLUE PENNANTS MARK LESS IMPORTANT BASES.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLEAR THE CHICKENS FROM THEM.
TO ENTER A BASE SIMPLY WALK INTO A CAVE ENTRANCE 
OR PUSH THE FIRE BUTTON WHEN STANDING NEXT TO A PENNANT.
THERE IS ALSO ONE HUGE TECHNO CITY ON EVERY CONTINENT.
THIS TECHNO CITY IS PROTECTED BY A BIG GATE WHICH WILL NOT OPEN BEFORE YOU
SUCCEED IN LIBERATING ALL IMPORTANT BASES.
THE EXIT OF A TECHNO CITY LEADS TO A TUNNEL SYSTEM,
BRINGING YOU TO THE VACUUM MACHINE.
THERE YOU WILL HAVE TO DEFEAT A TRULY TOUGH END-OF-LEVEL SENTRY.
DESTROYING THIS SENTRY WILL BRING YOU AUTOMATICALLY TO 
THE NEXT CONTINENT AND THE SURVIVING CHICKENS WILL ALSO
FLEE THERE FROM THE ONE YOU'RE CURRENTLY ON.
IT'S YOUR TASK TO FREE ALL FOUR CONTINENTS AND TO SAVE THE PLANET.
ON THE MAP MR.NUTZ WILL TALK WITH MANY INHABITANTS,
SOME OF THEM GIVING USEFUL HINTS.
BUT YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL BECAUSE MANY OF THEM,
ESPECIALLY CHICKENS,WILL TELL YOU LIES!

CHESTS

CHESTS WITH USEFUL THINGS INSIDE THEM CAN BE FOUND EVERYWHERE ON
THE ISLANDS.OFTEN THE CHICKENS HIDE TREASURES IN THEM.
SOMETIMES THEY CONTAIN MESSAGES FROM THE SEAGULL.

ROCKS

THERE ARE MANY ROCKS BLOCKING THE PATHS.THE CHICKENS HAVE PUT
THEM THERE IN ORDER TO STOP MR.NUTZ.
YOU CAN BLOW UP THESE ROCKS WITH A BOMB BY SIMPLY
PUSHING THE FIRE BUTTON WHEN STANDING IN FRONT OF A ROCK
(OF COURSE THAT WON'T WORK IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BOMBS LEFT!)

TRANSPORTERS

TRANSPORTERS CAN BE USED TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES IN SHORT
TIME. UNFORTUNATELY THE CHICKENS HAVE DEACTIVATED MANY OF THEM,AND
THESE ARE MARKED WITH A RED DOT.
THE TRANSPORTERS LEAD FROM THE TRANSPORTER CONTROL
AREA TO THE DIFFERENT BASES AND VICE VERSA,
AND REMAIN DEACTIVATED UNTIL YOU HAVE LIBERATED ALL THE BASES ON THE CONTINENT.
THERE ARE THE ORDINARY GREY TRANSPORTERS AND COLOURED ONES 
THAT CAN BEAM YOU FROM CONTINENT TO CONTINENT.
THE INTERCONTINENTAL TRANSPORTERS OPEN WHENEVER YOU FREE A
CONTINENT. THE RED TRANSPORTERS ARE USED BY THE PEANUT PLANET SECURITY SERVICE.

RAFTS

MANY OF THE ISLANDS ARE CONNECTED WITH RAFTS.USE THE LANDING
STAGES TO TRAVEL WITH ONE OF THEM.
THE RAFTS MAKE THEIR WAY FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND AUTOMATICALLY.

MUSHROOMS

THERE ARE SEVERAL RED MUSHROOMS ON THE ISLANDS.SIMPLY JUMP ON
THEM TO GAIN HEIGHT.

THE STATUS DISPLAY

DURING THE GAME THERE IS A STATUS DISPLAY AT THE CORNER OF THE
SCREEN. THE NUMBER ON THE TOP LEFT INFORMS YOU HOW MANY LIFES MR.NUTZ HAS LEFT.
TO THE RIGHT OF THAT YOU CAN SEE THE CURRENT NUMBER OF CONTINUES.
(IF YOU LOSE ALL YOUR LIFES YOU CAN USE A CONTINUE TO HAVE ANOTHER TRY.)
BELOW YOU CAN SEE MR.NUTZ'S HIT POINTS. THE NUMBERS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN
STAND FOR THE NUMBER OF GEMS AND THE NUMBER OF BOMBS MR.NUTZ IS CURRENTLY CARRYING.
THERE IS ONE ITEM ON EVERY ISLAND THAT ENHANCES MR.NUTZ'S SKILLS.
THE BOTTOM LINE SHOWS WHICH OF THE DIFFERENT SKILLS MR.NUTZ OWNS:

FEATHER        - THE FEATHER MEANS THAT MR.NUTZ CAN FLY.A CROSSED OUT
                 FEATHER MEANS THAT MR.NUTZ CAN'T FLY BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH HITPOINTS.
                 (YOU NEED AT LEAST FIVE HIT POINTS.)

DIVING GOGGLES - WITH THE DIVING GOGGLES YOU CAN STAY UNDERWATER AS LONG AS
                 YOU WISH WITHOUT THEM MR.NUTZ WILL TURN BLUE AFTER A WHILE.
                 WHEN HE DOES,YOU MUST BRING HIM OUT OF THE WATER TO
                 CATCH HIS BREATH OR HE WILL START TO LOSE HITPOINTS.
                 THE FLASH MEANS MR.NUTZ CAN TURN HIMSELF INTO A BOLT OF LIGHTNING.
                 THE NUMBER APPEARING INSTEAD OF THE SYMBOL INFORMS YOU HOW MANY SPELLS 
                 YOU HAVE GOT LEFT.
                 PRESS THE SPACE BAR TO CAST A FLASH SPELL.
                 NOW MR.NUTZ IS INVULNERABLE AND HE'S A DEADLY THREAT TO EVERY
                 CHICKEN (HE CAN EVEN DESTROY DOORS.)    

FIST           - THE FIST GIVES MR.NUTZ THE ABILITY OF DEFEATING SMALL AND MEDIUM
                 ENEMIES DURING A JUMP.HOLD THE FIRE BUTTON AND PUSH THE JOYSTICK DOWN                                       WHILE THE MAP IS ACTIVE YOU ALSO CAN SEE THE NUMBER OF STARS YOU OWN.

JUMP,YOU'LL HAVE
TO PUSH THE FIRE BUTTON(B)ON THE JOYPAD OR UP WHEN USING A
JOYSTICK.TO
DEFEAT YOUR ENEMIES SIMPLY JUMP UPON THEM.(GUESS WHY MR.NUTZ IS
SO STRONG?
RIGHT! BECAUSE OF ALL THE CURD CHEESE TURNOVERS...MAYBE HE WILL
TELL YOU A
LITTLE MORE ABOUT IT LATER ON.)WHEN AN ENEMY HITS MR.NUTZ HE WILL
LOSE ONE
HITPOINT.THE HITPOINT IS THEN SET FREE AND BOUNCES AROUND.YOU CAN
TRY CATCH
IT AGAIN.IF AN ENEMY HITS MR.NUTZ AND HE HAS NO HITPOINTS HE'LL
LOSE ONE
LIFE.IF YOU LOSE ALL YOUR LIFES YOU CAN USE A CONTINUE OR THE

MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE ALL THE DEFEATED
CHICKENS FROM

CHESTS AND
CHANDELIERS IN ORDER TO FIND ALL THE VALUABLE TREASURES.

CHICKENS
HERE HAVE HIDDEN THERE TREASURES IN OLD TOTEM POLES,CARVED OUT OF
CHERRY
WOOD.
