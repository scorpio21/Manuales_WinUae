                            (AMIGA  VERSION)


GAME PLAY:

The object of the game is to search the tunnels and collect items that you
need to get off the planet. These items have names like Photon device. You
will be able to tell which are the technical items. There are some
geometric shapes that are actually keys. If you have a certain shape on you,
you will be able to go through doors that were locked to you before. When
you pick "keys" up the game does not tell you it a key. In order to enter
the tunnels you must find an elevator. I have found several and will tell
you where one is just to get you started and to show you what they look like.
(An elevator is located at 09-05 on the grid.) When you go down in an
elevator you will always end up in an underground hanger. You will save a
hell of alot of time if you map the tunnels underground using door locations
and room colors to identify the different rooms and how they interconnect.
While underground you will run across three types of doors in addition to
the different shaped doors. A door with an "X" on it is some kind of
teleportation device. (I never could figure out a pattern to were it took
me.) If the elevator turns black it is will only go between two locations,
if it turns blue it can go to several different places. A door with an "/"
on it will take you to the same place every time. Be warned there is no way
back from this place (at least that I have found) and I spent along time
walking the surface to get back to my space craft. The third type of door is
simply a blank door that will take you into the next room. When you think
you have everything you need enter your craft and fly to the white dot in
the sky. You will find an orbiting station, NOW, I don't know what to do when
you get to the orbiting station because I didn't save the game and I
accidently walked off the platform (try this after you save the game...its a
great fall), so I haven't escaped from the planet yet. But this is
the basic idea. Also, as you collect items your craft will fly faster and
faster until you have the ability to get to the orbiting platform. The
ground speed of your craft will also increase. Well, I just that's enough
about the game except the controls.

                             __________
COMPASS DIRECTIONS:          | A - B  |
                             |--------|
                             |LOCATION|
                             |--------|


                       (-B)
                        00
                         |
             (-A) 270 ---|--- 90 (+A)
                         |
                        180
                        (+B)


              ALL NUMBERS ARE DEGREES


In other words, if you wanted to reduce the number in the "A" position, you
would change your compass heading to 270 degrees. Likewise to increase the
number in the "B" position you would change the compass to a 180 degree
heading. Of course changing the heading to lets say 45 degrees would
increase the "A" number while decreasing the "B" number. The whole map is
one giant grid so you should soon be able to go exactly where you want to
go.



COMBAT:

If you start shooting up the buildings on the surface you will soon be
attacked by either or both sides in the war (depends on whose buildings you
are shooting up). The best combat strategy I have found is, as soon as the
red light above your COMPASS comes on (indicating an attack) press the
spacebar to freeze your craft. Start rotating around and look for a moving
white dot, this will be the attacking ship. Try to pick him off as he goes
by. They are very good and don't often miss, so don't miss on the first
shot. If you do miss, try hitting "0"  which will quickly move you. Then hit
the space bar again and rotate to get another shot at the attacking craft.
