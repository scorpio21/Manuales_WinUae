THE HISTORY OF THE QUEST.
-------------------------
A VERY SACRED TIME IS UPON THE PEOPLE.A TIME THAT DESCENDS ONCE EVERY 1000
YEARS.

AS THE DRUIDS WILL BE ONLY TO HAPPY TO TELL YOU,THIS IS THE SEASON OF THE
MOONSTONES! DANU,THE SPIRIT OF THE MOON,HAS TURNED HIS ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE
ACTIVITIES OF THE COSMOS TO THOSE OF THE EARTH. IT IS DURING SUCH A TIME THAT
THE GODS BESTOW A FABULOUS GIFT TO THE GREATEST WARRIOR IN THE LAND;A GIFT OF
ULTIMATE POWER!.BUT FIRST SUCH A WARRIOR WOULD HAVE TO PROVE HIMSELF.

THUS,THE FIRST WARRIOR TO COMPLETE `THE QUEST OF THE MOONSTONES` WILL RECIEVE
THIS GREAT BLESSING.BUT ANY WARRIOR CONSIDERING SUCH A QUEST MUST BE PREPARED
TO WANDER THE SURROUNDING LAND,ENDURING HARDSHIPS,RISKING LIFE AND LIMB ALL THE
WHILE.

THE LAND COMPRISES OF 4 VAST TERRITORIES.TO THE NORTHEAST ARE THE NORTHEN
WASTELANDS,HOME TO THE GIANT BALOKS THAT INHABIT THIS GREAT ROCKY COUNTRY. TO
THE NORTHWEST ARE THE MISTY MOORS,WITH THEIR GREAT TRIBES OF VICIOUS TROGGS.
SOUTHWEST LIES THE GREAT FOREST,INFESTED WITH CUNNING RATMEN.AND FINALLY TO THE
SOUTHEAST YOU WILL DISCOVER THE WETLANDS,WHERE HALF PLANT,HALF HUMANOID MUDMEN
STALK HUMAN PREY INSIDE THEIR VAST SWAMP.

OVER ALL THESE TERRITORIES THE GREAT DRAGON ROAMS HIGH IN THE SKY,SEARCHING
LIKE A HAWK FOR THE NEXT TRAVELLER TO EAT OR PLUNDER.

HIDDEN DEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 4 TERRITORIES,AT THE VERY HEART OF THE
LAND,LIES THE MOST SACRED OF PLACES,`THE VALLEY OF THE GODS`,WHEREIN CAN BE
FOUND THE SACRED MOONSTONES.

TO COMPLETE A QUEST,YOU WILL HAVE TO ASSUME THE ARMS AND ARMOUR OF A NIGHT.
THEN YOU MUST EXPLORE ALL THE LANDS THAT SURROUND YOU TO FIND THE 4 KEYS WHICH
WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS INTO THE VALLEY OF THE GODS.

ALONG THE WAY YOU WILL HAVE TO DEFEAT MANY CREATURES AND RETAIN THEIR GOLD AND
MAGIC TREASURES TO INCREASE YOUR STRENGTH SO THAT YOU MIGHT SURVIVE THE PERILS
OF THE SHADOWY HALF WORLD THAT LIES WITHIN.ONCE THE KEYS ARE FOUND,YOU WILL
THEN MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE VALLEY TO FIND THE SACRED MOONSTONE,FIGHTING HORRIBLE
DEMONS OF IMMENSE POWER AND STRENGTH.

ONCE A MOONSTONE IS AQUIRED,YOU MUST THEN RACE TO STONEHENGE TO PRESENT THE
FRUIT OF YOUR QUEST TO THE GREAT MOON GOD DANU,HOWEVER,THERE ARE 4 POSSIBLE
MOONSTONES THAT ARE EACH KEYED TO A DIFFERENT PHASE OF THE MOON,,SO YOU WILL
HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT MOON PHASE BEFORE YOU MAY COMPLETE YOUR QUEST.

BUT WAIT!.DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE ALONE IN YOUR QUEST?-OF COURSE NOT!.ALL
THE GREAT KNIGHTS OF THE LAND KNOW OF THIS MOST SACRED OF EVENTS. SO THERE WILL
BE OTHER GREAT WARRIORS LOOKING TO BE THE FIRST TO COMPLETE THE QUEST.YOU WILL
CERTAINLY HAVE TO DO BATTLE WITH MANY MIGHTY WARRIORS BEFORE YOUR QUEST IS
DONE.

MOREOVER,YOU ARE BOUND TO ENCOUNTER THE DREADED BLACK KNIGHTS,WHO WANDER THE
LAND TRYING TO CONVINCE ANY WHO WILL LISTEN THAT THE DRUIDS ARE
HERETICS,SLAYING ANY WHO DO NOT. THEY PARTICULARY HATE THE QUEST OF THE
`MOONSTONES`AND WILL TRACK DOWN ANY PARTICIPTE,ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE CLOSE TO
COMPLETING THE QUEST!. THESE KNIGHTS ARE RENOWNED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO RASIE
THEIR SKILLS DURING COMBAT.THEY ARE NEVER BEATEN UNTIL THEY ARE SLAIN!!!

AFTER LONG,CAREFUL THOUGHT YOU DECIDE TO SURRENDER TO THE FATES AND THE
STRENGTH OF YOUR METAL.DONNING YOUR WARMEST CLOTHING AND GRABBING YOUR TRUSTY
SWORD AND ARMOUR YOU SET OFF,SWEARING TO BE FIRST TO COMPLETE THE QUEST OR TO
DIE TRYING;FOR NONE CAN RESIST THE PULL OF THE MOONSTONES!!!!!!.

VILLAGE AND YOU HAVE LESS THAN 3 LIFE POINTS,THEN YOUR VILLAGE DRUIDS WILL HEAL
YOU FOR FREE. THE LAST POSSIBLE WAY OF RAISING LIFE POINTS IS TO OFFER A MAGIC
ITEM TO DANU AT STONEHENGE.LIFE POINTS ARE DIVIDED UP INTO HIT POINTS.IF DURING
A COMBAT YOUR CURRENT HIT POINTS ARE REDUCED TO 0 YOU WILL LOSE THE COMBAT AND
A LIFE POINT.HIT POINTS CAN BE HEALED AT THE HEALER OR THROUGH HEALING
POTIONS.KNIGHTS ALSO HEAL NATURALLY EACH DAY THAT IS PASSED.

MONSTERS.
---------
THE TROGGS.
ARE A TERRIBLE HUMANOID RACE THAT EXIST IN ALL FOUR TERRITORIES.THEY
ARE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT WITH A SOCIETY VERY SIMILAR TO HUMANS,WHOM THEY HATE
WITH A BURNING DESIRE FOR FORCING THEM THEM TO LIVE IN PLACES DEEMED UNFIT FOR
HUMANS.THEY USE HAMMERS,AXES  AND SPEARS IN COMBAT AND HAVE TERRIBLE WAR BEASTS
THAT THEY`VE RAISED ON HUMAN FLESH.THE TRIBES THAT EXISTS IN THE MISTY MOORS
ARE EXCEPTIONALLY VICIOUS AND RENOWNED FOR THEIR STRENGTH AND SKILL IN COMBAT.

RATMEN.
THE RATMEN ARE SMALL,CARNIVEROUS RACE THAT EXIST IN THE TREES OF THE GREAT
FOREST.THEY ARE NOT VERY STRONG,BUT ARE ALWAYS FOUND TOGETHER IN LARGE NUMBERS
AND ARE EXCEEDINGLY AGILE.THEY ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS `MOON DEVILS` BECAUSE
THEY SEEM TO GROW STRONGER AS THE MOON WAXES.IT IS ALSO KNOWN THAT THESE LITTLE
CREATURES CARRY A DEADLY DISEASE AND IF YOU ARE BITTEN BY ONE YOU MUST BE
QUICKLY HEALED BY THE `HEALER` OR DRINK A HEALING POTION,OR YOU WILL SURELY
PERISH AND FAIL IN YOUR QUEST.

MUDMEN.
THIS STRANGE RACE THAT INFESTS THE WETLANDS SEEMS MORE LIKE A COLONY OF
INTELLIGENT PLANT LIFE FOUND IN THE MUD THAN AN ACTUAL ANIMAL,BUT SAGES SAY
MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED.THEY ARE HARD TO SEE AS THEY JUST APPEAR TO RISE OUT OF
THE MUD,OVERPOWER A KNIGHT AND DRAG HIM DOWN INTO THE MUD TO DO UNSPEAKABLE
THINGS TO HIM.

DRAGONS.
DRAGONS ARE HUGE,FLYING AND BREATHING LIZARDS.THEY ARE CRUEL AND GREEDY BY
NATURE AND FLY AROUND THE 4 TERRITORIES LOOKING FOR THE NEXT TRAVELLER TO SLAY
AND PLUNDER.DRAGONS ARE EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS IN COMBAT AND DIFFICULT TO
SLAY.IF A DRAGON DEFEATS A KNIGHT,HE WILL TAKE ALL HIS GOLD PIECES AND ONE
MAGIC OBJECT(UNLESS HE REDUCES THE KNIGHT TO 0 LIVES;THEN HE TAKES
EVERYTHING).HOWEVER,WHOEVER SLAYS A DRAGON WILL TAKE OVER ITS ACCUMALTED WEALTH
AND MAGIC OBJECTS.

BALOKS
BALOKS ARE VICIOUS HUMANOIDS WITH HUGE JAWS,LONG TEETH AND POWERFUL
LIMBS.LEGEND HAS IT THAT `MATH` MAGICALLY ENGINEERED THESE BEASTS IN HIS YOUTH
TO ACT AS GUARDS FOR HIS TOWER,BUT THE EXPERIMENT FAILED AND THEY HAVE SINCE
ESCAPED AND MULTIPLIED.THEY NOW STALK THE NORTHERN WASTELANDS IN SEARCH OF PREY
AND ARE ONE OF THE MOST FEARED OF CREATURES.

TROLLS.
TROLLS ARE VICIOUS CREATURES THAT FEED ON HUMAN FLESH.THEY ARE LARGE,HAIRLESS
HUMANOIDS THAT FIGHT WITH HUGE CLUBS CABABLE OF STRIKING DOWN THE MIGHTIEST
WARRIOR WITH ONE BLOW.THESE LEGENDARY CREATURES ARE GREATLY FEARED THROUGH OUT
THE LAND.

BLACK KNIGHTS.
THESE ROGUE KNIGHTS SERVE A RELIGIOUS SECT CALLED `THE DARK HALL OF PURITY`

TERRITORIES SEARCHING  FOR THE FOLLOWERS OF THE DRUIDS WHO ARE TRYING TO AQUIRE
THE MOONSTONES,IN ORDER TO PREVENT THEM FROM COMPLETING THEIR QUESTS.THE BLACK
KNIGHTS HAVE AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO GROW MORE SKILLED IN COMBAT AND STRENGTH
DURING AN ENCOUNTER.

GUARDIANS.
THE VALLEY OF THE GODS IS GUARDED BY SINISTER DEMONS.ONLY THE BEST WARRIORS IN
THE LAND WILL EVER STAND A CHANCE AGAINST A GUARDIAN.THEY CAN DRAIN POINTS FROM
A WARRIORS ABILITIES AND WHEN THEY DEFEAT YOU IN COMBAT,THEY TAKE 3 LIVES
INSTEAD OF 1.IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU MUST POSSESS THE BEST ARMOUR BEFORE YOU
