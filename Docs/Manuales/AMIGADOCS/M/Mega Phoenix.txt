MEGAPHOENIX
-----------

1.THE PHOENIX WAVES.
 Destroy a couple of flocks of Phoenix.Some of them will leave the formation
and attack your ship directly, either like kamikazes or shooting at you with
laser weapons.

2.THE KILLING EGGS.
 The murderous eggs turn into winged ships that shoot at you. Only their bo-
dies are vulnerable. Their wings grow in again every time you destroy them.

3.THE MEGAPHOENIX.
 An enormous metallic bird will shoot eggs that explode when they come near
your ship. It's only weak spot is 'below the belt'. Your scoreboard indica-
tes how many laser discharges are needed on target to destroy this beast.
When it is destroyed you will receive a load of weapons for your ship.

4.THE MOTHER SPACESHIP.
 Evil lurks within this ship. By destroying it you will bring a legion of
cosmic birds to their end. Phoenix fighters guard the ship, it has plenty
of guns and barrier that protects Orejut, the brain within the ship.
