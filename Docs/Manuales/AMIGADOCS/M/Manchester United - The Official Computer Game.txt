of figures and press the left mouse button twice you will then select either
to view the transfer list of players available or scout for a player.  The 
transfer list is the list of players currently being circulated by their
clubs that are available for transfer this information is being circulated
to all clubs not just UNITED.  The player has a club valuation which is based
on his actual player ratings.  If you wish to try and buy a player at the

valuation up or dwon in tens of thousands use the mouse cursor.  Once you have

buying a player then that player is immediatley included in the first team
squad.  If you elect to scout for a player the computer will then display

his derisory (in your view) offer.  Selling players will generate funds for
you to strengthen the team in other areas or simply look for a replacement.


TRAINING (Piccy of 2 players Pumping Iron!!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Training takes place on the days between matches and follows a set schedule.
As manager you are free to alter the training schedule of any or all of the
players according to their needs.

Each player is assigned training to certain aspects of the game, and may train
on any four in each week.  The manager may change either the content or the
emphasis of the training for each and every player.  Throughout the season
the players needs in training will alter as their fitness and form varies
with results.

Each session has a positive effect on the players attributes that it is
designed to affect so that over the season the benefits will show themselves
in the player ratings.  In certain circumstances, however, training can have
a negative effect, both on fitness and morale.

Heavy training also increases the risk of incurring injuries during training.

Training requires balance and thought.  Too little and the players will lose
fitness and form.  Too much and the players will be tired and injury prone.
