Miner Willy, while prospecting down Surbition way, stumbles upon an
ancient, lond forgotten mine-shaft. On further exploration, he finds
evidence of a lost civilisation far superior to our own, which used
automations to dig deep into the Earth's core to supply the essential raw
materials for their advanced industry. After centuries of peace and
prosperity, the civilisation was torn apart by war, and lapsed into a long
dark age, abandoning their industry and machines.

Nobody, however thought to tell the mine robots to stop working, and
through countless aeons they had steadily accumulated a huge stockpile of
vaulable metals and minerals, and Miner Willy realises that he now has the
opportunity to make his fortune by finding the underground store.

In order to move to the next chamber, you must collect all keys in the room
while avoiding nasties like POISONOUS PANSIES and SPIDERS and SLIME and
worst of all, MANIC MINING ROBOTS. When you have all the keys, you can
enter the portal. The game ends when you have been 'got' ot fallen heavily
three times.
