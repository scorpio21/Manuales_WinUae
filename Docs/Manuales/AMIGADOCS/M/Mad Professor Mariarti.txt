                        MAD PROFESSOR MARIARTI INSTRUCTIONS:
                        ------------------------------------

     Mad Professor Mariarti is a short sighted professor. The people who
     know him say he is a bit of an eccentric, most people say he is raving
     mad! He lives in a large rambling house, and every room is full of his
     wierd and wonderful inventions, most of which have no obvious use. One
     day he receives a letter from the Lord Mayor:

     Dear Professor Mariarti,

     I have been instructed by the town's people to write to you. They are
     worried about your inventions, I really do feel that they have a
     point. Your manic chip making machine is the last straw, we really
     cannot have manic computer chips running around the streets frightening
     the town's folk.

     I am giving you one weeks notice to close down your laboratories which
     I must point out you have not gained planning permission for. I am also
     asking the local director of the town's lunatic asylum Doctor Headbender
     to call and see you. I strongly suggest that everything is back to
     normal before he calls on you.

     P.S. That Cyboration Molecular Recalibrator you made for me is acting
     a little strangely. My wife put the dinner plates into it and they
     turned into a very expensive looking porcelain tea service. However, we
     did not have the same success with a silver bracelet, this has turned
     into yellow plastic!

     Your friend always.
     The Lord Mayor.

     Professor Mariarti must close down his five laboratories or Doctor
     Headbender takes him away and locks him in the lunatic asylum, he needs
     your help!

     On loading the game you will be presented with a screen showing five
     doors, here you can select the laboratory you wish to shut down. Simply
     stand in front of the door of your choice and jump and you will enter
     the room. The laboratories are:

     CHEMICAL RESEARCH, SPACE ROCKET DEVELOPMENT, COMPUTER SCIENCE,
     BIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AND THE MYSTERY LABORATORY.

     He can close down each laboratory in any order, but the mystery
     laboratory can only be entered when the first four have been closed down.

     Closing down the laboratory is no easy task, you must solve strange
     puzzles and avoid nasty monsters like Chip Worms, Mutant Masticaters and
     Evil Flasks, etc. Scattered around each laboratory are tokens which when
     collected can be used at the tool vending machines, one of which is
     sited within each of the first four laboratories. At the tool vending
     machine you will be allowed to buy more effective weapons depending on
     the number of tokens you have. The weapons are Spanners, Screw-drivers,
     Bolt-gun, Flame-thrower, Laser-gun and Virus-killer.

     The mutant morbid monsters that patrol the rooms can be stunned or
     destroyed by throwing or firing the tools at them. Nasties require
     multiple hits if they are to be stopped. The number of hits are
     determined by the toughness of the enemy and by which weapon you are
     using. The weakest you can have is a spanner and the most powerful is
     the laser-gun. If an enemy is stunned you may walk safely past it while
     the stars are flashing. If they are destroyed they will vanish for a few
     seconds and then reappear in a puff of smoke.

     To shut down a laboratory he must turn off the power and escape back
     to the main entrance. But before he can get to the switch various
     puzzles must be solved by using the artifacts he finds around the rooms.
     To collect an object simply touch it with the professor's feet and the
     item will eppear in the inventory window (Bottom left of screen). The
     item currently in use is depicted in the centre of the object window.

     The professor only has a limited amount of energy. This is shown by
     the bubbling flask of liquid at the bottom right of the screen. When he
     touches a monster or acid puddle, etc. this is depleted. If the liquid
     should run out then he will fall over from the lack of energy. Be
     careful where you tread because some things can deplete all his energy
     instantly. He gets five flasks of energy to aid him. The remaining
     flasks are shown as hearts on the control panel. When all the flasks
     have been used up, he is thrown in the lunatic asylum by Doctor
     Headbender.

     Keep looking at the message window, it can give you hints and clues on
     how to complete certain puzzles. And watch the professor in the action
     window because this can show you the effects of any items he collects in
     his quest.
