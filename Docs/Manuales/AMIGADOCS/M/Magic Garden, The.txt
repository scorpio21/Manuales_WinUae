 It all began when Grobble was caught red handed sabotaging the Gnome King`s
 Prize garden, arrested and sentenced to hard labour at a maximum security
 penal garden. The only means of escape was to perfect his gerdening skills
 and produce a garden which the Gnome King would be proud of.

 GARDENING IN "THE MAGIC GARDEN"
 ------------------------------
 The MAGIC GARDEN comprises a lawn,flower borders,a shed,a greenhouse,
 a vegetable patch, and old tree, a fountain,flowerbeds,a well,a bird
 table and below a maze of tunnles leading to the underground world of the
 naughty gnomes. The entire garden is affected by the unstable climate,
 which rapidly changes from cold to hot and wet to dry. Presiding over
 everything is th Gnome King.
 The lawn grows and must be moved. When mowing it is very important not to
 run over lawn creatures. To avoid this an insect repulsor is provided along
 with you lawn mower. The naughty gnomes will, if not caught, delighy in
 removing turf from the lawn, When this happens use the lawn speed provided.
 Failing to mantain the water level of the fountain will result in the fish
 escaping in search of water. They may be caught with a net and returned to
 the fountain, hurry though as failure to return them quickly will cause the
 gnome king to take action. The lawn is home to rampaging flowers who 
 previously found themseleves uncared for. It is unwise to get to close as
 they will take revenge for their predicament, a stun gun is advised. The 
 shed houses most tools of the gardeners trade. The generator powers some of
 the implements and must itself be powered by the solar panels, which will
 need to be put in place. The objects are many and varied and their uses
 must be discovered and utilised. The greenhouse is important for growing
 specialost flowers which can work wonders for the gardener. Temperatures
 of the greenhouse, along with that of the shed, must be closely monitored.
 Plant vegetable seeds in the vegetable patch, nuture the vegetable and 
 watch them spring to life. some will grow, but some will disappear. Find
 out why, Look inside the old tree to see what wonders are within. Travel
 down the well in your magic bucket. Care must be taken so the well creatures
 do not make you lose your balance and fall into the water below.
 Remember to take the key to underground passageways. Explore the underground
 maze and locate the numerous caverns, offering intriguing places to discover.
 And do not forget to take the naughty gnomes back to their home. You will
 find it easier if you check the map. It is wise to beware of the Gnome King
 who is always watching from the sky.
