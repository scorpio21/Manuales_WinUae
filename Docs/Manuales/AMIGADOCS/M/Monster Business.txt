THE STORY                                                 -------------------
---------
 
LEROY SMILED TO   HIMSELF   WHEN HE CLOSED   THE DOOR BEHIND  MR.BOB, BOSS OF
THE BIGGEST  CONSTRUCTION COMPANY IN TIN TOWN, WHO HAD JUST PAID HIM A VISIT.
LIKE MR.BOB  HAD EXPLAINED, HIS  CONSTRUCTION  WORKERS  WERE  HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH THE MAD MEANIES, NASTY LITTLE BEASTIES FROM THE BIG FOREST, THAT INVADED
ALL HIS  BUILDING  SITES, STEALING  ANYTHING  THEY  COULD  GET  THEIR  LITTLE
HANDS ON - INCLUDING THE TOOLS THE WORKERS NEEDED TO  GET  THEIR  JOBS  DONE.
THE MAD MEANIES FROM THE BIG  FOREST  USUALLY  STAYED  AWAY  FROM  TIN  TOWN;
INSTEAD, THEY   USUALLY   PREFERRED   TO   STEAL  BIRD'S  EGGS, OR  GENERALLY
BE A NUISANCE TO ALL OTHER ANIMALS IN THE  FOREST. EACH  CITY  NEAR  THE  BIG
FOREST HAD SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF  THESE  MAD  MEANIES  IN  CASE, LIKE  NOW,
THEY  SHOULD  LEAVE  THEIR   HIDING  PLACES.  LEROY  WAS  THE  BEST  OF  THIS
BEASTIE BUSTERS AROUND, AND THAT'S WHY  MR.BOB  HADN'T  THOUGHT  TWICE  ABOUT
HIRING HIM. LEROY HAD HIS WAY WITH MEANIES - LIKE NO OTHER HE COULD BLOW THEM
UP, SO  THEY  DISAPPEARED  WHILE  LEAVING  BEHIND  WHAT  THEY   HAD   STOLEN.
HE WENT OUT THE NEAREST CONSTRUCTION SITE RIGHT  AWAY.  WHEN HE  CAME  THERE,
LEROY LOOKED AT THE SKY AND DIDN'T BELIEVE HIS  EYES:  LOTS  OF  MAD  MEANIES
WERE RUNNING TO AND FROM ALL OVER THE CONSTRUCTION WORKS, STEALING  AWAY  ALL
THE TOOLS THE WORKERS NEEDED! "THERE  IS  SOME  WORK  TO  BE  DONE  HERE," HE
THOUGHT, AND GOT BLOWIN'.
 
USE YOUR JOYSTICK TO BECOME LEROY, THE  BEST  BEASTIE  BUSTER  IN  THE  LANDS
AROUND BIG FOREST, AND RID LEVEL  AFTER  OF  CONSTRUCTION  SITE  OF  THE  MAD
MEANIES THAT TRY TO STEAL AWAY ALL ITEMS  THEY  THINK  ARE  INTERESTING. UPON
HAVING BLOWN THEM AWAY, COLLECT ALL  ITEMS THEY LEAVE  BEHIND, THUS  ENABLING
THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TO GET ON WITH THEIR JOB, AND OBTAINING  POINTS THAT
WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR SCORE!
 
 
 
THE GAME
--------
 
IT IS YOUR AIM TO GET RID OF ALL MONSTERS INFESTING THE PLATFORMS. TO ACHIEVE
THIS, YOU HAVE TO BLOW UP MONSTER AND HAVE IT FLOAT OUT OF  THE SCREEN. IT IS
BETTER   AND  FASTER,  HOWEVER,  TO  PUSH  THE  MONSTERS  AS  THEY  FLOAT UP,
WHICH CAUSES THEM TO DISAPPEAR OFF THE RIGHT OR  LEFT  EDGE  OF  THE  SCREEN.
WOU WILL ALSO GET RID OF ANY MONSTERS THAT COLIDES IN THEIR FLIGHT PATH.
 
 
 
CONTROLS
--------
 
YOU WILL NEED  A  JOYSTICK. MOVE  THE  JOYSTICK  TO  THE  LEFT  OR  RIGHT  TO
MOVE  IN  THE  CORRESPONDING  DIRECTION.  TO   JUMP, MOVE  THE  UP.  A  SHORT
PUSH   WILL   MAKE   A   SMALLER   JUMP,  A   LONGER   PUSH  A  LONGER  JUMP.
WATCH OUT  NOT  TO  JUMP  INTO MONSTERS  MOVING  ABOVE  YOU.  WHILE  JUMPING,
YOU CAN MOVE YOUR CHARACTER SOMEWHAT TO  BOTH  SIDES, THUS  ALLOWING  YOU  TO
REACH MORE DISTANT PLATFORMS OR TO  AVOID  MONSTERS. USE  THE  FIREBUTTON  TO
BLOW UP THE MONSTERS - POSSIBLY  BY FAST,  REPETITVE  PUSHING. YOU  CAN  ONLY
BLOW UP A MONSTER AT APROXIMATE EQUAL HEIGHT WITH YOU. TO BLOW  UP A  MONSTER
YOU HAVE TO BE STANDING ON  SOMETHING SOLID  AND THE  DISTANCE SHOULD  NOT BE
TOO BIG.
 
 
 
BONUS ITEMS
-----------
 
ONCE YOU'VE BLOWN UP A MONSTER, THE ITEMS  STOLEN BY  THE  MONSTERS  WILL  BE
DROPPED. COLLECTING THESE WILL CAUSE YOUR  SCORE TO BE  INCREASED AT  THE END
OF THE LEVEL. WATCH OUT FOR BOXES STANDING AROUND. YOU  WILL  PICK  UP  THEIR
CONTENTS BY WALKING PAST THEM. ESPECIALLY THE BOXES WITH THE INJECTION SYMBOL
IN THEM ARE VALUABLE, AS THEY WILL GIVE YOU  A  JUMP  BONUS. BUT  WATCH  OUT:
YOUR JUMPING POWER AND THE CHANCE OF  COLLIDING  WITH  A  MONSTER  ABOVE  YOU
WILL INCREASE  DRAMATICALLY.  JUMP  POWER  INCREASE  IS  NOT  DISMISSABLE  IN
SOME LEVELS, HOWEVER.
 
 
 
TIME
----
 
YOU HAVE ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME  AT  YOUR  DISPOSAL  FOR  EACH  LEVEL.
THE TIME REMAINING CAN BE READ AT THE FAR RIGHT  SIDE  OF  THE  STATUS  LINE.
WHEN YOUR TIME HAS  PASSES  EXCEPT  FOR  FIVE  UNITS, A  "HURRY UP!"  WARNING
WILL BE DISPLAYED. YOU WILL THEN HAVE  ONLY  A  SHORT  TIME  LEFT  TO  FINISH
THE LEVEL. AT THE END OF A LEVEL  YOU  WILL  GET  A  TIME  BONUS,  CALCULATED
FROM THE TIME REMAINING. THIS WILL THEN BE ADDED  TO  YOUR  SCORE.  YOU  WILL
GET AN EXTRA LIFE AT EACH 20,000 POINTS.
 
 
 
THE PLATFORMS
-------------
 
THE PLATFORMS CONSIST OF HORIZONTAL AND  DIAGONAL  PARTS. ON  THE  HORIZONTAL
ONES   YOU  CAN   MOVE  NORMALLY, BUT  WATCH  OUT  ON  THE  DIAGONALS; THERE,
YOU CAN EITHER WALK UP OR SLIDE  DOWN. SO  WATCH  WHAT  IS  HAPPENING  AT THE
LOWER END OF A DIAGONAL BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO USE IT. WALKING  UP  A  DIAGONAL
PLATFORM   CAN   BE   ENDED  BY  RELEASING  THE  JOYSTICK  -  YOU  WILL  THEN
SLIDE DOWN. SLIDING CAN NOT BE STOPPED UNTIL YOU REACH THE END.
 
 
 
THE MONSTERS
------------
 
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING IN ADVANCE, EW WILL HERE MENTION
SOME SPECIES ONLY.
 
MUTANT BIRDS:   THESE REGULARLY LAY EGGS THAT EXPLODE  AFTER A   SHORT  TIME.
		THE EGGS THEMSELVES  ARE HARMLESS, BUT  DON'T GET  CAUGHT  IN
		AN EXPLOSION AS THAT WILL BE LETHAL.

SPITTING MONSTERS: MANY MONSTERS SPIT SHOTS  THAT  YOU  WILL  HAVE  TO AVOID.

RABID APES:	YOU SHOULD SPECIFICALLY WATCH OUT FOR THESE  WILD  APES! MANY
		USE PRESSURE HAMMERS TO MOVE VERY  QUICKLY.  OTHERS  ARE HIGH
		UP AND TRY TO KILL THE PLAYER BY LETTING  BARRELS  ROLL DOWN.
		THESE BARRELS NEVER SHOULD BE TOUCHED!
