                                  STORYLINE
                                  =========

   For the past 500 years, the depraved Shang Tsung has held an annual combat
 tournament on his remote island. His long standing champion is GORO, a huge
 4 armed mutant warrior whose prowess provides the losers souls that become
 the life force to keep Shang Tsung young.  
   Today, seven new contestants are assembled, each one a master warrior with
 special powers.  As the rules of the contest dictate, they must fight each
 other and a carbon copy of themselves before taking on GORO... and ultimatley
 Shang Tsung himself.  
                        WHO WILL BE THE REAL WINNER ?


                                   LOADING
                                   =======

                       Err, well take a wild guess !!!


                                  THE RULES
                                  =========

   THERE ARE VERY FEW...
                       2 combatants fight the best of 3 bouts in one of the
 six locations on Shang Tsung's island : The courtyard, The palace gates, The
 warrior shrine, The pit, Shang Tsung's throne room and Goro's lair.
   The combatants may use any means possible to win.  There are no
 restrictions on the use of special powers, weapons or death blows.  
   
   FLAWLESS VICTORY : Win your first bout without losing any energy and a
                      200,000 point bonus is yours. 

   DOUBLE FLAWLESS VICTORY :  Win the next bout without losing any energy for
                              a bonus of 500,000 points.

   FINISH HIM : When you wun 2 bouts out of 3, you get the chance to use your
                Death Blow and earn a fatality bonus of 100,000 points.  

   In a single player tournament the human controlled combatant is pitted
 against the other 6 contenders before taking part in a mirror match.  After
 that, there are 3 endurance matches against pairs of opponents, one after
 the other.  Then GORO will make his presence known, and eventually Shang
 Tsung will appear...but before you fight...

 a few tricks up his sleeve's...he shoots powerfull fireballs (crouch to
 avoid them).  note that the leg sweep has no effect on Shang Tsung.

                                PLAYING ADVICE
                                ============== 


    WHATS YOUR GAMBIT:  There's no best opening move, but many players prefer
 to begin combat with a flying kick. A good bambit for for sub zero is a  
 flying kick, and if he wins the air battle he can follow it up with a Power
 Slide. 
 
    AIR BATTLES:  Combatants must be able to win as many air battles as
 possible ( jumping  around  a lot  can irriatate a human opponent).  It's 
 all down to timing.  Avoiding a flying kick from an outset is easy:  simply
 take a step forward.   When  the  opponent  lands,  Punch  or  kick  them 
 from  behind.alternatively get  the  timing  right and you can Uppercut the
 opponent as they reach you.Of course, you could always fly at them too...


   DON'T keep repeating the same move over and over - the CPU controlled
 opponent will compensate for tedium.  For example, repeated leg sweeps
 against the CPU controlled opponent countered by their Special Moves-kano
 will perform his Cannonball, Sub Zero will use his Power Slide, and Raiden
 will use his Torpedo.


   COMBINATION MOVES:  or'combos' are tops.  Unlike the more sluggish combat
 simulations, Mortal Kombat's so fast that any combinations executed
 instantly so there's far less chance of commiting yourself by mistake.
 Alternating between two contrasting moves is a good idea as there's far
 more chance of your opponent falling foul to one of them, and it takes the
 CPU controlled opponent longer to adapt to the repetition.  A good
 combonation move is a Roundhouse kick followed by a Leg Sweep.  Your
 opponent usually ducks the Roundhouse...and ends up moving straight into
 your sweep!(or vice versa)
 Alternatively, try a jump kick followed by a leg sweep-or vice versa.
     
 NOTE:  there is a slight pause for breath when a special move is made.


   TIMING:  is the key!  Practice the moves by playing a two player match
 without using a human controlled opponent.


   THE BRIDGE:Use an Upprrcut instead of a Death Blow to finish your
 opponent.  He or she will fall into a pit full of spikes below and be
 impaled.


   ONE OF THE BEST ways to play is to change characters between losing
 matches.This  tends  to  slightly  confuse  the  CPU  controlled  opponents.
 However...
 unless the arcade machine is on FREEPLAY this is an expensive way to play.


   JOHNNY CAGE's Shadow Kick is best countr attacked by a block then a Leg
 Sweep.


   SCORPION can perform a tasty triple combo...  Shoot his harpoon, follow it
 up with an Uppercut and then perform a flying kick.  His harpoon is best
 unleashed when his opponent comes flying at him.


   RAIDEN regenerates after falling down which laeves him vunerable.  He is
 also unprotected when he teleports and can be speared by Scorpions harpoon
 and frozen by Sub Zero's ice fire.  Sonyas leg toss is partiulary effective
 against Raiden.  With careful timing she can repeatedly Leg Toss him until
 he's limp and lifeless.
 

   SONYA BLADE's Leg Toss is best counter attacked by a crouch, a block and
 then an Uppercut just as she bends over.


   KANO is the slowest fighter but his Uppercut has a good reach.  BEWARE!
 Sub Zero's ice fire and Scorpions harpoon can hit Kano when he's performing
 his Cannonball.  If Kano's cannonball is successfully blocked, follow it up
 with a high kick as he's about to land.


   LIU KANG is the fastest fighter and his special moves are probably easiest
 to execute.  A good combo for Liu Kang is to shoot a fire ball then quickly
 follow it up with a Supersonic Kick.
