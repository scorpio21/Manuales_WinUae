COMPLETE DOCS FOR MONOPOLY

RULES OF MONOPOLY

BRIEF IDEA OF THE GAME 

THE IDEA OF THE GAME IS TO BUY AND RENT OR SELL PROPERTIES SO PROFITABLY
THAT PLAYERS INCREASE THEIR WEALTH - THE WEALTHIEST BECOMING THE EVENTUAL
WINNER.STARTING FROM GO,MOVE THE TOKENS AROUND THE BOARD ACCORDING TO THROW
OF THE DICE.WHEN A PLAYER'S TOKEN LANDS ON A SPACE NOT ALREADY OWNED,HE MAY
BUY IT FROM THE BANK; OTHERWISE IT IS AUCTIONED OFF TO THE HIGHEST
BIDDER.THE OBJECT OF OWNING PROPERTY IS TO COLLECT RENTS FROM OPPONENTS
STOPPING THERE.RENTALS ARE GREATLY INCREASED BY THE ERECTION OF HOUSES AND
HOTELS,SO IT IS WISE TO BUILD THEM ON SOME OF YOUR BUILDING SITES.TO RAISE
MORE MONEY,BUILDING SITES MAY BE MORTGAGED TO THE BANK.COMMUNITY CHEST AND
CHANCE CARDS GIVE INSTRUCTIONS THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED.SOMETIMES PLAYERS LAND
ON JAIL.THE GAME IS ONE OF SHREWD AND AMUSING TRADING AND EXCITEMENT.

EQUIPMENT

THE MONOPOLY REAL ESTATE TRADING GAME CONSISTS OF THE BOARD ON SCREEN WITH
SPACES INDICATING BUILDING SITES,RAILWAY STATIONS,UTILITIES,REWARDS AND
PENALTIES OVER WHICH THE PLAYER'S PIECES ARE MOVED.THERE ARE TO DICE,TOKENS
OF VARIOUS DESIGNS REPRESENTING THE PLAYING CHARACTERS,THIRTY TWO GREEN
HOUSES,TWELVE RED HOTELS AND TWO SETS OF CARDS FOR CHANCE AND COMMUNITY
CHEST SPACES.THERE ARE TITLE DEED CARDS FOR EACH PROPERTY.

TO START THE GAME

EACH PLAYER IS GIVEN á£á1,500.EACH PLAYER IN TURN THROWS THE DICE.THE PLAYER
WITH THE HIGHEST TOTAL STARTS THE PLAY.HE PLACES HIS TOKEN ON THE CORNER
MARKED GO,THROWS THE DICE AND MOVES HIS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ARROW THE
NUMBER OF SPACES INDICATED BY THE DICE.AFTER HE HAS COMPLETED HIS PLAY,THE
TURN TO PLAY PASSES TO THE LEFT.THE TOKENS REMAIN ON THE SPACES OCCUPIED
AND PRO-CEED FROM THAT POINT ON THE PLAYER'S NEXT TURN .ONE OR MORE TOKENS
MAY REST ON THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME.

ACCORDING TO THE SPACE WHICH HIS TOKEN REACHES,A PLAYER MAY BE ENTITLED TO
BUY BUILDING SITES OR OTHER PROPERTIES - OR BE OBLIGED TO PAY RENT (IF
ANOTHER OWNS THE PROPERTY),PAY TAXES,DRAW A CHANCE OR A COMMUNITY CHEST
CARD,"GO TO JAIL",ETC.

IF A PLAYER THROWS DOUBLES HE MOVES HIS TOKEN AS USUAL,THE SUM OF THE TWO
DICE,AND THE SPACE THUS REACHED IS EFFECTIVE (I.E.,THE PLAYER IS SUBJECT TO
ANY PRIVILEGES OR PENALTIES PERTAINING SPACE).RETAINING THE DICE HE THROWS
AGAIN AND MOVES HIS TOKEN AS BEFORE,AND AGAIN,THE SPACE THUS REACHED IS
EFFECTIVE.IF,HOWEVER,HE THROWS THREE DOUBLES IN SUCCESSION,HE DOES NOT MOVE
HIS TOKEN ON HIS THIRD THROW,BUT IMMEDIATELY "GO TO JAIL" AND HIS TURN
ENDS.(SEE JAIL)

EVERY TIME THAT A PLAYER'S TOKEN EITHER LANDS ON OR PASSES OVER GO,WHILE
GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ARROW,THE BANKER PAYS HIM á£á200 "SALARY".
Üj      ÜŒLANDING ON UNOWNED PROPERTY

WHEN A PLAYER LANDS ON AN UNOWNED PROPERTY (I.E.,ON A BUILDING SITE FOR
WHICH NO OTHER PLAYER HOLDS THE TITLE DEED)WHETHER BY A THROW OF THE DICE
OR BY A MOVE FORCED BY THE DRAW OF A CHANCE OR COMMUNITY CHEST CARD,THE
PLAYER HAS THE OPTION OF BUYING THAT PROPERTY FROM THE BANK AT ITS PRINTED
PRICE.IF A PLAYER ELECTS TO BUY,HE PAYS THE BANK FOR THAT PROPERTY AND
RECEIVES THE TITLE DEED CARD.

IF THE PLAYER DECLINES HIS OPTION,THE BANKER MUST IMMEDIATELY OFFER THIS
PROPERTY FOR SALE BY AUCTION AND MUST SELL IT TO THE HIGHEST
BIDDER,ACCEPTING MONEY IN PAYMENT AND GIVE THE BUYER THE PROPER TITLE DEED
CARD AS EVIDENCE OF OWNERSHIP.ANY PLAYER,INCLUDING THE ONE WHO DECLINED THE
OPTION OF BUYING AT THE PRINTED PRICE,MAY BID.BIDDING MAY START AT ANY
PRICE

LANDING ON OWNED PROPERTY

WHEN A PLAYER LANDS ON OWNED PROPERTY EITHER BY THROW OF DICE,OR BY A MOVE
FORCED BY A CHANCE OR COMMUNITY CHEST CARD,THE OWNER COLLECTS RENT FROM HIM
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LIST PRINTED ON THE TITLE DEED CARD APPLYING TO
IT.NOTE: IF THE SITE CONTAINS A HOUSE OR HOUSES,THE RENT IS LARGER THAN IT 
WOULD BE FOR AN UNIMPROVED SITE.IF THE SITE IS MORTGAGED,NO RENT CAN BE
COLLECTED.DOUBLE RENT CANNOT BE COLLECTED FROM A COLOUR-GROUP IF ONE SITE
IS MORTGAGED.A PLAYER HOLDING FOUR STATIONS,BUT WITH ONE MORTGAGED,MAY ONLY
COLLECT RENT FROM THE OTHER THREE - I.E. HE WOULD COLLECT á£á100 - NOT á£á200.

NOTE: IF THE OWNER FAILS TO ASK FOR HIS RENT BEFORE THE NEXT THROW OF THE
      DICE NO RENT MAY BE COLLECTED.

ADVANTAGES FOR OWNERS

IT IS AN ADVANTAGE TO HOLD TITLE DEEDS FOR ALL SITES OF A COMPLETE
COLOUR-GROUP FOR EXAMPLE: MAYFAIR AND PARK LANE (OR PENTONVILLE ROAD,EUSTON
ROAD AND THE ANGEL ISINGTON) BECAUSE THE OWNER MAY THEN CHARGE DOUBLE RENT
FOR UNIMPROVED SITES OF THAT PROPERTY.(SEE TITLE DEED CARDS.)

HOUSES CAN ONLY BE BUILT ON SITES OF A COMPLETE COLOUR-GROUP OWNED (SEE
HOUSES).

THE ADVANTAGE OF OWNING HOUSES AND HOTELS RATHER THAN UNIMPROVED PROPERTY
IS THAT RENTALS ARE VERY MUCH HIGHER THAN FOR UNIMPROVED SITES AND PROFIT
THE OWNER IMMENSELY.

LANDING ON CHANCE OR COMMUNITY CHEST

A PLAYER IS GIVEN A CARD FROM THE PACK INDICATE AND AFTER FOLLOWING THE
INSTRUCTIONS,RETURNS THE CARD.THE "GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" CARD,HOWEVER,IS
RETAINED UNTIL USED.AFTER BEING USED,IT IS RETURNED TO THE PACK.THIS CARD
MAY BE SOLD BY A PLAYER TO ANOTHER PLAYER AT A PRICE AGREEABLE TO BOTH.

LANDING ON TAX SPACES

PAY ALL TAX TO THE BANK.Üj      ÜŒ
LANDING ON FREE PARKING

WHEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF PLAY A PLAYERS TOKEN REACHES THIS SPACE,THE
PLAYER RECEIVES NO BENEFIT NOR INCURS ANY PENALTY,AND MOVES AHEAD IN THE
USUAL MANNER ON HIS NEXT TURN.

THE BANK

THE BANK PAYS SALARIES AND BONUSES,SELLS PROPERTIES TO THE PLAYERS AND
DELIVERS THE PROPER TITLE DEED CARDS THEREFORE,AUCTIONS SITES,SELLS HOUSE
AND HOTELS TO THE PLAYERS,LOANS MONEY WHEN REQUIRED ON MORTGAGES OF
PROPERTY AT THE MORTGAGE VALUE WHICH IS ONE HALF OF THE SITE VALUE PRINTED
ON THE BOARD.THE BANK WILL AT ANY TIME BUY BACK HOUSES AND HOTELS FROM
BUILDING SITES AT HALF PRICE.

THE BANK COLLECTS THE PRICE OF ALL PROPERTIES YOU BUY FROM
IT,TAXES,FINES,MONEY,PENALTIES,LOANS AND INTEREST.

JAIL

A PLAYER LANDS IN JAIL - (1) IF HIS TOKEN LANDS ON THE SPACE MARKED GO TO
JAIL,(2)IF HE DRAWS A CARD GO TO JAIL,(3) IF HE THROWS DOUBLES THREE TIMES
IN SUCCESSION.

NOTE: WHEN A PLAYER IS SENT TO JAIL HIS TURN ENDS THERE.HE CANNOT COLLECT
á£á200 SALARY IN THAT MOVE SINCE,REGARDLESS OF WHERE HIS TOKEN IS OR OF THE
PATH OF THE BOARD.HE MUST MOVE HIS TOKEN DIRECTLY TO INTO JAIL.

VISITING JAIL.IF A PLAYER IS NOT "SENT TO JAIL" BUT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE
OF PLAY REACHES THAT SPACE,HE IS ''JUST VISITING'',INCURS NO PENALTY,AND
MOVES AHEAD IN THE USUAL MANNER ON HIS NEXT TURN.

A PLAYER GETS OUT OF JAIL - (1) BY THROWING DOUBLES ON ANY OR HIS NEXT
THREE TURNS LIKE AFTER LANDING IN JAIL.IF HE SUCCEEDS IN DOING THIS HE
IMMEDIATELY MOVES FORWARD THE NUMBER OF SPACES SHOWN BY HIS DOUBLES THROW -
HE ALSO HAS ANOTHER THROW OF THE DICE.(2) PURCHASING A ''GET OUT OF JAIL
FREE'' CARD FROM ANOTHER PLAYER,AT A PRICE AGREEABLE TO BOTH (UNLESS HE
ALREADY OWNS SUCH A CARD BY HAVING ON A PREVIOUS TURN DRAWN IT FROM CHANCE
OR COMMUNITY CHEST.(3) BY PAYING á£á50 FINE BEFORE HE THROWS THE DICE FOR
EITHER HIS NEXT SUCCEEDING TURN TO PLAY.(4) A PLAYER MUST NOT REMAIN IN
JAIL AFTER HIS THIRD TURN (I.E.,NOT LONGER THAN HAVING THREE TURNS TO PLAY
AFTER BEING SENT TO JAIL).

IMMEDIATELY AFTER THROWING THE DICE FOR HIS THIRD TURN HE MUST PAY á£á50 FINE
UNLESS HE THROWS DOUBLES.HE THEN COMES OUT AND IMMEDIATELY MOVES FORWARD
FROM JAIL THE NUMBER OF SPACES SHOWN BY HIS THROWN.

A PLAYER MAY BUY AND ERECT A HOUSE,SELL OR BUY PROPERTY,AND COLLECT RENTALS
EVEN THOUGH HE IS IN JAIL.

HOUSES

HOUSES CAN BE BOUGHT ONLY FROM THE BANK AND CAN ONLY BE ERECTED ON SITES OFÜj      ÜŒA COMPLETE COLOUR-GROUP WHICH THE PLAYER OWNS.(EXAMPLE: IF ONE PLAYER
SUCCEEDS IN OWNING PENTONVILL ROAD,EUSTON ROAD AND THE ANGEL
ISLINGTON,I.E. A COMPLETE COLOUR-GROUP,HE MAY AT ANY PERIOD OF HIS
OWNERSHIP BUY A HOUSE OR HOUSES FROM THE BANK TO ERECT THEREON.IF HE BUYS
ONE HOUSE,HE MAY PUT IT ON ANY ONE OF THESE THREE SITES.THE NEXT HOUSE HE
BUYS AND ERECTS MUST BE PUT AN ONE OF THE UNOCCUPIED SITES OF THIS OR OF
ANY OTHER COMPLETE COLOUR-GROUP HE MAY OWN.THE PRICE HE MUST PAY THE BANK
FOR EACH HOUSE IS SHOWN ON HIS TITLE DEED OF THE SITE.(ON THE UNIMPROVED
SITES OF HIS COMPLETE COLOUR-GROUP HE CONTINUES COLLECTING DOUBLE RENTAL
FROM AN OPPONENT LANDING THEREON.)

A PLAYER MAY BUY AND ERECT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ABOVE RULES AT ANY
TIME,IN HIS TURN,AS MANY HOUSES AS HIS JUDGEMENT AND FINANCIAL STANDING
WILL ALLOW,BUT HE MUST BUILD EVENLY.HE CANNOT ERECT MORE THAN ONE HOUSE ON
ANY ONE SITE OF ANY COLOUR-GROUP UNTIL HE HAS BUILT ONE HOUSE ON EVERY SITE
OF THAT GROUP.HE MAY THEN BEGIN ON THE SECOND ROW OF HOUSES AND SO ON UP TO
A LIMIT OF FOUR HOUSES TO A SITE.HE CANNOT BUILD,FOR EXAMPLE,THREE HOUSES
ON ONE SITE IF HE HAS ONLY ONE HOUSE ON ANOTHER SITE OF THAT
GROUP.SIMILARY,SITES MUST BE MAINTAINED EVENLY - I.E. IF HOUSES HAVE TO BE
SOLD THEY MUST BE REMOVED EQUALLY FROM SITES OF A COLOUR-GROUP.HOUSES MAY
NOT BE BUILT ON SITES IF ONE OF THE SAME COLOUR-GROUP IS MORTGAGED.

HOTELS

A PLAYER MUST HAVE FOUR HOUSES ON EACH SITE OF A COMPLETE COLOUR-GROUP
BEFORE HE CAN BUY AN HOTEL.HE MAY THEN BUY A HOTEL FROM THE BANK TO BE
ERECTED ON ANY SITE OF THAT COLOUR-GROUP,DELIVERING TO THE BANK IN
PAYMENT,THE FOUR HOUSES ALREADY ON THE SITE PLUS THE ADDITIONAL COST OF THE
HOTEL (á£á200 FOR AN HOTEL ON PARK LANE OR MAYFAIR) SHOWN ON THE TITLE
DEED.(IT IS VERY DESIRABLE TO ERECT HOTELS ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY LARGE
RENTAL WHICH MAY BE CHARGED.ONLY ONE HOTEL MAY BE ERECTED ON ANY ONE SITE).

BUILDING SHORTAGE

WHEN THE BANK HAS NO HOUSES TO SELL,PLAYERS WISHING TO BUILD MUST WAIT FOR
SOME PLAYER TO RETURN OR TO SELL HIS HOUSES TO THE BANK BEFORE THEY CAN
BUILD.IF THERE ARE A LIMIT NUMBER OF HOUSES AND HOTELS AVAILABLE,AND TWO OR
MORE PLAYERS WISH TO BUY MORE THAN THE BANK HAS,THE HOUSES OR HOTELS MUST
BE SOLD BY AUCTION TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.

SELLING PROPERTY

UNDEVELOPED SITES,RAILWAY STATIONS AND UTILITIES (BUT NOT BUILDINGS
THEREON)MAY BE SOLD TO ANY PLAYER AS A PRIVATE TRANSACTION FOR ANY AMOUNT
THAT THE OWNER CAN GET.NO SITE HOWEVER,CAN BE SOLD TO ANOTHER PLAYER IF
BUILDINGS ARE STANDING ON ANY SITES OF THAT COLOUR-GROUP.ANY BUILDINGS SO
SITUATED MUST BE SOLD BACK TO THE BANK BEFORE THE OWNER CAN SELL ANY SITE
OF THAT COLOUR-GROUP.MORTGAGED PROPERTY CANNOT BE SOLD TO THE BANK - ONLY
TO OTHER PLAYERS.

HOUSES AND HOTELS MAY BE RESOLD BY PLAYERS TO THE BANK ONLY BUT THIS MAY BE
DONE AT ANY TIME AND THE BANK WILL PAY ONE HALF OF THE PRICE PAID FOR
THEM.IN THE CASE OF HOTELS,THE BANK WILL PAY HALF THE CASH PRICE OF THE
HOTEL PLUS HALF THE PRICE OF THE FOUR HOUSES WHICH WERE GIVEN IN THEÜj      ÜŒPURCHASE OF THE HOTEL.

MORTGAGES

MORTGAGING PROPERTIES CAN BE DONE THROUGH THE BANK ONLY.THE MORTGAGE VALUE
IS PRINTED ON EACH DEED TITLE.THE RATE OF INTEREST IS 10 PER CENT,PAYABLE
WHEN THE MORTGAGE IS LIFTED.IF ANY PROPERTY IS TRANSFERRED WHICH IS
MORTGAGED,THE NEW OWNER MAY LIFT THE MORTGAGE AT ONCE IF HE WISHES,BUT HE
MUST PAY 10 PER CENT INTEREST.IF HE FAILS TO LIFT THE MORTGAGE,HE STILL
PAYS 10 PER CENT INTEREST AND IF HE LIFTS THE MORTGAGE LATER HE PAYS AN
ADDITIONAL 10 PER CENT INTEREST AS WELL AS THE PRINCIPAL.

HOUSES OR HOTELS CANNOT BE MORTGAGED.ALL BUILDINGS ON THE SITE MUST BE SOLD
BACK TO THE BANK BEFORE ANY PROPERTY CAN BE MORTGAGED.THE BANK WILL PAY ONE
HALF OF WHAT WAS PAID FOR THEM.

IN ORDER TO REBUILD A HOUSE ON MORTGAGED PROPERTY THE OWNER MUST PAY THE
BANK THE AMOUNT OF THE MORTGAGED,PLUS 10 PERCENT INTEREST CHARGE AND BUY
THE HOUSE BACK FROM THE BANK AT ITS FULL PRICE.

BANKRUPTCY

A PLAYER WHO IS BANKCRUPT,THAT IS,ONE WHO OWES MORE THAN HE CAN PAY,MUST
TURN OVER TO HIS CREDITOR ALL THAT HE HAS OF VALUE,AND RETIRE FROM THE
GAME.IN MAKING THIS SETTLEMENT,HOWEVER,IF HE OWNS HOUSES OR HOTELS,THESE
ARE RETURNED TO THE BANK IN EXCHANGE OR MONEY,TO THE EXTENT OF HALF THEIR
COST AS PRINTED ON THE TITLE DEEDS,AND THIS CASH IS GIVEN TO THE
CREDITOR.IF A BANKRUPT PLAYER TURNS OVER TO HIS CREDITOR PROPERTY THAT HAS
BEEN MORTGAGED,THE NEW OWNER MUST AT ONCE PAY THE BANK 10 PERCENT INTEREST
ON THE LOAN.AT THE SAME TIME HE MAY AT HIS OPTION LIFT THE MORTGAGED BY
PAYING THE PRINCIPAL.

IN CASE A PLAYER IS UNABLE TO RAISE MONEY ENOUGH TO PAY HIS TAXES OR
PENALTIES,EVEN BY SELLING HIS BUILDINGS AND MORTGAGING HIS PROPERTY,THE
BANK WILL TAKE OVER ALL HIS ASSETS AND SELL BY AUCTION TO THE HIGHEST
BIDDER EVERYTHING SO TAKEN EXCEPTING THE BUILDINGS.THE PLAYER MUST THEN
REMOVE HIS TOKEN.THE LAST PLAYER LEFT IN THE GAME WINS.

MISCELLANEOUS

PROPERTY OWNERS MUST WATCH OUT FOR RENTS DUE.DO NOT HELP PLAYERS TO WATCH
THEIR PROPERTIES.

THE BANK LOANS MONEY ONLY ON MORTGAGE SECURITY.PLAYERS MAY NOT BORROW MONEY
OR PROPERTY FROM EACH OTHER.PLAYERS MAY,HOWEVER,RADE PROPERTY AND CASH WITH
EACH OTHER (BETWEEN THE TURNS OF OTHER PLAYERS).BUILDINGS MAY NOT BE
TRADED.IF A PROPERTY IS TO BE USED IN A TRADE,ANY BUILDINGS ON IT MUST
FIRST BE SOLD BACK TO THE BANK FOR ONE HALF OF THE COST PRICE.

RULES FOR PLAYING THE SHORT GAME

BEFORE COMMENCING,THE PLAYERS STIPULATE THE TIME AT WHICH THE SHALL END.AT
THE END OF THE GAME THE RICHEST PLAYER IS THE WINNER.AT THE START OF THE
GAME EACH PLAYER RECEIVES TWO TITLE DEED CARDS.THE PLAYERS IMMEDIATELY PAYÜj      ÜŒTO THE BANK THE PRICE OF THE PROPERTY THUS DEALT TO THEM.

THE GAME THEN PROCEEDS IN THE USUAL MANNER UNTIL THE AGREED FINISH TIME IS
REACHED.NO FURTHER DEALINGS MUST TAKE PLACE,BUT A PLAYER IS IN ACTUAL PLAY
WHEN THE FINISHED IS ANNOUNCED,HE IS ALLOWED TO COMPLETE HIS MOVE AND ANY
TRANSACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH IT.EACH PLAYER THEN TOTALS UP THE VALUES OF
HIS POSSESSIONS: (1) CASH IN HAND.(2) BUILDING SITES,UTILITIES OR RAILWAY
STATION OWNED BY HIM,AT THE PRICE PRINTED ON THE BOARD.(3) MORTGAGED
PROPERTY AT HALF THE PRICE PRINTED ON THE BOARD.(4) HOUSES OWNED VALUED AT
THEIR RESPECTIVE COST PRICES.(5) HOTELS,VALUED AT THE COST OF FIVE HOUSES.

        THE PLAYER WITH THE HIGHEST TOTAL IS THE WINNER.
