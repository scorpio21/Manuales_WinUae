MYTH AN INTRODUCTION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In an age not remembered by men, the forces that governed all life 
met in a council to decide the fate of their respective creations.
These beings are only known to us as the PAGAN ones and play no part
in our lives today, but aeons ago no man was free of the attention
of these malignant spirits.  His life was govered and manipulated
according to their whims and his death, usually prematurely, was but
entertainment to them.

A handful of these Pagan spirits did however take a genuine interest
in Mankinds affairs and actually aided him on his tortuous journey 
into the light of civilisation.  These wise spirits divided the races
of men between them and applied their influences to the development
of several great peoples.

The seven races of man rarely encountered each other in those golden
times, their repective cultures flourished within their own borders 
and their numbers were small.  The story of Man would have been very 
different had things remained in this blissful state, but it was not
to be. 

The Seven Spirits of Wisdom kept their Earthly dominion a secret from
the other more malignant forces that roamed the universe, these others
delighted in destruction, hurling Sons together, smashing planets and
tearing huge holes in the fabric of creation.

One of these terible spirits was known as Dameron the Lord of all that
is darkness. This evil creature lurked in apart of the universe where
no stars shone, his brooding thoughts spread inky blackness outwards
to enshroud the minds of lesser beings. This malignant horror gathered
the other spirits around him, even six of the Seven Wise Ones 
converged on his black realm to pay homage to his ever increasing 
power.

The weaker spirits became bound to Dameron their heads forming a 
hideous crown from which poured a fiery retribution for those that
would not succomb to his influence. The six remained in council with
Dameron for many hundreds of years, slowly falling into evil thoughts 
and deeds. Whilst they converged with their new master, their peoples
on earth multiplied and expanded, sivilisations clashed, war broke out
and the one remaining Wise Spirit gathered his own people to an 
island to protect them from the bloodshed abroad.

The Six returned after a thousand years, they found their peoples in
conflict and were amused. It was decided to pit each race against the
other in a fight to the death that would last generations.

The one Wise Spirit gathered his high preists at the standing stones 
of their land and showed them a vision of the wars abroad. The preists
wailed in dismay as an image of Dameron appeared to them. `What can 
save us?' they cried to the skies.

A shimering light appeared at the centre of the stone temple and 
within it they could see the figure of a man. A disembodied voice
shouted `Behold Ankalagan, the Spitit Hunter, not yet born but soon to
be amongst you. Slayer of Dameron and all unholy Spirits, liberator of
mankind. His quest is already written in the stars!'.

As the voice faded away three stars converged to form the belt of a 
warrior, others took the shape of a sword in his hand and their light
caused the great stones to glow.

A legend was born..

GENERAL TIPS
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first aspects of the game you should master are the Joystick
controls. The highly interactive nature of the game is required
because of some of the complex moves the main charecter has to
perform. A high level of competence at the controls will enhance your
gameplay CONSIDERABLY.

Because of the adventure elements our second suggestion is that you
should get into the habit of RECORDING what happens on each screen.
This will enable you to obtain HIGHER SCORES with repeated play.

The last point is, NEVER TAKE ANYTING FOR GRANTED, some things are not
as they appear. Be curious and nosey, examine eveything.

PLAYING GUIDE TO LEVEL ONE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Kill harpies (small green flying dragons) throught the game which
drop EXTRA ENERGY and valuable FIREBALLS.

2. Use fireballs to kill skeletons until one of them drops a SWORD.

3. Use sword with various moves shown in `JOYSTICK CONTROLS' to fight
your way deeper into the game. CUT DOWN HANGING SKELETON.

4. Make your way down to the bottom of the cavern where the now freed
skeleton has to be killed and his skull must fall into the flames.

5. A DEMON then rises from the flames and can only be destroyed with
FIREBALLS.

6. Pick up Demons TRIDENT for use later in the game. Note:- The 
Trident is only ONE SHOT so care must be taken to use it wisely.

7. Make your awy to the top right in the cavern where you will be 
confronted by the  CHIMERA (A three headed demon). This can only be
killed by using the TRIDENT and it is advisable that the trident is
already selected just before you confront the CHIMERA.

8. Continue your adventure by slaying enemies with the sword until you
each the feminine NYMPH. Approach her ONLY when sshe beckons or when
her hand is flat. Be very cautious and when close enough, KNEEL down,
this changes the Nymph into an extra energy bead, vital for later 
stages of the game. Note:- When she holds her hand up in front of you,
move back again until she beckons you to try again and move in.

9. On reaching the ACHILLES statue, attack the HEEL with either 
fireballs or sword and this will eventually cause ACHILLES to crumble,
leaving only his shield which, when picked up, allows you to run past
all remaining enemies at this particular stage.

10. At this stage of the level, extra care must be taken with the 
joystick controls. Once these are mastered gameplay should become
easier. MEDUSA is around here, and her EYE BOLTS are lethal and will 
turn you to stone. Make sure you have selected the SHIELD prior to
running into Medusa and then use it carefully to deflect her eye bolts
as you make your way across the platforms to stand alongside her.
Note:- The shield must be RAISED to deflect her shots, not just held.

11. When she looks away, quickly select SWORD and attack her neck.

12. Pick up the MEDUSA HEAD to use in your final confontation in this
level. The huge three headed HYDRA stand between you and level two.
Use MEDUSA`S HEAD in conjunction with the FIRE BUTTON and aatack each
HYDRA head individually. On destroying the HYDRA, Level One is 
complete and you should now be capable of confidently tackling the
ever increasing hazards that will now greet your every turn throught
the rest of the game.

GOOD LUCK YOU`RE GOING TO NEED IT!
