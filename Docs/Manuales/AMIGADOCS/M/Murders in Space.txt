             THE DOX TO MURDERS IN SPACE---SCOOTER-<GENESIS>

JUNE 30,2000\5.06;45 UNIVERSAL TIME,BASE KOUROU.
INTENSE ACTIVITY IS IN THE AIR AT THE JUPITER CONTROL HALL,THE ROCKET ARIANE 5,
CHARTERED BY THE PEGASUS SPACE CONSORTIUM,IS READY FOR TAKE OFF FROM LAUNCH PAD
A3. AT THE TOP OF THE ROCKET,INSIDE AN EUROPEAN SPACE SHUTTLE ALONG WITH A
BRITISH ASTRONOMER,YOU MENTALLY COUNT THE FINAL SECONDS BEFORE LIFT OF....

EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE`NT A SPEACIALIST IN THE DOMAIN OF SPACE,AT LEAST YOU HAVE
BUILT UP A REPUTATION FOR YOURSELF THROUGH PRIOR INVESTIGATIVE RESEARCH. THE
PEGASUS CONSORTIUM HAS CALLED YOU RATHER THAN ANOTHER DUE TO THE GRAVITY OF THE
SITUATION.IN FACT, A FEW DAYS AGO,THE MISSION COMMANDER ALERTED GROUND CONTROL
OF UNUSUAL INCIDENTS ON BOARD. THE WORST OF WHICH BEING THE ASSASSINATION
ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE!! TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A ROUTINE FLIGHT,YOU ARE BEING SENT
TO THE SPACE STATION TO RESOLVE THE AFFAIR AND TO UNMASK THE CULPRIT.APART FROM
THE COMMANDER,THE CREW HAS NOT BEEN INFORMED OF YOUR ARRIVAL.OFFICIALLY,YOU ARE
MAKING A ROUTINE ADMINISTRIVE CHECK-UP.YOUR COVER;DICK ANDERSON.

FOR TECHNICAL REASONS YOU MUST REURN TO EARTH THE FOLLOWING DAY WITH THE
ASTRONAUT WHO HAS FINISHED HIS MISSION. THE 24 HRS ABOARD WONT BE MUCH...YET
AT TIMES THE HOURS WILL SEEM LONE ENOUGH!!!,BUT BE CAREFUL!,DUE TO THE
STALEMATE AT THE BERLIN NEGOTIATIONS IN MARCH 2004, AND THE ABSENCE OF THE
SIGNATURES FROM THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED WITH THE SPACE CHARTER 0F THE UNITED
NATIONS;YOU SHOULD BE QUITE CAREFUL IN YOUR INVESTIGATION INVOLVING CITIZENS OF
8 DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES.

YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO USE THE UTMOST DISCRETION.IN THE CASE OF
`NON-ACCIDENTAL` DEATH TO AN ASTRONAUT,YOU SHOULD TAKE ALL AVAILABLE MEASURES
TO HIDE THE EVENT UNTIL THE END OF YOUR MISSION.

THE SPACE STATION PEGASUS:

THE FIRST PARTS OF THE PEGASUS WERE PUT IN ORBIT AT THE END OF THE 20TH
CENTURY. THE SPACE STATION CONSISTED OF ONLY 4 MODULES.ORGANISED AROUND A
CENTRAL MODULE,IT IS TODAY MADE UP OF A:COMMAND MODULE,TWO HABITATION
MODULES;TWO LABORATORIES;AN EXTRAVEHIULAR ACTIVITY MODULE(EVA) AND A STORAGE
MODULE.
THE DOCKING SYSTEMS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL SPACE VEHICLES(IN REFERENCE TO THE
ESD-404).IN 2006,TWO INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION
MODULES(METALLURGY-ELECTRONIC-PHARMACEUTICAL)WILL JOIN WITH THE PEGASUS SPACE
STATION..THE SPACE STATION WILL THEN WEIGH 275 TONS.
IT IS SELF SUPPORTING FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO 3 MONTHS UNDER NORMAL
USE.RE-FUELING AND CREW CHANGE IS ASSURED BY A ROTATION OF ORBITERS.

PEGASUS IS IN ORBIT ALTITUDE OF 400 KILOMETERS.IT COMPLETES ONE ORBIT AROUND
THE EARTH EVERY 90 MINUTES JUST LIKE ITS NEIGHBOURING AMERICAN SPACE STATION
`FREEDOM` IN WHICH THE FIRST PARTS HAVE JUST BEEN INSTALLED.
IT IS IN THE SAME ORBIT AS THE SOVIET `MIR` WHICH WAS ABONDONED AND DESTROYED
AT THE END OF THE LAST CENTURY WHEN THE U.S.S.R DECIDED TO PUT A SPACE STATION
ON THE MOON.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM OF THE GAME;

THE PEGASUS CONSORTIUM IS SENDING YOU TO THE SPACE STATION TO INVESTIGATE THE
ATTEMPTED MURDER OF THE `MISSION COMMANDER` ONCE IN PLACE,EVENTS WILL
HAPPEN,MAKING YOUR MISSION MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU IMAGINED.
TO WIN,YOU MUST SUCCEED IN LEAVING THE SPACE STATION AT 11 O`CLOCK,THE DAY
AFTER YOUR ARRIVAL,LEAVING THE CREW OPERATIONAL AND ABLE TO COMPLETE THE
MISSION.
TO ACHIEVE THIS TASK,YOU MUST SAVE EACH CREW MEMBER IN DANGER.TO DO THAT,APART
FROM TRADITIONAL INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES(INTERROGATION,SEARCHING OF
PEOPLE/PLACES)YOU SHOULD EXPLORE THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND MATERIAL ON
BOARD.BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS,SPACE SCOOTER,TELESCOPE,MANIPULATING ARM....
TO COMPLETE YOUR MISSION YOU MUST ALSO FIND OUT THE `SECRET` OF EACH
ASTRONAUTS.ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE....

THE GAME:

MURDERS IN SPACE IS PART OF THE `MURDERS COLLECTION` FROM INFOGAMES.THIS SERIES
IS AN ORIGINAL TYPE THAT CANNOT BE COMPARED TO ANY OTHER ADVENTURE/SIM
PROGRAM.HERE YOU PROGRESS FREELY;YOU DONT HAVE TO COLLECT A 1000 DIFFERENT
OBJECTS,NOR TYPE A 1000 WORDS TO ACCESS THE NEXT STAGE,NOR DIE 7346 TIMES
BEFORE THE GAME FINALLY ENDS.

1) DOCKING
EXCEPT BY YOUR OWN INTERVENTION(PRESS F1 TO GO MANUAL)YOU DOCK
AUTOMATICALLY.AFTER THE SECURITY CHECK HAS BEEN COMPLETED,THE AIRLOCKS OPEN AND
YOU MAY ENETER THE SPACE STATION.

2) AREA OF INVESTIGATION
YOUR INVESTIGATION WILL TAKE PLACE THROUGHOUT THE SPACE STATION.YOU WILL SEE
THE ON BOARD PROFILE OF EACH MODULE.YOU PASS FROM ONE MODULE TO ANOTHER THROUGH
AIRLOCKS.REFER TO THE CENTRAL PAGE OF THE LOG BOOK FOR A COMPLETE VIEW OF THE
SPACE STATION.

                   DESCRIPTION OF THE SPACE STATION
                   --------------------------------

RIGHT DUDES THIS IS BY ME AS I VIEW THE SPACE STATION FROM THE LOG BOOK...

THE SPACE STATION IS MADE UP OF 2 MODULES AT THE TOP..AND 4 MODULES RUNNING IN
A STRAIGHT LINE...2 MORE MODULES COME OUT FROM HERE AT THE BOTTOM,THEN A
FURTHER MODULE IS ATTACHED TO THE LEFT HAND ONE BENEATH AGAIN...CHECK THE
LITTLE PICCY OUT..

POINT IN THE GAME:I THINK...SO I ACT!(ACTION SENTENCES)

CLICK ON THE MOUTH OF THE PLAYER: LIST OF POSSIBLE SENTENCES FOR DIALOGUE WITH
THE PERSON SELECTED(HISHER PHOTO HAS APPEARED)

FOR THESE TWO BASIC ACTIONS:
- CLICK THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON:BACK UP THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE

- TO CONFIRM A SENTENCE AND OBTAIN AN ANSWER,YOU MUST CLICK ON THE `THOUGHT`
BUBBLE OR SPOKEN TEXT OF THE PLAYER(BE CAREFUL! COMFIRMING A SENTENCE CAN CAUSE
YOU TO ACCEPT A PROPOSAL YOU MAY REGRET)

- IF A BUBBLE IS TO SMALL FOR TEXT,ARROWS WILL APPEAR IN THE CENTRE STRIP,JUST
CLICK ON THEM TO SCROLL THE TEXT LINE...LINE BY LINE.
DIALOGUES CHANGE EACH HOUR. THE CREW MEMBERS ALSO CHANGE THIER POSITIONS AND
ACTIVITIES ACCORDING TO THEIR SCEDHULES.

EXAMPLE OF ACTION:

BRINGING A PERSON TO THE MEDICAL ANALYSIS:AFETR DISPLAYING THE PICTURE OF THE
PERSON,SELECT THE THOUGHT,`IM JUST GOING TO RUN A FEW BIO-LOGICAL TESTS`...IF
IT IS POSSIBLE AT THIS MOMENT,A MESSAGE WILL POP UP ASKING YOU TO WAIT A FEW
SECONDS.
THEN YOU WILL FIND YOURSELVES IN LAB 1..YOU ARE NEXT TO THE CREW MEMBER WHO IS
CONNECTED TO THE ANNALYSING DEVICE. YOU THEN HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL NEW
SENTENCES ADAPTED TO THE SITUATION..EXAMPLE OF THOUGHT `THE ANALYSIS IS
OVER`....

B) GENERAL FUNCTIONS ACCESSIBLE BY THOUGHT;

THROUGHOUT THE THOUGHT `INVENTORY`YOU ACCESS THE LIST OF OBJECTS AT YOUR
DISPOSAL.ONLY NECESSARY ITEMS MAY BE PICKED UP,SO THERE IS NO NEED TO TRY TO
STUFF YOUR POCKETS!

QUESTIONAIRE.

THROUGH THE THOUGHT `I`M GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONAIRE` YOU MAY ACCESS THE
30 QUESTION LIST ESTABLISHED BY GROUND CONTROL.THESE MAY POSSIBLY SERVE AS
CLUES IN YOUR INVESTIGATION.ANSWER BY TYPING THE TEXT IN THE BUBBLE FOR THE
PLAYER.[ESC]ALLOWS YOU TO ESCAPE AT ANY TIME.THE QUESTIONAIRE WILL NOT WORK IF
THE CONNECTION WITH GROUND CONTROL IS BROCKEN....IN WHICH CASE THE SYSTEM MUST
BE REPAIRED.

SECRETS:

EVERY CREW MEMBERS IS HIDING SOMETHING...YOU CAN ASK `WHAT SECRETS HAVE BEEN
DISCOVERED` THE PROGRAM ANSWERS WITH AN 8 DIGIT NUMBER,EACH DIGIT CORRESPONDING
TO A CREW MEMBER;IN ALPHBETICAL
ORDER(ALVISI-AMIOTI-BORONOVA-CONNOLY-HIGGINS-KAMAKURA-MAHRUBI-SCHMIDT).
POSSIBLE RESPONSE:00100001 MEANS THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED THE SECRETS OF
BORONOVA AND SCHMIDT.

END OF THE GAME:

YOU MAY END THE GAME BY CHOICE USING THE SENTENCE `BACK TO THE START OF THE
GAME`(AND THEN COMFIRMING CHOICE)OR BY SWITCHING OFF THE COMPUTER. WHEN IT IS
11 O CLOCK OR YOU KILL A CREW MEMBER(WHICH IS NOT YOUR MAIN GOAL,BUT CAN
SOMETIMES HAPPEN!)YOU THEN PROCEED TO THE EPILOGUE.

C) TIME;

THE GAME TAKES PLACE BETWEEN THE TIME YOU ARRIVE AT THE STATION(OPENING OF THE
AIRLOCKS) AND 11 AM THE FOLLOWING DAY.
IT IS DIVIDED INTO 20 PARTS..EACH OF THEM CORRESPONDS TO EVENTS OR TASKS THAT
THE PLAYER MUST FULFILL,AS EACH HOUR PASSES,A DISK ACCESS TAKES PLACE.
YOU CAN EXAMINE AN AIRLOCK TO SEE IF IT HAS BEEN OPENED BY COMPARING ITS STATUS
BEFORE AND AFTER THE HOUR...

ADVICE CONCERNING TIME.

- BEWARE OF THE CHANGING HOUR THAT CAN CAUSE AN EVENT TO TAKE PLACE(OR YOU
COULD BECOME AWARE OF IT...EXAMPLE;ALARM)

- YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN CHANGING THE SPEED IN WHICH THE TIME PASSES(SEE
`CLOCK REGULATION`)

DURING YOUR STAY,THE MISSION SHALL CONTINUE AND THE ASTRONAUTS WILL FOLLOW
THEIR SCEDHULE AS USUAL.WHEN THEY ARE ASLEEP,YOU ARE AUTHORISED TO TRY AND WAKE
THEM,FOR EXAMPLE TO BRING THEM TO A MEDICAL ANALYSIS.
WHEN SOMEONE HAS BEEN AWAKENED,THEY WILL STAY UP TILL THE END OF THE HOUR,THE
FOLLOWING HOUR THEY WILL RETURN TO THE STATE IN WHICH THEY WERE FOUND;BACK AT
THEIR POST OR ASLEEP.

D) ALARMS;

APART FROM THOSE WHICH YOU MAY PROGRAM YOURSELF TO REMEMBER AN EVENT OR AN
APPONITMENT...CERTAIN ALARMS GO OFFDURING THE GAME WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR.
THE ALARM MAY SOUND UNTIL THE END OF THE HOUR.OF COURSE YOU CAN CUT THE SOUND
BY PRESSING F8.WHEN AN ALARM GOES OFF,IT MAY CAUSE THE APPEARENCE OF NEW
DIALOGUE SENTENCES WHICH CAN BE WORTH A CLOSER LOOK...FURTHER MORE AN INTERNAL
REPORT WILL BE CREATED IN THE `MAIN COMPUTER`(C.O.P.S SYSTEM)

E) EVIDENCE ITEMS;

AFETR A SEARCH YOU OBTAIN A LIST OF OBJECTS.THESE ITEMS ARE EVENTUALLY MARKED
BY AN (*)IF THEY ARE PART OF A KIT,OR THEIR LOG BOOK NUMBER IF THEY ARE
PRINTED.

GROUND CONTROL WHEN YOU HAVE CONFIRMED.

ADVICE AND HINTS FOR THE GAME;

TRY TO FIND THE CODES FOR THE MAILBOX OF EACH PERSON THROUGH THE EVIDENCE
ITEMS...
IF YOU DISCOVER A DEAD CREW MEMBER,DISCREETLY TAKE HIM TO THE EVA MODULE TO
HIDE HIM FROM THE REST OF THE CREW.....
THE SETTING IN WHICH THE STORY TAKES PLACE IS BASED ON ACTUAL AMERICAN AND
BRITISH PROJECTS(FREEDOM AND COLUMBUS RESPECTIVELY),FOR SPACE STATIONS....
OF COURSE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ACTUAL PROJECT DELAYS,PEGASUS IS AHEAD OF ITS
TIME AND BENEFITS FROM TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL NOT BE USED FOR A LONG TIME IN THE
FIELD OF ENERGY PRODUCTION AND HEAT CONVERTERS.
