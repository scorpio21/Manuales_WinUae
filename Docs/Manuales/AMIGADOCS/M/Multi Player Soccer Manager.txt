GENERAL
All keyboard entries should be followed by pressing return, except when using
the function keys. All other selections should be made by joystick or mouse,
depending on which you select (Don't know how the hell you are supposed to use
the mouse for this game, as it was DONGLE protected via the mouse port, and I
can't find any option to select between mouse and joystick)!
