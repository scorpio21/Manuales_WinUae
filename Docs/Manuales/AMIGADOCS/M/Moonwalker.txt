				   -------

There are 4 different area settings in the firm studios where there are 7
points of a rabbit costume which need to be collected by Michael so as he
can disguise himself from his fans. Amiga/Atari ST users have to collect
parts of the rabbit suit in order, so watch the radar for some flashing
hints as to their location. Avoid at all costs Granny and her Grandson, the
cowboys on horseback, the Biff brothers and the Japanese tourists as they
will take one of your coveted Platinum discs. Once you have collected the
complete rabbit suit and the 4 special items you must find the waiting
motorbike to escape to Michaelsville.

                           LEVEL 2 - MICHAELSVILLE
			   -----------------------

Unfortunately Mr Big has seen through your disguise and tipped off your
fans too. Road blocks have been set up which divide the town into sections.
Bright shining orbs have to be collected whilst you're on your motorbike to
transform you into a glittering Stratus sports car able to leap the
barriers. This effect lasts for only 10 seconds so choose your path with
care. If you fail to make it, you will need a fresh set of orbs. As you
zoom around the streets, Mr Big's drug hoardes can be destroyed by running
over them. Occasionaly you can also run over a trooper before he gets ahead
of you. If you get far enough, then it's only a jet-ski ride from freedom,
that is if the Biff brothers don't get you.

                              LEVEL 3 - CLUB 30
			      -----------------

So you think you're safe in Club 30? Not for long as Mr Big has discovered
your hideout and means to dispose of you smartly. Trooper guards suddenly
appear at windows and doors, but so do the children, so be careful. Without
your disguise a gun and ammunition must be found so you can tackle Mr Big's
task force. Act swiftly to guide the children to safety.

                             LEVEL 4 - THE ARENA
			     -------------------

Mr Big has kidnapped Katy to lure you to his lair for what must surely be
the final confrontation. Troopers and Storm Troopers are gathered together
to finish you off with their powerful laser guns. Take out each foe as they
appear, but beware the mighty plasma cannon that Mr Big has installed as
you need to destroy it before it destroys you. Can you survive to take the
children to safety?
