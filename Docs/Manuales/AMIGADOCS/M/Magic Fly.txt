            THE DOCS FOR `MAGIC FLY` TYPED IN BY SCOOTER\
            \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\


BIRTH OF THE FLY:

THE SECURITY PASS CARRIED BY GENERAL BY GENERAL JOHN PARRAMORE HAD A LARGE
YELLOW LABEL. IT READS `WEAPONS RESEARCH`-GRADE 10. IT WAS THIS SLIP OF SILICON
AND PLASTIC THAT HAD MADE HIS JOURNEY INTO SUCH A SENSITIVE PLACE POSSIBLE.

`AH` GENERAL PARRAMORE, GLAD YOU COULD SPARE THE TIME, A VOICE ECHOED OUT OF A
DARKNESS WHICH SHROUDED UNWELCOME EYES FROM RESEARCH HANGAR NUMBER 7.

FROM THE SHADOWS CAME AN OUTSTRETCHED HAND FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY A WHITE COAT
WORN BY ZED SNELL, CHIEF DESIGNER AT DEL-VARIANT.

they are just putting the finishing touches to......HE STARTED TO EXPLAIN.

BEFORE HE COULD FINISH THE GENERAL HAD MOVED AWAY AND WAS PEERING EAGERLY INTO
THE HANGAR. SNELL THOUGHT HE HAD BETTER COVER THE SILENCE.

when your very specific request came through, i immediately thought of our
original fly concept. it embodied many of the charcteristics that you specified
so --we evolved the fly into something radically different from any other
fighting machine, we think.

A NOT SO DISTANT COUGH TERMINATED SNELLS DIATRIBE. ah lights please.

THE HANGAR INSTANTLY BECAME FULL OF EQUIPMENT,TECHNICIANS AND ONE VERY
DISTINCTIVE LOOKING SPACECRAFT.

this is the T2..the MAGIC FLY..snell took on a paternalistic gaze as parramore
moved towards the hardware for a close inspection.

PARRAMORE RECOGNISED VARIOUS EXTERNAL FEATURES, THE GP7 RIPPLE FIRE LASER, THE
MULTI LASER DEFLECTIVE ARMOUR.

this?. HE POINTED AT AN OCTANGAL POCKET WHICH APPEARED IN FOUR PLACES ON THE
REAR OF THE CRAFT.

a multi various weapon launcher--it can fire almost anything that you could
feasibily carry. the power plants are 4 olympus 972`s with turbo modifications.
speed is hover to 2200 metres per second and...SNELL DREW BREATH..it can turn
on a credit card.

TO SNELLS AMAZEMENT PARRAMORE TURNED AND BEGAN WALKING AWAY.

general......

THE GENERAL KEPT WALKING.

i want another 9..you have 65 days.

this is only the prototype!!, PROTESTED SNELL.

no, this is mission day minus 64....your pilots will be here in 8 days, i
suggest you get a move on.....

SNELL LOOKED AT THE TECHNICIANS. THEY LOOKED AT HIM. THEY ALL LOOKED AT THE
MAGIC FLY.

ITS NAME IS .......  T2 .....  (CODENAMED THE MAGIC FLY)

CARRYS A CREW OF      1
WEAPONS               1 GP7 RIPPLEFIRE LASER CANNON,MULTI WEAPON LAUNCHER.
POWERPLANT            OLYMPUS 972 WITH TURBO MODIFICATIONS.
SPEED                 HOVER TO 2200 METRES PER SECOND.

THE BRIEFING:

XV SQUADRON HAD BEEN RECALLED 2 WEKS INTO A MONTHS REST SEGMENT. THEY RETURNED
TO THEIR CARRIER TO FIND THAT NOT ONLY HAD ORDERS CHANGED BUT ALL THEIR T1
CRAFT HAD BEEN REPLACED. IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED THEY WERE INVOLVED IN AN
INTENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAMME. THEY WERE ALL AMAZED AT THE AGILITY AND FIREPOWER
THE `MAGIC FLY` SUPPLIED. TOGETHER WITH THE ODD FRIGHT. EVERYBODY GOT CAUGHT
OUT BY THE TURBO AT SOME STAGE. NOW THEY WERE READY--FOR WHAT?.IN THE 8 WEEKS
OF TRAINING THEY HAD NO INDICATION AS TO THEIR TARGET. ALL THEY KNEW WAS THAT
IT INVOLVED CONFINED SPACE FLYING AND FIGHTING. A CHALLENGE FOR WHICH THEY ALL
AGRRED THE `MAGIC FLY` WAS SUPERBLY SUITED.

8 HOURS PREVIOUSLY ALL CRAFT AND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT HAD BEEN STOWED ABAORD THE
CARRIER `ACHEON` AND THEY HAD LEFT GATEWAY FOR DEEP SPACE. THE PILOTS CONCERNED
THEMSELVES WITH THE WEAPON PROFILES OF THEIR CRAFT AND WAITED FOR THE CALL TO
MISSION BRIEFING. IT CAME SOON ENOUGH.

PARRAMORE WAITED UNTIL ALL PILOTS HAD CONTROLLED THEIR PRE-FLIGHT FIDGETS
BEFORE BEGINNING HIS PRESENTATION.

the target is a small ore planetoid in an obscure system on the edge of the 7th
spiral arm- calledlb-400-21. it was previously mined for precious metals and
contains an extensive network of tunnels. intelligense reports suggest that
this is the primary base for the ceti triads. it is our belief that they are
using it to service a large selection of military hardware. we also understand
that they are devolping a super fighter, the `moth`.

we need to know the harware they have, and its capability. so - nobody is
carrying any nuclear weapons, we must have this data before you destroy the
complex.

if we can`t carry nuclear - how do we pickle the place once we have all the
data we need?..CAME THE OBVIOUS QUESTION.

even if all your t2`s carried nuclear weapons you could not deliver the tonnage
necessary to destroy lb-400-21. your only chance is to use the nuclear
stockpile they have collected. you need a `trigger` to detonate these
weapons-somewhere inside that complex is an atomic sledge hammer. once fired
this will fly to the neaarest atomic device and detonate it.

the end result is a nuclear explosion which will obliterate lb-400-21

here are your mission objectives. read them well. the drop is scedhuled for
1300 hours. good luck!.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISSION OBJECTIVES.

TO COMPLETE THE MISSION YOU MUST NAVIGATE YOUR `MAGIC FLY` THROUGH A VAST 3D
UNDER GROUND COMPLEX, OVERCOME ITS DEFENSES AND ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES.

1.    LOCATE AND NEUTRALISE THE COMMUNICATIONS CENTRE,REACTOR CORE,MISSILE
      DEFENSE SYSTEM AND COMPUTER CENTRE.

2.    FIND THE INNER SANCTUM,GET INSIDE AND SCAN THE PROTOTYPE `MOTH` BEFOR
      DESTROYING IT. 

3.    FIND THE ATOMIC SLEDGEHAMMER AND USE IT.

4.    SCAN ALL ENEMY CRAFT YOU ENCOUNTER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR
      CAPABILITIES.

5.    ESCAPE FROM THE PLANETOID BEFORE IT EXPLODES.

YOU MUST FULFILL THE FIRST 2 OBJECTIVES BEFORE YOU DESTROY THE ENTIRE COMPLEX.
THE MEANS TO DO THIS AND POSSIBLE ESCAPE LIE WITHIN THE COMPLEX.
THE ASTEROID IS PROTECTED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF ENEMY CRAFT WHICH PATROL THE
TUNNELS. THESE ARE THE FORCES OF THE CETI-TRIAD,WHO WILL ATTEMPT TO HUNT YOU
DOWN,DESTROY YOUR SHIP AND TERMINATE YOUR MISSION.

THE CETI TRIAD HAVE ALSO PLACED STATIC DEFENSE STRUCTURES AND BUILDINGS INTO
THE TUNNELS TO PREVENT ENEMY AIRCRAFT PENETRATING THE COMPLEX. MOST OBJECTS YOU
FIND HAVE SOME FUNCTION,EITHER DEFENSIVE,OBSTRUCTIVE OR BOTH.

FLIGHT GUIDE:

THE MAGIC FLY IS SIMPLE TO NAVIGATE AND HAS MANY DEFENSIVE AND OFFENSIVE
OPTIONS, THESE INCLUDE THREE TYPES OF LASER, THREE TYPES OF MISSILES AND A
RANGE OF `SUPER` WEAPONS DESIGNED TO OVERCOME `HARDENED` FOE OR OBJECTS. IF YOU
COME UNDER ATTACK YOU HAVE A CRAFT WHICH CAN MANOEUVRE IN THE SMALLEST OF
SPACES,LAUNCH DEFENSIVE `WEBS` AND OUT-RUN THE ENEMY WITH TURBO ENGINES.

MAIN SCREEN:

THE MAIN SCREEN IS A COMBINATION OF THE VIEW OF THE VIEW FROM THE MAGIC FLY
AS MUCH INFORMATION AS CAN BE EASILY BE DIGESTED WHILE YOU ARE CONTROLLING THE
MAGIC FLY. THE KEY AREAS ON THE MAIN SCREEN ARE NUMBERED ON THE MAIN SCREEN
GRAPHIC.YOU WILL FIND A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THESE IN THE FOLLWING SECTIONS.

ACTION TRIANGLES:

THERE ARE 5 EXTRA INFO SCREENS WHICH GIVE YOU ACCESS TO EXTRA INFORMATION AND
FEATURES OF THE `MAGIC FLY` THEY ARE:

. MAP            (SEE SECT 2.1)

. DAMAGE CONTROL (SEE SECT 4.1)

. DATABASE       (SEE SECT 12.1)

. ENERGY         (SEE SECT 5.1)

. WEAPONS        (SEE SECT 3.1)

TO SEE THE SCREENS,CLICK ON THE ACTION TRIANGLES ON THE MAIN SCREEN WITH THE
LEFT MOUSE BUTTON, TO EXIT THE EXTRA INFO SCREENS, PRESS THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON
OR SPACE BAR..SEE YOUR MAGIG FLY REFERENCE CARD FOR THE KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS TO
ACTIVATE THE ACTION TRIANGLES..ACTION TRIANGLES ARE LOCATED NEAR THE AREA THEY
PROVIDE EXTRA INFO FOR.

1. THROTTLE AND THRUSTERS:

THE THROTTLE AND THRUSTER DISPLAY IS REPLICATED IN EACH CORNER OF THE
SCREEN,SHOWING THE POSITIONING ON YOUR CRAFT. THE THROTTLE PART WILL ILLUMINATE
TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH POWER YOUR ENGINES ARE OUTPUTTING. THE THRUSTER ELEMENTS
WILL BECOME ACTIVE WHEN YOU TURN,FLIP OR ROLL.

2.  MAP RADAR:

THIS IS A MINITURE 3D MAP OF YOUR LOCAL AREA,WITH YOU AT THE CENTRE.ENEMY CRAFT
ARE OVERLAID AS DOTS. A FULL MAP SHOWING ALL THE TUNNELS YOU HAVE FLOWN THROUGH
CAN BE SEEN BY CLICKING ON THE `ACTION` TRIANGLE IN THE CORNER OF THE MAP
RADAR.(THIS IS THE LARGEST SCREEN TO THE LEFT OF THE MAIN SCREEN..AND THE
ACTION TRIANGLE IS THE SMALL TRIANGLE..TOP LEFT OF THIS)

SECT 2.1

EXTRA INFO---MAP:

THE NAVIGATION COMPUTER ON THE `MAGIC FLY` HAS AN AUTO MAPPING FUNCTION. THIS
WILL HELP YOU TO ORIENTATE YOURSELF IN THE TUNNEL SYSTEM AND GAUGE YOUR
PROGRESS. ONLYTUNNELS YOU HAVE FLOWN THROUGH ARE SHOWN ON THE MAP. WHEN YOU
ACTIVATE THE MAP THE CENTRE OF THE MAP DISPLAY SHOWS THE CURRENT POSITION OF
THE `MAGIC FLY`. YOUR CORDINATES (X,Y AND Z UNDER CURSOR) ARE ALSO SHOWN AS ARE
THE CORDINATES OF THE LAST DOCKING BAY YOU ENTERED. CLICK THE ARROW ICONS TO
SCROLL  

THE MAP IN ONE OF SIX DIRECTIONS. IN REPRESENTING THIS 3D WORLD ON A 2D SCREEN,
THE TUNNELS TRAVELLING IN EACH OF THE 3 PLANES ARE COLOURED DIFFERENTLY, THE
LARGE 3D IMAGE ON THE LEFT IS SUPPORTED BY THREE 2D VIEWS IN THE TOP RIGHT. IF
THE POINT AT VERY CENTRE OF THE MAP IMAGES LIES ON THE TUNNEL IT IS SHOWN IN
WHITE.

TWO OTHER ICONS ARE ALSO PROVIDED,A TAKES THE MAP BACK..(SHOWN ON THE EXTRA
INFO MAP..BOTTOM RIGHT OF THE SCREEN..SQUARE NEXT TO THE DOWN KEY.)TO THE START
POSITION.(WHERE THE MAGIC FLY IS LOCATED).B GOES TO THE POSITION OF THE LAST
DOCKING BAY YOU ENTERED.(B IS SHOWN ON THE EXTRA INFO SCREEN..FAR RIGHT HAND
SIDE..3 CENTRAL SQUARES.

3.

CURRENT WEAPON:

THIS IS BOTH A WEAPONS SELECTOR AND INDICATOR SHOWING THE QUANTITY OF AN ITEM
YOU ARE CARRYING(EXCEPT FOR LASER BOLTS OF WHICH YOU HAVE A LIMITED SUPPLY.) TO
CHANGE CURRENT WEAPON CLICK ON THE TRIANGLES LOCATED ABOVE AND BELOW CURRENT
WEAPON..(SHOWN ON MAIN SCREEN TOP LEFT CORNER .2ND BOX DOWN--HAS A TRIANGLE
ABOVE AND BELOW IT)..THIS WILL CYCLE THROUGH YOUR AVAILABE WEAPONS. THE
QUANTITY OF EACH TYPE OF WEAPON AVAILABLE IS INDICATED BY THE NUMBER OF RED
DOTS BELOW THE WEAPON NAME.

THE ONLY WEAPONS WHICH ARE ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE ARE LASRES. THESE HAVE UNLIMITED
SHOTS AS LONG AS THE LASER UNIT REMAINS UNDAMAGED AND YOU HAVE THE ENERGY TO
FIRE THEM.(SEE ENERGY SECTION)

ALL OTHER WEAPONS ARE CARRIED IN THE MULTI-VARIOUS LAUNCHER. THIS CAN CARRY A
LIMITED NUMBER OF SPECIAL WEAPONS. YOU WILL FIND THESE WEAPONS STORED IN THE
DOCKING BAY,IF YOU WANT TO FAMILIARISE YOURSELF WITH WHAT EACH WEAPON LOOKS
LIKE, USE THE ACTION TRIANGLE TO GET`EXTRA INFO` ON WEAPONS. THE ONLY OTHER
TIME YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO VIEW THEM IS WHEN THEY ARE FIRED AT YOU!.

THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE WEAPONS ARE:

LASERS   1,2, AND 3    -/- CAT
MISSILES 1,2, AND 3    -/- WEB
MINES    1 AND 2       -/- ATOMIC SLEDGEHAMMER

AS A PARTICULAR WEAPON IS SELECTED THE TARGETTING SYSTEM WHICH OVERLAYS THE
TARGETING WINDOW WILL CHANGE TO REFLECT THE TYPE OF DEPLOYMENT THE WEAPON HAS.
SOME WEAPONS ARE NOT TARGETED.

AT THE START OF THE GAME YOU WILLONLY HAVE LASERS AND MISSILES. YOU CAN REPLACE
THE MISSILES FROM THE STICK PILES WHICH ARE ACCESED THROUGH THE DOCKING BAYS.

IN ADDITION TO ALL THE DESTRUCTIVE ITEMS YOU HAVE,YOU ALSO HAVE THE SCANNER,
THIS HAS NO OFFENSIVE CAPABILITY BUT IS USED TO COLLECT DATA ABOUT THE SHIPS
YOU ENCOUNTER..(PART OF YOUR MISSION) ANY SHIP WHICH IS SUCCESFULLY SCANNED CAN
BE VIEWED IN THE DATABASE. THIS WILL GIVE YOU INFORMATION ON HOW TO FLY AND
COMBAT THE CRAFT THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR COMPLETION OF MAGIC FLY.

3.1

EXTRA INFO-WEAPONS:

ALL THE AVAILABLE WEAPONS ARE SHOWN HERE IN 3D. TO CHANGE THE SELECTED WEAPON
CLICK ON THE WEAPON DISPLAYED DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN. THE CHOSEN
WEAPON CAN BE ROTATED THROUGH VARIOUS POSITIONS BY CLICKING ON THE ROTATE
ICONS,LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. THE WEB CANNOT BE ROTATED, AND THE
SCANNER CANNOT BE VIEWED, AS IT IS PART OF YOUR SHIP, AND NOT A WEAPON.

4

DAMAGE CONTROL:

THIS PART OF THE MAIN SCREEN DE[PICTS A VIEW OF YOUR SHIP. WHEN ONE OR MORE
SEGMENTS FLASH THIS MEANS YOU HAVE SUSTAINED DAMAGE IN THOSE AREAS. IF YOU WISH
TO ACCESS THE DAMAGE OR ACTIVATE THE DAMAGE CONTROL SYSTEMS,CLICK ON THE DAMAGE
CONTROL ACTION TRIANGLE(ON THE FAR RIGHT OF THE SCREEN..HAS A PICCY OF THE FLY
IN IT)...

4.1

EXTRA INFO--DAMAGE CONTROL

FROM THE SMALL INDICATOR ON THE MAIN SCREEN YOU WILL KNOW IF YOUR CRAFT IS
DAMAGED. THE EXTRA INFO FOR THE DAMAGE CONTROL WILL TELL YOU HOW BADLY EACH
AREA ID DAMAGED AND ALSO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SET REPAIR SYSTEMS TO CURE
THE DAMAGE. THE REPAIR SYSTEMS CAN BE SET TO ONE OF FOUR
LEVELS:PRIORITY-/-HIGH-/-LOW-/- OR FORGET(LEAVE DAMAGED).SET THE DESIRED LEVEL;
OF REPAIR BY CLICKING ALONGSIDE THE DAMAGED PART IN THE APPROPIATE COLMN. THE
REPAIR SYSTEM HAS A LIMIED AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, BY SETTING HIGH OR LOW LEVELS
OF REPAIR YOU ARE SPECIFYOING THE PROPORTION OF THE EFFECT WHICH GOES INTO
REPAIRING THE SYSTEM. THE PRIORITY SETTING WILL SET ALL OTHER REAPAIRS TO
FORGET, WITH ALL THE REPAIR RESOURCES GOING INTO FIXING THAT ITEM.

FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE PRECISELY YOU ARE DAMAGED, THE SCREEN
DISPLAYS A 3D MODEL OF THE MAGIC FLY WHICH CAN ROTATE. OVERLAID ON THIS ARE
YELLOW CIRCLES WHICH SHOW THE SITE AND EXTENT OF DAMAGE.

EXTRA INFO SCREEN--DAMAGE CONTROL:

HERE`S A DESCRIPTION OF THIS SCREEN:

LETTERS P/H/L/F ..TOP RIGHT OF THE SCREEN....GIVEREPAIR SETTINGS....THESE ARE
P = PRIORITY....H = HIGH....L = LOW....F = FORGET.

THE ICONS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE ARE ALL THE FLYS SYSTEMS..AS DESCRIBED CLICK
ON THE SMALL BOX(FAR RIGHT) TO CHOOSE REPAIR LEVEL.

THE ICONS RUNNING FROM THE BOTTOM LEFT OF THE SCREEN(THERE ARE 7 OF THEM)
(OF WHICH THE FIRST 6 OF THEM ARE THE ARE ROTATE ICONS) THE LAST IN THE LINE IS
TO RESET TO THE STARTIN POSITION.

5.

ENERGY BANKS:

THIS GIVES YOU A GRAPHICAL DISPLAY OF YOUR CURRENT ENERGY STATUS.(RIGHT HAND
SIDE OF SCREEN..2ND ROW..SET OF THREE ICONS)THESE ARE THE 3 MAIN TANKS..WITH
THE NEXT ICON ALONG BEING THE RESERVE. AS YOU USE ENERGY, THE TANKS WILL EMPTY
FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. WHEN YOU HAVE NO ENERGY LEFT, THE MAGIC FLY WILL SELF
DESTRUCT. THE TECHNOLGY IS TO SENSITIVE TO BE LEFT FLOATING AROUND. REFUREL
WITH ENERGY AT DOCKING BAYS.

5.1

EXTRA INFO--ENERGY

TO CHECK THE FUEL STATUS OF THE MAGIC FLY, REFER TO THE EXTRA INFO-ENERGY
SCREEN, THIS SHOWS EXACTLY HOW MUCH FLYING TIME IS LEFT AT THE CURRENT LEVEL OF
POWER USE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY UNITS USED BY VARIOUS
SYSTEMS AND WEAPONS IS ALSO DISPLAYED.

THE ENERGY SHOWN FOR WEAPONS IS THE AMOUNT EXPENDED PER SHOT. THE ENREGY SHOWN
FOR SCANNER-/-TURBO-/-ECM AND SYSTEMS IS THE AMOUNT EXPENDED DURING EACH MINUTE
OF USE. IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DE-ACTIVATE THE FRONT AND
REAR SHEILDS. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CLICKING ON THE SHEILD VALUES ABOVE AND
BELOW THE SHIP GRAPHIC. BY DROPPING THE SHIELDS, YOU WILL PROLONG FLIGHT TIME
AND THIS MAY ALSO GIVE YOU ENERGY TO REPAIR OR FIRE WEAPONS. BUT
BEWARE--IF YOU HIT AN OBSTRUCTION OR ARE STRUCK BY A WEAPON WITH YOUR SHEILDS
LOWERED, THE MAGIC FLY MAY BE DESTROYED.

6.

ZONE INDICATOR:

THE MAGIC FLY IS NAVIGATED THROUGH JUNCTIONS BY MEANS OF `ZONE FLYING` THIS
INSTRUMENT SHOWS YOU WHICH ZONE YOU ARE IN.(OCTANGAL TYPE SHAPE..AT BOTTOM
RIGHT OF THE MAIN SCREEN)
TO MAKE NAVIGATION OF MAGIC FLY AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE, ZONE FLYING HAS BEEN
DESIGNED. THIS MEANS THAT IT IS NOT NECCESARY TO TURN CORNERS, AS THE
NAVIGATION COMPUTER WILL DO THIS FOR YOU. ALL THAT THE PILOT NEEDS TO DO IS TO
GET THE MAGIC FLY INTO THE CORRECT ZONE AND MAKE THE TURN HE WANTS.

IMAGINE THE TUNNEL IS SPLIT INTO 5 ZONES..TOP-/-LEFT-/-RIGHT-/-BOTTOM AND
MIDDLE. BY FLYING IN ONE OF THESE ZONES YOU ARE MAKING THE DECISION AS TO WHICH
DIRECTION YOU WISH TO GO AT ANY INTERSECTION.FLYING THE TOP ZONE WOULD BE
SELECTING THE EXIT UPWARDS IF A TUNNEL GOES IN THAT DIRECTION AT THE NEXT
JUNCTION.

TO HELP YOU GET ACQUAINTED WITH USING THE ZONES, A ZONE INDICATOR IS LOCATED ON
THE MAIN SCREEN, THIS ILLUMINATES THE CURRENT ZONE AND ALSO SHOWS YOUR POSITION
WITHIN THE ZONE. IF YOU ROLL THE SHIP, THE ZONE INDICATOR MOVES WITH YOU.

WHILE MOVING BETWEN TUNNELS(AT A JUNCTION OR KINK) YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE
MAGIC FLY, UNTIL YOU ENTER THE NEXT TUNNEL SECTION. THE DISABLING OF THE
CONTROL AND WEAPON LAUNCHING IS FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION.

7.

DOCKING AID:

TO REPLENISH YOUR FUEL TANKS AND WEAPONS, YOU MUST FIND AND USE THE DOCKING
BAYS LOCATED WITHIN THE TUNNEL COMPLEX. THE DOCKING AID WILL GIVE YOU A VISUAL
AND AUDIABLE SIGNAL WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SAME TUNNEL AS A DOCKING BAY.
DEPENDING ON THE DISTANCE FROM THE BAY, THE AID WILL PING AT A VARYING RATE.
THE CLOSER THE PINGS ARE, THE NEARER YOU ARE TO THE DICKING BAY,IF THE SOUND IS
CONTINUOUS AND THE INDICATOR IS STILL, THEN YOU ARE DIRECTLY ABOVE THE DOCKING
BAY, A BLUE DOOR IN THE FLOOR OF THE TUNNEL.

FROM THIS POSITION YOU CAN AUTO DOCK..ENTER THE BAY,REFUEL,REPAIR AND REARM AND
ALSO SAVE THE GAME.

8.

TURBO COUNTDOWN:

THE ENGINES OF THE MAGIC FLY HAVE A SPECIAL MODIFICATION FOR TURBO SPEED. THIS
IS AN ULTRA HIGH SPEED ESCASPE OR PURSUIT MODE. IT DOES HOWEVER HAVE ITS
DRAWBACKS. THE TURBO MUST REACH A SET PRESSURE LEVEL IN THE ENGINE BEFORE IT IS
ENGAGED. IT TAKES APPROX 5 SECONDS TO ACHIEVE `TURBO` PRESSURE BEFORE IT IS
ENGAGED. IT TAKES 5 SECONDS TO SHUT DOWN AND DISENGAE. FOR THIS REASON WE
RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE TURBO IN AREAS WHERE YOU KNOW THE LAYOUT OF THE
TUNNELS..ONCE THE TURBO COUNTDOWN HAS BEEN STARTED IT CANNOT BE ABORTED. YOUR
TURBO FIRE AND SPED OF THE FLY WILL INCREASE DRAMATICALLY..IN ORDER TO HELP YOU
JUDGE TURBI IGNITION, THE 5 SECOND PRESSURISATION AND SHUTDOWN PERIODS ARE
DISPLAYED AS A COUNTDOWN  IN THE TURBO AREA OF THE MAIN SCREEN(JUST BELOW
RADAR..SHOWN AS A SEXTANGOL SHAPE) IF YOU HAVE A COLLISION WHILST USING TURBO
SPEED, THE TURBO WILL AUTOMATICALLT SHUTDOWN TO PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE TO YOUR
SHIP.

9.

COMBAT INDICATORS:

THE SIX COMBAT INDICATORS ARE WARNING LIGHTS TO HIGHLIGHT CERTAIN SITUATIONS.
THESE ARE:

LIGHT 1.  MISSILE 1 OR 2 IS COMING IN YOUR DIRECTION.

LIGHT 2.  A MINE IS NEAR YOUR SHIP.

LIGHT 3.  THE `CAT` IS FIRING.

LIGHT 4.  MISSILE 3 HAS BEEN FIRED AT YOU.

LIGHT 5.  A WEB IS NEAR YOUR SHIP.

LIGHT 6.  ECM (ELECTRONIC COUNTER MEASURES) IS ACTIVE.

ACTIVATING ECM SENDS OUT A PULSE OF ENERGY, ANY GUIDED MISSILE ENTERING THIS
PULSE WILL BECOME CONFUSED. THE MOST LIKELY RESULT IS THAT THE MISSILE WILL
TRAVEL ON IN A STRAIGHT LINE. THUS GIVING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE OUT OF ITS
PATH. SOMETIMES THE EFFECT IS LESS PREDICTABLE. EACH USE OF THE `ECM` WILL USE
A LARGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY.

10.

TARGETTING WINDOW:

IN THE CENTRE OF THE MAIN SCREEN IS THE TARGETTING WINDOW, THROUGH WHICH YOU
CAN VIEW OUT OF THE MAGIC FLY.THROUGH THE TARGETTING WINDOW YOU WILL SEE A
COMPUTER ENHANCED IMAGE WHICH ENABLES YOU TO VIEW THE TUNNEL STRUCTURE AS A
TRANSPARENT. THIS MAKES SEING ENEMY SHIPS AND OBSTACLES EASIER. YOU CAN
ACTIVATE NORMAL VISION, BUT IN THIS TYPE OF ENVIROMENT WE SUGGEST YOU USE
ENHANCED VISION FOR FIGHTING. ENHANCED VISION IS THE DEFAULT MODE.
THE TARGETTING WINDOW IS OVERLAID WITH LINE GRAPHICS WHICH ARE THERE TO HELP
YOU FLY THE SHIP AND TARGET WEAPONS. DEPENDING WHICH WEAPON YOU HAVE SELECTED,
A TARGETTING CROSS WILL APPEAR IN VARIOUS SHAPES AND SIZES. THE DEFAULT WEAPON
IS THE LASER. IF YOU EXPERIMENT WITH THE LASER YOU WILL DISCOVER THE LASERS
ALWAYS FIRE IN THE DIRECTION MARKED BY THE CENTRE OF THE TARGETTING WINDOW. THE
TARGETTING CROSS IS USED TO LINE THE SHIP UP WITH THE TARGET. SO AIM YOU
SHIP--NOT THE WEAPONS.

DUE TO THE LAYOUT OF MAGIC FLYS LAYOUT,LASERS CAN FIRE IN EITHER
DIRECTION(FRONT OR REAR) MISSILES ALWAYS FIRE IN EITHER DIRECTION FORWARDS AND
MOST OF THE SUPER WEAPONS FIRE BACKWARDS. SWITCH TO A REAR VIEW TO TARGET
BEHIND.

11.

VIEW DIRECTION INDICATOR:

THIS SMALL INDICATOR SHOWS WHICH WAY THE VIEW FROM THE FLY IS POINTING. THE
ARROW INSIDE THE CAN POIT IN 1 OR 2 DIRECTIONS: UP FOR FRONT VIEW AND DOWN FOR
REAR VIEW.

12.

DATABASE:

ALL THE DATA COLLECTED WHEN AN ENEMY SHIP IS SCANNED AND STORED IN A DATABASE,
WHERE YOU MAY VIEW IT AT YOUR LIESURE. FILLING THE DATABASE IS ONE OF YOUR
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES AS IT WILL GIVE YOU THE INVALUABLE INFORMATION IF YOU FACE
THAT ENEMY AGAIN.

12.1

EXTRA INFO--DATABASE

WHEN EVER A SHIP IS SCANNED IT WILL BE SCANNED AND STORED IN THE DATABASE,
CLICK ON A SHIP IN THE GRID TO SHOW ALL INFORMATION GATHERED BY THE SCAN. THIS
INCLUDES A 3D MODEL OF THE SHIP WHICH YOU MAY EXAMINE BY USE OF THE 3D MODEL
OF THE SHIP WHICH YOU MAY EXAMINE BY USE OF THE ROTATE ICONS AT THE BOTTOM LEFT
OF THE SCREEN. TO BEGIN WITH THE ONLY SHIP STORED IS YOURS.

13.

FAILURE INDICATOR:

IF AT ANY TIME YOU ATTEMPT TO LAUNCH A WEAPON YOU DONT HAVE OR FIRE A LASER
WHICH IS DAMAGED AND THE FLY CANNOT CARRY OUT THAT OPERATION, THE `X` ON THE
FAILURE INDICATOR WILL FLASH TO SIGNAL A FAILED OPERATION. THIS MAY BE DUE TO A
FAILED WEAPON OR NOT BEING ABLE TO INCREASE IN SPEED DUE TO DAMAGED ENGINES.

FULL SCREEN:

THE MAIN SCREEN HAS AN ALTERNATIVE MODE FOR THOSE MAGIC FLY PILOTS WHO WANT  A
FULL SCREEN IMAGE WHEN HUNTING DOWN THEIR PREY. THE FULL SCREEN MODE MAKES THE
WHOLE SCREEN AN EXTERNAL VIEW.

TO GIVE THE BEST VIEW,ONLY LIMITED INFORMATION IS OVERLAID ONTO THIS SCREEN,
THE 12 AREAS ON THE MAIN SCREEN ARE REDUCED TO A VITAL 4.

-/- WEAPON INDICATOR
-/- PROBE DOCKING AID
-/- TURBO COUNTDOWN
-/-TARGETTING

FLIGHT AND ACCESS:

FROM THE MAIN SCREEN YOU CAN TOGGLE BETWEEN TWO DISTINCT MODES--FLIGHT AND
ACCESS. IN `FLIGHT` MOD4E THE MOUSE MOVEMENT CHANGES THE ATTITUDE OF THE MAGIC
FLY AND ENABLES YOU TO FLY THE CRAFT. IF LASERS ARE YOUR CURRENT WEAPONS, THE
TARGET IN THE CENTRE OF THE SCREEN WILL MOVE WITH THE MOUSE AND THE CRAFT WILL
PITCH AND YAW IN RESPONSE. IN THE `ACCESS` MODE A POINTER APPEARS WHICH ENABLES
YOU TO CLICK ON ONE OF THE 5 ACTION TRIANGLES ON THE MAIN SCREEN. THESE TAKES
YOU TO ONE OF 5 SUB SCREENS DISPLAYING IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

THE FLIP:

AS MAGIC FLY USES `ZONE` FLYING YOU HAVE NO NORMAL WAY OF REVERSING YOUR ROUTE
SHOULD YOU TAKE A WRONG TURN OR ENTER A DEAD END. TO CHANGE A DIRECTION IN A
TUNNEL, YOU CAN FLIP THE FLY OVER AND MOVE OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.THIS
REQUIRES PERFECT TIMING AND ENGINE CONTROL. SO THE NAVIGATION COMPUTER HANDLES
THIS IN THE SAME WAY AS MOVING THROUGH JUNCTIONS. AGAIN ALL CONTROL AND WEAPONS
ARE DISABLED FOR YOUR SAFETY.

THIS MANOEUVRE CAN BE A LIFE SAVER WHEN BEING PURSUED BY ENEMY FLYING CRAFT.
HOWEVER BE CAREFUL, IF YOU FLIP WITH AN ENEMY CRAFT TOO CLOSE IT MAY NOT BE
ABLE TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION AND WILL COLLIDE WITH YOU.

WEAPONS:

EACH OF THE DIFFERENT WEAPONS FIRED BY THE MACIG FLY HAS A DIFFERENT EFFECT IN
THE TERMS OF ITS DESTRUCTIVE CAPABILITY. SOME ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AGAINST GROUND
TARGETS AND OTHERS MORE EFFECTIVE AGAINST AIRBORNE CRAFT. THROUGH
EXPERIMENTATION YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK WHICH DEVICE SUITS A GIVEN SITUATION
BEST. THE NUMBER TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF EACH WEAPON INDICATES THE ENERGY
LEVEL REQUIRED TO FIRE THE WEAPON.

LASERS:

THE LASE CANNON MOUNTED UNDER THE NOSE OF THE MAGIC FLY FIRE PAIRS OF LASER
BOLTS IN THREE POWER SETTINGS WHICH ARE SELECTED BY USING LASERS..1/2 AND
3..LASER BOLTS WILL BOUNCE OFF SMOOTH SURFACES SO AVOID FIRING AT WALLS
DIRECTLY AHEAD OF YOU.

AS WELL AS PERFORMING A DESTRUCTIVE FUNCTION, LASERS ARE USED TO ACTIVATE SOME
TUNNEL STRUCTURES. THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY NEEDED AND THE RESULT OF THE ACTIVATION
IS SPECIFIC TO THE STRUCTURE.

REMEMBER--USING LASER 3 ALL THE TIME MAY NOT BE NECESSARY AND IT DRAINS YOUR
ENERGY. THE LASERS ALWAYS FIRE DIRECTLY AHEAD, SO HIT A TARGET YOU WILL HAVE TO
POSITION IN THE CENTRE OF THE TARGETTING AREA. SOMETIMES IT IS EASIER TO
ATTEMPT `DEFLECTION` SHOTS THAN GET A DIRECT ALIGNMENT WITH GROUND TARGETS.

MISSILE 1: UNGUIDED.

MISILE 1 IS AN UNGUIDED HIGH EXPLOSIVE DEVICE. IT ALWAYS FIRES IN THE DIRECTION
THE FLY IS POINTING. IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE AGAINST SLOW GROUND TARGETS.

MISILE 2: PROXIMITY MISILE.

THIS PROXIMITY MISSILE WILL SENSE THE ENERGY FEILD OF ANY ENEMY CRAFT AND
EXPLODE. IF SEVERAL SHIPS ARE CLOSE TOGETHER YOU HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF HITTING
MORE THAN ONE WITH THIS WEAPON.

MISSILE 3: GUIDED MISSILE

THIS IS A GUIDED VERSION OF MISSILE 1..TO LOCK THE MISSILE ONTO A SPECIFIC
TARGET YOU MUST COVER THE TARGET WITH THE TARGETTING CROSS AND HOLD IT OVER THE
TARGET UNTIL THE MISSILE IS LOCKED. WHEN THE CROSS IS FIRST PLACED OVER THE
ENEMY CRAFT YOU WILL HEAR A BEEP, DURING THIS TIME A SECOND TARGETTING CROSS
WILL MOVE OUT FROM THE RIGHT OF THE DISPLAY. IF THIS REACHES YOUR FIRST
TARGETTING CROSS THE TWO WILL COMBINE TO INDICATE THAT THE MISSILE IS LOCKED ON
TARGET.
ONCE LOCKED THE MISSILE CAN BE FIRED. THE PERCENATGE OF MISSES WITH THIS WEAPON
IS VERY SMALL.

MINE 1:  LIMPET MINE

THE LIMPET MINE IS DROPPED FROM THE REAR OF THE FLY AND THEN ATTACHES ITSELF TO
THE NEAREST SURFACE. ONCE IN POSITION THE MINE WILL THEN ARM ITSELF AND WAIT
FOR THE CRAFT TO COME NEAR BEFORE EXPLODING. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED THAT YOU
DROP THIS WEAPON AND THEN PERFORM THE FLIP.

MINE 2:  SPINY NORMAN.

THE MINE IS LAUNCHED AN A CUBE PACKAGE. ONCE AWAY FROM THE RELEASING CRAFT IT
GROWS LONG SPINES, IF THE SPINES ARE TOUCHED, THE MINE EXPLODES.

CAT:

THE CAT IS A FORM OF AUTOMATIC REAR DEFENSE. ONCE ACTIVATED IT WILL POSITION
ITSELF BEHIND THE FLY AND ACT AS AN AUTOMATIC REAR GUNNER. IT HAS A SHOT
MECHANISM LIMITED TO 100 ROUNDS.

WEB:

THERE MAY BE AN OCCASION WHEN YOU WANT TO BLOCK A TUNNEL, THE WEB IS FIRED FROM
THE BACK OF THE FLY AND EXPANDS TO FORM A TUNNEL WIDE BARRIER. ANY CRAFT FLYING
INTO THE WEB WILL BECOME ENTANGLED, THAT IS IF NOT DESTROYED BY THE INTIAL
COLLISION.

ATOMIC SLEDGEHAMMER:

A WEAPON OF ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION, ONE OF THESE DEVICES IS CAPABLE OF DESTROYING
THE ENTIRE TUNNEL COMPLEX, BY LOCATING THE NUCLEAR STOCKPILE AND ACTING AS A
TRIGGER TO DETONATE IT. THE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS BUILT INTO THE HAMMER WILL TRY
TO FIND THE EXACT CENTRE OF THE COMPLEX BEFORE DETONATION. TO HELP YOU IN THIS
TASK A CLOCK COUNTDOWN BEGINS ONCE THE HAMMER IS RELEASED.

SCANNER:

USE THE SCANNER TO EXAMINE ENEMY CRAFT. THE INFORMATION  THE SCANNER GLEANS
WILL THEN BE STORED IN THE DATABASE FOR YOU TO REFER TO, THIS GIVES YOU A
INVALUABLE INFORMATION ON YOUR ENEMIES AND WILL ALLOW YOU TO FIGHT THAM MORE
EFFECIENTLY..REMEMBER PART OF YOUR MISSION BRIEF IS TO BRING BACK AS MUCH
INFORMATION ABOUT THE CETI-TRIADS SHIPS AS POSSIBLE.

DOCKING BAY PROCEDURES:

YOU CANNOT ENTER THE DOCKING BAYS IN `FLIGHT MODE` SWITCH TO ACCESS MODE
BVEFORE YOU ATTEMPY TO DOCK. ONCE YOU HAVE ENTERED A DOCKING BAY A PROBE IS
LAUNCHED TO COMMUNICATE YOUR NEEDS. IT IS SPHERICAL IN APPEARENCE AND FLOATS
OUTSIDE THE FLY. DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CRAFT USING THE BAYS AND
THE COMMUNICATIONS PROBLEMS BETWEEN DIFFERENT COMPUTER SYSTEMS, THIS PROVED TO
BE THE MOST RELIABLE MEANS OF SERVICING ALL CRAFT. THE DOCKING BAY PROBE WILL
FLOAT IN FRONT OF YOUR TARGETTING CROSS UNTIL YOU FIRE. IT WILL THEN FLY TO THE
END OF THE DOCKING BAY AND BOUNCE OFF THE WALL. THE PROBE IS USED TO MAKE
CHOICES AND ACTIVATE SYSTEMS. THE DOCKING BAY HAS A SELECTION SCREEN AT EITHER
END EACH WITH UNIQUE OPTIONS TO SELECT.

FORWARD VIEW:

HAS TWO OPTIONS:  REFUEL AND COMMUNICATIONS..IF YOU ACTIVATE REFUELING THE
SCREEN WILL DISPLAY~REFUELING IN PROGRESS~ UNTIL THE TRANSFER OF FUEL IS
COMPLETE.

REAR VIEW:

WHILE YOUR WAITING FOR THE ENERGY TO COME ONBOARD YOU MAY WANT TO RESTOCK
WEAPONS. THE SUPPLY OF YOUR CRAFT IS DONE THROUGH THE REAR SCREEN.
YOU AGAIN HAVE TWO OPTIONS: REPAIR AND REARM.

THE REPAIR SYSTEMS IN A DOCKING BAY WILL QUICKLY RESTORE ALL DAMAGED AREAS TO
100% FUNCTIONALITY.

THE REARM OPTION IS YOUR MEANS OF REPLACING YOUR MISSILES AND OTHER WEAPONS. IT
OFFERS YOU TWO CHOICES: MISSILES AND SPECIAL. MOST DOCKING BAYS WILL HAVE SOME
MISSILES OF THE THREE STANDARD TYPES. YOU CAN LOAD THESE ONBOARD IF YOU WISH BY
CHOOSING THE MISSILE TYPE YOU WANT. YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH A SCREEN SHOWING
THE NUMBER OF MISSILES IN STOCK. BY USING THE PROBE ON THE `DOWN ARROW` YOU CAN
MOVE ONE MISSILE INTO YOUR SHIP. IF YOU WANT TO DUMP MISSILES IN PREFERENCE FOR
OTHER ITEMS, YOU CAN MOVE MISSILES FROM THE FLY TO THE BAY BY USING THE UP
ARROW.

IF YOU CHOOSE TO LOAD SPECIAL WEAPONS YOU WILL BE INFORMED OF WHICH TYPE IS
AVAILABLE, EACH DOCKING BAY ONLY CARRIERS ONE SPECIAL ITEM IN STOCK AT ANY ONE
TIME.
THE MULTI VARIOUS WEAPON LAUNCHER CAN ONLY CARRY A LIMITED NUMBER OF EACH
NUMBER, USUALLY TEN. YOU CAN LEAVE THE DOCKING BAY AT ANY TIME, THOUGH IF YOU
LEAVE BEFORE REPAIR AND REFUELLING ARE COMPLETE YOU WILL HAVE AN UNPREPARED
CRAFT.

LEAVING THE BAY:

ONCE YOU HAVE MADE THE REPAIRS AND REFUELLED YOU WILL WANT TO CONTINUE YOUR
MISSION. YOU CAN EITHER PRESS THE `DOCKING BAY EJECT` KEY OR OPEN THE DOORS
WITH THE EXIT BUTTON, EITHER WAY YOU WILL BE PLACED BACK IN THE TUNNEL READY TO
CONTINUE YOUR MISSION.

THE ENEMY:

WITHIN THE TUNNEL COMPLEX YOU WILL ENCOUNTER A WIDE RANGE OF ENEMY CRAFT, THEY
WILL RANGE IN THEIR OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE CAPABILITIES, BY USING THE SCANNER
AND DATABASE YOU CAN IDENTIFY DANGEROUS CRAFT AND TAKE SUITABLE ACTION. THE
HARDWARE OF THE CETI-TRIAD FALLS INTO 5 CATEGORIES.

-/- AIRBORNE ASSAULT
-/- GROUND ASSAULT
-/- GROUND DEFENSES
-/- AIRBORNE RECONNAISSANCE
-/- GROUND RECONNAISSANCE

AIRBORNE ASSAULT:

THE MAJORITY OF CRAFT ARE AIRBORNE CRAFT, GIVEN THAT THEY WERE MAINLY DESIGNED
FOR SPACE AND HIGH ATMOSPHERE WORK, THEY CAN MANOEUUVRE REMARKABLY WELL IN THE
CONFINMES OF THE TUNNEL. THEY WILL USE THE HIT AND RUN TACTICS TO WEAR YOU
DOWN, AS WELL AS MULTIPLE ATTACKS FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. DO NOT EXPECT AN
UNDER GUNNED FIGHTER TO TURN AND RUN, HE IS MORE LIKELY TO TO GO `HEAD TO HEAD`
OR LEAD YOU INTO AN AMBUSH. MOST FLYING SHIPS  CAN FIRE LASERS AND MISSILES.
THE AMOUNT OF PUNISHMENT THEY CAN TAKE IS VERY MUCH DEPENDENT ON THE TYPE OF
CRAFT. SOME OF THE `HEAVY ASSAULT` FIGHTERS CAN TAKE AS MUCH DAMAGE AS GROUND
BASED CRAFT.

AIRBORNE RECONNASSIANCE

IN SUPPORT OF THE AIRBORNE FIGHTERS ARE AIRBORNE RECONNASSANCE, KNOWN AS AR
SHIPS, THESE PATROL ALL PARTS OF THE COMPLEX LOOKING FOR YOU. IF YOU COME
ACROSS AN AR SHIP AND IT ESCAPES, THEN THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE FIGHTERS
WILL BE DESPATCHED TO YOUR PRESENT LOCATION.

GROUND ASSAULT:

THESE CRAFT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL FIREPOWER AND ARE HEAVILY ARMOURED, THEY ARE
LOCATED AROUND SENSITIVE AREAS AS GUARDS, THEY FIRE LASERS,MISSILES,WEBS AND
MINES...THE RATE OF FIRE ON SOME IS SO HIGH THAT YOU IF DO NOT SUCCEED IN
DESTROYING THE CRAFT ON THE FIRST PASS YOU MAY NOT GET THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
ANOTHER. IF THE CRAFT IS A `WALKER` THE LEGS AND UNDERBELLY ARE THE BEST
TARGET.

GROUND RECONNASSAINCE:

THE GR CRAFT ARE  SCOUT AND SUPPLY PLATFORMS, THEY MOVE THROGHOUT THE COMPLEX,
SOME ARE AUTOMATED. AS WLELL AS SUPPLYING THE DOCKING BAYS, THEY ALSO GATHER
INFORMATION IN A SIMILAR FASHION AS THE AR SHIPS. THOUGH THEY MAKE GOOD TARGET
PRACTISE, DESTROYING TO MANY GR SHIPS MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO GET WEAPONS
FROM THE DOCKING BAYS.

GROUND DEFENSE:

TO BACK UP THE GROUND ASSAULT CRAFT SOME LOCATIONS HAVE A LASER TURRETS AND
OTHER DEFENSIVE STRUCTURES. THEY ARE OFTEN PLACED NEAR DOORS OR OTHER
OBSTRUCTIONS WHICH CAUSE CRAFT TO SLOW DOWN. THEY CAN PUT OUT OF ACTION BY
REPEATED USE OF LASER BOLTS.
