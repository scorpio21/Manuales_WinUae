Welcome to "MONEY CASCADE" fruit machine.
The following keyboard keys will only work while the
machine is waiting for you to insert a coin or when the
machine start button and/or the hold buttons are flashing

        F  	Switches between 2 reelspin speeds on/off

        W  	Makes machine easy & hard gambles, Most bandits
		have something that reduces payout, mine tells the machine
		to give less chance of winning Hi/Low gambles after 2 
            attempt, so I have let you switch it ON or OFF.

  D  or  P	Puts machine in demo or pause mode, like a normal 
		machine it has flashing lights attract feature,

                The art of good  skilful machine playing is knowing 
                the reels. So being a caring person I have let you see 
                them to learn more quickly,
                -----------------------------------------------------

M O D I F I C A T I O N S
==========================

FIRSTLY  CAUTION!

MONEY CASCADE REQUIRES EVERY BIT OF MEMORY TO RUN.
So any external DISK DRIVES or other devices must be REMOVED,
Before running this game. 
So if you have anything connected:- 
SWITCH OFF your AMIGA now! and remove anything connected.
Then reboot this game.

NOW WORKS ON A HARD DRIVE
HOW TO INSTALL MONEY CASCADE ON A HARD DRIVE


Make a drawer of any name on you hard drive eg a GAMES drawer
then copy the MCPICS drawer from the Floppy into the GAMES drawer
then copy the program MCFM into the same drawer on hard drive
then copy TTTable into the same drawer on hard drive
Then if you like copy the MCFM.doc with it's icon.
don't forget to make sure PPMORE is in your Hard Drive C drawer

So there you have it, MONEY CASCADE is best run from cli for memory
conservation etc, to use it on your hard through a ICON
you must use ICONX if your short of memory.
So by copying the Run_MCFM file with it's icon  into the same GAMES
drawer as the MCFM game file, things should then be OK.

HIGH SCORE TOP TEN TABLE

It now has a high score TOP TEN table, If you want your score
recorded on the disk or HARD DRIVE then providing your disk is
NOT write protected it will record any high scores thats achieved.
If  you  want to reset TABLE then delete TTTable file using DOS or
some directory copy utility such as Disk Master/Sid or OPus

GRAPHICS

machine buttons have also been graphically changed.
also other minor touches on GAME OVER screen.

OTHER MODS & REFINEMENTS March 1994

On the last two features PICK & MATCH and 5 AUTO WINS the jerky
movement of the reels have been made more smooth movements.

Sound effects have been reduced in volume & the more irritating
effects have been removed, a NEW sound effect has been added which 
is when the reels start moving MOTOR HUM SOUND,
Some very NEW more comical sound effects have been added.

The bandit pays out slightly less to try and make it more realistic.
To do this I've reduced the holds and made holds more intelligent,
EG Not to be available at the wrong times such as after a win etc. 
same also with the feature hold bulb.

The Number reel no longer spins on normal playing of the machine, 
which was really doing a pointless task on the original version.

A NEW pointer as been added and is shown only when needed.

Gambling number reel now spins faster and is less predictable,
also like a real bandit the gambling is very devious, so take
care when you gamble large amounts, the greedy lose! or for the
bad losers press 'W' to switch devious off.

The Main reels now spin slightly slower in normal play mode.

Removed 16 Fruit symbols making 18 to each reel instead
of 22 symbols in the 1st version

Now on the Pick & Match feature you have 3 attempts for wins
the early version only gave you a single attempt (MEAN eh)

Bugs removal & Modificationss June/July 1994

Major BUG removal

Repaired program crashing on high score display screen
Removed a few minor bugs that were only noticable when playing
for a long time,

Modifications

NOW requires 20p each play 
Installed AUTO HOLD
Installed selectable 2 reelspin speeds
Installed selectable Easy/Hard gamble feature option
Installed Restart option
Installed KEY used help screen 
Modified all screen displays
Player names length from 5 to 7 letters wide
Now works with shift lock on/off 
Removed the need of a disk font, now uses it's own built in fonts.
Now it has it's own built in AMOS.libray

For Your Benefit

I have made the machine load it's samples from the disc
Rather than have them built in, this enables you to change
Them, You Need AMOS to do that, All pics & Samples are stored
on the disc as Amos Banks.

Also because this is licenceware I have included the source
code on the disc,

Write to me anytime, send me a donation if you like.
