THE MANIX MENU
---------------

Manix features three different styles of game - normal puzzle and 
competition.Before you start any type of game you will see a map layout of
the entire level that you are on as well as a face next to the individual
scene in the level.There are eight scenes to complete in each level and
a total of sixteen levels to complete giving a total of one hundred and
twenty eight scenes of fun in all after completion of each level,you will
be given a password to use in the Custom Kit (see later).This will enable
you to start games from later levels.


THE PLAYERS
------------

You control a character called Fat Filbert as he constantly bounces around
an isometric 3D landscape.Note that if you have selected a two player game
then Fat Filbert will have be joined by his friend Bulbous Bilco will have
a green ball on his head and Bulbous Bilco will have a blue ball on his 
head - This is to help you identify which character is yours.

The aim of the game is to bounce around changing the colours of the 
landscape tiles - what you should aim to change them to will vary 
depending on which game type you are playing.

Every time you bounce on a land tile,the colour of the tile will change
cycling through a set pattern of tiles.If you land in water then you will
lose a file.Some tiles are slaped and will make you bounce in odd 
directions unless you are careful.

When you first start a scene,grenade bombs will fall fown onto the
landscape and blow up immediately,ruining some of the tiles around them.
Further bombs will drop throughout the game,on short fuses.Whilst you are
bouncing around changing the colour of land tiles you should eat grenade
bombs to stop them from ruining your landscape.


PLAYING THE PRESET ONE AND
TWO PLAYER GAMES
--------------------------

This is a one or two players game.When you enter a scene you will see the
landscape as it needs to be for that scene.Then a number of bombs will
drop down and explode - changing the landscape tiles around them.
Using Fat Filbert and,if you wish,his friend bulbous bilco,you must fix
the landscape back to its previous state by bouncing around the land tiles.

Whenever you bounce on a tile,the tile colour will cycle if it is not the
correct colour tile.If the tile is the correct colour it will remain the
same.Once all of the tiles have been restored,the screen will turn 
monochrome and then you will start the next scene.


PLAYING THE PUZZLE GAME
------------------------

This is a one player game only.When you enter a scene you will see the 
landscape as it needs to be for that scene.Then a number of bombs will
drop down and explode - Changing the landscape tiles around them .
Using Fat Filbert you must fix the landscape back to its previous state
by bouncing around the land tiles.

Whenever you bounce on a tile,the tile colour will cycle.Note that the tile
colour will not stop cycling when it reaches the correct colour as it does
in the normal game type.Once all the tiles have been restored to their
original pattern,the screen will turn monochrome and then you will 
start the next scene


PLAYING THE COMPETITION GAME 
-----------------------------

This is a two players game only.Before the game starts,each player will
be shawn the clour of the land tile that they must create.Then the landscape 
will appear followed by a number of bombs dropping onto it and exploding - 
ruining the landscape tiles around them.Using Fat Filbert and Bulbous Bilco,
the players must create as many of their own tiles and destroy as many of 
their opponents tiles before the timer expires.


Whenever a player bounces on a tile,the tile colour will cycle if it is not
their tile colour.If the tile is the correct colour it will remain the same.
Once the timer expires,each players tiles are counted up and the numbers
counted are shown in the players score boxes.These numbers accumulate from
the scene to scene.The winner is the player who has created the most tiles
after either player has no more remaining lives and the current scene is 
complete or when both players have lost all of their lives.


PLAYING A CUSTOM GAME
----------------------

This can be any of the game types above but with pre-set parameters
for the game set by you using the custom kit (see later).Up to eight 
(numbered 0 to 7) customized games can be set up by you.The main menu tells
you which custom game number is currently selected and what type of game it
is currently set up as.Use the F7 and F8 keys to change the custom game 
number and F6 to actually play that custom game.


EXTRA FEATURES
---------------

A variety of extra features appear in the game to either help you or hamper
your progress.As features are added scene by scene,their functions will be
described before to start of each scene.

Grenades Bombs explode after a set amount of time and the colours of the 
-------------- floors tiles around them are ruined.They can fall from the 
sky or be left around by grenade rebots.Eat them up to stop them from 
destroying the landscape.

Vikings Balls bounce around the landscape,changing the colours of tiles.If
------------- they touch you,you will lose control for an instant.You can
shoot them with the cola cans.

Ninja Balls bounce around the landscape,changing the colours of tiles.If 
----------- they touch you,you will lose a life.You can shoot them with 
cola cans.

Grenade Robots fall from the sky leaving the odd grenade bombs lying around.
--------------

Bees come down from the sky planting the odd tree here and there.Every tree
---- that a bee passes over will grow.

Spikes come out of the ground every now and then and hang around for a few
------ seconds.If you land on one,you will explode and lose a life.

Acid Pools kill you if you land on them.They appear after a potion if you
---------- don't collect it in time and will disappear after a short while
or if a tea cup is picked up.

Cola Cans are your weapons.Every time you collect a can,five of that can
type will be stacked on your can pile.Then when you fire,the top can on 
your can pile will be fired.The number of cans in your pile is shown in the
bottom left hand corner for player two.The type of can that you are about
to fire is displayed next to the number of cans.The cans are : 

Red and Green Cola Cans - these cans fly through the air.

Red Cola Cans - these cans bounce along the ground - if they hit a slope
they will bounce back.

Red and Silver Cola Cans - these cans fly right up in the air and then 
come back down and explode on the ground.In some games (see custom kit) 
these cans can kill you if they land on top of your head.

Bonus Potions can be picked up by you.There are four types of bonus potion
They are : 

Clock Potions - give you extra time on the clock.

Tick Potions - cause a tick to drop out of the sky.

Point Potions - are bad.These make all your joystick movements reverse.

Can Bins can be used to gain high bonuses.Throw cola cans into the can bins
to improve your score.

Extra Lives can be picked up for extra lives.

Tea Cups will cause everything on the landscape to go up in the air.This
can be a quick way of getting rid of bombs or an unwanted acid pool.

Coins can be picked up for bonus points.

Ticks can be picked up to correct all of the blocks around your character.

Trees grow as bees pass over them.Any tile with a tree growing on it will 
have its colour locked.To change the colour of the tile,you will need to 
bounce on the tree a number of times until it disappears.

Sea Monsters,Submarine Periscopes and Fishes float around in the water and
look interesting but they won't really affect your game.We put them in to 
cheer you up !

EDITING PARAMETERS
------------------

parameters or modify MISCELLANEOUS.You can also select the type of game
setup:- either a one player normal game,a two player normal game,a two 
player competition game or a one player puzzle game.Click on +/- to change

puzzle.Note that certain combinations are not permissable.


MODIFY ENEMY PARAMETERS
-----------------------

Click on +/- to after values.A list of chances will appear.Each chance is
the chance out of 127 (after all,a chance of 127 out of 127 would give a
100% chance!).This chance then increases every time that the player
completes a certain number of scenes (This is the single digit in the 
centre) by the amount to the right (The two digit number).

First of all the computer tests,in each game loop (1/25th of a second),
the Overall Chance to see if an enemy should appear.If an enemy should 
appear then the computer goes through the list of enemy types,one at a 
time from top to bottom,testing each chance to see if that enemy type
should appear.If the enemy type should appear,then the computer will stop
testing any more chances and will go ahead and create that enemy tyep.If
the computer manages to pass through the whole list of enemy chances 
without choosing an enemy then no enemy is created for that game loop.

Click on a box next to an enemy (its to the left).This shows you the 
information about that enemy type.When the computer decides to create an 
enemy type it must then perform some more tests and get some information
about that enemy.Firstly there is the'number on screen' value.This is the
maximum number of this enemy type allowed in the game at any one time.This
value can INCREMENT EVERY 'x' scenes by 'xx' AMOUNT.There is also a 
'starting screen' value.This is the scene number that this enemy type can
start appearing on.These values appear for each enemy type but there are 
also a number of values that are particular to an enemy type.


BALL ENEMIES - the computer will choose either a viking or ninja ball
(note that only the viking ball is shown on screen).The 'water avoiding' 
chance allows you to give them a chance of avoiding water.A chance of 127
means that they will always avoid jumping into water.The 'player following'
chance allows you to make ball enemies 'seek' players.A chance of 127 means
that they will always home in one a player.

ROBOTS ENEMIES - The 'chance to stay' value is the chance that the robot
will stay on the landscape.A chance of 127 means that the robot will not
go away once it has been created.

GRENADES - The 'fuse time' value is the amount of time (in 1/25 ths of a
second) that the grenade will stay on screen for before it blows up.Note
that the amount column is a negative number for this value.This is because
fuses get shorter and shorter to make the game tougher.

BEES ENEMIES - The 'chance to stay' chance is the chance that the bee will
stay on the landscape.A chance of 127 means that the bee will not go away
once it has been created.


MODIFY BONUS PARAMETERS
-----------------------

Bonus parameters work in the same way as enemy parameters 
(see previous section).

Click on a box next a bonus (its to the left).The 'number on screen' value
and the ' starting screen' value work the same as the enemy type values
of the same name.The 'remain time' value is the time (in 1/25ths of a 
second) that the bonus remains on the landscape before it disappears.these
values appear for each bonus type but there are also a number of values that
are particular to a bonus type.

CANS - The 'range of can 1' value is the range that can 1 (the flying red
can with the green stripe) can travel in pixels/land tiles.The 'range 
of can 2' value is the range that can 2 (the bouncy red can) can travel
in pixels/land tiles.The 'can 3 dangerous' value is either 0 or 1.0 means
that the can is not dangerous if it hits a player and 1 means that the can
is dangerous if it hits a player and 1 meansthat the can is dangerous if it
hits a player potions - the 'acid remain time' is the time that the acid 
pool,left behind when a potion disappears,will remain on screen for 
(in 1/25ths of a second).


MODIFY MISCELLANEOUS
---------------------

Two extra sets of parameters are provided on this screen - trees and 
monsters.They work in the same way as the bonus and enemy parameters.

The start screen value lets you alter the scene number that you start from.
For every eight scenes (ie every level) you will be asked to type in a 
password.This stops beginners from seeing all 128 of the scenes.

The three time values (normal,puzzle and competition) enable you to change
the time allowed (in seconds) to complete a scene in each game type.

The 'start lives' value enables you to change the number of lives that the
player starts with (note that 3 lives are always added to this figure).
