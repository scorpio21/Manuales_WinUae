				INTRODUCTION

Far away on the other side of the universe, a shining green planet is
losing it's life to the twisted followers of a mad scientist known only as
"The Muddy"! It is your job as part of the Cosmic Heli Patrol to unmask the
evil Muddy and restore the balance of nature. Use your trusty joystick to
fly Mr. Heli deep into the heart of the planet, firing missiles, bullets
and bombs at The Muddy's followers as you go. You may also use your weapons
to destroy groups of bricks and uncover as small fortune in crystals which
you may use to buy the surrounding power-ups.
