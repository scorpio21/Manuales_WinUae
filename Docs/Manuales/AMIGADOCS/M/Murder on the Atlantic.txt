                       MURDER ON THE ATLANTIC

ABOUT MURDER ON THE ATLANTIC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is the year 1938 and you and your companion have just boarded the
S.S.Bourgogne luxury cruise liner. With 14 decks and countless staff to
serve you, this will be the vacation of a lifetime. Or will it be?

Unexpectedly and with lightning speed and terror a murder has just occurred
on the ship. A cruise of pleasure has now been turned into a cruise of
survival, horror, and suspense!

An urgent cable awaits you in your cabin. By order of your government, you
have been chosen to investigate this hideous crime. With more than 600
cabins and 40 suspects, where do you begin? And while investigating, what
other horrors will occur to further complicate your mission?

In this challenge of a lifetime, you will be assisted by dozens of clues
and evidence supplied with this program. However, your most important asset
will be your logic, determination, and skill.

Good luck! Untold riches, or untold murder awaits!

LOADING THE GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AMIGA
~~~~~
Power up your machine in the usual fashion. When the Amiga asks for the
Workbench disk, insert the MOA program disk. The program will autoboot.
Leave the disk in the drive while playing the game.

APPLE MACHINES AND ATARI ST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Insert the MOA program disk into drive 1 (Apple) or drive A (Atari) and
turn on the computer. The program will autoboot. Leave the disk in the
drive while playing the game.

COMMODORE 64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Insert the MOA program disk into unit 8, drive 0. Type LOAD "*",8,1 and
press RETURN. The program will automatically run. Leave the disk in the
drive while playing the game.

COMMODORE 128
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With the disk drive (unit 8 drive 0) on, insert the MOA program disk. Make
sure the 40/80 key on the C-128 is in the UP (40 column) position and your
40-column (composite) monitor is turned on. Then turn on the C-128. The
program will autoboot. Leave the disk in the drive while playing the game.

IBM PC AND COMPATIBLES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boot the computer with the DOS disk in Drive A. Take out the DOS disk and
put in game disk. At the DOS prompt, type MURDER and press RETURN. Leave
the disk in the drive while playing the game.

Hard disk users: Boot the system as usual. Put game disk in Drive A and
type A: and press RETURN. Now type MURDER and press RETURN.

PLAYING THE GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the game opens, you will find yourself looking for clues on board, in
the winter garden, deck A aft. Your position on the ship is marked by a
black square with a white border. Move this square around to investigate
the ship.

MOVING ABOUT ON DECK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Move through each deck with your computer's CURSOR RIGHT and CURSOR LEFT
keys.

To examine a room, press the E key. The room and its contents and occupants
will be displayed. If the room is locked, a padlock will be shown. The
padlock combination is three two-digit numbers. Enter each two-digit number
followed by a RETURN. If the combination is correct, the room will be
opened for you. The combinations to the locked rooms may be found anywhere
on the ship, so be alert!

Booby-trapped rooms: Certain rooms are booby-trapped. The clues to
surviving these traps are hidden in other rooms. If you visit a
booby-trapped room and you have not previously visited the room which has
the trap's clue, the game will restart.

To interrogate a passenger or crew member, press the I key. The interview
will be displayed on screen.

MOVING BETWEEN DECKS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To move to another dick, you must first find the elevator. There are two
elevators on board, aft and forward. When you have found the elevator,
press the L (Lift) key to call it. Decks are labeled A (upper deck) to O
(lower deck). To move to another deck, simply press the corresponding key.

Stuck elevator: Sometimes the elevator will get stuck. To repair the
elevator, you must let the repair technician - or another member of the
crew - know you are stuck. You can do this by:

	Setting off the alarm: Press the P key to set off the alarm
	With some luck, the technician will be around to hear the
	alarm and fix the elevator.

	Calling for help: Use the telephone in the elevator to call for
	help. Dial a seven-digit number by pressing the desired digit 
	keys (0 to 9) on the keyboard. You may be lucky enough to
	get an answer. If you're really lucky, you will get the elevator
	fixed. You will find telephone numbers readily accessible on
	board; stay alert.

	Reset the elevator: Press the R key.

The elevators on board are not very reliable. They are apt to break down at
the most unexpected times. not all repair methods described will work at all
times. Patience, a keen eye, and good memory will be invaluable in getting
out of the elevator.

To exit the elevator once you arrive at your deck, simply use the cursor
right or cursor left key to move forward or aft.

There is a message decoder somewhere on board. When you locate it, press
"T" to invoke the decoder.

ENDING THE GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QUITTING THE GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To quit the game, press the ESCape key (or the STOP key on the C-64/C-128).
Make sure the MOA program disk is in the drive or you may seriously damage
the program.

When you decide to play the game again, you will be given the opportunity
of starting where you left off or starting from the beginning.

SOLVING THE MYSTERY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please refer to the enclosed registration card for details on solving the
murders and winning the game.

Dear Mr. Leedy and Miss Allison:

Here are the specifications that you will need to complete the assignment.

Valve Cover Location: Aft section of the engine compartment, specifically
on the left side of the top of the push-rod assembly.

Bolt Size: 36 millimeter head size, 12 millimeter thread size. Length of
threads is 84 millimeters.

Bolt Configuration: 14 bolts holding the plate in an oval pattern. Each
bolt is at the edge of the plate with the exception of one in the center.

Torque Magnitude: Each bolt is torqued down with a force of 90
meter-kilograms.

Internal Valve Configuration: Each valve is driven by a push-rod and rocker
arm assembly. Each push-rod is held in position with a single adjustment
bolt.

Suggested Method: Loosen several valve adjustment bolts so that once out to
sea, they become detached and inoperative.

Good luck with your mission, your check will be waiting upon your arrival.

                                       James Salizar

Dearest Gigi,

This is very difficult for me to do but I prefer happiness to living a lie.
I have been involved with another woman for some time now and she is
pressuring me to make a decision. We are very much in love and I must be
with her. Please try to understand.

                                                      Rene
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time is running out, Charvet. Pay the cash, deliver the scientist as
agreed, or your career is over!
