INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a freely distributable game based on the Boulderdash idea,
dedicated to all Boulderdash fans. I have tried to stick as close as
possible to the old Commodore version, because I think it is the best
one!

There are only 40 levels included in this package, but by using the level
editor you are able to create 60 more (or replace the 40 original levels
with new, better ones). Read 'BGLevEd.doc' for more information.


STARTING UP
~~~~~~~~~~~
You can start the game from either Workbench or Shell, version 2.04 or
higher. If you are using Shell, make sure that the 'Level' directory is
in the current directory. If the game won't start it will tell you why,
using an alert. When succeeded it shows you the title screen.


THE TITLE SCREEN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first thing that appear is the menu. If you don't move your joystick
for about 8 seconds, the menu vanishes and the top-ten list is dispalyed.
After 8 seconds or when you move the joystick, it will switch back to the
menu.

Use the joystick to select from the menu whether you want to practice or
play a real game, and choose a level to start at. If you decide to play
you can start only from levels ending with a '0' or a '5'. When
practicing you are able to start from any level, but you will only get
one life and you won't proceed to the next level when you have finished
your selected level.

If your selected level doesn't exist, you will automatically start from
level 00. The same thing happens when you have finished one level and the
next is not to be found.


LEVELS
~~~~~~
There are two types of levels. The first one is the ordinary level, or
simply 'level'. It is 40×30 squares, and covers four 'normal' screens.
The screen will scroll when you approach the edges.

The second type is the intermission. This is one fourth of an ordinary
level (20×15 squares) and covers only one screen. If you have an NTSC-
amiga it covers a bit more than one screen and there will be some
scrolling here too. While playing you will note another difference. You
won't lose any life if you die, instead you will move on to the next
level. If you find the exit, you get a bonus life. Bonus lives are also
given for every 10000 points you reach.

When you have completed a level you get 7 points for every remaining
timeunit.


THE GAME
~~~~~~~~
All objects and characters correspond to an object or a character in the
original Boulderdash game. They don't look quite the same so I guess an
introduction is appropriate.

BALDER		This is you! A young Nordic god who thinks everything is
		good. Use your joystick to make him move. If you keep the
		button pressed he will only touch the adjacent square.

BUSH		Has nothing to do with an American expresident. Just walk
		on it and it disappears. It keeps berserks and snakes
		away and stops falling rings and stones.

RING		Collect these, and you will see the exit open.

RUNESTONE	It follows the law of gravity just like the ring. Remove
		the object it rests on and it will fall down. Try to push
		it and it will move if there is nothing blocking its way.
		Use it to kill berserks and snakes.

FENCE		Looks like four plaited boards. You can't remove it
		simply by walking on it, but it will disappear by an
		explosion caused by a berserk or a snake.

EXPANDING FENCE	Looks like a fence but it will expand to the right and
		the left if it finds an empty square. Be carefull with
		this one! It blocks your way very easy.

MAGIC FENCE	This one transforms runestones into rings and vice versa.
		You start it by dropping a stone or a ring on it. It will
		only stay active for a settled time, and you won't be
		able to activate it again when this time is over. Make
		sure there is enough space below it for the transformed
		rings and stones or else they will be forever lost!

STOCKS		Two stocks together. All levels are surrounded by stocks.
		Stocks are the only things that are indestructible.

EXIT		Looks exactly like stocks until it opens. It is often
		placed in the border among stocks. Unlike stocks, the
		exit is NOT indestructible. An explosion will blow it
		out.

THORSHAMMER	This is the hammer that Thor, the god of thunder,
		carries. Now it helps Balder by destroying everything
		that is evil. Both berserks and snakes will explode when
		they touch a hammer. A hammer may multiply to an adjacent
		square that is empty or covered with a bush.

BERSERK		A viking running around the screen, following the edge of
		empty squares. If you touch him or drop a stone or a ring
		at him, he will explode leaving upto nine empty squares.
		If you are too close you lose a life.

SNAKE		Much the same as the berserk, except it will leave rings
		instead of empty squares when it explode.

The last row of the game screen shows you some interesting and important
information. It could look something like this:

	S: 001346  R: 023  T: 129  L:27  M: 2

You have probably already guessed what the letters denote, but I will
give a short explanation anyway.

	S - Score
	R - Rings left to take before the exit will open
	T - Time left
	L - Level
	M - Men left including the one you are using right now

Beside the joystick there are a few keys that effect the game.

	SPACE		Pause the game
	ESC		Suicide (if you get stuck somewhere)
	ALT ESC		Collective suicide, you lose all you men

Well, now I think you are fit for fight! Just one more thing. The program
will save the highscore list in the current directory as 'BGHighScores'.
Happy playing!


HISTORY
~~~~~~~
V1.11	The game now works with NTSC-machines too! I had to change the
	title screen a bit.
	Unfortunately you won't get the same good survey of the game
	screen with NTSC-machines as with PAL-machines. Sorry.

V1.0	First release.
