                          ----------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 THE STORY SO FAR...
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Martys in big trouble.Having returned to 1955 to try and stop the evil Biff
from changing the future for his own benifit with the aid of a stolen sports
almanac,he and Doc Brown have managed to do that. But when the flying Delorean
with Doc inside is hit by lightning and disappears,Marty is left stranded in
1955! His troubles are far from over.
 Seconds after the Doc's dissapearance,Marty recieves a letter from him dated
1885!.After being catapulted back to the old West by the lightning bolt.Doc
has decided to settle down there as a blacksmith,explaining that he's quite
happy there and wants no help from Marty.Also included in the letter are
specific instructions on how to find the DeLorean (which doc has hidden in a
disused mineshaft) and use it to get Marty back to 1985.
But when Marty and Doc return to the mineshaft to recover the DeLorean they
discover,in the nearby graveyard,a headstone with Doc's name on it dated ust a
few days after his letter to Marty! Realising he has to save the Doc before he
is killed,Marty uses the DeLorean to travel back to 1885...

 OVER TO YOU!
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now its up to you,in the roles of both Marty and Doc Brown to save the day and
return everyone safely to their own time.Its not going to be easy,thanks to
the appearance of Buford "Mad Dog"Tannen,the first in the long line of the
evil Tannen,the first in the long line of evil Tannens of Hill Valley! He's
been gunning for Doc since he arrived and now he's gunning for you too.

 LEVEL 1 - THE BUCKBOARD CHASE
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 SCENARIO
 ~~~~~~~~
 Just after meeting up with each other back in 1885.Marty and Doc are planning
how to get back to 1985 when they hear somebody scream.Its Clara ,Hill Valley
new schoolteacher,on a runaway buckboard (which is,by the way,sort of a
horse-pulled cart) headed straight over the ravine! Acting quickly. Doc leaps
on his horse and gives chase.

GAMEPLAY
~~~~~~~~
The object of thisfist game is to reach Clara before the buckboard reaches the
edge of the ravine.Youre Doc,on the horse,and you start out just behind Clara
on the buckboard.A window below the main screen shows how close you and Clara
are to the ravine.You dont have any direct control over the horse,as it
gallops automatically.However you can control Doc's actions.If you catch up
with Clara before she reaches the edge of the ravine,you've won and it's onto
the next level.
The task is made more difficult by obstacles that crop up along the way and
threaten to stop Doc from saving Clara.Objects such as indian tomahawks and
pieces of luggage that have fallen from the back of the buckboard,come flying
at the Doc,and they must either be ducked under or jumped over you'll learn
which movement is appropriate depending on the height of the object.
Some objects can be picked up anything that dosnt bounce,like a hat or piece
of clothing can be collected by Doc by pushing diagonally down and right on
the joystick.You get bonus points for every item collected.
To make things more difficult,the Indians have decided to interfere.They chase
after Doc on horseback,trying to knock him off his horse.Fortunately you've
got a gun to defend yourself with,and you can shoot both in front and behind.
Everytime Doc falls off his horse,time is lost and Clara gets closer to the
ravine.If you fall off too many times,the buckboard goes over the ravine and
the game is over!.

 MID-GAME SECTIONS
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As you get closer to Clara,the action changes viewpoints at certain intervals
you're still Doc on the horse,but now you view the action from directly above
with the screen scrolling upwards.
In the first of the two overhead sections,you're caught in a battle between
the cavalry and the indians,and you've got to make your way through the 
crossfire without getting hit by their own fire.You've still got your gun,
and you can shoot the Indians but don't shoot the cavalry! Also,keep an eye
out for obstacles on the ground that can knock you off your horse.
In the second overhead section,which comes in the later part of the level
you've got to make your way through Hill Valley right in the middle of a 
bank robbery! Buford and his gang have been cornered by the cavelry coming
out of the bank,and theres a big shootout underway.Again,avoid the bullets
and shoot the bad guys,while looking out for obstacles on the ground.
HINT - Dont Shoot The Cavelry.

 LEVEL 2 - THE SHOOTING GALLERY
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 SCENARIO
 ~~~~~~~~
 It's a night of celebration in Hill Valley.Construction of the famous clock
tower has finally been completed,and Marty and Doc are there at the open-air
party.While he's there,Marty notices an old-style shooting wagon.Unable to
resist the temptation after all the practice he's put in at Seven Eleven,
Marty pays up,loads up and takes aim.

 GAMEPLAY
 ~~~~~~~~
 In this section,the objective is simple-shoot as much as you can,as
quickly as you can.This game is played in First-Person perspective-which
means you see things exactly as Marty sees them.Your gun appears on
screen,and to help you a little,there's a special gunsight that shows
exactly where you're aiming.All you have to do is aim and shoot,and try to
knock out as much as you can.Don't worry about ammunition - you've got as
much as you like,but time is short.A clock in the top-right hand corner
ticks away as you play,and when you run out of time,Buford appears and ends
the game.
The easiest targets to hit are the ducks - they scroll along the bottom of
the gallery from right to left.There are also flying ducks,that come along
the top of the gallery in the same direction.These move faster,so you have
to be quick.There are also plenty of bonus items to watch out for,so keep
your eyes open.
For more points though,watch out for the cardboard cut-outs of Buford and
his gang.They appear from the shop doorways and windows - and even at point
blank range,right at the front of the screen - gunning for Marty.They can't
shoot you,but they only appear for a very short time before dissapearing
again,so you have to be quick.

 HINT
 ~~~~
Targets aren't the only thing you can shoot.Take a look around OUTSIDE the
limits of the shooting gallery itself,and try to hit some of the backround
obstacles.There could be interesting results! Don't shoot the old
ladies,and look out for special duck bonuses!

 LEVEL 3 - PIE THROWING
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 SCENARIO
 ~~~~~~~~
 While at the Clock Tower opening ceremony,who should turn up but the evil
Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen and his gang of cronies and they're just looking for
trouble.But when they start picking on Doc,they didn't count on meeting Marty
He may not have a gun,but he's a mean frisbee thrower,and armed with a pile
of empty pie-trays from the pie stall,Marty gives Buford and the gang a run
for their money!.

 GAMEPLAY
 ~~~~~~~~
 Buford's gang have hidden in the buildings around the Hill Valley square,
leaving you out in the open with nothing but a pile of pie-trays to defend
yourself with.The bad guys appear from doorways,windows and on the saloon
roof and shoot at you.You've managed to grab an old oven door,which you're
using as a primitive bullet proof vest,but it can only protect you for a
certain number of shots - if it gets hit too many times,it breaks open,
relealing Marty's heart.The next hit is fatal.
 You get your pies - in stacks of ten - from the table in the bottom right
corner of the screen.There is an infinate supply of pies,and Marty can
replenish his supply at any time.To throw them,ust position yourself (Marty
can only move left or right) and hit fire - you can throw the trays as fast
as you like.Getting positioned exactly right so you can hit your targets
isn't easy,but it soon comes with practice.The trick is getting there fast
enough so you can hit one of Buford's gang before they disappear again.
 However,hitting a bad guy once isn't good enough.It'll get rid of him for
a little while,but he'll soon be back.You must hit a bad guy three times to
get rid of him for good,and when he's gone he's crossed off the Bad-O-Meter
at the top of the screen.When all six bad guys have been defeted,Buford 
himself appears and must be defeated.Get rid of Buford,and it's on to the
final section.

 HINT
 ~~~~
You can Bend pies in the air by swerving them.Touch the joystick in the
direction you wish to swerve immediately after throwing the pie.Useful for
getting into tight corners!.

 FIRE      = THROW PIE / PUNCH
 PUSH UP   = JUMP
 PULL DOWN = DUCK / PICK UP
 PUSH LEFT = WALK LEFT
 PUSH RIGHT= WALK RIGHT

 LEVEL 4 - THE TRAIN
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 SCENARIO
 ~~~~~~~~
 Marty and Doc have finally come up with a plan to get back to 1985 - but
the only way they can get the DeLorean up to 88mph is to push it in front
of a locomotive! So they decide to steal one...

 GAMEPLAY
 ~~~~~~~~
 You play Marty,and you start the game standing on top of the moving
locomotive's last carriage.You've got to make your way along the carriages,
collecting Doc's special speed logs along the way to push the train up to
88mph,and finally get to the DeLorean at the front of the train before time
runs out.
 As you walk along the train,members of Buford's gang and the train engineers
(who don't want you to steal their train) appear and confront
you.Fortunately,Marty's still got some pie trays left that he can throw to
knock the bad guys off the train.If they get too close,Marty can either 
punch them out or duck down and crawl under their legs.You must also jump
to get over the gaps from carriage to carriage.
Be careful of static obstacles as the train speeds past Mailhooks,water
towers and signals can all knock Marty off the train,so you need to duck or
jump to avoid them.If you get knocked off,you're brought back on screen by
your hoverboard,and you can climb back up on one of the carriage ladders to
carry on.
 Along the way,you must pick up the seven coloured speed logs that the
careless Doc has dropped along the top of the train.Each log increases the
engine's speed by mph,with the final one pushing up to 88mph.
 When you finally make it to the engine at the front of the train,there's
one last obstacle to overcome before you can return to 1985.The locomotive's
boiler has been pushed too far by the special speed logs,and it's spraying
out puffs and jets of steam.The puffs are harmless,but the jets can knock
Marty off.You need to edge your way up the engine carefully,avoiding the jets
and jump down to the DeLorean at the front of the train.If you manage that,
it's back to 1985.
 But is it the End?

 HINT
 ~~~~
 Every time you pick up a speed log,the train bumps as it picks up speed.
Be careful you don't get knocked off when this happens,and look out too for
the smoke and cinders that can confuse Marty and cause him to fall off.
