   program disk).

3) If the display prompts for a Kickstart disk insert one into the internal
   drive as usual.

4) When the display prompts for a Workbench Disk insert the BAAL disk into
   the internal drive.

5) BAAL will now start up automatically.

6) If the BAAL title screen has not appeared within 45 seconds there may be
   a problem with either the program disk or your Amiga system. Check that
   your system is connected together properly and that the above sequence
   of instructions has been followed correctly. If you are sure that your
   computer is functioning (other software works correctly) and loading
   difficulties are still being experienced then please read page 2
   'Warranty limitations' of this manual for replacement details.

THE BAAL DISK MUST BE LEFT IN THE INTERNAL DRIVE AT ALL TIMES DURING GAME

GAMEPLAY.

BAAL - THE HORROR BEGINS

Archaeology is a strange profession at the best of times, digging up human
remains, picking through what is left of a civilization after hundreds of
years makes you feel you could be one of a pack of salivating wolves or a
hooded vulture whose patience has been rewarded with a few maggoty remains
and that's if you're lucky. But I shouldn't complain, the fact is I enjoy
it immensely, or I did until we started our latest dig and I began
receiving the letters. At first I put them down to some kind of crazy crank
with nothing better to do. The lads on the dig thought them a great joke.
They started putting chicken bones on my door and one of them gave me a
Barbie doll stuck with pins. They pulled my leg about them coming from a
jilted lover, but they weren't that type of letter. They looked like they'd
been written by somebody (thing?) who was incredibly old. The writing, -
no, scrawl - was barely decipherable. What I was able to read warned of
terrible destruction of the earth, or death, plague, and of man killing man
just for the hell of it. There were comments about the dig too; I couldn't
decide whether they were threats or warnings. Whoever it was knew a lot
about the massive stone slab we had uncovered.

The stone came to light after we had removed yet more human remains from
the site. The general concensus of opinion was that we had stumbled across
an ancient burial ground but I didn't agree. The thing I couldn't
understand was the grotesque mutilation of so many of the remains, of the
look of abject terror on the faces. It was as if they had seen hell on
earth and had died a hideous death in the process - but why?

The stone was covered with strange evil looking hieroglyphics depicting
horned monsters, massive toothed demons, mutants of all shapes and sizes.
In the center of the stone was a single word "BAAL", it stood out from the
surrounding filth like a pus filled sore. I thought it looked like a
massive door, but to what chamber? The mood of the team changed as a
feeling of dread settled over us - in silence that night we all went home
unsure of what tomorrow would bring. When I got home another letter was
waiting, I suddenly felt very cold and afraid. My hands were clammy as I
opened it to reveal a crudely composed rhyme written again by my poison pen
friend.

Look at the date, 
turn the last three around 
remove the I 
your screams won't make a sound.

This one had me totally lose; what was significant about today's date - 5th
June 1999, three what? and for heaven's sake there's no "I" in June to
remove. But the last line brought back the images of those corpses all with
their mouths open as if in silent scream, I shivered as if someone or
something had walked over my grave.

I played with my food rather than eating it that night and I looked at the
steak on my plate I suddenly wished I'd become a vegetarian. The meat
(flesh) just stuck in my throat. I decided to swap the solids for liquid
refreshment and opened a can of beer. The bitterness of the beer matched my
mood as I attempted to look at the problem logically. What had these
letters, today's date, the poor tortured souls who had died so hideously
all got in common? And then of course there was the massive stone with the
carvings and BAAL, - who or what is BAAL? That feeling of dread returned,
but I needed to know.

I programmed everything I knew into the computer in the hope that something
relevant just might surface but it had no data on BAAL. So in desperation I
rang my old university lecturer praying that he hadn't moved or (as I
realized how old he must be) died. After what seemed like a lifetime the
phone was answered by a woman and my heart sank thinking he must have gone
but she explained that she was his housekeeper, that he was already in bed
and hated being disturbed. I tried the old charm on her and soon had her
eating out of my hand. In no time old Jonesy was growling down the phone at
me, muttering about being woken in the middle of the night and who the
blazes did I think I was. I just said one word - BAAL, silence - you could
have heard a pin drop, and then a whisper.

"Don't move the stone".
"How do you know about the stone"? I asked.
"It was foretold by an old scottish monk way back in the 12th century", the
old man replied. "He wrote that a pictured stone would cause death and
destruction to the world at a time when man was reaching for the stars. His
contemporaries thought him crazy and locked him away, but it looks like he
wasn't so daft after all". 
"But I don't understand, what have the stars got to do with it?"

He tutted down the phone, and I smiled to myself as he obviously hadn't
changed a bit, he was still impatient Jonesy. "Don't you see that's a
reference to man's space flights"!

I realized as he spoke I'd not told him about my secret letter writer so I
quickly went through everything that had happened. They didn't make sense
to him either, he told me he needed to refer to some past notes and would
ring me back. He left me with a chilling warning, "Move that stone at your
peril."

I sat for a while trying to come to terms with the idea that behind that
stone there lurked a beast, a creature so vile that to let it loose would
mean man's destruction. I just couldn't believe it. It was like the
beginning of a horror movie except this time it was for real and the film
had a very reluctant leading man - ME!!

I was rudely woken by the shrill ringing of the phone. "Where have you
been?", barked Jonesy as I answered it. "I've been ringing you for hours.
You've not moved that stone have you?" I apologized and assured him I'd not
been near. "While you've been in the lad of nod I've been busy. I checked
up on what our supposed mad monk had prophesied in case there was any
reference to dates or times."

He asked me to read the verse again. When I had finished I thought the
phone line had gone dead - then I head a groan and before I could ask him
if he was okay he said in a fearful voice, "You received that last letter
on the 5th - a day early." 
"What do you mean?", I replied. 
"That letter should have arrived today, the 6th." 
"You could be right", I said, "but there's still no I in June." 
"Heavens you are stupid today", Jonesy said rudely. 
"It's not an I it's a number 1, don't you see it says - just look at the
date (it being now the 6th June 1999) turn the last three around - that
turns the three nines into sixes, remove the one (not the I as you read it)
leaving you with the date the 6th of the 6th following by 666 and you know
what that is?"

I felt sick as I said, "Oh my God, the sign of the devil." As I answered
him I notice my watch on the table - I couldn't believe the time - 7:50
a.m. I dropped the phone and ran as the lads would already be at the dig. I
prayed I wouldn't be too late as I reached the brow of the hill overlooking
the site.

They had enlisted the help of a large excavator to which they had attached
thick wire strops connected to large eye bolts in the rock. My cries were
lost to the digger as it took the strain and I watched in horror as the
stone started to move. For what seemed like an eternity nothing happened as
I started to run down the hill.

It began as a low rumble, and then stale foul air erupted from the
uncovered hole. I was thrown to the ground by the roar that followed, the
stench of death by now making me retch.

By this time panic had set in with the men and some started to run. They
were the lucky few - others were frozen to the spot in absolute terror -
they died where they stood as BAAL rose through the mayhem firing at
anything in his sight. As the dust settled he seemed to survey the area
like an evil general after a battle pleased at the carnage before him. my
mind was working overtime on one thought - escape, but that idea few right
out of the window as he turned to the small hill where I lay transfixed
with fear.

"Good of you to come and watch the side show," BAAL sneered sarcastically.
"I'm sorry it was all over rather quickly for you, but never mind, the Main
Event will thrill you to death. He paused and then added, "Yes, literally
to your death". "Why me?", I screamed (more in anger than in fear). He
gestured with his hand as if to dismiss me and replied, "You just happen to
be useful to me, but any of your pathetic humans would have satisfied my
needs. By the way did you like my letters?"

The demon said this with a terrible evil grin on his face. His look said it
all, he was revelling in the power that burst from his whole self. The
fiend was just playing with me, the letters were all a game. He interrupted
my train of thought by boasting that even now as he spoke, his army of
undead were stealing the thing he'd come back for - a top secret War
Machine with which he could rule or destroy the world. He sneered.

"When we meet again, I will be your master. At last the world will be
mine."  With that, he was gone, back to his stench filled lair, to await
the return of the undead. Unfortunately I had a funny feeling that we would
be meeting again very soon.

That all happened three days ago, events have moved fast since then. A war
council has been set up and an elite squadron on men, code named the Time
Warriors, have been formed - their mission to find and destroy BAAL and
return with the War Machine.

MISSION INSTRUCTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
YOU are in charge of the Time Warriors and here are your Top Secret Mission
Instructions. You must guide and control each Time Warrior in his quest.
Although it is impossible to say what horrors you will encounter when you
enter BAAL's lair, his enormous power coupled with his huge army of
monstrous beasts make him an extremely dangerous enemy.

We pray you can do it, we know you can. Many lives will be lost in the
numerous bloody battles ahead but BAAL must be defeated. If not we run the
risk of being ruled by a power crazy demon at best, at worst the earth as
we know it is doomed. OUR FATE IS IN YOUR HANDS......

Basic Playing Instructions:

The joystick is used to control the Warrior as follows:

Without fire button pressed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
j/s center - Warrior is still and in firing position where
             appropriate.

up/down -    Warrior up or down ladders where appropriate.

left/right - Warrior turn/move left or right where appropriate.

With fire button pressed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
j/s center - Warrior fires laser in direction faced where appropriate 
             (including off the ladders!)

up -         Warrior jumps straight up where appropriate.

down -       same as j/s center

left/right - Warrior stops and fires or transports where appropriate.

j/s diagonal-Warrior somersaults forward in direction he is facing 
             where appropriate.

(It says 'where appropriate', because depending on your situation you won't
be able to carry out some actions, for instance, you can't somersault off a
ladder!).

Where the title screen is being displayed and the music is playing the
following keys can be used:

S	-	Save high score table to disk

F10     -	Toggle high score table display

<Space> -       Start game

Keyboard Actions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The keyboard is also used for some functions:

F1	-	Set screen sync to 50hz

F2	-	Set screen sync to 60hz

'1'	-	Select laser mode 1

'2'	-	Select laser mode 2*

'3'	-	Select laser mode 3*

'%'	-	Select laser mode 4*

'C'	-	Toggle area co-ordinate display on/off

'P'	-	Pause game (any key to resume)

'R'	-	Refuel laser (see note below)

'S'	-	Save current game position (see note below)

'L'	-	Load preciously saved game (see note below)

Esc	-	(with fire button pressed) - Abort current game.

* Can only be used when corresponding cartridge has been collected. Numbers
refer to ones on main keyboard (not numeric pad).

REFUEL LASER: To refuel the lasers you have to first find one of the few
refueling points and move up to it from the right side only, until you are
in very close proximity to it (but not touching). If for some reason you
can not refuel, the info console will tell you. For instance if you have
blown the refueling point up you won't be able to refuel! It could be
though, that you aren't close enough so move closer; or you could be too
close (touching) in which case move back slightly and try again. To stop
refueling just move your Warrior away.

SAVE GAME: Follow the instructions for refueling but instead of pressing
"R" you press "S" for save. This is only a limited save game facility and
as such is only available in the underground cave world.

LOAD GAME: To load in a presaved game, you may do so by pressing "L". You
will be asked to verify this, type "Y" to go ahead of "N" to abort. This
option is only available in the underground cave world.

TRANSPORTING: There are 3 separate domains to Baal, 2 large, 1 small. Once
all war machine pieces have been collected (they flash yellow), you need to
find the transporter, enter it and press the fire button. You will then be
transported to the next domain. If you do not have all the war machine
pieces in that particular domain, you will not be able to transport (You
require 10 components to travel from Domain 1 to Domain 2 and a further 8
from there to the final part of your mission. Each time a component is
collected it turns off one of the flashing L.E.D.s at the bottom of the
screen). Once you are successfully transported, your squadron will be
granted an extra Time Warrior. If you have 6 or more warriors, only 5 will
be displayed in the "Active Warriors" box, but don't worry, they are still
there.

THE LASER: Your laser has 4 weapon modes (you need the cartridges for 3 of
them). The first is very weak and objects will need many hits before being
destroyed, some more than others. Some objects can't be destroyed at all
where as others need the more powerful weapon modes (4 is the most
powerful). When you are low on laser energy (electrolite), the laserbolt
will flash when it is fired.

ENERGY SHIELDS/SCANNER: You are equipped with a personal energy shield that
will protect you from alien missiles only, for a limited number of hits. It
can be topped-up at any re-fueling point. The scanner is equipped with an
early warning system, a flashing red arrow at the top corners of the screen
tell you of an approaching alien.

NOTE: An extra warrior will be designated to your squadron for every 5,000
personal status points you achieve.

End of Game:

Once the game is over, and you have a high personal status, you will be
requested to identify yourself. To do so just type in your name using the
main keyboard. The numeric pad is used if you want to include special
characters in your name. Each number on the numeric pad will produce the
character above the numbers on the main keyboard (i.e. pressing 1 on the
numeric pad will display a !). If you make a mistake, use the 'backspace'
key to delete it. Press 'return' once you are finished.

To restart the game you press the spacebar of if you wish to go back to the
title screen and music (all 11 minutes of it!) you can press the return
key.
