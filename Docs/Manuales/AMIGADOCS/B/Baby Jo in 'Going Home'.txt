BABY JO...THE STORY.
--------------------
BABY JO IS LOST IN THE COUNTRYSIDE,FAR FROM TOWN,FAR FROM HIS HOME AND FAR
FROM HIS MOTHER.LUCKILY `BABY JO`IS A RESORCEFUL CHILD.FIRST OF ALL,HIS INNATE
SENSE OF DIRECTION WILL ALWAYS LEAD HIM HOME. WHATS MORE,HIS FRIENDLY NATURE
WILL HELP HIM MAKE A LOT OF FRIENDS.

BUT ABOVE ALL,HE`S A BABY LIKE ANY OTHER;HE CRIES WHEN HE IS HURT,SMILES WHEN
HE FINDS HIS FAVOURITE THINGS,SCREAMS WHEN HE GETS BURNT,SHOWS HIS
SATISFACTION AFTER A GOOD MEAL,IS SAD WHEN HE FALLS,AND SUCKS HIS THUMB WHEN
HE IS BORED.

HOWEVER,MANY OF BABY JO`S ATTRIBUTES MAKE HIM A BABY..NOT LIKE THE REST
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SUPER DIAPER.........THIS IS A TEMPORARY POWER. IT GIVES BABY JO -SUPER
SPEED- AND ENABLES HIM TO CROSS HUGE DISTANCES IN A SINGLE BOUND.

THE PROTECTIVE CAPE.....ALSO TEMPORARY IT GIVES JOE PROTECTION FROM EVERYTHING

THE THROWING RATTLE......EACH RATTLE DISCOVERED EQUALS 5 THROWING RATTLES.
THIUS WEAPON IS EFFECTIVE AGAINST MOST BUT NOT ALL OF THE VILLIANS `BABY JO`
WILL COME UP AGAINST. SOME VILLIANS ONLY DISAPPEAR AFETR 2 DIRCT HITS.

BUT BABY JO WILL COME ACROSS OTHER ITEMS.
-----------------------------------------
THE BABY BOTTLE..........ESSENTIAL TO THE BABYS SURVIVAL TO PREVENT STARVATION

BONUSES.SWEETS/LOLLIPOPS.THESE FRUITS AND SWEETS ARE ALSO WORTH POINTS.EXTRA
LIVES ARE WON AT 20.000 POINTS,AT 40.000 POINTS AND EVERY 40.000 POINTS
THEREAFTER.

FIRST AID KIT............IF `BABY JO` GETS HURT THIS FIRST AID KIT WILL HELP
HEAL HIM.

THE NEW DIAPER...........AFTER EATING SO MANY FRUITS AND SWEETS,`BABY JO` GETS
HEAVIER AND HEAVIER..MOVING ANYWHERE BECOMES DIFFICULT. HE CAN NO LONGER RUN,
HE CAN`T JUMP AS HIGH OR AS FAR AS USUAL. A CLEAN DIAPER WOULD BE A WELCOME
RELIEF.....

SURPRISE PACKAGES........THESE ARE OPENED WHEN THEY ARE PASSED OVER OR WHEN A
RATTLE IS THROWN AT ONE.THEY HAVE ONE OR MORE OF THE OBJECTS ALREADY DESCRIBED
INSIDE AND OTHER SURPRISES TOO..WARNING;ALL OBJECTS OTHER THAN BONUSES
DISAPPEAR AS SOON AS THEY TOUCH THE GROUND.

BALLOONS.................THESE BALLOONS INFLATED WITH HELIUM, CAN EASILY LIFT
THE FEATHER WEIGHT `BABY JO`. THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR CLIMBING CERTAIN STEPS,OR
CROSSING RAVINES.

DURING HIS ODYSSEY `BABY JO` WILL MEET MANY CHARACTERS.MOST OF THEM NASTY!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE TREES................THINGS FALL FROM TREES.BUT BEWARE,AS THEY CAN EITHER
HELP `BABY JO` OR HURT HIM.

JACK IN THE BOXES........IN EACH ONE IS EITHER A JACK OR A BONUS.THEY CAN ALSO
BE USED AS TRAMPOLINES.

THE FLOWERS..............THE FLOWERS ARE VERY SENSITIVE. THEY HATE BEING
CRUSHED AND CAN HURT BY SPITTING.

THE BLACK CLOUDS.........YOU HAVE TO HIT THESE TWICE TO ELIMINATE THEM.

THE SHOOTING DWARFES.....THESE ALSO HAVE TO BE HIT TWICE TO BE ELIMINATED.

THE MOSQUITOES...........SAME AS CLOUDS AND DWARFES.

THE SUN..................INDESTRUCTIBLE...SO TRY TO AVOID IT.

BABY JO IS A CRAFTY ONE,SO HE CAN AVOID SOME OF HIS ENEMIES AND USE OTHERS TO
HIS ADVANTAGE.OF ALL HIS AQUIANTANCES,HIS MEETING WITH `JOCK THE DUCK` ARE THE
MOST FRUITFUL `JOCK`,ALTHOUGH,A PRACTICAL JOKER,GIVES IMPORTANT CLUES,BEWARE
THOUGH,SOME OF HIS CLUES ARE ONLY JOKES....

DONT FORGET THAT `BABY JO` IS VERY CLEVER.BESIDES FINDING HIS PATH,HE CAN ALSO
LOCATE MYSTERIOUS CAVES,SECRET PASSAGES,AND MASTER ALL THE BIZARRE WAYS OF
GETTING INTO THEM. FACED WITH SUCH A MISCEVIOUS YET LOVEABLE IMP YOU`VE JUST
GOT TO HELP HIM FIND HIS WAY HOME...

YET ONE MORE DOC ADDED TO THE LIST...BY SCOOTER...............................
