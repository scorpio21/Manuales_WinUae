                     Docs by Phantom Lord (MEDWAY BOYS)


SCENARIO
--------
The peace summit was succesful. An army treaty has been signed. All medium
range missiles have been destroyed... except for two which have been
captured by a group of Terrorists who plan to destroy the Western World
unless their fellow terrorists are released from a penitentiary in the
United States.

Your task, as a mercenary employed by the United States Government, is to
capture the terrorists bases in their desert outpost - Battle Valley - and
eliminate the two missiles.

AIM OF THE GAME.
----------------
The player starts off at his central H.Q. and his aim is to progress there
to capture all terrorist bases, three located in either direction. Then the
two missiles have to be destroyed in their silos, found before the
countdown reaches zero, otherwise the missiles will be launched and the
world destroyed.

In between the bases lie many different weapons, which steadily increase in
speed and complexity as more ground is covered. Most of the weapons can be
eliminated by using the helicopter. The remainder must be destroyed using
the tank. Note that the terrorist bases and the missile silos themselves
can only be destroyed by the tank.

The helicopter has a winch which is used to collect pontoons for memding
broken bridges or to collect extra ammunition from rooftops. The tank
collects ammunition when it is halted on the grid at an ammo dump.
