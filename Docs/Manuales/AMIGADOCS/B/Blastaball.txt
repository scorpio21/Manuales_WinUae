				BLASTABALL

AD3613

	Blastaball is the fastest growing participant sport in the Empire.
Over the past twnety years the number of playfields springing up has
increased dramatically. Mastertronic is proud to bring to you the first
OFFICIAL Blastaball computer simulation! Only ours is officially sanctioned
by the National League and contains all the features of this thrilling
adversarial sport. Every one of the ten ship classes is represented here
and their comparative performances have been faithfully reproduced.
	For those unfamiliar with the game (where have you been for the
last decade? Asleep?) let's recap the rules of he 'ball:

	The aim is simply to score more points than your opponent. One
point is gained for bouncing the puck off the end of the playfield
(goal-line) defended by the opposition, call a LINE GOAL. Two points are
scored for driving the puck onto the centrally placed goal (or register)
just in front of his goal-line. The puck can touch this from any direction,
even from behind. Both puck and ships are held within their area of play on
the matrix by boundary lines, from which they will rebound. The game is
thus continuous - there are no stoppages - except when a score is made, and
the game lasts three minutes, or until one player amasses more than nine
points, (called "a killing").
	The players move the pubk by either shooting at it with their (now
standardised) noser cannon or by deliberately colliding with it.
	All the licenses ship types are designed to achieve the same level
of performance, but in different ways. The friction rating between the
linear motor drives and the playfield itself can be set anywhere between
1000 and 3500 units. Low friction craft accelerate and manoeuver rapidly,
but are more difficult to control accurately. Some designers have added
homing missiles to their ammunition in an attempt to ensure that hits are
registered on the puck in the correct direction but the value of these is
debatable. They have unpredictable effects at times, especially in close
situations.
	Championships have been won with all ten classes and despite their
widely different play characteristics the craft do seem pretty well equally
matched. It is a matter of personal choice in which to compete.

Tournament Play

	You will play against a randomly chosen League side. As you are the
challenger you will be offered the choice of ship, and the champion will
have to accept your choice. Play lasts for three hectic minutes, unless
either player manages to score more than nine points, when the judges will
stop play. Can you come out ahead to claim the prize, or will you hang your
head in shame as you suffer the indignity of a killing.

Using The Simulations
	
	All the ship types have a standard rate of spin and fire. Note that
due to power limitations, continuous fire is not possible. The batteries
take a moment or two to recharge between bursts. Aim carefully.
	At the top of the screen is the matrix scanner that shows the
position of the two players and the puck on the field, relative to the
boundaries of the pitch.
	In tournament play the main screen keys off your ship and displays
the area around it. In tow player the action is centered on the puck.
Eaither way the scanner is a vital part of the game play. Use it or lose!
	Alongside the scanner are shown the score panels, with direction
indicat0ors for both ships and bar graph display showing how much time
remains in the match. Watch it carefully.

Controls

	Joystick left and right causes the craft to turn. Push joystick
forward to thrust. Press fire button to fire cannon.

Quickstart Instructions

1.	Choose control options and one/two player from menu.
2.	Select ship
3.	Start shooting! LINE GOAL = 1 pt  GOAL = 2 pts.
4.	Score over nine to win, or be in front after three minutes.
