Body Blows From Team 17 Docs+Moves

It's been a long time in the making, but the most exciting beat'em-up to appear on your Amiga has arrived. Experience super fast, hard hitting fight action like you have never seen before. Choose one of four hero characters to combat the increasingly evil computer controlled opponents in Arcade mode. Take on a friend (or enemy!) in the highly competitive two player mode or go for broke in the Body Blows ultimate challenge, where up to eight players select their favourite character from the ten available and compete for the champion's belt.
COMPATIBILITY

Body Blows will run fine on any Amiga system imaginable from the A500, A500Plus to the A600, A1200, A2000 through to the A3000/4000 series. Should you experience any problems then please read the troubleshooting section.

Body Blows supports external drives and extra memory, you will need an Amiga with one-megabyte of RAM in order to play. If your machine has extra memory then this will be used to store data during play.

You will need a joystick to play the game, or two if in two player mode. The game will run on a CDTV system that supports joystick control.

There is no facility to install Body Blows on to Hard-Drive, the disks are non Amiga standard. Trying to carry out such a task may damage your original disks and therefore we advise against it.

Your Body Blows disks carry on-disk copy protection and as long as you keep your disks write-protected they will function perfectly. If your disks become damaged, virus-infected or should suffer some equally horrible fate then please read the Disk Faults & Returns section. NOTE:Body Blows works fine on any normal Television set although we recommend that players sit at least 1.5-2 metres away whilst playing.
LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

Turn your Amiga OFF at the power-supply-unit, wait 10 seconds and turn it back on again - this makes sure your system is clear of any other data.

When the usual insert-disk prompt appears, insert Body Blows Disk One.

After a short while, a loading screen should appear and loading will commence. If this is not the case, consult the Troubleshooting section.

Insert the other Body Blows disks only when prompted by the game. When loading is complete, the main options menu will appear and music will play.
MAIN MENU

Use the joystick to move around the menu and the button to change between various options; when you are satisfied with the set-up you can start the game.
GAME MODES

There are three distinct modes of play within the game, these are as follows

One Player - In this mode, a single player can select their character
             from the four "hero" characters (DAN, NIK, LO-RAY & JUNIOR)
             and do battle against ever-tougher opponents in an attempt
             to finally beat the evil MAX and discover his terrible 
             secret!

             For details on selecting and operating the characters of
             your choice, please refer to the separate character
             information pages that follow the main instructions.

Two Player - In this mode, two players can select their fighters and
             location and take part in a bone crunching duel.  Using
             the set-up options you can tailor the game to your
             specific requirements

Tournament - This mode allows 4 or 8 human players to take part in a
             huge Body Blows knock-out tournament.  As for the Two
             player game, the tournament can be tailored to suit your
             own personal preferences via the set-up options.

OPTIONS

Within the set-up options for both one-player and two-player games there are the following facilities

TIME - The round timer can be OFF in which case the fight is won by the
       last player standing, or it can be set to 60 or 90 time units.

ROUNDS - This can be set to 1 or 3.  This way you can decide if the bout
         is decided quickly or if it is to be decided by the first player
         to win two rounds.

MUSIC - In game music can be OFF or ON

CHAR v CHAR - This can be ON or OFF and gives players the ability to
              fight with the same character.  If two players are using
              the same character in the same fight then this will be
              shown on the screen with a marker for the player using
              the second joystick (gameport one).

ARCADE SKILL - This can be ON or OFF.  This effects the difficulty level
               of the computer opponents in the one player "Arcade" game
               To see the exciting climax to the one-player game, you
               must play in Arcade mode.

Defaults ; On loading, Body Blows defaults to the following set-up;

TIME ON (90), ROUNDS (3), MUSIC (ON), CHAR V CHAR (OFF)

The one-player game defaults to Arcade Skill.

PLAYING THE GAME

After selecting your game, the program will load the various characters and data from your disks, please insert disks only when the game requests them.

At the top of the main game screen there is a panel which indicates the players and their strength, the number of bouts won, time left ( or energy depleted before total knock-out if TIME has been turned off ) and the number of points for the players. The player controlling the character from game port one is on the left and the other is on the right.

The fight will be introduced with digitised speech and from then, the fight is underway! The fight continues until one player defeats the other over 1 or 3 rounds, depending upon the set-up options.

For full movement lists on the character you have chosen, consult the pages after these instructions.

One is for movement of the joystick only (moves 1-8), one is for movement of the joystick along with the fire button (moves 9-16) and the last is for movement of the joystick along with the fire button, while your player is in the air during a fight (moves 17-20).
