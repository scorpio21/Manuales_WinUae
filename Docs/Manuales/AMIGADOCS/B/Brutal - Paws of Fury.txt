                            KUNG FU BUNNY

 Right Understanding - "To know fear is courage" Style - Relaxed Paw

 He bowed his  head  in  comtemplation.  Crossed-legged  he looked for
guidence from deep within his  soul.  "It  is  in the nature of things
that all good must come from evil  and  all evil must come from good."
He remembered what his old teacher had  told him. "A white painting on
a white canvas is not a painting  at all." Kung Fu Bunny nodded slowly
at the wisdom.
 The  invitation  had  arriveed   yesterday   at  his  temple  refuge.
Handwritten in the Dali Llama's  own  hand  it  asked  him to come and
fight in the competition once again.  Kung  Fu  Bunny was torn. He had
taken his vows of nonviolence and yet the monastery was poor and badly
needed the funds the competition could provide.
 He gazed around  at  the  peace  of  this  forest  retreat. Idly, two
butterflies meandered by, oblivious to ant  concerns he might have. It
was their nature to fly and feed, not to ponder the world. e smiled as
he struck upon th answer. He  would  enter the competitiion and fight,
if he won, the monastery would be safe for two years.
 But he knows that was not why he  was going, he fought because it was
his nature to fight and,  reluctantly,  he  realized he could never be
free of his nature.  "A  white  painting  is  still  a painting to the
painter" he said aloud  and  smiled.  The  butterflies ignored him and
flew on.

                       WHO PLAYS KUNG FU BUNNY?

 You are kind and considerate. Nothing gives you greater pleasure than
seeing how you have  helped  another  succeed.  However, you difficuty

                             TAI CHEETAH

  Right Mindfulness-"To Teach someone is to be responsible for them"
                         Style-Tai Chi Chaun

 Tai Cheetah stood motionless on the lovely mountain top. His fur rose
slightly as a chilly breeze  stroked  him.  Time  to begin. slowly, he
began his training kata focusing his  mind  on tthe battle to come. As
he turned back and  forth,his  hands  weaved  an  intricate pattern in
front of him,slowly his mind  drifted  as  his  body exercised. So the
four years had passed already.  The  invitation  was tucked inside his
belt unopended, the symbol on  the  front  was enough to tell him what
it contained. The fist of  the  eight-fold  path of the enlightenment,
the sign of the Dali Llama, the competition was afoot! He did not need
to attend, he had already won  life's  great contest. He had succeeded
at everything in life,he was spiritually  rich, he had a happy family,
and he was weathly. Yes he had won at everything he could. He lost his
foooting and stumbled in the middle  of  the  kata. Except for him. He
sighed as he always did when he  tought  of his pupil Kendo Coyote. He
had rescued him for a pride of lions and taught him all his skills and
yet he had failed.  While  Kendo  excelled  in  all  areas of physical
endeavour he  never  understood  the  spiritual  side.  Now  Kendo was
everything that Tai Cheetah stood against and yet the two had shared a
deep fellowship.
 Tai Cheetah  remembered  well  the  difficulties  of  teaching  Kendo
Coyote. They sat cross-legged in the dojo with a single pillow between
them. In softness is always strengh he had always taught "Your paw may
break the thickest wood  or  the  strongest  brick,  but you can never
break a pillow" Before Tai Cheetah could blink an eye, Kendo had taken
his sword and delivered  a  blow  and  sheathed  it.  Before him was a
pillow in two pieces. Tai Cheetah sighed once more. Although it pained
him, he must go to the competition to see how his pupil was faring. He
feared the worst.

                        WHO PLAYS TAI CHEETH?

You are devoted to those who are  close  to you. Yet, you are cold and
unfeeling to those  who  you  regard  as  enemies.  Your abilities are
second to none and yet, you  lack  the self-motivation to excel. Often
you are happy with your lot and  see  no need to change. Too often you
have  seen  others  "succeed,"  only  to  change  into  an  unpleasent
character. Your aims are modest, but you happiness will be grand.

                             KENDO COYOTE

               Right Resolve-"I'm BACK!" Style-Kenjutsu

 THEY'RE GOOOOOOOD! Kendo held up the packet of Kendo Coyote flakes to
the camera and  smiled  broadly.  "And  CUT!,"  the  director shouted.
"Great Kendo, great, really, you are THE one, Baby!" Kendo dropped the
smile dead, ignored the  director  and  made  his  way to the dressing
room. Once in there he snatched  up  the phone and dailed. "Hey James?
Yeah it's me Kendo, Yeah its  finished."  Kendo poured himself a glass
from the chilled bottle and laid back  on  the couch. "Look man i want
to go into the movies....Yeah, sure, ut  adverts can't buy me that new
yacht you know?" He absently pulled  his  robe  on from theside of the
couch, it was initialed KC.  "Whaddaya  mean  i'd have to fight again?
Hey i was number 1 for....Yeah WAS Ok, Ok." He gazed around the room's
walls packed with  trophies  and  medles  from  past  tournaments, the
public memory was fickle and shallow.  "Sure  I'll do it, you know me,
anything for a buck! yeah, no problem,  i got just the thing, Leave it
to me and within a month I'll have another trophy that we can get rich
off. Sure James." Kendp  hung  up  and  stared  down  at his belly. It
flopped over his belt like it  was  trying to escape. Clearly he would
have to start exercising again. He walked  over to the ample food tray
near the couch and  looked  under  the  caviar plate. Disappointed, he
moved a few other choice dishes  to  see if there was anything beneath
them. Then a slow smile of realization came across his face as his eye
fell upon the trash can at the  other  side of the room. He moved over
and emptied the small trash can on the floor.
 Sifting through the trash he came  upon  a small paper dart. "Gotcha"
he shouted and unfolded the  dart  to  reveal  a fist surrounded by an
eight pointed star. He  was  aging  and  overwieght  bt Kendo vowed to
himself that he would win this tournament.  Let them despair as i turn
back on their foolish rituals and beat the best, my way.

                           WHO PLAYS KENDO?

You are a winner. No matter what happens, you know eventually you will
succeed.You are undaunted by problems and any setback merely makes you
seek another solution. Your confidence makes you reckless. You indulge
yourself totally and never cheat yourself of any pleasure.

                               RHEI RAT

          Right speech-(Quote unavailible) Style-Thai Boxing

His opponent wiped his bloody  nose  and  the crowd roared. Rhei stood
poised, waiting for his opponents  next  move. A poorly aim roundhouse
came flying at him, in one move  he  deflected the leg and inflicted a
double punch to his opponents groin.  He followed up with a lightening
blow to the neck and finished him off  with a mighty kick to the face.
His opponent flew out of the  ring  and landed in the crowd unconsious
and would probably  need  to  be  hospitalized.  Rhei  scpowled at the
cheers of admiration for him and left the arena. His manager approched
him as he walked back to the  dressing room. "Rhei, Rhei." He scowled,
"couldn't you just wave to the crowd once?, or maybe even smile?" Rhei
stopped in his tracks, turned and stared  hard at his manager. "Ok. ok
it was just a thought. Look, here's  a letter, it came for you today."
Rhei took the letter and raised  an  eyebrow  as he felt the damp glue
give way to open the envelope. His manager caught the look and started
to babble "The uh......, servants opened it  by mistake, so i had them
reglue ir..." he stammered.
 Rhei shook his head at  the  stupidity  of the excuse. Invitations to
the competition came with a wax seal not glue. "Anyway, you can't go."
His manager continued, you've got  big  money  fights all through  the
month, sorry." His manager showed  him  the  page  of his day-timer to
back up the veracity of  the  statment.  He smiled a sympathetic smile
and shut his day-timer to end the debate,such as it was.
 Rhei stared at him "One of them is Silver River himself!" the manager
argued.
 Rhei looked at the  invittation,  then  at  the  manager. "That fight
alone is worth $100,000 to us.  You  can't  just throw that away!" The
manager was getting desperate.  Rhei  turned  and walked away. "Ok,ok,
I'll rebook it. Darn, I just can't  argue with him!" He shook his head
and followed Rhei towards the dressing room
 "Hey, Rhei, we could  make  up  the  cash  by  you doing that shampoo
endorsement we were discussing?" He  added  hopefully. The door to the
dressing room slammed shut.

                           WHO PLAYS RHEI?

 You despise fools. You want them  to  be  humiliated. You are the one
who can stand up to the bullies  and shame them. You find it dofficult
to make friends as they often make you cringe with their ignorance and
inaqbility. You speak very little, as you can normally answer your own
questions much better  than  most  other  people.  Strangely, you have
found it difficult to succeed in life whereas others with less ability
succeed.

                     Style-Tan Ku (The Iron Rage)

 Leon walked from the jet and  waved  to  the crowd. A cheer rose from
the p;eople gathered and garlands of  flowers  were thrown in front of
his footsteps. It was good to be  home. The limousine raced him to the
royal palace where he was greeted by the servants. His father the king
was still out hunting and would not be back for some days.
 "Your Highness?" A servant  pushed  forward  a samll envelope towards
Leon. He  took  it  with  a  nod  and  opened  it.  After  reading the
invitation, he neatly folded it back into the envelope and laid it pon
a small table. Moving to a window he gazed out plains beyond.
 "You both will be there, wont  you?"  he  spoke to himself. Moving to
his study he opened a scrapbook and  flicked through it. It was filled
with clippings of his two enemies, Tai Cheetah and Kendo Coyote."Kendo
Coyote to appear in new movie!" the  headline of the New York Informer
blared. "Tai Cheetah  invests in  telecommunications." the Wall Street
Journal reported. Leon pushed  the  book  aside  and  stared up at the
ceiling. "I will shame  you  both  as  you  shamed  me." Leon vowed to
himself. For honor's sake he would cross  the world and fight, but for
prides sake he would win.

 You never forget a debt for  right  or  wrong. You stop at nothing to

it difficult to focus on more than one thing at a time.

      Right Livelihood-"To care for others is the greatest joy."
                          Style-Penjat silat

Reaching down to the injured child  Indrahs smile was genuine, even if
the surroundings were not. The  flashes  of  the  camera shot away ant
feelings of intimacy between her and  the infant. Still these were the
burdens of being the President of the U.N.'s chilrens fund. How ironic
she thought that not 20 years ago she to was aon abandoned orphan in a
U.N. hospital just like this one, her  youth had only one passion, the
mastery of the martial art  of  Penjat  Silat.  Her adulthood also had
only one passion, to help  others  who  had  gone through the pain she
had. Now, here she  was,still  helping  people,  determined with every
passing day to ease the  pain  of  another  in  some small way. To the
world she was one of the most successful and popular bureaucrats ever,
but she held a secret. Now  another  four  years had passed and it was
time for her secret again. She would attend the competition as long as
she was invited such was her love  for  the great man who held it, the
Dali Llama. "Could you  hold  the  child  up  Ms Prashmet?" a reporter
brought her back to reality.  She  smiled  a  broad smile and secretly
thought of the time soon coming  when  no  one  would be asking her to
smile, only to accept the belt of heaven.

You are a capricious, playfil soul who loves to see joy and happiness.
You are unable to tkae  anything  seriously  for too long however, and
you have a strong need for diversion.

             Right Action-"You can rest when your dead."
                        Style-Soviet Military

 Ivan strained against the cramped  rail  carriage seat. Of course the
Trans Siberian Railway was not  designed  for comfort, but for someone
of his frame, it  was  worse  than  usual.  Ivan  was  not the sort of
russian who would bear such  grievances  stoically either. He was more
the sprt of Russian who wanted to share his discomfort with others. To
this end he constantly nudged  his  neighbours,  either waking them or
causing them to wish he was smaller  so they could threaten him. After
a while he took to gazing out into the forests whizzing by and wishing
he was out there doing something.  Anything in fact. The inactivity of
the journey was made tolerable only  by  the  thought of the action at
the end. Imagine him,  Ivan,  invited  by  the greatest living martial
artist to compete on his  island.  Ivan  was  not  even trained in any
particular martial art,of  course,he  had  been  military hand-to-hand
champion for 3 years running beforehehad left.  Then he had taken up a
job on a construction site  and  thought  the  competitive part of his
life was over untill the letter  came.  It  was snuggled deeply in his
pocket and every now and then  he  would  pat it for reassurance. Ivan
smiled and elbowed his neighbour in the ribs.

                            WHO PLAYS IVAN

You are a down-to-earth kind  or  person  who  stands for no nonsense.
Almost any problem can be overcome by  a  bit of common sense and hard
work. You hate to sit still for any  length of time and you are unable
to see why some people  want to do nothing all the time.

     Right Meditation-"Inner strength is a goal above morality."
                            Style-Chin Na


 The chanting rose and fell  before  the  dark  idol. A score of monks
bowed and prostrated  themselves  before  the  ugly  squat  beast. The
Pantha held his hands aloft before  the assembled priests and screamed
a terrible cry. The sound was of  pure hate and it rang throughout the
caverns long after the Pantha had  finished.  The Pantha hung his head
low, then slowly raised it,  his  flat  tongue  licked his sharp teeth
that jutted out from his  fleshy  gums.  His  eyes fell upon the small
lamb tied to the altar.

                         WHO PLAYS THE PANTHA

You know the game. There  are  leaders  and followers. Most people are
honest,hard workers willing to put  in  a  fair  day's work for a fair
day's pay. You are a leader.  These  people  will work for you and the
rewards shall  be  yours.  You  know  people  better  than  they  know
themselves. No matter what they say, they respect the stern leader.

showed racks of teeth. "Maybe  its  time  someone showed that old fool
that you don't need training  to  be  the  best!" He dropped back down
under the jetty and waited.

      Right Power-"Water can distroy mountains" Style - Sabbaal

 Within the small frame beat  the   heart  of  a  dragon. He had lived
forever but he wanted more.  All  those  who  brought harmony were his
enemies. He had sensed that a power for order was rampant in the world
and he knew he  must  stop  it.  The  Dali  Llama  had gained too much
strength and noe Poe would have to restore the balance.

 It is the wise not the strong  who  rule the world. You know this and
use other people to your advantage.

                            THE DALI LLAMA

He stood atms outstreched on the mountain  top. From here he could see
the ocean on all sides of the island. He breathed deep and allowed his
mind to reach out.
 He saw them all, one by  one,  making  there way to the island. There
was Kendo drinking on  a  cruise  liner.  But  it  would  be an unwise
opponant who took Kendo  for  a  fool.  Prince  Leon was still running
though Asia, he would get here  strong after his journey. Leaon seemed
driven by something. Would Leon  ever  be  rid  of his rage? The llama
wondered. Tai Cheetah deep in  meditation  waiting for the airplane to
come. Tai, the only one who  truly  did  not  care, if he won or lost.
Foxy whisked away at night in a  black car to make her secret journey.
Kung Fu Bunny  still  training  deep  in  the  forest.  Ivan  the Bear
uncomfortable on the train complaining  about  food. The Llama lowered
his arms and waited, soon it would begin. "Only through inner strength
can come physical strength." "Sometimes  the  fastest  blow is the one
delivered last." You are given the  code  to  play Dali Llama once you
have completed th game on black belt or above.
