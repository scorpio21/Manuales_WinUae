                                   BATMAN 


A LEGEND HAS RETURNED
---------------------

BRUCE WAYNE(tm), The multi-millionare head of the Wayne Foundation is an
unassuming, quiet type of guy. However, when night falls and evil stalks
the streets, he sheds his daytime persona and becomes the masked vigilante
of GOTHAM CITY(tm) - BATMAN!

Crusading against crime from the rooftops of the sickened city, his
objective becomes the elimination of gus Grimssom's criminal empire: in
particular, the conquest of JACK NAPIER(tm), the psychotic
second-in-command.

Napier was the most cunning and sadistic force in Gotham anyway, but when
an accident befell him, twisting him both physically and mentally, he
became the ultimate criminal - THE JOCKER(tm)!

You control BATMAN(tm) in five different scenarios as he is pitted against
his malevolent nemesis in the life or death struggles that ensure.

GAMEPLAY
--------
Section 1 - Axis Chemical Plant

As BRUCE WAYNE, you overhear Commissioner Gordon telling the Mayor of an
attack on the Axis Chemical Plant by JACK NAPIER and his henchmen. Acting
swiftly, you don your black costume and make your way to the scene.
Once inside the factory, you must move towards the exit (and Napier) on the
far right of the map. You will meet assorted criminals along the way, some
of whom will attack you physically, some will shoot at you and some will
throw grenades. Avoid, also, leaking chemical droplets and gas bursts at
various points on your route. You can sustain a limited amount of hits as
your body armour affords a certain degree of protection, but your energy
can get depleted quite rapidly if you do not try to defend yourself.
Use the BATARANG to throw at your attackers, and your 'batrope' to access
levels above, by shooting a grapnel device from your belt and reeling
yourself up.
On the final screen of this level, you will confront Napier himself. If you
defeat him, he will fall into a vat of toxic chemical waste which will
disfigure his appearance and mind. You have created THE JOKER!

Section 2 - The Streets of GOTHAM CITY (1)

having rescued Vicky Vale from the clutches of THE JOKER in the Flugetheim
Museum, you must make good your escape in the BATMOBILE.
Racing at high speeds through the streets of GOTHAM CITY, you must avoid
both THE JOKER's vehicles and the police who have set up road blocks, as
they are still unsure which side of the law you are on.
Your BATMOBILE is equipped with a sophisticated radar which will indicate
the the direction you must follow in order to escape safely. If you do not
maintain a high speed, THE JOKER will catch you up and inflict damage upon
the BATMOBILE, as will any collisions with other cars.
The BATMOBILE is also equipped with a rope and grapnel. If, whilst
travelling at high speeds, you wish to make a fast turn, shoot the grapnel
out at a lamppost on the street corner; if timed correctly, this will
enable you to make the turn without speed loss.

Section 3 - The BATCAVE

The JOKER has invented a compound, "Smilex" which, on contract, will kill
its victims, leaving a deathly rictus grin on their faces. The JOKER has
'spiked' certain everyday consumables with elements from this compound
which, when mixed together, forms Smilex.
Using the powerful computer in your BATCAVE, you must, in the time given,
ascertain which three objects contain those elements. As you select any
three, the display will indicate how many of those you have chosen
correctly. You must, by process of elimination select the exact trio of
elements before the time runs out.

Section 4 - The Streets of GOTHAM CITY (2)

THE JOKER's deadliest scheme is now taking place at midnight on the Streets
of GOTHAM CITY. By promising massive handouts of money to the people of
Gotham, the streets are packed with masses of unsuspecting citizens.
However, all is not as it seems, for the carnival-type parade contains a
sinister secret.
Inside the dozens of bright balloons is enough Smilex gas to kill the
entire population of GOTHAM CITY. These balloons are about to be leaked....
You are piloting the BATWING and must cut through the mooring ropes of the
balloons with the wings of the flying craft. If you miss any of them, they
will self-destruct, seding clouds of gas into the crowds, similarly if you
miss the rope and hit the balloon itself, the same will occur. If, however,
you slice the rope, the balloon will float harmlessly away where the gas
will dissipate into the atmosphere.

Section 5 - The Cathedral

Pursuing THE JOKER to Gotham Cathedral, you must negotiate the crumbling
floors and avoid the rabid rats in order to confront, finally, THE JOKER on
the roof. As in the Chemical Factory, you must use yor BATARANG and
'batrope' to achieve this aim.
On the rooftop, you must defeat THE JOKER, or he will make his escape by
helicopter and bring GOTHAM CITY to its knees.
