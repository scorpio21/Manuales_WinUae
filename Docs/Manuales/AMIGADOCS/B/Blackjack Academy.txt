			   RULES TO BLACKJACK

OBJECT: Defeating the dealer by having a better hand.

WINNING: When the player's total hand does not exceed 21 and is greater than
the dealer's total hand, the player is a winner. If the dealer busts (total
hand exceeding 21), play also wins.

LOSING: When the player's total hand exceeds 21 or when the dealer's total hand
is greater than the player's total hand, the player loses. When the player
busts it is an automatic loss even if the dealer also busts.

DRAW/PUSH: When a player and the dealer have the same total hand without
busting, that is known as a draw or push. The player does not win or lose and
keeps his/her original bet.

CARD VALUES: Totals are determined by adding the face value of the cards in a
player's hand. Twos through tens are counted at face value, with jacks, queens,
and kings valued at ten, and aces valued at either one or eleven. If an ace is
dealt, it is the player's option to use it as a one or an eleven, this is known
as a soft total. Face cards and tens are collectively known as ten count cards.

BLACKJACK: If the first two cards dealt to the player are an ace and any of the
ten count cards, that is called a blackjack and is an automatic winner. The
only exception is if the dealer also has a blackjack in which case the hand is
a draw/push. Blackjack hands are turned face up immediately.

BETS: The player places his/her bet before the cards are dealt. If the dealer
wins, he/she collects the bet. If the player wins, the dealer pays off an
amount equal to the original bet. If the player has a blackjack the dealer pays
off $3 for each $2 of the original bet.

THE DEAL: After the bets are placed, two cards are dealt to the player and to
the dealer with one of the dealer's cards always face up. The player's cards
may be dealt face up or face down depending on table rules.

THE PLAY: Once the dealer has dealt to all players (play starts at dealer's
left) each player needs to determine how to complete his/her hand. Each player
will be requested in turn to do one of the following: Hit, Stand, Spllit,
Double Down, Surrender, or Insurance. Casino rules differ, so some options may
not be available.

HIT: Hitting is the term for drawing another card. If a player requests a hit,
the dealer will deal another card. The player then must determine the new hand
total and select his/her next play option.

STAND: When a player is satisfied with the total in the hand, he/she signals
that he/she does no want any additional cards and is standing.

DOUBLING DOWN: This option allows the player to double the amount of his/her
original bet. When this option is chosen, the player places his/her cards face
and then places the second bet (equal to the first bet) next to the first bet.
The dealer then deals ONE additional card to the hand. The player may look at
the card if he/she wishes, however, no additional hits are permitted. The play
of that hand ends when double down is selected. Some casinos limit doubling
down to hands totaling 10 or 11.

SPLIT A PAIR: When the first two cards dealt in a hand are of the same value,
i.e.4-4, 9-9, 10-K, Q-K, etc., the player may choose to split the pair and make
two hands. When this option is chosen, the player places the two cards face up
and places a second bet equal to the original bet next to it. The dealer then
deals one card to each hand making two separate hands which are played
separately. If aces are split, the player will receive only ONE card per ace
and must stand after that deal. If a split hand also contains two cards of
identical value, they too may be split. This is called resplitting. Resplitting
of aces is not allowed. Check casino rules for doubling down on split hands.

INSURANCE: If the dealer's up card is an ace, he/she will ask if players want
to place an insurance bet. This, in fact, has nothing to do with insurance, it
is merely a side bet on whether the dealer has blackjack. If the player makes
an insurance bet he/she is betting that the dealer does have blackjack. To
place the bet, the player places any size bet up to 1/2 the original bet in
front of the bet box. The dealer then looks to see if he/she has blackjack. If
the dealer has blackjack the player wins the insurance bet. Insurance bets pay
2 to 1. Because the dealer has blackjack only about 1/3 of the time, insurance
is usually an unwise bet.

SURRENDER: This option is offered by only a few casinos. If the player chooses
to surrender, play of the hand ceases and the dealer collects only 1/2 of the
bet.

DEALER RULES: After the dealer has dealt and all players have played out their
hands, the dealer plays his/her hand and has strict rules to follow. If the
dealer has a hard total of 17 or more he must stand. If the dealer's total is
16 or less he must hit. Some casinos require the dealer to hit a soft 17,
others require him/her to stand.

SETTLING THE BETS: Insurance bets are settled before the hands are played. When
a player gets blackjack, he/she turns his/her cards up immediately and the
dealer pays him/her immediately. Similarly, if the player busts, the cards are
turned up and the dealer collects them and the bet immediately. Once the dealer
finishes playing out his/her hand, he/she settles the bets with each player
still in the game.
