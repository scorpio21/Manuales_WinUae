THE STORY:
----------

 Necron's back in town and he wants revenge. Only you - in the guise of
Hegor The Barbarian - Have the courage, strength, and stupidity to face
the challenge:

 Its time once again to don your dented helmet, tie your sweaty 
breechcloth, sharpen your rusting sword and move your big feet in the
direction of danger.

 Forests, caves, dungeons, castles, and temples await your barbaric
exploration, each is infested with deadly inhabitants and devious traps
ready to terminate your lowbrow activities.

 Featuring 2,000 frames of sprite animation, 32 colours on-screen,
paralax scrolling, 6 levels of continuous arcade/adventure action, over 1
megabyte of fully animated sprites, 50 divergent enemies, magic and
Health Potions to help you on your quest and a plethora of unique
weapons to find and use, BARBARIAN II is:

                    THE ULTIMATE IN LOINCLOTH ENTERTAINMENT.

Loading Instructions
--------------------

IMPORTANT:- Always switch your machine off for at least 30 seconds before
loading the game. Failure to do so may result in virus contamination of the
BARBARIAN II master disk. 


AMIGA

Switch your computer on. Insert a kickstart disk if so prompted. When the 
display prompts for a workbench disk insert Disk 1 of BARBARIAN II in your
computers internal drive. Insert the other disks when prompted. Once loaded,
Disk 2 may remain in your first drive and Disk 3 in your second, for the 
duration of the game. 
The Amiga version utilises extra memory should you have it.

insert other disks when prompted.

LOADING TIPS

Should the title screen not appear within 45 seconds of turning on your 
machine there maybe a problem with your computer system. Check your 
computer connections and that the above instructions have been correctly
carried out. If you are sure your computer is functioning properly (i.e.
other sotware loads successfully) and are still unable to load 
BARBARIAN II then you may have a faulty disk, in which case you may obtain
a free replacement from PSYGNOSIS LTD. (Or a local Skid Row BBS)

HEGORS'S HINTS:
---------------

Explore every nook and cranny of each domain, for years, for you will
need to find all available keys.

If you can afford it, buy the helmet from your friendly
Shopkeeper, it may save your life in an unexpected attack.

Each weapon has a different effect on your enemies, learn which
is best to use against which foe.

Against the castle guards, the best defense is attack.

Buy gossip at every affordable opportunity, it might provied a
vital clue!

Remember, you must be actually carrying a weapon for it to be
enhanced by potions.

All enemies exept werewolves) defeated in the forest, leave
their gold for you to pick up and spend.

Striking the thieving goblin will deter its return, Rolling into 
him could prove benificial.

Keep and eye on your weapon strength, swords and axes will 
break if it get too low.
