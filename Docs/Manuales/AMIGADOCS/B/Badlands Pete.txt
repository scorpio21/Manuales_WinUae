Badland Pete by Endless Piracy :

Instructions -

The Governor` s face bore a worried frown as he re -read the letter
scrawled on notepaper that have been delieved wrapped around a rock.
His belowed daughters had been abducted by the not so savoury inha-
bitants of the badlands territories.If he wanted to see them again a
ransom was to be paid...... but the govemor had other ideas .

Into his office stalked Pete Coyote,known thoughout the west as bad-
lands pete . His quick fire two-handed gun style andsteely glare are
recognised and feared by desperados averywere. "i ` ve got a new job
for you PETE".it` s time we showed those folk in the ` lands that we
mean business.  PETE looked at the Govemor coldy from under the brim
of his hat and asked "ok,but what`s in it for me?"

"Alright PETE ill pay the full bounty on anyone who gets in your way,
but the towns folk may offer a bounty on your headed in return".PETE
looked straight at the govenor "NOt good enough Gevernor , the risks
outweigh the reward how about five thousend dollars dor every daugh-
ter i send home alive?"."Have a heart pete,how about two and a half?
You know  how many girls i ` ve raised! " PETE gave a cygnical smile.
"in gold govemor, i want in gold".with that pete turned on gis heels
and walked from the office.The Govemor rose from behind his desk and
crossed to the window. As he looked towards the BADLANDS he wondered
wether the people out there realied was coming.

Some HINTS `N` TIPS :

    - Aiming abd shooting : close quarter gunplay is not always
       the most accurate.If you have trouble hiting enemis that
       are cloese by, than trybacking off or moving into or out
       of the screen.
    - Choosing Targets : if you are uncertain of a character`s
       intentios, watch and wait to see if he (or she) drwas his
       / her gun , offers a bonus object or ingnores pete before
        he blazed away with his guns.

    - Travelling between Towns : Riding on trains rather than wal-
       king is much easier on PETE`s health.Tickets for the jour-
       ney can be found during gameplay.Without a ticked you will
       not be allowed onto the station platform.
