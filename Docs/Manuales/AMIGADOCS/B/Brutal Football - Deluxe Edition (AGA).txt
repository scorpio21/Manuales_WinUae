-----------
OK,OK LETS CRANK IT UP FOR THE BIG ONE, THE `BRUTAQL FOOTBALL LEAGUE` DUST
DOWN THE KNUCKLEDUSTERS AND GET READY TO SLASH AND SMASH,BUT FIRST HERES
SOME INFO SUPPLIED BY NOEL `BONECRUNCHER` NOWALL,OUR RESIDENT EXPERT ON ALL
ASPECTS OF THE LEAGUE..OK THEN `BONECRUNCHER` SHOOT...ON NO!...I DIDNT
MEAN..STOP!!! STOP!! `BANG`

THE IDEA FOR A BRUTAL SPORTS FOOTBALL LEAGUE WAS FIRST MOOTED IN 2034.WHEN
THE AMERICAN FOOTBALL LEAGUES DWINDLED DUE TO BOREDOM,BRUTAL FOOTBALL WAS
INVENTED BY MR DAN SYCO AND WAS INTIALLY CONCEIEVED AS A CRUDE POPULATION
CONTROL OPERATION.

AT FIRST BRUTAL FOOTBALL MATCHES WPLAYED BY HUMANS WERE EXTREMELY
POPULAR,HOWEVER,INTEREST BEGAN TO DIE QUICKLY AS THE PLAYERS. CROWDS GREW
RESTLESS AS THE GAMES RARELY LASTED FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE...2 TEAMS
DOMINATED THIS PERIOD..THE `BRAINDEAD`AND THE HIGHFLYING `NATIONAL NUKERS`

THE FINAL CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THESE TEAMS DREW AN ENORMOUS CROWD TO THE
BADLANDS,WHERE THE GAME WAS TO BE FOUGHT, AN EXPLOSIVE MATCH WAS PREDICTED.
UNFORTUNATELY NO-ONE HAD PREDICTED HOW EXPLOSIVE IT WOULD BE,WITHIN IN 30
SECONDS THE NUKERS LIVED UP TO THEIR NAME AS THEY DECLARED WAR ON THEIR
OPPONETS-THERMO NUCLEAR WAR. THE ENTIRE LAND MASS WAS OBLITERATED. XTHE
RESULT WAS DEEMED A NO-SCORE DRAW.

THE SETBACK MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE END OF THE GAME BUT FOR PROF GRAHAM GEEK.
HIS GENETICALLY ENGINEERED BI-PEDS PROVED IDEAL PLAYERS OF THE GAME,ONCE
PRODUCTION HAD BEEN TAKEN OVER BY ACME BI-PEDS INC, THE LEAGUE WAS UP AND
RUNNING.

AFTER LONG AND DETAILED CONSIDERATION,LASTING 3 MINUTES THE FOLLOWING RULES
WERE MADE UP.

* FOUR LEAGUES EXIST

* EACH NEW MEMBER OF THE LEAGUE MUST START AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 4TH WITH A
TEAM OF VIKING BI-PEDS AND ATTEMPT TO WORK THROUGH THE LEAGUE.

* EACH LEAGUE IS MADE UP OF 4 TEAMS

* SIX GAMES MUST BE PLAYED PER SEASON

* 3 POINTS ARE AWARDED FOR AN OUTRIGHT WIN

* 2 POINTS ARE AWARDED FOR WINNING AFTER INJURY TIME

* 1 POINT IS AWARDED FOR LASTING AFTER INJURY TIME

THATS GREAT NOEL...I LOVE THIS GAME, AND SEEING ED CASE ON THE FLOOR THERE
IN A POOL OF BLOOD,REMINDS ME OF THE SPECIAL LOCKER ROOM OPTION,THAT OCCURS
