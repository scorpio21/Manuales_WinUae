|---------------------|       The Threat Beyond Dark Castle
| Picture of a multi- |
| pointed star        |	   Prince Duncan is on his own in the Dark
|                     |    Castle.  Somewhere within its gloomy and
|   1,000 points      |    treacherous walls, his sworn enemy - the
| "Only one at a      |	   Black Knight - awaits him.  If Prince
| time!"              |	   Duncan can find the five powerful Magic
|---------------------|	   Orbs and return them to their rightful
place, he earns the right to challenge the Black Knight.

Before they meet, however, Prince Duncan has to prove his courage, his
daring, and his cunning against a host of nasty vermin, merciless henchmen,
and carefully laid traps.  He does get some assistance from
health-restoring food, and weapons he stumbles upon along the way.  And
Prince Duncan needs all the strength he can muster for the threat Beyond
Dark Castle.

  |                     | 
  | "Bird's eye view."  |  Joystick only (Commodore system only).
  |---------------------|
                           To make Prince Duncan move up and down, left or
right, push the joystick to the left or right, or up or down.  He'll move
in the corresponding direction.

and press the joystick button.  To jump down, pull the joystick down and
press the button.  To jump higher, push the joystick up and press the
button.

To throw, continue to hold down the joystick button, and tap the joystick
to the right or left.

To fight, hold down the joystick button.  To block a blow, press the action
key.

Keyboard/mouse combinations (Commodore and Amiga systems)

The keyboard controls his jumping, running, climbing, reaching and flying
the chopper-pack:

	A - moves him to the left.

	D - moves him to the right.

	W - moves him up.  If he has the chopper-pack on, he becomes
	    airborne.

	S - moves him down.

	E - makes him duck.  He'll continue to duck for as long as you hold
	    down the key.
                                                |----------------------|
	Q - is the "Action" key.  (If you're    |  40 points           |

To continue, press any key on the Amiga and the Run/Stop key on the
Commodore.

ESC on Amiga and the <-- key on Commodore quits the game in progress and
takes you back to the Scores of Merit screen.

These keys can be used in combinations so that Prince Duncan can move
faster and more effectively:

	Running and Climbing: Use the A or D keys with the W or S keys so
	Prince Duncan can run to a ladder and climb up or down it without
	stopping.

	Jumping: Use the space bar with the A or D keys so Prince Duncan
	can take a running leap.  Use the space bar with S so he can make
	a downward jump, and space bar or jump up higher.

The mouse controls his rock throwing, and shovel and mace fighting.

	To aim, move the mouse up and down.  Prince Duncan's arm moves
	correspondingly.  To throw a rock, press the mouse button.

	To swing the shovel or mace, press the mouse button.  To block a
	blow, press Q (see above).  To dodge a blow, press E (see above).

To plant bombs, use the keyboard and mouse together.  Press E while
clicking the button to place and light a fuse.  |-----------------------|
Then, get Prince Duncan out of there!  He can   |    150 points         |

			Prince Duncan Decides His Fate

After you've selected Play, the game opens to reveal Prince Duncan
discovering the secret Ante Room behind the Fireplace.  It is here he
begins the adventure of his life.          |---------------------------|
                                           | 40 points                 |

  | Picture of eagle with    |  If Prince Duncan succeeds and fights his

  | extended.                |  to the next scene of peril (see the map in
  |--------------------------|  the Practice option to see how the chambers
in the Castle are arranged).  He can also go back through the door he came
in.

If he fails, he returns to the door where he entered.  He does get to keep
whatever points he earned as well as any items he has collected.

The Magic Orbs

There are five Magic Orbs scattered throughout the Castle.  Prince Duncan
must find all five and return them, one at a time, to their pedestals in
the Ante Room.  Once he has an Orb, he must retrace his steps back to the
Ante Room.  He may be magically transported there - if he stumbles upon the
right medium.

When he's accomplished this task, the large gate in the center of the Ante
Room creaks open.  Prince Duncan finally faces the Black Knight in battle
(see "The Showdown" later in this guide).

Elixirs and Other Important Life-Extending Tools

Prince Duncan needs all the help he can get.  He'd be smart to pick up as
many of the following items scattered about the Castle as he can.

The Status area at the bottom of the screen keeps track of the number of
items Prince Duncan has accumulated, as well as his score.

	Health: His health is increased by picking up food and decreased
	by bumping into walls, falling, and suffering bites from the 
	Castle vermin.  The Health Bar in the Status Area measures how
	much health/stamina Prince Duncan has remaining.  If the Health
	Bar Runs out, he loses a life.

	Elixirs: There are three of these magic potions in all.  The main
	elixir has an antidote for bat and rat bites.  Unfortunately, it
	only works for a short time before its healing effects wear off.
	The second elixir has the properties of transporting whoever
	drinks it back to the Ante

				7

	Room.  The third should be avoided, well, like poison.

	Rocks: Prince Duncan is armed with rocks.  Every rock bag he finds
	gives him 10 more.  If he has more than 80 rocks, he can't pick up
	any more bags.  Once he gets the magic Fireball power, the rocks
	turn into fireballs and are more deadly.

	Keys: Prince Duncan should pick up keys wherever he finds them;
	they can help him get out of a few tight spots in the Dungeon and
	Labyrinths.

	Gas: Prince Duncan picks up a chopper-pack at the top of the Clock
	Tower to fly over the Swamp and Black Forest.  He'll need lots of
	gas to make the flight in one piece (see the "Prince Duncan on the
	Move" section for maneuvering the chopper-pack).

	Bombs: Prince Duncan especially needs bombs - lots of bombs - to
	get through the Catacombs.  (See the "Prince Duncan on the Move"
	section to set the bombs.

	Shield: Somewhere inside the Dark Castle is a magical shield.  If
	Prince Duncan finds it and puts it on, he'll be invincible to
	dangerous objects for short periods of time.  The Shield is
	activated only if you press Q, the "Action" key.

The Showdown: Prince Duncan Meets the Black Knight

Once Prince Duncan has returned all five Magic Orbs to the Ante Room, he
confronts the Black Knight.  The gate in the center of the Ante Room slowly
opens.  When Prince Duncan enters, the battle begins.

If you're playing in the Advanced level and defeat the Black Knight, you
win thousands of points and discover an incredible secret.

Scoring

You can earn bonus points if Prince Duncan makes it through a chamber
without using up all of his Health.  These points are  |-----------------|
based on the amount of Health remaining in the         | 30 points       |
Health bar.                                            | "Pain in the    |

When you achieve a certain number of points, Prince    | Picture of bat. |
Duncan gets more lives.  At the Beginner level, you    |-----------------|
