THE GRAVEYARD OF THE BEAST lies within the dunes of
the Plains,these regions inhabited by fierce and barbarous
Nomads,They seldom settle,and then only briefly upon the
slaying of a dragob,the highest-prized game of all! Pitching


camp nearby,the carcass is then systematically stripped to
the bones by the entire Nomad tribe; Calumm must be wary 
of the Nomads,yet merciful to those who raise their hands
to him in surrender,Quicksand is also Calumn's enemy here....

Having fought his way throught the Plains,Calumn continues
North,The landscape becoming hillier and more treacherous.
Distant volcanoes erupt in flames,illuminating the sky deep
into the night.Our hero's quest seems lost on coming to a 
vast river,stretching to the horizon in each direction; his
only way to cross it,THE BRIDGE OF FIRE! Guarded by
bands of Dragon men,with pits of acid barring his path ,and
the ever-present danger of volcanic fire showers,this will
be Calumn's greatest test yet....

These adventures behind him, Calumn's final challenge lies
ahead, the seeking out of the evil Golem in THE TEMPLE OF
PAIN! No-one truly knows the temple's secrets, or those of
the Golem and his Temple Guards, but Calumn must defeat
them all to complete his quest!
