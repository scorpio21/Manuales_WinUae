red ballons that will help him to jump over obstacles.

HOW TO KILL THE MONSTER:
 The monster has a potential of life represented by 8 pastilles shown at the
top of the screen.
   -Shooting at him deprives the monster of 1/4 of an energy pastille.
   -Dropping rocks on his head deprives him of 1 or 2 energy pastilles.
 Once the monster is killed, his heart appears on the screen.Take it, this
way you will easily kill the ultimate monster.
