THE STORY

The long faces on the portraits looked down disappovingly at he old man as
he climed into bed. His tame pet haggis was already contentedly assleep at 
the foot of thebed dreaming of faryaway Scottisch Glens, Laird Hamish 
McTavisch plimped up his pillow, blew out his candle, and fell into a
deep sleep

Outside the walls glinstened with lighting as a storm settled down for the 
night over Drumtrochie castle. A barn Owl hooted miserably and, somewhere in
the distance, a click struck twelve.

Throughout the castle came the sound of ancient clicking into operation.
This was the ghost expelling machinery invented by the late Red Lair McTavisch
was more than a touch peeved having become a ghost himself, to find himself 
kicked out of his own home by the machinery he invented! It was this machinery
that ensured that the McTavish Clan had a long and happy night's sleep.

WELL UNTIL TONIGHT THAT IS

it is not easy being a ghost, the hours are long, the place of work cold and
 dark, and the promotion prospects, in all honesty, are fairly limited.
However, the major problem for a prospective ghost is training.

Altn hough the qualifications to become a ghost are fairly simply (being dead 
is usually the only requirement), the actual haunting part is alot more 
tricky than most people realise.

So, the famous school for Spactres and Spooks was set up, to educate and inform prospective ghost
prospective ghost in the ways of haunting.At the end of the school year, the star pupils
 are sent to haunt there pupils are to haunt the more exclusive nightspots

And so it was Blinky, the school's star pupil,arrived at Drumtrochie Castle ready
y to put in a solid night's haunting totally unaware of the deadly machinery
ticking quietly in the bowels of the Castle.


 Let the fun begin !?!!
