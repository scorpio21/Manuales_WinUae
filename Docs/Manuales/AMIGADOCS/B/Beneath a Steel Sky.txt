WHAT IS GOING ON IN UNION CITY?
-------------------------------
In  Beneath  a  Steel  Sky  you  take the role of Robert Foster abducted by
brutal Security forces and brought to Union City.  Foster`s fate is in your
hands  as he talks to people and explores the area around him in an attempt
to  discover  why  he  was  brought  to the City.  At the start of the game
Foster  has  escaped  from  the  wreck  of  the  helicopter in which he was
kidnapped.   Now it is up to you to ensure that he eludes Security in order
to discover his past and his destiny.

CONTROLLING THE GAME
--------------------
Beneath  a  Steel  Sky is played using the mouse to move a cursor about the
game  screen.   Clicking  on  objects  or  charactars  will cause Foster to
interact with them.  A full description of how to use the mouse to tell the
computer what you want to do is shown below in Gamma Control Summary

MOVING ABOUT IN UNION CITY...
----------------------------- 
Normally,  Foster  can  be movad by pointing the corsor at certain areas on
the screen and clicking either of the mouse buttons.  Obviously Foster will
not  walk up walls or to areas to which he has no access.  If he is blocked
by  another  character  while moving he will attempt to find an alternative
route.

The  cursor  will  change  to a large arrow when positioned over a possible
exit.  Occasionaily Foster may be able to look through windows to adjoining
rooms.   This is done by clicking the RIGHT button while the cursor is over
a window

EXPLORING AND MANIPULATING ITEMS...
-----------------------------------
Certain  objects  in  the  game  may  be examined or used by Foster.  These
objects  will  be  identified by their name and the cursor will change to a
cross whan over them.

Pressing the LEFT button will cause Foster to examine the object.  Pressing
the  RIGHT button will prompt Foster to pick up an object, or to attempt to
use  or  operate  the selected object.  Virtual Theatre has a feature which
automatically  selects  the  most  logical manner in which an object can be
used  or  manipulated.   For  instance  if  you  click on a closed door the
program  assumes that you wish to OPEN it (or CLOSE an open door) or in the
case of a button that you want to PUSH it.

Objects  which are picked up and carried will appear in Foster`s inventory.
To  display the Inventory move the cursor to the top of the screen.  Select
an  item  by  pointing  at  it and clicking the RIGHT button.  The selected
object  will  be  highlighted  and you are now able to use that item on any
other  visible  object on screen, including other objects in the inventory.
The selected object can also be offered to other characters.

PUTTING WORDS INTO FOSTER'S MOUTH..
-----------------------------------
Foster  will  meet many strange characters in the game and from them he can
find  out  more  about the City.  Not all of them will be friendly but with
perseverence and luck he may find allies who will help him.

When  the  cursor  is  moved over another character in the game, his or her
name  will  be  displayed  (if known by the player).  Clicking either mouse
button will prompt Foster, to talk to the selected character.  Usually, you
will  have  a  choice  of text which is displayed at the top of the screen.
Select  a question or remark by pointing the cursor at the line of text and
click either mouse button.

GAME CONTROL SUMMARY
--------------------
Don`t  panic it`s easy!  The Virtual Theatre interface has been designed to
be  easy to use.  You can interact with the backgrounds and people you meet
easily and simply using your mouse.  Follow the example shown below and you
are on your way.

GAME SCREEN
-----------
When  the  game  starts your mouse pointer will be a SMALL ARROW.  Move the
pointer  over  the  door  on  the right hand side of the screen and it will
change  into  a CROSS with the word DOOR next to it.  Press the LEFT BUTTON
and  Foster  will look at the door.  Press the RIGHT BUTTON and Foster will
use  the door (try to open it).  Unfortunately it`s locked so you will have
to find something to open it with.


     CURSOR SHAPE             LEFT MOUSE          RIGHT MOUSE
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^             ^^^^^^^^^^          ^^^^^^^^^^^

   Small arrow                Walk to pointer     Walk to pointer
   Cross (over an object)     Look at object      Use/Pick up object
   Large arrow (over doorway) Exit the location   Exit the location
   Cross (over a person)      Talk to person      Talk to person


INVENTORY MODE
--------------
Move  the pointer to the top of the screen and a bar will drop down showing
the  items  Foster  is  carrying.  The mouse works in the same way with the
items in the inventory.  Pointing at them will reveal what they are.  Press
the LEFT BUTTON and you will get a description.  Press the RIGHT BUTTON and
you  will  pick  up  the  item.   If you now move the pointer onto the game
screen it will turn into a pointing hand to show that you can use it.  Move
the  hand over an object like the door (it will change to an open hand) and
then  click either button.  Foster will attempt to USE the inventory object
on the background object/person.


     CURSOR SHAPE             LEFT MOUSE          RIGHT MOUSE
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^             ^^^^^^^^^^          ^^^^^^^^^^^

  Cross (over an item)        Look at item        Pick up item
  Cross with item selected    Look at item        Deselect item
  Pointing hand (over object) Use item on object  Use item on object
  Pointing hand (over person) Give item to person Give item to person


If  you direct Foster to attempt something impossible or pointless (using a
Spanner on a Sandwich) he will turn and shrug his shoulders

SAVE AND RESTORE
----------------
To  save  a  game  press  F5.   There are ten possible save game positions.
Click  the  mouse  on  one  of the positions and type the name of your save
game.   Press enter to save the game.  If playing from floppy you will need
to  have  previously  formatted an Amiga disk Refer to your manual for full
instructions.

To  restore  a  previously saved game press F6.  A menu of previously saved
games will be displayed.  Click the mouse on the save game that you wish to
restore.   Follow  the  on  screen  prompts if you are playing from floppy.
Remember  when  restoring  a game that the current game in progress will be
lost

PLAYING TIPS
------------
Talking  to  the  inhabitants  of Union City will often provide clues which
will  help  your  progress.   Examining  objects may also provide clues and
Joey`s analytical skills may prove of use.

If  you  are  totally  stuck, it may prove useful to return to areas of the
City which you`ve already visited

WARNING!!
---------

THE FOLLOWING HINTS ARE SPECIFIC TO SECTION ONE.
------------------------------------------------

THEY ARE INTENDED TO AID PLAYERS WHO ARE NEW TO THIS TYPE OF GAME.
------------------------------------------------------------------

To  escape  the  first  guard,  get the rung from the left hand side of the
ledge and use it to open the door on the right.

To obtain a spanner, stand on the lift to distract Hobbins.  As soon as you
can,  walk  through to his workshop and open the small cupboard on the left
of the back wall.  The spanner will be a very useful ltem later in the game
so grab it quick before Hobbins returns!

To  get  Joey  up  and running you must insert his character board into the
discarded robot shell below the lift.

To  start  the  transporter robot in the lift room, examine it then talk to
Hobbins  until he tells you what is wrong with the robot.  You will then be
able  to  tell Joey to mend the robot.  This in turn will cause the lift to
start running when the robot returns with e canister.  As the lift descends
you will be able to climb into the lift shaft.

To  escape  from  the  furnace, examine the slot beside the door.  You will
then be able to instruct Joey to open the door

GOOD LUCK.........

TROUBLE SHOOTING
----------------
Beneath  a  Steel  Sky  requires a full 1 Meg of memory.  If you experience
problems  running  the  game please ensure that there are no other programs
resident in memory (screen savers etc).
 
If running the game from a machine with a hard drive 1.5 Meg of memory is
required due to the extra system memory used by the hard drive.

CUSTOMER SERVICES
-----------------
In  the  case  of faulty disks you should return ONLY the disks to Customer
Services  Department.   Virgin  Interactive  Entertainment,  338A  Ladbroke
Grove, London, W10 5AH with a covering letter containing your name, address
and details of the fault.

FORWARD BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE UNION
SECURITY COUNCIL

The council is proud of the achievement of the security forces in
promoting the interests of the Union Group. It is your fight against
subversion that has allowed continued recovery.

Over the last year market share has again increased despite
production restrictions due to mineral shortages. The acquisition of
Asio City makes the Union Group the second largest of the six
remaining city states and represents the capitulation of the last non
corporate city.

The quality of the air being re-cycled within the protection dome
that encases the city continues to improve. The predictions made last
century about deteriorating public health due to ecological poisoning
has been proved to be untrue. Even the toxic air outside the dome in
"the Gap" has not deteriorated beyond the point of supporting human life.

Security in the Gap has been a top priority. After pre-emptive
strikes against random Gap villages, there has been a marked
increase in community taxation receipts and a reduction in
economically damaging "scavenging" raids.

The Hobart corporation continues the abhorrent market policies
eradicated decades ago in the Union Group. Their discredited policies
of labour representation and social benefits for the "needy"
contradicts the basic neo democratic principles agreed on cessation
of hostilities of the Great Euro American War. Since the LINC
computer system was assigned control of all city functions twenty
years ago, a determined economic war has been waged, and is being
won, against Hobart which has consistently sought to undermine the
foundations of our success.

We can congratulate ourselves on another successful year. And,
as always, be vigilant, be alert.

               REVOLUTION SOFTWARE LIMITED
               ---------------------------

The following information was extracted under considerable duress
from a reluctant subversive. This group should be identified and kept 
under close surveillance.

Revolution Software started life three years ago above a fruit shop in
Kingston upon Hull. Born into the harsh world of entertainment 
software development, the fledgling company devised a system
called "Virtual Theatre". The system created a real world with real
characters allowing unique features to be designed into graphic
adventures "Virtual Theatre" would change the face of graphic 
adventures forever. Impressed by the system, Mirrorsoft - the 
publisher owned by Robert Maxwell signed their first product, "Lure 
of the Temptress". 

A yachting accident put paid to Mirrorsoft but not to Revolution or 
Virtual Theatre. Revolution jumped ship and then re-licensed 
"Temptress" to Virgin games.

The success of their first project convinced Revolution to further
expand their ambitions. Working with top comic book artist Dave
Gibbons, it was decided to embark on designing a new generation of
graphic adventure. The blueprint for "Beneath a Steel Sky" was thus
conceived. Two years later they are proud to present their work a
significently enhanced Virtual Theatre system, driving a game that is
six times larger than "Lure of the Temptress".

PAGE 29
+++++++

Revolution is again planning what the next generation of computer
gamers can expect. State of the art graphics technology is being
used to produce images to be displayed using advanced cinematic
techniques. With support from the British Department of Trade and
Industry, leading edge Artificial Intelligence is being written to be
incorporated into future games.
 
                       BE VIGILANT!

             THE REVOLUTION HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN
