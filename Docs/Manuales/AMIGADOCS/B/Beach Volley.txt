is not necessary for you to be exactly on the cursor to hit the ball. The

the opposing side.

To smash the ball by pressing the fire button pushing up on the joystick.
When you are in the air wait a few seconds and press the button again to
smash the ball.
The direction of the joystick will allow you to do either a short or long
smash in the required direction. If the opposing team smashes the ball you
can jump in defence by pressing the fire button and moving the joystick
upwards at the same time.

THE BLOCK
---------
If a player from the opposing team tries to smash the ball you can jump and
block the ball by pressing the fire button and pushing the joystick up (as
for the smash).
If the ball goes past the block you can play again with your second player
pressing the fire button again.

SCORING
-------
The winner will be the first to reach 7 points or the team with the higher
score at the end of the time limit.

HINTS AND TIPS
--------------
There are two ways of scoring
A)      By attacking when you have the ball.
B)      By defending when the opposition have the ball.

DURING THE ATTACK
-----------------
Change your smash poistion as much as possible.
The closer you are the second player and the lower the ball, the less time
your adversary will have to block you.
It is possible to smash a serve - keep trying!

DURING THE SERVE
----------------
During the length and direction of your serve as much as possible.
Smashing a service is much faster so use it.

DURING DEFENCE
--------------
The block has to jump later than the player smashing the ball.
If your opposition smashes the ball a long way from the net then you must
anticipate the correct time to jump.
During the first few levels the computer will not serve too far away from
you.
