          ------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION OF AGENTS CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------------------------
THESE NUMBERS DESCRIBE YOUR AGENT.THEY RANGE FROM 0-100(DO NOT HOPE FOR
MORE DURING CREATION) BUT CAN PASS THE MAXIMUM DURING THE COURSE OF THE
GAME(YOUR AGENT WILL THEN HAVE SUPER POWERS). THE FOLLOWING LIST DESCRIBES
THE VARIOUS CHARACTERISTICS.

STRENGTH; THIS REFLECTS THE PHYSICAL POTENTIAL OF YOUR AGENT.THE VALUE
DETERMINED DURING CREATION CORRESPONDS TO THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE VALUE FOR
YOUR AGENTS STRENGTH(EXCEPT IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS) WHEN IN GOOD PHYSICAL
CONDITION. A MINIMUM OF 70% IS RECOMMENDED.

INTELLIGENCE; THIS REFLECTS YOUR AGENTS MENTAL CAPACITIES. INTELLIGENCE
ENABLES YOUR AGENT TO SOLVE COMPLEX PROBLEMS.OR, FOR EXAMPLE,TO TAKE THE
UPPER HAND DURING A CONVERSATION.WITH ANOTHER CHARACTER HAVING WEAKER
MENTAL FACILITIES. A GENIUS IS DEFINED AS HAVING A VALUE OF 100 FOR
INTELLIGENCE,WHEREAS HAVING A VALUE OF 0 WOULD BE FATAL (BRAIN DEAD).

CHARISMA; IS YOUR AGENTS ABILITY TO BE ATTRACTIVE,WETHER THAT BE PHYSICAL
OR MENTALLY IN NATURE. THIS CHARACTERISTIC CAN BE VERY USEFUL DURING A
NEGOTIATION OR EVEN A FRIENDLY CHAT. THE MAX WILL GIVE YOUR AGENT A
HYPNOTIC EFFECT ON OTHERS WHILE THE MIMIMUM WILL RENDER HIM OR HER
INVISIBLE TO OTHER CHARACTERS.

THE REST ;PERCEPTION.VITALITY,REFLEXES,EXPERIENCE ECT ARE BASICALLY THE
SAME, THE HIGHER THE % THE BETTER.

			     B.O.B
                             -----
YOUR AGENT POSSESSES,AS DOES EVERY B.A.T AGENT, A Biodirectional Organic 
Bioputer (B.O.B) IN HIS LEFT ARM.
BOB ANALYSES IN (REAL TIME) YOUR AGENTS ORGAMISM BY MONITORING SEVERAL
IMPLANTS IN YOUR AGENTS BODY AND BY CONTROLLING HIS BLOOD FLOW. BOB IS NOT
A GADGET; IT IS A TOOL THAT WILL HELP YOUR AGENT AND CAN EVEN SAVE HIS
LIFE. EVEN IF YOU DECIDE NOT DECIDE TO TAP ALL BOBS POTENTIAL(BY USING THE
ADVANCED PROGRAMMING MODULE AND IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO SO TO COMPLETE A
MISSION) WE RECOMMEND,NONETHELESS,THAT YOU TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
EXTRAORDIANRY POWER THAT B.O.B CAN AFFORD YOU.

TO ACCESS B.O.B CLICK ON THE RHMB TO FREE UP THE MOUSE,AND THEN CLICK ON
THE B.O.B WINDOW IN THE UPPER RIGHT OF THE SCREEN WITH THE LHMB. YOUR
AGENTS ARM WILL THEN A PPEAR WITH A MAIN MENU.

TO RETURN TO THE GAME, CLICK ON THE RHMB WHILE YOU ARE IN THE MAIN B.O.B
MENU.

THE 4 ICONS ARE THE MEANS OF ACCESS TO THE 4 PRINCIPAL FUNCTIONS OF B.O.B
(CHARCTERISTICS,BIO,IMPLANTS,PROGRAMMING MODULE) CLICK ON THE ICON WITH THE
LHMB TO ACCESS IT.
          ------------------------------------------------------
                             THE `CHARACTERISTICS` FUNCTION
                             ------------------------------
THIS FUNCTION SUMMARARIZES THE GENERAL STATE OF YOUR AGENTS CHARACTERISTICS
(STRENGTH,INTELLIGENCE,VITALITY,REFLEXES,PERCEPTION,CHARISMA) WEAK
CHARACTERISTICS WILL FLASH IN RED. YOUR AGENTS EXPERIENCE AND PROGRESSION
ARE ALSO DISPLAYED.
          ------------------------------------------------------
                             THE `BIO` FUNCTION
                             ------------------
THIS DISPLAYS YOUR AGENTS HEART BEAT, A GRAPH SHOWING HIS CONSUMPTION
LEVELS,A REPRESENTATION OF THE IMPACTS(BLOWS) HE HAS RECIEVED,AND ACCESS TO
A DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM.

TOP LEFT OF SCREEN	HEART BEAT
MIDDLE LEFT OF SCREEN	CONSUMPTION GRAPHS
BOTTOM LEFT OF SCREEN	EXIT

MIDDLE RIGHT OF SCREEN  COMMAND ZONE FOR THE MAN IN 3D
MIDDLE/FAR RIGHT SCREEN	DIAGNOSTIC FUNCTION.

THE HEART BEAT IS DISPLAYED AS A CARDIOGRAM THAT SHOWS THE DILLATORY AND
CONTRACTORY MOVEMENTS OF THE ARTERIES. A NORMAL RHYTHM IS AROUND 60-70 BPM.
YOU CAN DECREASE THE RHYTHM(WITH A PROGRAM) TO PREVENT,FOR EXAMPLE,
EXCESSIVE BLEEDING WHEN YOUR AGENT IS WOUNDED.SIMILARLY, YOU CAN AUGMENT
YOUR AGENTS CARDIAC RHYTHM TO TEMPORARILY HIS REFLEXES.BE
CAREFUL,HOWEVER,NOT TO OVERSTRESS YOUR AGENT...

THE CONSUMPTION GRAPH(BELOW THE CARDIAC RHYTHM DISPLAY) SUMMARIZES THE
CALORIC AND WATER INTAKE OF YOUR AGENT AND THE AMOUNT OF SLEEP HE HAS
RECIEVED. THE RED CURVE INDICATES THE CALORIC LEVEL, THE GREEN CURVE
INDICATES THE LEVEL OF CORPORAL HYDRATION,AND THE BLUE LINE INDICATES THE
AMOUNT OF SLEEP NEEDED BY YOUR AGENT. YOU SHOULD TRY TO MAINTAIN THE CURVES
IN THE CENTRE OF THE SCREEN.

AN IMPACT RECIEVED BY YOUR AGENT WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE ROTATING 3D
MAN.IMPACTS ARE DISPLAYED IN RED ON THE BODY. YOU CAN
ENLARGE,REDUCE,IMMOBILIZE THE BODY OF THE 3D MAN BY CLICKING ON THE COMMAND
TO THE RIGHT.
NOTE; AN IMPACT SIGNIFIES THAT THE AGENT IS BLEEDING,CONSEQUENTLY MEDICAL
ATTENTION SHOULD BE SOUGHT.

THE DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM IS ACCESSED BY MEANS OF THE DIAGNOSTIC KEY. THIS
DIAGNOSTIC FUNCTION IS A REAL `EXPERT SYSTEM` MICRO-PROGRAM. A SCREEN
SUMMARIZING THE HEALTH OF YOUR AGENT WILL APPEAR. THE SCREEN DISPLAYS
TEMPERATURE,BLOOD PRESSURE(IF YOUR AGENT IS SICK!) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,A
SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL CONDITION(FROM NORMAL TO CRITICAL) THAT DISPLAYS IN
RED WHAT YOUR AGENT NEEDS MOST URGENTLY(DRINK,SLEEP,SEEK,CARE,ECT)
          ------------------------------------------------------
                             THE `IMPLANTS` FUNCTION
                             -----------------------
THIS FUNCTION ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL THE FIVE IMPLANTS(CYBERNETIC FUNCTION
THAT IMPROVE YOUR AGENTS ABILITIES) LOCATED IN THE BODY OF YOUR AGENT.
THESE IMPLANTS ARE.

* ATS 43.   (ANTI SLEEP S1) ALLOWS AGENTS TO STAY AWAKE FOR LONG PERIODS
* FIBRINE.  (HEALING AGENT S2) FIBRINE ALLOWS AGENTS TO HEAL SMALL WOUNDS
            RAPIDLY

* HYPERCEP. (HYPER PERCEPTION S3) THIS IMPLANT ACTIVATES A LIGHT
            AMPLIFICATING FILTER IN YOUR PUPIL OF YOUR AGENT.ALLOWING HIM TO
            SEE AT NIGHT.OTHER SOUND AMPLFIERS(LOCATED IN AGENTS EARS)WILL
            ALLOW HIM TO HEAR FAINT SOUNDS.

* MORPHO L7.(DEFORMANT S4) THIS IMPLANT ACTIVATES MOCROSACKS ON THE FACE OF
            THE AGENT,RENDERING HIM UNRECOGNIZABLE. HE WILL BE UNOTICED FOR
            A WHILE...

* PSY       (EXTRA SENSORIAL S5) THIS IMPLANT ALLOWS YOUR AGENT TO HAVE
            PREMONITONS OF IMMENIENT DANGERS. THE PREMS MANIFEST THEMSELVES
	    AS `RED FLASHES` 

IMPORTANT NOTES;
THE ACTIVATION OF THESE IMPLANTS CONSUMES LARGE QUANTITIES OF VITAL ENERGY. 
YOU MUST NOT OVER USE THEM OR YOUR AGENT WILL FATIGUE AND WIND UP EASY PREY.      

THESE IMPLANTS HAVE MEMORY.IF YOU ACTIVATE AN IMPLANT SEVERAL TIMES.IT WILL
REMAIN ACTIVATED FOR SEVERAL HOURS!
          ------------------------------------------------------
                             THE PROGRAMMING MODULE
                             ----------------------
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FUNCTIONS OF BOB, YOU HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL AN
EDITOR THAT ALLOWS YOU TO WRITE PROGRAMS. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO AUTOMATE MANY
ACTIVITIES IN YOUR AGENTS LIFE. THE LANGUAGE YOU PROGRAM IN IS CALLED
`PARALLEL TOKEN` AND IS ENTIRELY GRAPHICAL IN NATURE(ICONS ONLY) `PARALLEL`
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE SEVERAL COMPLETELY INDEPENDANT PROGRAMS AND
EXECUTE THEM AT THE SAME TIME (IN PARALLEL) `TOKEN` BECUASE ITS EXECUTION
MODULE INJECTS SELF-PRODUCING TOKENS INTO THE PROGRAM THAT ACTIVATE(OR
DE-ACTIVATE) VARIOUS FUNCTIONS. AS THE TOKENS CAN REPRODUCE THEMSELVES.THE
PARALLELISM EXISTS NOT ONLY AT THE PROGRAM LEVEL,BUT ALSO AT THE LEVE;L OF
THE PATHS WITHIN A PROGRAM.

TO PROGRAM, YOU HAVE AT YOUR DISPLOSAL AN 18 X 12 BLOCK WORKSHEET.EACH
BLOCK CAN CONTAIN CERTAIN FUNCTION ICONS. THIS WORKSHEETS REPRESENTS YOUR
PROGRAMMING AREA.

NOTES; CREATING `PARALLEL` PROGRAMS REDUCES VITAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION.
       YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 5 PROGRAMS RUNNING IN TANDEMS

THE EDITOR; THE EDITOR COMPRISES OF THREE MAJOR AREAS.
----------
THE LEFT HALF OF THE BOB SCREEN IS A 5X5 GRID SECTION OF THE PROGRAMMING
WORKSHEET. THIS GRID SECTION IS  CALLED THE `VIEWSHEET` YOU CAN MOVE IT
AROUND THE PROGRAMMING WORKSHEET BY USING THE DIRECTIONAL ARROWS LOCATED TO
THE RIGHT OF THE GRID.
THE UPPER RIGHT OF THE SCREEN IS THE FUNCTION FABRICATION ZONE(ZFI) THE
UPPER TWO LINES DISPLAY THE NAME OF THE INSTRUCTION JUST COMPLETED. THE
THREE BLOCKS BELOW ARE THE ACTIVE PARTS OF THE INSTRUCTION.(THE ACTIVE
FUNCTION IS THE ONE THAT YOU INSERT IN THE VIEWSHEET). BY CLICKING ON ONE
OF THEM,YOU WILL SCROLL THE PARAMETERS OF THE INSTRUCTION.

THE FIRST PARAMETER IS THE TYPR OF FUNCTION(STATE,DO,IF) THE TWO OTHERS ARE
THE PARAMETERS OF THE INSTRUCTION.

THE FOUR KEYS THAT ALLOW YOU TO ERASE AN INSTRUCTION. TO LINK INSTRUCTIONS
TOGETHER IN A `VIEWSHEET`(LINK `KEY`) TO COMPLETELY ERASE THE PROGRAMMING
WORKSHEET(`NEW KEY`) OR TO RETURN TO THE MAIN MENUAND,CONSEQUENTLY, START 
A COMPLILATION ARE LOCATED ON THE LOWER RIGHT OF THE SCREEN.

THE ERASE FUNCTION IS `ACTIVE` WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT(CLICK ON IT AGAIN TO
DE-ACTIVATE IT).WHEN ACTIVE, YOU CAN ERASE AS MANY INSTRUCTIONS AS YOU
WANT. THE LINK FUNCTION IS ALSO AN ACTIVE FUNCTION,WHEN ACTIVE,CLICK ON THE
SPOT OF THE VIEWSHEET WHERE YOU WANT TO BEGIN A LINK. A RED LINE THAT MOVES
FREELY WILL APPEAR ON THE VIEWSHEET.MOVE THIS LINE TO THE DESIRED
DESTINATION AND CLICK; THE LINK WILL BE DRAWN AUTOMATICALLY.DO NOT CREATE
LINKS THAT ARE TOO COMPLEX-THE PROGRAM HAS AN ALGORHYTHM THAT OPTIMISES
CONNECTIONS AND IT WILL BE THROWN AWRY BY COMPLEX LINKAGES. KEEP THE LINKS
SIMPLE AND DIRECT TO AVOID FINDING YOURSELF IN AN INCOMPRHENSIBLE MESS...

BOB IS ALSO FURNISHED WITH AN ALARM. TO SET,INSERT THE FUNCTION IF HOUR=
ALARM IN THE VIEWSHEET AND CLICK ON THE ALARM CLOCK ICON. THEN CLICK ON THE
ARROWS TO CHANGE THE ALARM TIME.

YOU CAN SEE THE ENTIRE PROGRAM WORKSHEET(ZOOM FUNCTION) BY CLICKING ON THE
RHMB(ONLY WHEN YOU ARE INEDITOR) A 5X5 SQUARE WHICH REPRESENTS THE
VIEWSHEET,WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE 8X12 WORKSHEET.CLICK ON THE LHMB TO MOVE
THE VIEWSHEET.CLICK ON THE RHMB TO RETURN TO THE EDITOR.

THE COMPLIER
------------
A COMPLILER IS AN ALGORHYTM THAT TRANSLATES THE COMPUTER LANGUAGE OF A
PROGRAM INTO BINARY CODE(THE LANGUAGE MOST SIMILAR TO THE THOUGHT PROCESS
OF A COMPUTER) BEFORE THE EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAMME. THIS TRANSLATION
CONSIDERABLY AUGUMENTS THE EXECUTION SPEED OF THE PROGRAM. `PARALLEL` TOKEN
HAS A COMPILER. THE BOB OF BAT 1 HAD AN INTERPRETOR, A PROGRAM THAT
TRANSFORMS INSTRUCTIONS TO BINARY CODE AT THE MOMENT OF THEIR EXECUTION.

WHEN YOU SELECT THE `EXIT` OPTION WHILE IN THE EDITOR,YOU AUTOMATICALLY
LAUNCH THE COMPILER WHICH WILL COMPILE THE PROGRAM/S ON YOUR WORKSHEET(IF
THERE ARE ANY). THE RESULT OF THE COMPILATION IS DISPLAYED IN THE MAIN MENU
AS A FLASHING MESSAGE. THE MESSAGE WILL BE EITHER `RUNNING`,IF THERE ARE NO
ERRORS FOUND(THE PROGRAM IS THUS EXECUTED AUTOMATICALLY) OR `ERROR` IF THE
COMPILERE FINDS AN ERROR.

IF AN ERROR IS FOUND,THE VIEWSHEET WILL AUTOMATICALLY DISPLAY THE ERROR
WHEN YOU RETURN TO THE EDITOR. THE LOCATION WHERE THE COMPILER STOPPED WILL
BE HIGHLIGHTED IN RED.

PARALLEL TOKEN - BEGINNER LEVEL
-------------------------------
THE PARAALEL TOKEN HAS 3 BASIC FUNCTIONS;THE `STATE FUNCTIONS` A `DO` 
FUNCTION AND A TEST FUNCTION;`IF` THE POSSIBLE INSTRUCTIONS ARE;

* RUN (STATE FUNCTION) THIS ICON STARTS A PROGRAM(OBLIGATORY AT THE
BEGINNING OF ALL PROGRAMS)

* STOP (STATE FUNCTION) STOPS A TOKEN,THUS TEMPORARILLY STOPPING THE
EXECUTION OF A PROGRAM.

* END (STATE FUNCTION) THIS ICON DESTROYS THE TOKEN THAT IT ENCOUNTERS AND
RE-INJECTS A TOKEN AT THE LAST ENCOUNTERED `RUN` ALL PROGRAMS MUST
TERMINATE WITH AN `END`

* DO P1,P2; THIS ICON EXECUTES THE FUNCTION `P1,P2`(PARAMETER 1,
PARAMETER 2)ONLY P1,P2 ARE DISPLAYED ON THE VIEWSHEET.(eg- DO DISPLAY
STRENGTH)

* IF P1,P2; THIS FUNCTION ALLOWS YOU TO TEST,IF CONDITION P1.P2 IS TRUE,THE
TOKEN WILL TAKE THE DIRECTION OF THE RIGHT ARROW(`1` LOGIC) OTHERWISE,IT
WILL MOVE DOWNWARDS(`0` LOGIC)
          ------------------------------------------------------
PROGRAMMING RULES
-----------------
WHEN STARTING OFF FOLLOW THESE PROGRAMING RULES(SEE ALSO ANNEX 6)

* A TOKEN NEVER MOVES IN AN UPWARD DIRECTION.do not make any upward links

* A TOKEN ALWAYS ARRIVES AT AN INSTRUCTION FROM ABOVE.connect from above

* THE FIRST PARAMETER WILL BE EXECUTED AT A JUNCTION

* ALWAYS BEGING PROGRAMS WITH `RUN`

* FINISH ALL BRANCHES WITH `END` or reloop them toward an END

* BEGIN ALL INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING YOUR CHARACTER WITH THE INSTRUCTION `DO
  ANALYSE ME` and all instructions regarding an EVI with DO ANALYSE HUMAN.
