 Dizzy's in trouble - again! Dizzy was taking a boat journey to visit his
 girlfriend, Daisy and present her with a glittering pearl necklace (the
 old romantic). But! Catastrophe strikes as Dizzy discovers he's not on
 passenger boat at all!! It's a pirate ship, captained by non other than
 the evil Captain Blackheart.

 "Yikes!" yelled Dizzy as Blackheart snatched the pearls from his clutches!

 Blackheart hollered, "Avast there! Splice the mainbrace! And chuck this land
 lubber over the side! With that, Dizzy was made to walk the plank and - 
 splooosh! - into the ocean he fell!

 As Dizzy ank into the mysterious ocean caverns there was only one thing
 for it - head for the suurface and FAST!!

 DIZZY GETS FIZZICAL!

 To rise to the surface Dizzy can jump onto the bubbles rising from the
 floor of the deep caverns. Leap on top of a bubble, stay balanced and
 Dizzy floats towards the surface - but look out, thatbubble could burst
 at any moment!

 Ledges on the cavern wall make handy resting places for Dizzy. Some ledges
 house oysters from which Dizzy collects pearls! If he gets enough he can
 make a new necklace and win Daisy's love!

 Danger lurks in the caverns. Beware of the ocean creatures which drain
 Dizzy's energy. And don't run out of oxygen either! By leaping onto bubbles
 and lesges Dizzy can reach the surface and leap onto land!
