  A BATTLESHIP REPRESENTS THE BISMARCK AND PRINZ EUGEN. IF YOU ARE PLAYING 
  THE GERMAN SIDE THEN THIS IS THE ONLY OTHER UNIT SYMBOL ON THE MAP WHEN 
  YOU START THE GAME. IF YOU OPTED TO PLAY THE BRITISH THERE WILL BE 12
  UNITS DISPLAYED. THE DARK BLUE UNITS ON A LIGHT BLUE BACKGROUND ARE UNDER
  ADMIRALTY CONTROL. THE BLACK UNITS ON A GREY BACKGROUND ARE UNDER YOUR
  CONTROL AND CAN BE MOVED AT WILL.

  if you move the COMBOX over any of the units on screen information about
  them will be displayed. the codes are as follows:

  BB   No of BATTLESHIPS in fleet/unit
  CH   No of HEAVY CRUISERS
  DD   No of DESTROYERS

  BECOME A CROSS. MOVE THE CROSS TO WHERE YOU WANT THE UNIT TO GO AND PRESS
  FIRE AGAIN. THE UNIT WILL NOW BEGIN MOVING TO THAT POINT ON THE MAP. TO 
  SEE WHERE A UNIT IS HEADING AT ANY TIME, SIMPLY MOVE THE Combox OVER IT.
  ITS DESTINATION WILL BE PINPOINTED BY THE MOVEMENT CURSOR.

  NOTE: ships cannot sail over land--you must give directions around land
        masses.
        
        if opposing units sight each other (come within 40000 yards in good
        visibility) then both will  be displayed on the map.
        they need not attack however.

  NIGHT AND DAY

  YOU WILL NOTE THAT AT 2000 HOURS EACH  DAY THE MAP BACKGROUND COLOUR 
  CHANGES FROM LIGHT TO DARK. THIS SIGNIFIES THE ONSET OF NIGHT. DURING THE
  NIGHT PHASE YOU HAVE NO Air/Search, CANNOT MAKE Air Attacks AND VISIBILITY
  IS LIMITED.
  DAYLIGHT RETURNS AT 0400.

  VISIBILITY:

  THE MAXIMUM RANGE OF VISIBILITY IS AFFECTED BY BOTH NIGHT AND DAY AND THE
  WEATHER. IT RANGES FROM 41000 YARDS ON A CLEAR DAY DOWN TO 3000 YARDS AT
  NIGHT IN POOR WEATHER. YOU WILL SEE THE OPPOSING SHIPS FADE OUT AS THEY
  APPROACH MAXIMUM RANGE OF VISIBILITY. YOU CAN USE POOR WEATHER TO HELP YOU
  SNEAK PAST ENEMY SHIPS WHEN YOU WANT TO AVOID A FIGHT.

  SHIP ACTION SCREENS:

  MOVE THE Combox OVER ONE OF YOUR SHIP UNITS AGAIN AND PRESS FIRE THREE(3)
  TIMES. THE UNIT WILL FLASH AND THE WORD BATTLE WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN
  AND YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH A SHIP SCREEN. IF THE ENEMY SHIP ATTACKS
  ONE OF YOUR SHIPS YOU WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY BE TAKE ONTO THIS SCREEN.
  THIS IS YOUR VIEWPOINT FROM THE SHIP AND IS USED TO ENGAGE THE ENEMY UNITS.
  THE SCREENS VARY ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF SHIP YOU ARE CONTROLLING.

  1.BATTLESHIPS

  THE SCREEN IS SPLIT INTO THREE(3)

  THE TOP THIRD IS THE REAL WORLD VIEW AND SHIPS WILL BE SHOWN HERE ALONG
  WITH YOUR GUNS AND ANY ATTACKING AIRCRAFT.

  THE CENTRE SECTION IS YOUR ICON SELECTION BOX:

  THE LEFT HAND COLUMN OF ICONS CONTROL YOUR MOVEMENT.

  THESE ARE SHOWN AS
  (TWO SHIPS FACING EACH OTHER ) MEANING:  close in on the ship on screen.
  (TWO SHIPS---ONE CHASING THE OTHER) MEANING:  maintain the same distance.
  (TWO SHIPS---FACING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER)MEANING:  retreat.

  THE NEXT COLUMN OF THREE(3) CONTROL YOUR VIEWPOINT:

  (ONE SHIP WITH A CURSOR POINTING FORWARD) MEANING: forward view.
  (ONE SHIP WITH A CURSOR POINTING REAR   ) MEANING: aft (rear view).
  (A TELESCOPE)                             MEANING: SHIP I.D BOOK

  SELECTION OF THIS LAST ICON WILL BE SEQUENTIALLY DISPLAY A LIST OF ALL THE
  SHIPS IN THE ACTION AND STOP WHEN IT GETS TO THE SHIP CURRENTLY ON SCREEN
  PRESS RIGHT TO SPEED UP THE LIST. THIS FEATURE IS VERY USEFUL FOR ENSURING
  YOU DONT ATTACK YOUR OWN SHIPS UNTIL YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY EXPERIENCED
  AT THE GAME TO IDENTIFY THE SHIP SILOUETTES WITHOUT REFERRING TO THE BOOK.
  
  MOVING FURTHER RIGHT YOU ARE GIVEN INFORMATION ON YOUR guns AND damage
  THE TWO BOXES AT THE TOP OF THE SECTION ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN red,flashing
  green, or green.
  LARGE NAVAL GUNS MUST HAVE THEIR BARRELS IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION FOR THE
  HYDRAULIC HOIST/RAMS TO LOAD A SHELL AND CHARGE.
  THIS MEANS IN PRACTICE THAT ONE BARREL IS UP AND READY TO FIRE WHILE THE
  OTHER IS DOWN RELOADING. TO SIMULATE THIS THE GUN CONTROLS ARE AS FOLLOWS
  
  BOTH GUN LAMPS  green: BOTH GUNS REDAY TO FIRE.

  EITHER GUN LAMP red  : RELOADING NEITHER WILL FIRE.

  EITHER GUN LAMP flashing green: 
                                :ONE GUN HAS RELOADED IS COMING TO ELEVATION
                                :THE OTHER GUN CAN BE FIRED!
  THE OTHER green               :

  NOTE: 4.7" guns on destroyers did not work in the way described above, but
  for ease of game design we have assumed they did.--apoliges

  JUST BELOW THE GUN LAMPS :TWO SETS OF FIGURES ARE SHOWN.:
  THE TOP SET SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE THAT THE SHIP YOU ARE ATTACKING HAS
  SUSTAINED, THE BOTTOM SET IS YOUR LEVEL OF DAMAGE, ANY LEVEL OVER 99
  MEANS YOU ARE SINKING.

  MOVING TO THE RIGHT AGAIN, THE NEXT THREE(3) ICONS ARE:

  DAMAGE CONTROL     (SHOWN AS A FIRE EXTINGUISHER)

  SELECTING THIS PUTS A CURSOR ON THE SHIP PLAN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN
  MOVE THE CURSOR TO ANY SECTION THAT IS ON FIRE AND PRESS FIRE. THE WHITE
  DAMAGE CONTROL PARTY SYMBOL WILL MOVE TO THAT POINT AND PUT THE FIRE
  OUT. REMEMBER THAT FIRES SPREAD. THE VARIOUS LETTERS SHOWN ON THE PLAN
  ARE AS FOLLOWS:

  `G`     GUN TURRET  -  A FIRE HERE WILL REDUCE YOUR RATE OF FIRE
  `M`     MAGAZINE    -  ANY FIRE HERE COULD LEAD TO AN EXPLOSION
  `S`     SHELL ROOM  -  AS ABOVE
  `E`     ENGINE ROOM -  DAMAGE HERE WILL SLOW YOU DOWN
  `B`     BOILER ROOM -  AS ABOVE AND/OR LEAD TO AN EXPLOSION.

  ALSO REMEMBER TO PUT ALL FIRES OUT BEFORE RETURNING TO THE `MAP SCREEN`
  AS THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BURN AND SPREAD IF UNDEALT WITH AND MAY RESULT
  IN YOUR SHIP SINKING.

  THE NEXT ICON DOWN GIVES YOU `GUN CONTROL`. ONCE YOU SELECT THIS OPTION
  YOU CAN SWEP YOUR GUNS LEFT(PORT) AND RIGHT (STARBOARD) TO GIVE AN ALL
  ROUND VIEW FROM THE SHIP. THE GUNS HAVE THE FOLLOWING SWEEP.

                                 0

                                180

  TO FIRE THE GUNS PRESS `FIRE` WITH THIS ICON SELECTED.

  THE LAST ICON IN THIS COLUMN (SHOW AS A BOX WITH A LARGE CROSS IN IT.)
  EXITS TO THE MAIN MAP SCREEN. YOU CANNOT EXIST WHILST AN ENEMY SHIP IS
  WITHIN VISIBILITY OF YOUR SHIP.

  THE FINAL (FAR RIGHT) COLUMN OF FIGURES DISPLAYS INFORMATION ABOUT
  `DISTANCE`, `RANGE` , AND `BEARINGS`.

  THE TOP FIGURE IS THE RANGEFINDERS ESTIMATE OF THE `DISTANCE` TO THE
  SHIP SHOWN ON THE SCREEN.

  THE CENTRE READOUT IS THE `RANGE` THE GUNS ARE CURRENTLY SET AT. WITH
  THE `GUN CONTROL` ICON SELECTED,MOVING `UP`OR`DOWN` WILL INCREASE OR
  DECREASE THIS RANGE.WHEN FIRING AT SHIPS YOU SHOULD AIM TO KEEP
  THESE TOP TWO FIGURES EQUAL.

  THE BOTTOM READOUT SHOWS THE TURRET `BEARING`.IF THIS IS HIGHLIGHTED
  `RED`,THE GUN TURRET IS POINTING TO `PORT`,IF `GREEN` THEN IT IS
  POINTING TO `STARBOARD`.SEE `GUN CONTROL` FOR MORE INFORMATION.

  MOVING AND SELECTING ICONS

  WHEN YOU FIRST ENTER THIS SCREEN,THE `EXIT,FORWARD VIEW AND MAINTAIN 
  DISTANCE` ICONS WILL BE SELECTED.YOU CAN MOVE THE HIGHLIGHTED  
  `SELECT` BOX AROUND USING THE JOYSTICK OR THE COMMAND KEYS AND 
  PRESSING FIRE WILL `SELECT` AN OPTION.IF YOU HAVE SELECTED EITHER
  `GUN CONTROL` OR `DAMAGE CONTROL` YOU MUST PRESS THE LEFT HAND MOUSE
  BUTTON TO RETURN TO NORMAL ICON SELECT MODE.
  THE OTHER TYPES OF SCREEN AVAILABLE ARE AS FOLLOWS;

  2. DESTROYERS/CRUISERS/CONVOYS (YOU CONTROL THE DESTROYER  ESCORTS)

  THE CHANGES ARE;

  A) IN PLACE OF THE PLAN VIEW YOU HAVE A RADAR DISPLAY (REMEMBER ALL
     SHIPS APPEAR ON THE RADAR SCREEN- NOT JUST ENEMY SHIPS).

  B) `A TORPEDO` ICON REPLACES `DAMAGE CONTROL`.TO FIRE A TORPEDO,
     HIGHLIGHT THE ICON AND PRESS FIRE.AFTER A SHORT WAIT A MESSAGE
     WILL APPEAR ON SCREEN INDICATING EITHER A HIT OR A MISS.

  3. AIRCRAFT CARRIERS
     THE DISPLAY IS AS FOR `BATTLESHIPS` BUT ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE NO
     `DAMAGE CONTROL` (IT IS ASSUMED THAT IF YOU ARE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO
     ALLOW A RELATIVELY UNDEFENDED AIRCRAFT CARRIER SO CLOSE TO THE
     ENEMY THAT IT CAN BE ATTACKED,THEN YOU DESERVE TO LOSE IT!)
     REPLACING THE `DAMAGE CONTROL` ICON IS `LAUNCH AIRCRAFT`.
     IF AN ENEMY SHIP IS WITHIN AN AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AIR SEARCH ZONE
     (3 SQUARES) AND IT IS DAYLIGHT AND CLEAR WEATHER,THEN SELECTING
     `LAUNCH AIRCRAFT` WILL SEND A SQUADRON OF FAIREY SWORDFISH TORPEDO
     BOMBERS TO ATTACK THE ENEMY SHIP.IF IT IS DARK WHEN THEY REACH THE
     TARGET, NO ATTACK WILL BE MADE.IF THE WEATHER DETERIORATES EN ROUTE
     LOSSES WILL BE TAKEN.
     WHEN THE AIRCRAFT REACH THE ENEMY YOU WILL GO AUTOMATICALLY INTO THE
     `AIR STRIKE ACTION SCREEN`.AFTER AN ATTACK THE AIRCRAFT WILL RETURN
     TO THE CARRIER.
     A FURTHER AIR STRIKE CANNOT BE MADE FROM THE SAME CARRIER WITHIN
     SEVEN HOURS OF THE FIRST LAUNCHING.THERE IS ONLY ONE AIR STRIKE UNIT
     PER CARRIER, AND IF IT IS AVAILABLE IT WILL BE SHOWN ON DECK ON THE 
     PLAN VIEW.

  AIR STRIKE ACTION SCREEN

  IF YOU ARE COMMANDING THE BRITISH WHEN AN AIR STRIKE IS MADE,THE SCREEN
  WILL CLEAR TO THE VIEW FROM THE COCKPIT OF THE LEADING SWORDFISH
  AIRCRAFT.ON THE HORIZON YOU WILL SEE THE ENEMY SHIP.IN THE CENTRE OF THE
  SCREEN IS YOUR TARGETTING CURSOR.THE 2 DIALS ARE YOUR ALTIMETER (RIGHT
  HAND) AND `ASI` (AIR SPEED - LEFT HAND).
  MOVING DOWN INCREASES YOUR SPEED AND REDUCES YOUR HEIGHT,MOVING UP
  DECREASES SPEED AND INCREASES HEIGHT.
  THE SWORDFISH`S MAXIMUM SPEED WITH A TORPEDO WAS APPROXIMATELY 100 KNOTS
  IT WOULD SLOW TO AROUND 60 KNOTS TO DROP THE TORPEDO AND THE OPTIMUM
  HEIGHT WAS 80 TO 100 FEET.
  THE ALTIMETER ON YOUR SCREEN HAS A TRIANGULAR SECTOR MARKED ON IT.THE
  TOP OF THAT SECTOR IS 100 FEET.THE BOTTOM IS SEA LEVEL.THE `ASI` READS
  60 KNOTS AT 10 O`CLOCK.
  AN 18" (AIR DROPPED) TORPEDO WILL RUN FOR 1,200 YARDS BEFORE IT IS 
  ARMED.IT WILL RUN FOR A FURTHER 4,800 YARDS AT A SPEED OF 32 KNOTS AND
  THEN SLOW TO 20 KNOTS FOR ITS FINAL 4,000 YARDS.IT WILL "DIE" AT
  10,000 YARDS.
  TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL TORPEDO ATTACK,YOU MUST THEREFORE DROP THE
  TORPEDO (PRESS FIRE) AT 100 FEET,60 KNOTS AND BETWEEN 1,200 YARDS AND
  10,000 YARDS.YOU WILL LEARN TO GAUGE THE DISTANCE TO THE ENEMY SHIP FROM
  ITS SIZE ON THE SCREEN THE MORE YOU PLAY THE GAME.
  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE ENEMY,THE MORE CHANCE
  YOU STAND OF BEING SHOT DOWN.EQUALLY IF YOU SIMPLY FLY IN A STRAIGHT
  LINE AT THE SHIP,YOU DON`T STAND MUCH CHANCE OF GETTING TO DROP THE 
  TORPEDO.
  AFTER DROPPING,YOUR AIRCRAFT WILL VEER AWAY FROM THE ENEMY SHIP,AND
  YOU WILL BE PLACED IN CONTROL OF THE FOLLOWING AIRCRAFT.DURING THIS
  NEXT RUN,A MESSAGE WILL APPEAR TELLING YOU IF THE LAST PLANE`S TORPEDO
  SCORED A HIT OR NOT.
  THIS SEQUENCE IS REPEATED FOR ALL THE AIRCRAFT IN THE UNIT.
  IF YOU ARE COMMANDING THE BISMARCK AND YOU COME UNDER AIR ATTACK,YOUR GUNS
  BECOME ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS AND CAN BE MOVED IN ALL DIRECTIONS.FIRING IS
  MUCH MORE RAPID THAN BEFORE.DAMAGE IS SHOWN IN THE NORMAL WAY.

  1) AVOID ENGAGING ENEMY BATTLESHIPS WHERE POSSIBLE,BUT TRY TO SINK
     ANYTHING ELSE YOU COME ACROSS.
  2) TRY TO KEEP UNDER BAD WEATHER.AN IDEAL TIME TO BREAK THROUGH THE
     BRITISH LINES IS UNDER BAD WEATHER AT NIGHT.
  3) KEEP IN MIND THE VICTORY CONDITIONS.GETTING TO BREST SAFELY
     WITHOUT DAMAGE AND WITHOUT SINKING ANYTHING MEANS YOU LOSE.
  4) KEEP AN EYE ON THE TIME AND DATE.IF YOU DON`T GET TO THE SOUTHERN
     EDGE BEFORE THE GAME FINISHES -- YOU LOSE.
  5) IF YOU ARE NEAR AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER,EITHER TRY AND SINK IT OR
     RETREAT -- DON`T HANG AROUND.

  BRITISH PLAYER

  1) DON`T COMMIT YOURSELF TO EITHER THE NORTH OR SOUTH OF ICELAND
     UNTIL YOU SPOT THE BISMARCK OR YOU`LL GET LEFT BEHIND.
  2) USE THE CARRIER`S AIR SEARCH CAPABILITY IN YUOR HUNT.TRY NOT TO 
     LET ZONES OVERLAP.
  3) DON`T LET CARRIERS GET TOO CLOSE TO THE BISMARCK.
  4) IN ACTION,DON`T LET YOUR BATTLESHIPS GET TOO CLOSE TO THE BISMARCK
     THAT WAY YOU CAN WITHDRAW MORE EASILY IF YOU TAKE DAMAGE.
  5) USE CRUISERS AND DESTROYERS TO SHADOW THE BISMARCK.DON`T WASTE
     THEM IN FUTILE ATTACKS.

  GENERAL TIP;

  DURING BATTLES,RAPID MANOEUVRES CAN CONFUSE THE ENEMY AND ALLOW YOU
  TO CLOSE ON A SHIP THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE MOVING AWAY.SELECT
  "CLOSE IN" FOLLOWED BY "MOVE AWAY" FOLLOWED BY "CLOSE IN" IN RAPID
  SUCCESSION.

                             GOOD LUCK

                          AND GOOD HUNTING
