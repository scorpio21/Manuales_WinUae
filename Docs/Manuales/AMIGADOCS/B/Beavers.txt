°Beavers Docs.
*-*-*-*-*-*-*

BEAVERMANIA has swept the World! The Beavers Supergroup and their megastar
leader Jehtro have reached number one in the Chart again! With their catchy
"funky-hillbilly" style songs and the "Beaverspin" dance craze sweeping the
forest discos, the World is their oyster.

Not all the creatures in the valley are pleased with the Beaver's success.
The Rappin' rabbit Rockers, the former number one group, are VERY angry about
the Beavers rise to the top. Not only is it costing them a fortune in record
rales but the Beaver style goes against their underground hare-raising rock/
rap musical taste. They are determined to rid the charts of this cutesy music
- Once and for all!!

A fiendish plan is put into operation. Jethro's beloved wife is kidnapped and
held hostage. She will not be released until the Beavers are disbanded and
all their master tapes are destroyed!

Jethro is determined not to let his Beaver comrades down. In a heroic gesture
he sets off to rescue his kidnapped wife with the aid of his faithful
children.
