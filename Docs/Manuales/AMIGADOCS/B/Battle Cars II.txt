                         1.  Introduction
                             ------------

This game is the sequel to "Battle Cars", the public domain game released
in 1991 (not to be confused with the Amos Licenseware game of the same
name).
    For either one or two players, the game is played inside one of four
800m by 800m arenas with the two cars starting at opposite ends. The aim
is simply to destroy your opponent's car, which is done by breaching the
armour on one side of his (or her) car.  To help you in your task, your
car is equipped with a 30mm cannon, radar guided missiles and (in the two
player game) a set of ram-plates.








                         2. Loading Instructions
                            --------------------

To load the game, simply reset the computer and put the disk into the
drive.  You will then be asked if you want to view these instructions -
just type 'Y' or 'N' followed by <RETURN>.
    The first thing to load will be an animation of a flight around the
city where the arena is situated - just press the left mouse button or the
joystick fire button to quit.  Next, the game itself will load and you
will be presented with the title screen.  Press a key to go past this and
then type in your name at the prompt, followed by <RETURN>.  The next
screen is the main menu where you can start a game or change the options
such as track number and ramplates on/off.
    The game will run on half-meg machines but you won't get any music
during the intro animation.  Tests have been done on the A500+ and it
works fine.  Although I haven't been able to test it on an A2000 or A3000,
I don't think there would be any problems.

NOTE: This version of the game is PAL ONLY.  If you have an NTSC
(American) amiga, you will need to install the program as explained in
section 8.

                         3. Driving The Car
                            ---------------

The game is played using the joystick - left and right turn left and
right, forward and back accelerate and decelerate the car and *FIRE* fires
fire your gun.  The only other controls are <SPACE BAR> to fire a missile
and <ESC> to quit from a game.

The dashboard at the bottom of the screen displays the following
information :
At the left hand side is your speed in mph (with a minus sign if you are
going backwards).
In the middle are two gauges showing how much ammo your gun has left and
how many missiles you have.
Your armour and your opponent's armour are displayed at the right hand
side - yours in red and his in blue.
    The car is also equipped with a radar which tracks the enemy car and
shows its position on the screen; if your opponent is in front of you then
a green targetting box will be displayed showing where he is, otherwise an
arrow will be displayed telling you to either go left or right.  When one
of your missiles is locked on to the enemy car, a diamond will light up
inside the green targetting box.

The maximum speed is 100mph either backwards(!) or forwards.  When you
steer, the wheels turn gradually in the direction you want to turn i.e. to
do a hard turn you need to keep pushing the joystick in one direction.
The wheels will gradually straighten when you stop pushing the joystick
sideways, so a slow turn rate can be achieved by alternately pushing the
joystick sideways and then letting go again.  A feature not present on
most driving games is that when you push the joystick in the opposite
direction to the direction you were steering, the wheels will immediately
straighten, allowing very fast changes in direction.
    As with a real car, if you try to steer too hard the car will begin to
skid.  The amount of skid depends on the speed you are going at and also
how hard you are turning, and generally tends to increase if you keep
steering in the same direction.  A small amount of skid is nothing to
worry about but if you keep skidding your speed is likely to decrase, a
fact which can be used to advantage when you want to stop quickly.
    Crashing into buildings or walls doesn't do your car any damage, but
will decrease your speed.  The outcome of a collision with another car
depends on whether you are playing a one or two player game.  In a one
player game you cannot crash into the computer car but during a two player
game the outcome is the same as crashing into a wall (unless ram-plates
are on - see section 6 for more details).






















                         4. Weapons
                            -------

Your car has two weapons - a very big, powerful gun and also 3 radar
guided missiles.  To fire the gun simply hit the fire button whenever you
have your opponent in your gunsights.  You have a limited amount of ammo,
but there should be enough to keep most people happy.
    Missiles do a lot more damage than guns, but you only have 3 of them
so they need to be used wisely.  The missiles automatically lock on to the
enemy car and try to follow it around the course at a speed of 200mph, but
they do have a limited turning circle which means that they will sometimes
just crash into a wall or building.  There is a proximity fuze built into
the missiles so that they automatically explode when they are within 10
metres of the enemy car.  Each missile has enough fuel to fly for 30
seconds which, although it might sound a bit low, is more than enough to
enable it to fly right round the arena several times, and it is very rare
for a missile to last more than about 10 seconds after being fired.
    An important thing to consider when using missiles is that they take
time to "warm up" - for the first 1.5 seconds of flight (about 150
metres!), the missile will just fly straight ahead in the direction it was
fired and will not explode even if it goes right past your opponent's car.
This means that there is an effective minimum distance for missiles.  The
diamond shaped "lock on" indicator will only be displayed if you are
outside this minimum range (and, obviously, only if you have some missiles
left to fire!).  However this indicator is only a guide - a missile can
still be launced when there is no lock and could still hit the enemy car
if the car is travelling away from you.  Similarly, if the enemy car is
coming straight towards you then you will need to be slightly further away
than the minimum distance.  In general, the further away you are from your
enemy, the better chance you have of hitting him, but it also gives him a
chance to try and outmanoeuvre your missile.
    In a two player game, if you hear a missile being fired then its time
to panic!  You have roughly 5 seconds (at most) to try and lose the
missile by either driving behind a building or turning hard in an attempt
to make the missile fly past.  Using either approach does not mean that
the missile actually loses you but it does greatly increase the chance of
the missile hitting a wall or building and exploding harmlessly.
    Your car has armour on four sides - front, back, left and right.  Each
side has 48 points, one point being taken off by each hit by a gun, 10
points for a missile hit and 15 points if you are hit by the other player
when he has ram-plates.  Armour is taken off the side of the car which is
hit except for the missiles, which take armour off all four sides of the
car.

                         5. One Player Game
                            ---------------

In the one player game you play against a computer driven car.  You can't
crash into the computer car and it can't fire back at you.  Sound a bit
easy?  Not when you realize that you have a time limit of three minutes in
which to win, otherwise the computer automatically wins.
    The computer car drives a set course around each track ranging from a
Sunday lada driver on track 1 to a Formula one driver on track 4. However,
even on the harder tracks the computer car has no built-in advantage over
your car i.e. it has the same turn rates, acceleration/deceleration etc.
    Both standard weapons are available in the one player game - missiles
and machine gun - but it won't make any difference whether ram-plates are
on or off because you simply pass through the drone car if you hit it.
    The one player game is started by selecting "one player game" from
the main menu and can be quit simply by pressing <ESCAPE> during a game.






                         6. Two Player Game
                            ---------------

In a two player game you play head-to-head against another human player
using two amigas connected by a null modem cable.  Full details of
connecting the computers together can be found in section 9.
    Assuming that you have connected both computers together and the game
is loaded on both computers, the next step is to "connect" the two
computers.  This can be done by choosing the "two player options" from the
main menu and then "make connection".  The computer will then print
"trying to connect".  At this point "make connection" should be selected
on the other computer and if all goes well the message "connection
established" should appear on both computers.  If not, press <ESCAPE> and
refer to section 9.
    Once the two computers have been successfully connected, the computer
which selected "make connection" first will be in control - any mouse
movements or menu selections made on that machine will also be carried out
on the other machine.  Note that any options such as track number or
ram-plates will be automatically be synchronized on both computers to the
settings on the controlling computer.
    Selecting "break connection" from the "two player options" menu will
break the connection between the two machines reverting to normal control
on both machines.
    To actually start a two player game, select "return to main menu" and
then "two player game".  It is possible to start a two player game simply
by choosing this option without first having selected "make connection";
the two machines will automatically connect before the game can start.
However, it is better to make the connection before this point so that
both players can see exactly what options are being used in the game.
    The two player game starts with both cars at opposite ends of the
arena.  Both players have guns and missiles as in the one player game but
there is also the option of having "ram-plates".  These are large pieces
of metal bolted to the front of your car which make collisions a lot more
interesting; each time you hit your opponent with the front of your car,
the ram-plates will remove roughly one third of his armour (on the side of
his car which is hit).  During a head-on collision BOTH cars lose armour,
so it is a good idea to avoid crashing head-on unless your opponent has
a lot less front armour than you.  Even when ram-plates are off during a
two player game, collision detection between the two cars is still
switched on, so crashing into the other car will have the same effect as
hitting a wall.
    Pressing <ESCAPE> during a two player game will quit the game for both
players meaning that nobody wins.
    There is no time limit in the two player game - you have as long as
you like to try to blow each other off the face of the earth, although in
practice games don't tend to last much longer than about 10 minutes at
most and ram-plates reduce life expectancy even further.

NOTE: If for some reason both machines hang up, it is sometimes possible to
regain control by keeping your finger on the ESCAPE key while selecting
"break connection" from the menu, or (during a game) by simply pressing
<ESCAPE> a few times.














                         7. Menu Options
                            ------------

All options are selected using the mouse - move to the option you want and
then press the left mouse button to select it.  Following is a brief
summary of the menu options:


                            Main menu:

One player game:     Begins a one player game against a computer opponent
                     on the currently selected track.  There is a time
                     limit of 3 minutes and there are no collisions with
                     the computer car.

Two player game:     Begins a two player game (two humans on two
                     computers).  If "make connection" has not been chosen
                     at this point, the machine will automatically try to
                     establish a connection.  The two machines remain
                     "connected" after the game is over.  There is no time
                     limit and it is possible to use "ram-plates" for
                     enhanced violence and destruction.

Two player options:  Moves to the "two player options" menu (see below).

Track:               The currently selected track (1-4) on which either a
                     one or two player game will be played.  Select this
                     option to change to another track.

Exit:                Quits to amigados.


                            Two player options menu:

Speed:               Speed at which data is transferred between the two
                     computers, either 153600 or 200000 baud.  It is
                     generally a good idea to have this set to the same
                     speed on both computers before attempting "make
                     connection".  To change the speed, simply select this
                     option, although there is really no reason why the
                     speed should ever need to be changed from the default
                     200000 baud (see section 9 for more details).

Ram-plates on/off:   Toggles ram-plates on/off.  Only affects two player
                     games.

Make connection:     Attempts to connect two machines linked by a null
                     modem cable.  This option should be chosen on both
                     computers.

Break connection:    Break the connection between the two machines formed
                     by either "make connection" or "two player game" and
                     allows both computers to operate independently again.

Return to main menu: Does what it says.











                         8. Installing NTSC Version of The Game
                            -----------------------------------

As it stands, the game will only run on a PAL machine.  However, the NTSC
(American) version has also been included on the disk.  To get the NTSC
version up and running you simply need to rename the file "s/NTSCstartup"
to "s/startup-sequence".  This can be done simply by putting the game disk
in the internal drive and typing:

df0:rename df0:s/NTSCstartup df0:s/startup-sequence

Before doing this, however, it would be safer to make a copy of the
original disk and then type the above command with the backup disk in the
internal drive.
    The game itself is exactly the same as the PAL version except that the
main display window has been slightly reduced in size.  This just means
that the 3D action is slightly more squashed in the vertical but not
enough to detract from the game (and hardly noticeable, anyway).




                         9. Using The Serial Datalink
                            -------------------------

In order to have a two player game you will need to have two amigas
connected together with a serial null modem cable.  This is a lead which
is simply connected to the serial ports of the two computers to allow them
to transfer data at high speed.  An appropriate cable can be bought from
any good computer store or can be easily made up yourself (see end of this
section).  One note of warning - a "modem" cable is not the same thing as
a "null modem" cable and should never be used for connecting two computers
together.
    To use the datalink, firstly switch off both computers and connect the
null modem lead to the serial port of each computer.  Load the game on
both machines and choose "two player options" and then "make connection"
and if all goes well a message should come up saying "connection
established".
    Two speeds are used for the datalink - 200000 baud (default) and
153600 baud.  These speeds may seem quite high but it makes the game run
that little bit faster and, although you might find it hard to believe,
the amiga is more than capable of transmitting and receiving at these
speeds, even with a null modem cable of 3 or 4 metres in length.  If there
are any transmission errors during a game, the message "checksum error"
will flash on the screen momentarily, although this is very unlikely to
happen unless you have a VERY faulty connection.  It is possible to reduce
the speed from 200000 baud to 153600 baud, but this is unlikely to have
any effect on checksum errors.

If you've got a soldering iron and know how to use it, it is possible
to make up your own null modem cable using two female 25-way D-connectors
and some wire:

   7  ____________________________________________________  7

   2  _______________________  ___________________________  2
                             \/
   3  _______________________/\___________________________  3

Connect pin 7 to pin 7, pin 2 to pin 3 and pin 3 to pin 2.  Double check
the connections before plugging it in as you could seriously damage your
amiga by connecting a 12V signal directly to ground.
N.B. For an A2000 or A3000, male connectors may be necessary - check your
manual to make sure.


                        10. Hints And Tips
                            --------------

1 - In the one player game, you need to learn the course driven by each
computer car.
2 - If the enemy car is travelling fast, it is better to cut him off
rather than trying to follow at a distance - your gun is much less likely
to hit a target which is far away.
3 - Learn to predict the effect skid has on your car so that you can turn
very sharply at corners.
4 - Hitting walls slows you down.  This can sometimes be an advantage and
sometimes a disadvantage.  Head on collisions cost more speed than
glancing collisions.
5 - Use missiles wisely as you only have three of them.
