The story
---------
Imagine a universe of a different dimension - a dimension of height, of
ground, of gravity and time.  Here life is but a bounce away from oblivion
for Blob.

Blob's spaceship has broken down whilst transporting a cargo of baby
Bloblettes.  Parts of the ship have been lost and some of the Blobletts have
wondered off in all the confusion.  

Guide Blob through 50 taxing levels of bouncy, crazy puzzles, find all the
spaceships parts and rescue any Blobletts that have become lost or trapped.

LIVE LIFE ON THE EDGE - EXPERIENCE BLOB!


Controls
--------
Blob is controlled via the joystick.  Moving the joystick up, will move Blob
up.  Moving the joystick left, will move Blob left.  Pressing the fire button
down will enable Blob to go into Bounce mode and he will gradually gain
height.

Here is a brief description of some of the blocks:

Blue Block - Absorbs Blobs bounce and stops him dead.

Flashing Block - A teleporter.

Green Block - Standard block.

Brown Block - Enables Blob to bounce even higher.

Invisible Block - Helps you out in times of strife.

Brown Cracked Block - Will only support Blobs weight for two bounces.

Plus lots of other blocks.  Experiment and see.

Keys
----
Pause Game - Space bar
Escape - Quit current game
M - Toggle music on/off
Left mouse button - Commit suicide


Menu Screen
-----------

The menu screen looks something like this:

		 	   START GAME
			ENTER PASSWORD ____
			SOUND TEST      __

To use the menu, simply move the joystick up and down to the required
selection.  To enter password, simply press fire button and type the
password and then go back to START GAME and it will do just that.  To test
all of the in-game FX, press the fire button to hear the current sound.
Moving the joystick left-right will change the sound effect.
