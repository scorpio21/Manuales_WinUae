HOW TO DRIVE YOUR CAR



o Joystick:

  - forward to accelerate

  - back to brake

  - press SPACEBAR to shift gears down

  - press FIRE BUTTON to shift gears up



o Keyboard

  - up arror to accelerate

  - down arrow to brake

  - SPACEBAR to shift the gears down

  - BUTTON to shift gears up



HOT TIP #1:

NASCAR drivers turn the steering wheel with a short back-and-forth motion

(called "sawing") to steer around banked turns.  Using the keyboard controls

enables you to come closer to this technique than the joystick controls allow.



HOT TIP #2:

When you want to feel even more speed as you fly around the turns, try playing

the game with the "Objects Off" option.  This puts the power of your Amiga

in the race and less in the off-track graphic detail.
