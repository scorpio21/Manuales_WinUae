                                STEER WRESTLING
                                ~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~
                 The idea to chase the steer and when you are
                 close enough jump on it and take hold of it's
                 horns.  Use all your strength and leverage to
                 overbalance it and get it on the floor. Use 
                 the joystick to control your horse's movement.
                 As in calf roping get as close as you can and 
                 then leap and grab hold of it's horns by 
                 pressing the fire button. Overbalance the steer
                 by waggling the joystick left and right until
                 it falls to the ground. Again this event is
                 timed.

                                TRICK SHOOTING
                                ~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~
                 You'll have to be quick on the draw to become 
                 the fastest gun around.  Shoot the targets as
                 they pop up but don't shoot young ladies or
                 inocent people in the back or the Sheriff or
                 you'll lose points and a lot more besides if they
                 send out a posse!  If you you use the mouse reload
                 by pressing the right hand mouse button.  With 
                 the joystick option reloading is automatic.  To go
                 to part 2 press the right mouse button.  Part 2 of
                 Trick Shooting is shooting bottles thrown into
                 the air, show off your marksmanship and shoot
                 the bottles before they hit the ground.

                                BRONCO RIDING
                                ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
                 Pit your stamina and balance against a mean,
                 bucking bronco and hold on until the dust 
                 settles.  To remain seated on the horse push the
                 joystick in the opposite direction of the high-
                 lighted arrows on the direction icon.  Don't allow
                 the arrow to reach the end otherwise you'll be 
                 in for a fail.  Watch your score increase the
                 longer you stay on.

                              STAGECOACH RESCUE
                              ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
                 The scene is set, the indian has ambushed the last
                 Stage and the occupants are in dead trouble.  The
                 joystick controlls the actoion, wiggle the joystick left
                 and right.  To make the horse run towards the stage 
                 move the joystick up and down to avoid the lug-
                 gage.  Once you are alongside the coach press the 
                 fire button to climb aboard.  Fight the indian by
                 pushing diagonally up to punch towards the head
                 and diagonally down to punch towards the stom-
                 ach.  Pushing left and right moves you towards and
                 away from the indian.  Pushing left and pressing the
                 fire button blocks the indian's punches.  You'r mis-
                 sion is timed, therefore speed is of the essence.

                                 CALF ROPING
                                 ~~~~ ~~~~~~
                 The crowd is cheering, the sun is shining, the
                 atmosphere is electric.  The gate is opened and
                 the calf is away.  Follow the calf using your skill
                 and judgement., slip the lasso over the calf's
                 head and bring it to a halt in the quickest time.
                 Use the joystick to move you forwards, back-
                 wards, up and down.  When you are close 
                 enough to the calf press fire to throw the lasso
                 and pull back on the joystick to halt it.
