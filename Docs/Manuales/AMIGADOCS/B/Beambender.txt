 Every time you need to think of a solution to the level, use the Pause
 function. (Playtime should only be used to set the components.)


THE GAME ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 With the aid of various components (mirrors and colour converters) the goal
 of this game is to hit all Exits (=target of a laserbeam) with one (!)
 laserbeam of mathing colour. Therefore every Cannon (=source of a laserbeam)
 does not have to be used (to operate see Final Test Mode). With the cursor,
 components from the manufacturer , are »beamed« onto the gamefield.
 An empty cursor appears round on the gamefield, square in the manufacurer
 area. An arrow appears on the top of the cursor when a component is selected.

·MANIPULATION MODE (=Play Mode - Cannons and Exits are locked)
 in this mode all components can be set and Wobbly Dots appear.

·TEST MODE (Cannons and Exits are activated)
 Double click on selected Cannon. The Canon shoots three times in sequence to
 check beam path and possible errors. After the third lasershot construction
 errors have an effect on the score. During the first two shots errors are
 indicated  by an »Overload« (flash over Cannon and Exit).

·FINAL TEST MODE (Cannons and Exits are activated)
 Double click on any Exit - each Cannon shoots only once in sequence. Every
 consruction error has an immediate effect on the score. During the Final Test
 each Exit must be hit once by a laserbeam of corresponding colour, without
 destroying any Cannon or Exit. Only when the Final Test Mode is correctly
 completed , will the level be resolved.

 TEST MODE AND FINAL TEST MODE CAN BE ENDED WITH A SINGLE CLICK ON ANY CANNON
 OR EXIT = BACK TO MANIPULATION MODE.

 The total points for a resolved level are calculated from the corresponding
 level value plus time bonus, minus number of used mirrors.

 SENSOR
 Allows laserbeam of its colour to pass, other colours are absorbed.

 BASE
 Baseplate - only these will hold any components.

 KEEP OFF!

 EYE
 Every laserbeam that hits will be absorbed.

 GRIM REAPER
 If hit by a laserbeam, the level will be restart and the player looses 1 try.

 BLOCK
 Sits on a baseplate and stops every laserbeam, but can be blasted with a mine.


COMPONENTS -------------------------------------------------------------------


 These are made in the Manufacturer. Once set on the gamefield the position
 of components can not be changed. They can only be blasted with mines.
 Mirrors may be present. The components used by the laserbeam in the Final
 Test are minus points.

MANUFACTURER -----------------------------------------------------------------

 1 PAUSE           Interrupts game, so you have time to think about solutions,
                   another single click on Pauseplate resumes game.
                 
 2 SAFE-FIELD      A component can be kept during the present level.
                 
 3 MANUFACTURER    Makes components.

 4 TRASHCAN        Unwanted components from the Manufacturer (and from
                   Safe-Field) can be dumped. The Manufacturer is forced to
                   make new parts.

 5 RESTART         A double click restets the level back to the start position
                   and one try is lost.
