 By now you will already met our friend Pob and seen his relatively good day
 turned into a very bad one indeed.  Not only has he been turned into a 
 bouncing head but is also transported into an incredfble world where 
 insanity and gravity seem to have taken a back seat.  Looks like you've done
 it this time.  Pob!

 It seems Pob's only chance of escape is to play the wizards crazy game.  
 Unfortunately, he has made Pob's task extremely difficult by interfering with
 the gravity pull in this strange maze like world.

 Playing the part of Pob.  It is your task to roll and bounce around each 
 level, of which there are 100, collecting the precious coins that will allow
 you the chance to escape.  This is made more difficult by the constantly 
 changing gravity and the nasties that inhabit this world.

 PLAYING THE GAME

 Before entering the level you will be presented with a map showing the maze,
 the locations and the position of all the coins.  Press fire to play the  
 level.

 At the bottom of the screen is the status panel which shows information about
 your progress.  The displays indicate your score, time remaining(indicated by
 Pob's head which turns from pink to green as time elapses), gravity direction,
 the amount of coins remaining in-the-level and the amount of coins collected
 indicated by a money bag which grows in size accordingly.  Once all the coins
 have been collected you must guide Pob over to the exit which turns into a
 solid circle.  If the timer reaches zero before Pob has collected all the 
 coins his head at the bottom will throw up and Pob will die.

 The wizard has filled each level with plenty of obstacles and nasties which
 will hinder your progress.  These include gravity swappers, fans, springs, 
 breakable wall blocks and other fiendish objects.  Nasties include killer
 balls, plungers and spinnythings which will kill Pob if he touches them!  Some
 of the objects, such as the rotating spikes will also reduce Pob's coin.  If
 Pob's coins reach zero, Pob will, snivel, die.

 Fortunately, the wizard has also complemented each level with bonus icons 
 which you can collect by rolling Pob over them.  These will enhance or 
 hinder Pobs movements in several different ways and are explained further
 on, along with the nasties and objects.

 CONTROLLING POB

 Control of Pob is through the joystick.  Left/Right rotate the play area
 accordingly allowing Pob to roll and fire bounces Pob giving him the 
 ability to negotiate direction and pulling down with left/right rotates the 
 play field at break neck speed.  Pressing the P key pauses the game at any
 time.


 Joystick Direction	|Effect
 -----------------------+--------------
 Fire			|Bounce
 Diagonal up/right      |Roll fast right  
 Right			|Roll right
 Diagonal down/right    |Roll very fast right
 Diagonal down/left     |Roll very fast left
 Left			|Roll left
 Diagonal up/left       |Roll fast left

 P - Pause the game

 The first 25 levels of the game are trainer levels which will allow you to 
 become accustomed to controlling Pob and the effects of the various 
 collectable icons.  The nasties will appear later on.  As you progress, the
 levels will become increasingly harder and you will eventually be joined by
 Pob's body - The body ball which you will also have to guide through the 
 exit along with pob.

 I cant put the icons in so i'll just tell you what they do, you can guess
 what the icon looks like.

 TOGGLES PIPS 1 & 2 ON/OFF - ALLOWS POB TO CONTINUE AT THAT LEVEL IF HE DIES

 
 OBJECTS

 I cant put the objects in so i'll just tell you what they do, you can guess
 what the icon looks like.  

 PIPS - There are two identical sets of pips which are toggled by an OFF/On
 switch.  The pips allow access to the level if Pob dies.

 BREAKABLE WALL BLOCK - Pob can destroy these by bouncing into them at great 
 speed or rolling over them when the heavy ball icon has been picked up.

 FANS - These blow Pob in the appropiate direction.

 CLOSED EXIT - You need more coins, Pob!

 OPEN EXIT - Well done, Pob!

 PINBALL BUMBER - These will bounce Pob all over the place.

 COIN - The key to escape.

 SPRINGS - These will spring Pob in the appropriate direction.

 ROTATING SPIKES - Do not touch them Pob.

 TELEPORT - Transport Pob and the body ball from one area of the level to 
 another.  Beware, the killer ball can also use them.  Teleports will not work
 if there is an object covering the other end.

 NASTIES

 Each contact with a nasty willcause Pob to lose coins.
 
 KILLER BALL - Pob's arch enemy.
 ABACUS - These slide either horizontally or vertically and are deadly.
 SPINNYTHING - Flip Flops around the platforms.
 PLUNGER - Jumps along horizontal platforms.
