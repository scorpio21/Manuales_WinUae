                        RAM. Special graphics will be loaded if it runs on 
                        an AGA-machine  (A1200 or A4000)

2) Start: Reboot your Amiga and insert disk A into your first drive. Blitz 
          Tennis can be installed to your hard drive by loading the 
          Workbench and double clicking the icon of the HD Installer on the

                             c) Demo


All menus are controlled by the Joystick by moving the bar and pressing
the firebutton on your chosen entry. You can quit all menus (and the game
during the match) with the "e" key.

(see below)

You can start with little tournaments, improve your abilities and climb the
world rankings. You will first have to enter your a name, then you will get

                           b) Number of players (single/double)
                            c) Play best of x sets
                             d) Ready to serve ?

Surface: One of four different courts can be selected (sand, grass and two
synthetic materials). They are all different in speed of ball bouncing and
therefore require different techniques (eg. sand: baseline playing, grass:
serve and volley).

Number of Players: One joystick represents a game against a computer
opponent. Two joysticks show a game between two human players (exchange
your mose with a second joystick). AGA-Amigas allow you to play with four
players, you require a standard four player adapter for the parallel port.

Best of x sets: Sets the number of sets you need to win.

Select Player: The two names show the actually selected players. The
numbers to the left of their names show their ranking. The upper level is
always taken over by a human player. By moving the joystick left/right
while pressing fire you can change the player.
The selection of the players represents thier appearance and their
qualities. In the beginning it is easier to select a good player for you
and select a worse player for the computer opponent.

Ready ? You start the game with the selections made above.

        pressing F1-F9 you can distribute these points on the several
        qualities. At the beginning we advise you to invest points in running,
        forhand and backhand.

The several qualities effect as shown -

Fitness: Obvious
service: how hard your service is
forehand: power and precision of youur forehand (including volley),
          backhand analog
smash: Power of the smash, e.g important when playing serve and volley lob:
precision and reliability of lobs
stop: precision.

7) Control:
All shots and movements are done by Joystick. "P" activates Pause mode.
Replay during or after a rally by pressing <G> during the replay alters the
speed of the replay. Pressing <SPACE> again stops replay. During single
matches <ESC> quits to main menu.

Service:
With a short press on the firebutton you throw the ball, the service is
continued automatically. The direction can be changed with the joystick. It
requires some practice, but makes it harder (for human opponents) to return
your service. During the rally, you hit the ball with the firebutton, the
computer automatically selects (depending on your position to the ball)
which kind of stroke to take. By moving the joystick left/right in the same
movement, you can change the direction of your shot.
If you stand a bit too far away from the ball, your player jumps towards
it. Looks spectacularly, but doesn't give good control.
If you move the joystick up/down during the shot, your player make a
lob/stop: A move in dorection of the shot results in a stop, against the
direction a lob.
