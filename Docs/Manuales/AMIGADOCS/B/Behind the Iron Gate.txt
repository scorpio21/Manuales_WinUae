  U.I.S facillity 6 was the worlds biggest and best robot detention centre.
It was here that most of Europe's rouge machinery was kept under lock and key
until such time as it could be examined. 
It had been set up after the famous Armatage case. Armatage had lost his job
to a robot. In a twisted attempt at revenge had programmed a droid known as
GIS 16 to systematically slaughter the board of directors, who Armatage felt
were responsible for his dismissal. As planned the robot was impounded but 
before it was destroyed a young tech had decided to open up GIS 16 to `look
into the mind of a killer'. When he discovered that the machine had been 
tampered with, he called the police. The trail eventually lead back to
Armatage who was tried and imprisoned for the murders. Not long after this
historic case laws concerning the analysis of machines involved in crime
were passed. U.I.S 6 was built for the containment of criminal machinery.
It ran for over fourteen years without trouble. One day all that changed.
 
It must have been the quitest breakout in history. The warders hadn't been
aware of it until it was to late. They hadn't noticed that one by one the 
holding pen doors were gliding up, and why should they ? The computer gave
no sign of the impromptu liberation and it was five minutes until a door
opened within ear shot of a guard patrol. Even when they heard the soft hiss
of the bars slipping into their sockets the guard's didn`t sound the alarm.
They didn't even take the saftey of their guns. Instead they just wandered
round the corner unafraid and unprepared. 
 
Within one hour the entire complex was over run. The installation manager had
stood in ythe control room barking out orders. Analysists and technicians had
desperatly fought to regain control of their computers. They had one in the 
end when one of the analysists had found the glitch. Within minutes the
installation had been locked down. Atleast the robots weren't going to spill
out the prison. Although his major fear had been alleyed the manager could
not see any bright side of the situation. Instead of beeing the man in charge
of the largest robot detention centre in the world he was the man who media
would hold responsible for the worlds worst robot rebellion. Of the two
hudered staff in the building only 3 had got out alive. The manager jumped
as the door behind him was opened. He took a deep breath and turned, half
expecting to blinded by flashing cameras. It wasn`t a journalist that stood
in the door though, it was a stocky man wearing a nondescript grey uniform.
 
 "Hello Mr. Knight. We've come to help you get your prison back. "
 
  The manager looked nervously at the grey clad man.
 
 "Yes sir, we belive that the machines have armed themselves. Yes Sir, very
  good sir, on my way". The man clicked the cell phone closed and slipped it
  into his breast pocket.
 
 "Well ?"
 
 "We've sent a man through the vents system, that way we can avoid messing
  with the doors"
 
 "The vents" the manager said in a surprised tone. "You can only just squeeze
  through the biggest ones, how do you intend to get any weapon in ?"
 
 "We don`t" said the soldier. "Don't worry he is a good man, very resourceful"
  he said as he walked towards the door. "I'm expected at the scene. coming ?"
  
  A chopper had dropped the grey clad figure on the roof of tehbuilding. It
had taken him about ten minutes to absail down to the recess in which he was
now crouched. The ledge was barely big enough to stand on and the man had to
rely on his line to stop him from tumbling down to the streets below. In
front of him a heavy metal grill blocked his way. He moulded thelast of his
putty charges over a bolt head and pressed a small black reciever into the
yellow blob. From his pocket he pulled out a little box. He pressed a button
on the side of the box causing it a yellow LED to light. Another press
started the light pulsing, slowly at first, and then with a greater
frequency. He bent his knees, ready to push himself away from the grill. The
yellow light stopped pulsing and a red light appeard by its side. The black
box emitted an urgent sounding peeping tone and smoke filled the recess. He
swung back towards the recess, landing gracefully. The grill away in one tug.
He discarded it, sending it spinning silently to the floor many storeys below.

  Manouvering himself into the small tube that the grill had been blocking
was harder than he had imagined. With so little to stand on, getting in to
the tunnel head forst proved difficult. After a couple of attempts he was in
and able to release his line. He began to work himself down the tunnel, 
using his elbows and knees to move along in the tight duct. The pencil thick
torch he carried gave enough light for him to see if he was about to fall
down a shaft, but little more. `Atleast there's air' he thought, trying to
find something cheerful to think about. He hadn't been feeling particulary
good since he was told was his days work entalied. He hadn't expressed his
discontent to the commanding officer, that wasn't his place, after all it 
was his job, but that didn`t mean he had to like it. When they had given
him his orders he had remained calm and composed, but he knew his CO had seen
his eyes widen in a second of disbelief. Why had they chosen him ? The
commander had waffled on about he was the only man for the job but that
wasn't strictly true. He could think of ten other guys that were as good as
him and two of them would probably been happy to do the job. He sighed, 
realising that there were no point wishing he wasn`t there. He was and he
had a job to do so he might as well do it to the best of his abillity. If
he didn't he'd end up as mince meat as those poor fools that had been
guarding the place when it was over run.
 
  Descending the ladder had, at first, made a nice change from crawling
along tunnels. After a while it hadn't seemed so great. That shaft seemed 
to go on forever and it had been with an audible sigh of relief as he had
entered duct A27.4, his goal and the beginning of the mission proper. A 
sort of crawl and he was looking into the tunnel he was about to enter.
`At least they`re low security inmates on this floor' he thought. He started
to inhale deeply and then in short pants, psyching himself up. Gently he
lifted the mesh out of its housing and poked his head through the hole. The
corridor seemed to be empty but in the distance he could hear the hum of
robot motors. He went through his mental checklist one last time. Keys,
weapons, exit alive, not in bag. He lowered himself into the corridor without
making a noise.
 
  It was time to go to work....

                     that you must find and activate before you can leave.

            of the equipment list to highlight the item you want to buy and
            click on an empty box in your pocket. 
 
 COMPLETING THE GAME - Your commander has decided that the best way to 
                       neutralize any threats to the installation is to 
                       destroy it. The building contains a self destruct
                       module. Your ultimate aim is to find it and activate
