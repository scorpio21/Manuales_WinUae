INTRODUCTION
------------
BATTLE ISLE IS A STRATEGY GAME NOT UNLIKE CHESS,THE RULES OF BATTLE ISLE ARE
FLEXIBLE,WHICH HELP THE BEGINNING STRATEGIST,WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE 
COMPLEXITY AND DIFFICULTY OF THE GAME.
AS IN CHESS YOU MUST MOVE A VARIETY OF PIECES(UNITS) WITH YOUR OBJECTIVE:TO
DESTROY YOUR OPPONENT.

TO DO SO YOU CAN EITHER INVADE THE ENEMY`S HEADQUARTERS OR DESTROY ALL THE
ENEMY`S UNITS. YOU MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH
UNIT AS WELL AS THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE PLAYING FEILD.

BATTLE ISLE IS A REALISTIC REPRESNTATION OF MODERN WARFARE WAR. ALL THE 
ELEMENTS OF A MODERN WAR,FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF DEPOTS TO THE REPAIR AND
PRODUCTION OF NEW UNITS,AND AS WELL AS THE SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS,PLAY 
IMPORTANT ROLESIN BATTLE ISLE.
YOU CAN PLAY AGAINST A HUMAN OR COMPUTER OPPONENT. THERE ARE 32 UNIQUE MAPS TO
CONQUER.ADD ON SCENARIO DISKS CONTAINING NEW MAPS AND ADDITIONAL UNITS ARE
ALREADY UNDER DEVOLPMENT AND WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON.

OVERVIEW
--------
BATTLE ISLE CAN BE PLAYED BY 1 OR 2 PLAYERS,EACH PLAYER CAN TAKE AN ACTIVE

ALSO BLACK ON THE MAP. THE HQ`S ARE REPRESENTED BY A SMALL WHITE H.
TO MOVE TO A NEW LOCATION,MOVE THE SQUARE CURSOR TO THE DESIRED AREA AND PRESS
THE FIRE BUTTON.
NOTE: WHEN YOU SEE A MAP FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU SHOULD STUDY THE SITUATION
CAREFULLY USING THE GLOBAL VIEW. LOOK INTO ALL BUILDINGS AND TRANSPORT UNITS
BEFORE MAKING A DECISION. ONLY A LARGE SCALE STRATEGY WILL LEAD YOU TO VICTORY

[HEXAGON ICON WITH AN `I`] -INVENTORY CURSOR-
THE `I` DISPLAYS THE INVENTORY OF A BUILDING OR UNIT.THIS FUNCTION CAN ONLY BE
USED WHEN THE CURSOR IS POSITIONED OVER A BUILDING OR TRANSPORT UNIT. USE THIS

YOU ARE IN ACTION. IT SHOWS THAT YOU WANT TO LEAVE THE UNIT WHICH IS LOCATED
UNDER YOUR CURSOR.

[HEXAGON ICON WITH HAMMER] -CREATE A NEW UNIT CURSOR-
THE HAMMER IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY WHEN YOU ARE INSIDE THE BUILDING. BY VALIDATING
THE OPTION YOU CAN CREATE NEW UNITS.

MOVING UNITS [CROSSED ARROWS]
TO MOVE A UNIT,POSITION THE CURSOR OVER ONE OF YOUR UNITS. PRESS THE JOYSTICK
FIRE BUTTON AND MOVE THE JOYSTICK AWAY FROM YOU (UP) THE MOVE SYMBOL WILL THEN
APPEAR. WHEN YOU RELEASE THE FIRE BUTTON THE RANGE OF THE UNIT AND POSSIBLE
DESTINATIONS WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED.
POSITION THE CURSOR ON THE DESIRED DESTINATION AND PRESS FIRE BUTTON AGAIN.
THE ROUTE YOUR UNIT WILL TAKE THEN APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. PRESS THE FIRE 
BUTTON A SECOND TIME TO MOVE THE UNIT TO A DESIRED DESTINATION. MAKE SURE THE 
CURSOR IS POSITIONED ON THE DESTINATION SQUARE WHEN YOU PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON 
A SECOND TIME!.

THE RANGE OF THE UNIT WILL APPEAR AGIN ON THE SCREEN AND YOU WILL HAVE TO
CHOOSE AGAIN A DESTINATION. AS SOON AS YOU HAVE MOVED YOUR UNIT, THE COMPUTER
CLOCKS THE MOVING FUNCTION(BLACK STRIPES ON THE UNIT TELL YOU THAT ITS
CLOCKED)

YOU CAN ALSO GET UNITS OUT OF BUILDINGS OR TRANSPORTERS. VERIFY FIRST THE
CONTENT OF THE BUILDING OR TRANSPORTER USING THE -INVENTORY- COMMAND. TO
LEAVE JUST MOVE THE UNIT. THE RANGE OF UNITS MOVING OUT OF BUILDINGS IS
LIMITED. AS CONVEYING THE TROOPS TO THE BATTLE FIELD TAKES TIME. AFTER MOVING
A UNIT OUT, YOU WILL REMAIN IN INVENTORY MODE. TO LEAVE THE BUILDING,USE THE
EXIT COMMAND [HEXAGON-X].

BUILDINGS LIKE TRANSPORT UNITS,ARE REPRESENTED ON THE MAP BY TARGET SQUARES
WHEN YOU ARE WITHIN RANGE.CHOOSE A BUILDING AS YOUR DESTINATION AND YOUR UNIT
WILL GO INTO THE BUILDING AND TRANSPORT UNIT.
KEEP IN MIND THAT YOUR ACTIONS ARE PLANNED:YOUR MOVEMENTS WILL NOT BE EXECUTED
AND YOUR UNITS WILL NOT ARRIVE AT THEIR DESTINATION UNTIL THE CHANGE IN 
`PHASE`.IN FACT,YOUR UNIT MAY NEVER ARRIVE IF YOUR OPPONENT DESTROYS IT BEFORE
THE NEXT TUN.

HINT: SHORT RANGE (ESPECIALLY INFANTRY)UNITS SHOULD BE MOVED WITH TRANSPORT
UNITS. MOVE THE UNIT INTO A TRANSPORT WHICH HAS NOT MOVED IN THAT TURN,AND 
THEN MOVE THE TRANSPORT UNIT.MOVING UNITS INTO A TRANSPORT UNIT WHICH HAS
ALREADY MOVED IN THAT TURN IS NOT POSSIBLE.


ACTION
------
POSITION THE CURSOR ON ONE OF YOUR UNITS AND PRESS THE JOYSTICK FIREBUTTON. 
AS SOON AS THE EXIT SYMBOL APPEARS ON THE CURSOR,MOVE THE JOYSTICK AWAY FROM
YOU(UP): THE EXIT SYMBOL IS REPLACED BY AN EXCLAMTION MARK. RELEASE THE FIRE
BUTTON TO SEE THE TARGETS IN YOUR RANGE.
POSSIBLE ATTACK TARGETS IN YOUR RANGE. POSSIBLE ATTACK TARGETS WILL BE
HIGHLIGHTED. CHOOSE THE DESIRED TARGET BY PLACING THE CURSOR OVER THE TARGET
AND PRESSING FIRE BUTTON. WHEN THE UNIT RECORDS THE TARGET IT IS NOT POSSIBLE
TO USE THIS UNIT AGAIN ONCE THE TARGET IS VALIDED.

CERTAIN UNITS CAN NOT BE USED FOR ATTACK. A TRANSPORT PLANE,FOR EXAMPLE,CAN
REPLY TO AN ATTACK,BUT CANNOT BE USED AS AN ATTACK UNIT.YOU USUALLY NEED
TO ATTACK AN OPPONENT UNIT SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE DESTROYING IT. THIS CAN BE 
DONE IN ONE TURN,USING SEVERAL UNITS,OR IN SEVERAL TURNS.

THE DEPOT BUILDER IS A SPECIAL UNIT. INSTEAD OF ATTACKING ENEMY UNITS,IT 
BUILDS DEPOTS. THIS IS DONE THE SAME WAY YOU ATTACK A UNIT. POTENTIAL BUILDING
SITES (INSTEAD OF TARGETS) ARE HIGHLIGHTED.

A DEPOT BUILDER CAN ONLY BUILD HALF A DEPOT AT A TIME. EITHER THE DEPOT IS
BUILT IN TWO TURNS OR TWO BUILDERS SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. IT IS OFTEN NECESSARY
TO ATTACK THE ENEMY UNIT SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE DESTROYING IT. IT IS OFTEN
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE UNITS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BE USED TO ATTACK AN ENEMY
UNIT.

IF YOU PLACE THE CURSOR ON ONE OF YOUR UNITS WHICH IS ALREADY ENGAGED IN 
BATTLE,THE TARGET RECORDED BY THIS UNIT WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN SURROUNDED
BY A HEXAGON.

REPAIRING UNITS
---------------
REPAIRING UNITS(SPANNER). THE SPANNER IS ACCESSIBLE IN THE ACTION PHASE.USE
IT TO REPAIR DAMAGED UNITS IN ANY BUILDING.
POSITION THE CURSOR OVER THE BUILDING CONTAINING DAMAGED UNITS AND PRESS THE
FIRE BUTTON. MOVE THE JOYSTICK LEFT TO THE INVENTORY SYMBOL.
POSITION THE CURSOR ON THE UNIT TO BE REPAIRED,MOVE THE JOYSTICK DOWN(TOWARDS
YOU) AND PRESS FIRE BUTTON. THE UNIT WILL APPEAR WITH BLACK STRIPES. THE UNIT
CANNOT BE USED WHILST UNDER REPAIR.
REPAIRING DAMAGED UNITS USES 3 UNITS OF ENERGY,REGARDLESS OF HOW SERIOUS THE
DAMAGE MAY BE,WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DEPOT BUILDERS, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE
ENOUGH ENERGY IN THE BUILDING AN ERROR WILL APPEAR.
REPAIRING UNITS IS AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC POINT.IT IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL TO
REPAIR VERY STRONG UNITS. SO THAT ENEMY CAN INCREASE ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN
BATTLE BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF BATTLE EXPERIENCE GAINED.

PRODUCING UNITS
---------------
PRODUCING UNITS [HEXAGON-HAMMER]. THE HAMMER IS ALSO USED INSIDE BUILDINGS
DURING THE ACTION PHASE.USE THIS FUNCTION TO PRODUCE NEW UNITS IN THE 
FACTORIES.

AS WHEN REPAIRING UNITS,YOU MUST FIRST INVENTORY THE FACTORY. THEN POSITION
THE CURSOR ON AN EMPTY SQUARE RESERVED FOR A UNIT. PRESS FIRE BUTTON AND MOVE
THE JOYSTICK LEFT. THE HAMMER(PRODUCTION) SYMBOL WILL APPEAR.

RELEASE THE FIRE BUTTON, TO SEE WHICH UNITS CAN BE PRODUCED WITH THE ENERGY
AVAILABLE, ON SOME LEVELS, CERTAIN UNITS CAN NOT BE PRODUCED EVEN IF
SUFFICIENT ENERGY IS AVAILABLE.

CHOOSE THE UNIT TO BE PRODUCED WITH THE CURSOR,PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON, THEN 
MOVE THE JOYSTICK LEFT WHILE KEEPING THE FIRE BUTTON PRESSED.
THE CHOSEN UNIT WILL APPEAR COVERED WITH BLACK STRIPES. THE UNIT CAN BE MOVED
OUT OF THE FACTORY IN THE NEXT MOVEMENT PHASE.

CHANGING PHASE
--------------
AFTER HAVING MADE YOUR TACTICAL SELECTION YOU MUST MOVE ON TO ANOTHER PHASE OF
THE GAME.PLACE YOUR CURSOR ON AN AREA NOT OCCUPIED BY A BUILDING OR 
TRANSPORTER. WHEN YOU PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON WHILE MOVING THE JOYSTICK TO THE
LEFT,YOU WILL SEE A <--> SYMBOL APPEAR. THE SYMBOL MEANS THAT YOU MUST CHANGE
PHASES. RELEASE THE JOYSTICK BUTTON TO VALID YOUR CHOICE. IF YOU REALISE YOU
HAVE FORGOTTEN TO PROGRAM SOME TACTICAL CHOICES,PRESS THE JOYSTICK BUTTON TO
CANCEL THE CHANGING PHASE.
THE COMPUTER WILL ONLY ACCEPT THE CHANGING PHASE WHEN THE SECOND PLAYER HAS
ALSO ASKED THE FINAL COMFIRMATION WHICH IS VALIDED BY PRESSING THE SPACE BAR.

LOADING AND SAVING GAMES
------------------------
SINCE MOST OF THE MAPS IN BATTLE ISLE TAKE SEVERAL HOURS TO COMPLETE,WE HAVE
PROVIDED A LOADING/SAVING FUNCTION.

LOADING
-------
TO LOAD A GAME GO TO THE MAIN MENU, THEN TO DISK MENU AND CHOOSE THE `LOAD`
OPTION.THEN, YOU WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE A SAVED GAME BETWEEN 0-9. FOR THIS,
PRESS THE CORRESPONDING KEY. THE PROGRAM WILL ASK YOU TO INSERT YOUR SAVE GAME
DISK, INSERT THE DISK,IN THE INTERNAL DRIVE,THEN PRESS ANY KEY. AFTER A FEW
SECONDS,YOUR SAVED GAME WILL BE  LOADED.

SAVING
------
TO SAVE THE CURRENT GAME,BOTH PLAYERS HAVE TO CHANGE MODES. DO NOT PRESS THE
SPACE BAR,PRESS `D`(DISK) KEY.
THE PROMPT WILL THEN ASK YOU TO TYPE IN A FIGURE FROM 0 - 9. YOU MAY HAVE TO
INSERT A NEW DISK. THE PROGRAM WILL REGONISE THE CORRECT DISK AUTOMATICALLY.
IF YOU HAVE INSTALLED BATTLE ISLE ON A HARD DISK,YOU WILL NOT BE ASKED TO
INSERT A DISK WHEN LOADING OR SAVING. BUT IF YOU ARE USING AN AMIGA,YOU WILL
ALWAYS HAVE TO INSERT THE CORRECT DISK. IF YOU HAVE LOADED THE GAME ON A
COMPUTER WITH MORE THAN 512KBYTES RAM, YOUR SAVE GAME DISK MUST BE FORMATTED
WITH AMIGA-DOS AND NAMED BI4. IF YOUR COMPUTER HAS ONLY 512 KBYTES,USE A 
NEWLY UNFORMATTED DISK TO SAVE YOUR GAME. BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE CORRECT
PROCEDURE,OTHERWISE YOU WILL SAVE YOUR GAMES ON THE BATTLE ISLE DISK.

THE BUILDINGS
-------------
THERE ARE 3 MAIN TYPES OF BUILDINGS,HEADQUARTERS,FACTORIES AND DEPOTS. ALL OF
WHICH SERVE A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS. ALL BUILDINGS SHOULD BE SUPPLIED WITH
ENERGY TO REPAIR.PRODUCE UNITS. THE ENERGY UNITS REPRESENT ALL RAW MATERIALS.

THEY CONSIST OF STRATEGIC TARGETS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE AND YOU SHOULD TRY
TO TAKE THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

EVEN IF A BUILDING IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF YOUR ENEMY YOU SHOULD TRY TO TAKE
CONTROL OF IT. ONLY THE SOLDIERS ARE ABLE TO OCCUPY BUILDINGS,THUS, YOU SHOULD
PROTECT YOUR INFANTRY AS NECESSARY BECAUSE WITHOUT INFANTRY YOU CANNOT OCCUPY
ENEMY BUILDINGS OR DEFEAT THE ENEMY BY TAKING ITS HQ`S.

IF YOU WANT TO ATTEMPT TO ATTACK A DEPOT OR AN ENEMY UNIT, YOU MUST PREPARE
YOUR ATTACK CAREFULLY. IN MOST CASES THE ENEMY HAS ADVANTAGE IN THAT IT CAN
REPAIR ITS UNITS IMMEDIATELY. A SUPERIOR NUMBER OF FORCES DURING ATTACK WILL
USUALLY LEAD TO SUCCESS.
HOWEVER THE EXPERIENCE OF YOUR TROOPS ARE OFTEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A LARGE
NUMBER OF ROOKIES, THE LOCATION OF A STRUCTURE IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE 
A DEPOT OR A FACTORY NOT ACCESSIBLE FROM ANY SIDES IS OFTEN INEVITABLE IF
YOUR ENEMY IS TENACIOUS.

THE HEADQUARTERS [SHOWN AS A WHITE - H -]
----------------
THE HEADQUARTES REPRESENT THE PRIMARY ENEMY TARGET. EACH HEADQUARTERS IS
INDICATED BY A LUMINOUS COLOURED DOME(RED OR YELLOW--BLUE OR GREEN). OCCUPY
THIS HEXAGON WITH AN INFANTRY DETACHMENT TO CAPTURE THE HEADQUARTERS AND WIN
THE GAME.
ON LARGER MAPS,LEAVE AT LEAST 2 UNITS NEAR YOUR HQ`S TO KEEP YOUR OPPONENT 
FROM BRINGING HIS TROOPS IN WITH FAST TRASPORTERS AND CAPTURING YOUR HQ`S.

SENDING TROOPS TOWARDS THE OPPONENTS HQ`S MAY MAKE THE OPPONENT REMOVE UNITS
FROM THE BATTLEFIELD. YOU MAY SACRIFICE A FEW UNITS, BUT THIS MANOEUVRE WILL
EASE YOUR TASK ON OTHER FRONTS.

THE FACTORIES [ - F - ]
-------------
THE FACTORIES,LIKE THE HQ`S,ARE ALREADY ON THE MAP. 2 LUMINOUS DOMES INDICATE
THE FACTORY LOYALTY. LIKE THE HQ`S, THE FACTORY IS CAPTURED BY THE INFANTRY
ENTERING THE ENTRANCE HEXAGON.
ALL UNITS IN A FACTORY OR A DEPOT AT THE TIME OF CAPTURE FALL INTO THE HANDS 
OF THE VICTOR. IF BOTH DOMES ARE GREY, YOU CAN CAPTURE THE FACTORY BY INFANTRY
LANDING ON THE TOP HEXAGON.
WHEN YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF INVADING SEVERAL FACTORIES CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING
FACTORS BEFORE MAKING YOUR DECISION.

* CHOOSE THE FACTORY OBTAINABLE WITH THE LEAST LOSS

* VERIFY THE UNITS STORED. DONT BE TEMPTED BY THE NUMBER OF UNITS AVAILABLE
  INSTEAD,LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF THE UNITS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF YOUR GLOBAL
  STRATEGY AND THE STRENGTH OF YOUR OPPONENTS UNITS,FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS NOT
  VERY WISE TO TAKE A FACTORY CONTAINING 3 ANTI-AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS IF THE
  OPOONENT HAS NO PLANES OR HELICOPTERS.

THE DEPOTS [ - D - ]
----------
DEPOTS EXIST ON ALL MAPS, BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE BUILT USING SPECIAL UNITS. IN
ORDER TO BUILD A DEPOT, THE GROUND MUST BE CLEAR: A DEPOT REQUIRES 4 HEXAGONS
AND LEVEL GROUNDS. DEPOT BUILDING SITES ON MAPS WITH UNEVEN GROUND ARE VERY
RARE.

START THE ACTION FOR THE DEPOT BUILDER THE SAME WAY YOU START THE ATTACK
ACTION AND POSSIBLE DEPOT BUILDING SITES WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED. S DEPOT
CONSTRUCTION UNITS BUILDS ONE HALF OF THE DEPOT AT A TIME. YOU CAN EITHER USE
2 UNITS WORKING TOGETHER OR BUILD A DEPOT IN 2 TURNS.AFTER BUILDING A DEPOT, 
THE CONSTRUCTION DOES NOT HAVE ANY RAW MATERIAL TO BUILD ANY ADDITIONAL 
DEPOTS YOU CAN REMEDY THIS BY SENDING THE UNIT TO BE REPAIRED IN A FACTORY OR 
IN YOUR HQ`S.

A DEPOT YOU HAVE BUILT IS YOURS IMMEDIATELY, AND DOES NOT NEED TO BE CAPTURED
BY YOUR TROOPS. DEPOTS ARE SUPPLIED WITH ENERGY DURING CONSTRUCTION AND CAN
REPAIR UNITS.YOU CANNOT,HOWEVER,PRODUCE NEW UNITS IN DEPOTS. ASIDE FROM THESE
DIFFERENCES,DEPOTS AND FACTORIES ARE GOVERNED BY THE SAME RULES.

ON SOME MAPS THERE WILL BE EXISTING DEPOTS THAT YOU HAVE TO CAPTURE. YOU CAN
ALSO TAKE POSSESSION OF ENEMY DEPOTS BY CAPTURING THEM WITH YOUR INFANTRY.

ON LARGE MAPS, DEPOTS REPRESENTS IMPORTANT STRATEGIC BASES WHICH SHORTEN
SUPPLY TIME WHEN SET NEAR TROOPS IN COMBAT.

SUPPLYING DEPOTS WITH ENERGY IS NOT ESSENTIAL. IT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO
SUPPLY FACTORIES WITH THE CRYSTAL ENERGY SOURCE.

SUPPLYING BUILDINGS WITH ENERGY
-------------------------------
REPAIRING AND PRODUCING UNITS USES ENERGY. THIS ENERGY REPRESENTS ALL THE RAW
MATERIALS NECESSARY TO BUILD OR REPAIR UNITS. MOST BUILDINGS WILL BE SUPPLIED
WITH ENERGY AT THE START OF EACH GAME. THIS ENERGY WILL BE USED DURING THE 
GAME TO REPAIR AND REPLACE UNITS.

ENERGY CRYSTALS ARE PRESENT ON ANY MAPS. COLLECT THESE ENERGY CRYSTALS AND
SUPPLY YOUR FACTORIES WITH THEM TO DO SO, MOVE THE CRYSTALS INTO A TRANSPORT
UNIT. WHEN THE TRANSPORT UNIT ENTERS A BUILDING THE CRYSTALS WILL BE UNLOADED
AND PUT INTO CREDIT OF THE BUILDING. EACH CRYSTAL IS WORTH 50 UNITS OF CREDIT
OF THE BUILDING, KEEPING IN MIND THAT 50 UNITS OF ENERGY CAN PRODUCE ABOUT
4 NEW UNITS. YOU CAN SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CRYSTALS.

TYPICALLY, THE CRYSTALS ARE FOUND IN DIFFICULT TO REACH LOCATIONS. YOU MAY
NEED SEVERAL TURNS BEFORE REACHING THEM,WHICH MEANS THAT YOUR TRANSPORT UNIT
COULD EASILY BE INTERCEPTED BEFORE REACHING ITS DESTINATION. MAKE SURE THAT
YOUR OPPONENT DOES`NT GET ANY CRYSTAL, AS THE REPAIRING OF UNITS BEGINS A 
DECISIVE PART IN THE GAME.

THE TERRAIN
-----------
THE TERRAIN IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN BATTLE ISLE. DURING THE MOVEMENT OF
UNITS, A CHANGE IN TERRAIN CAN SHORTEN OR LENGTHEN THE RANGE AND MOBILITY OF
UNITS. MANY OF THE LAND UNITS MOVE FASTER ON CLEAR LAND (ex:ROADS)WHILE WOODS
AND MOUNTAINS PRESENT IMPASSABLE OBSTACLES.

USUALLY THE HEAVIER THE UNIT, THE MORE LIMITED THE RANGE AND THE MORE UNLIKELY
IT IS TO PASS THROUGH MOUNTAINS.

THE DEPTH OF WATER PLAYS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR THE NAVAL UNITS.
THE LARGER AND HEAVIER THE VESSEL,THE MORE SLOWLY IT MOVES.THE LIGHTER THE
VESSEL,THE LONGER ITS RANGE,LIKE LAND UNITS,THE RANGE OF NAVAL AND AIR UNITS
WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED IN MOVEment PHASE.
THE TERRAIN ALSO PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE DURING THE ATTACK AGAINST THE 
OPPONENT. UNITS ON THE ROAD ARE EASIER TARGETS THAN UNITS IN THE WOODS. THE
ALTITUDE CAN BE A DECISIVE FACTOR IN THE OUTCOME OF A BATTLE: THE UNIT
POSITIONED HIGHER USUALLY HAS THE ADVANTAGE

THE EXPERIENCE SYSTEM
---------------------
THE QUALITY OF A UNIT DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON THE FIRE POWER, THE RANGE, OR THE
ARMAMENT, BUT ALSO ON THE EXPERIENCE GAINED BY THE UNIT IN COMBAT. EACH TIME A
UNIT IS EBGAGED IN BATTLE AND SUCCEEDS AT LEAST ONE ENEMY UNIT.

THE UNIT EXPERIENCE GAINED DURING BATTLES IS DISPLAYED ON THE STATUS
LINE(STARS).

THE MORE EXPERIENCE A UNIT HAS, THE MORE DANGEROUS THAT UNIT IS TO THE
OPPONENT, AS EXPERIENCE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE OUTCOME OF THE BATTLE.

TRY TO GAIN SUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE WITH ALL YOUR UNITS. DONT ATTACK POWERFUL
ENEMY UNITS WITH WEAKER UNITS OF YOUR OWN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME. IN
ALMOST ALL CASES, THIS WILL ONLY HELP YOUR OPPONENT GAIN EXPERIENCE.

IF YOU ATTACK A SERIOUSLY DAMAGED OPPONENT UNIT, TRY TO USE A UNIT POWERFUL
ENOUGH TO COMPLETELY DESTROY THE ENEMY DETACHMENT. YOUR UNIT WILL THEN GAIN 2
ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE POINTS. AS YOUR ACCURACY IMPROVES WITH EXPERIENCE, YOUR
ABILITY TO DODGE ENEMY FIRE ALSO IMPROVES. 


HOW TO GET IMMEDIATE INFORMATION
--------------------------------
BATTLE ISLE IS SUCH A COMPLEX GAME THAT IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOUR FIGHTING UNITS AND THE SITUATION IN GENERAL. AND SO WE HAVE 
PROVIDED A FUNCTION FOR CALLING UP INFO AT ANY POINT OF THE GAME.

INFORMATION ON FIGHTING UNITS.
------------------------------
PLACE THE QUESTION MARK ON THE UNIT AND PRESS `RETURN`. THE SCREEN WILL SHOW
FULL DATA ON THAT UNIT.BELOW THE UNIT ID,YOU WILL SEE THE IMPORTANT TECHNICAL
DATE:
1 - FIRE POWER AND ATTACK RANGE AGAINST TERRESTRIAL TARGETS
2 - FIRE POWER AND ATTACK RANGE AGAINST AIRBORNE TARGETS
3 - FIRE POWER AND ATTACK RANGE AGAINST MARINE TARGET
4 - RADIUS OF ACTION OVER BEST TERRAIN
5 - ARMOUR

IF YOU CALL UP ANY INFO ON ENEMY TARGETS, YOU WILL GET AN `ACCESS DENIED`
MESSAGE.

GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------
IF YOU WISH TO SEE THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE GAME, SELECT THE QUESTION MARK
WITH THE CURSOR ON AN EMPTY SPACE BETWEEN UNITS.A SET OF FIGURES APPEARS ON 
THE SCREEN,WITH THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:

1 - ROUND/THE NUMBER OF ORDERS EXECUTED SINCE GAME WAS STARTED

2 - LEVEL/LEVELS 0-15 CONCERN MAPS WHICH ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN 2 PLAYER GAMES
NUMBERS 16-31 ARE MAPS USED WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING THE COMPUTER.

3 - MODE/SHOWS THE CENTRAL COMMAND POST MODE. YOU CAN ONLY ORDER YOUR UNITS TO
MOVE IF THE WORD `MOVE` APPEARS,OTHERWISE, YOU MUST PLAN YOUR ATTACK AND
EXECUTE OTHER ACTION.

4 - HIGH/IS AN ABBREVEATION FOR `HIGHEST RATING` THE HIGHEST SCORE ON THE
CURRENT MAP.

5 - ACTUAL/DESIGNATES THE ACTUAL SCORE.

6 - THE MAIN WINDOW SHOWS THE BALANCE OF FORCES BETWEEN THE PLAYERS, YOU CAN
COMPARE THE NUMBER OF UNITS,DEPOTS AND FACTORIES BETWEEN YOURSELF AND YOUR
ADVERSARY. THE FIGHTING UNITS,DEPOTS AND FACTORIES IN THE THIRD COLUMN DO NOT
BELONG TO ANYONE,THEY CAN BE WON BY EITHER PLAYER.

7 - TURN/SHOWS THE NUMBER OF ORDERS YOU HAVE GIVEN.

8 - LIMIT/SHOWS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ORDERS YOU CAN GIVE.

PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT
----------------------
WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING BATTLE ISLE FOR SOME TIME,YOU WILL BE LESS
INTERESTED IN THE OUTCOME OF ANY PARTICULAR BATTLE THAN IN YOUR SCORE.THIS IS
WHY THERE IS A LIST OF BEST PLAYERS FOR EACH MAP.
WE SHALL DESCRIBE THE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SYSTEM TO HELP YOU BLOW OFF THE
ROOF!!!.

THE BEST SCORE IS BASED UPON THE DEFENSE VALUES OF ALL UNITS ON THE MAP.THIS
IS SHOWN IN THE GENERAL INFO. THE SCORE DROPS WHEN A FRIENDLY OR ENEMY TROOP
DISAPPEARS. COUNTING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF UNITS IN THIS WAY MEANS THAT YOUR
FINAL SCORE WILL DROP IF YOU WIN BY DESTROYING ALL THE ENEMY UNITS,BUT ON THE
OTHER HAND, YOU WILL EARN SUPPLEMENTARY POINTS.

THIS IS HOW POINTS ARE CALCULATED.
----------------------------------
* ALL UNITS DESTROYED..... +500 POINTS
* WITH HIDDEN INVENTORIES. +100 POINTS
* NOT MORE THAN 4  ORDERS. POINTS X 4
* NOT MORE THAN 8  ORDERS. POINTS X 3
* NOT MORE THAN 16 ORDERS. POINTS X 2
* MAXIMUM SCORE........... 32.500 POINTS

END....
