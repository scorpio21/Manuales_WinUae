                    TYPED TO PLEASE SKID ROW'S TRADITION!

I.LOADING THE GAME:
 Insert the BOOLY disk in your internal drive and switch on your computer.

II.PROTECTION:
 At the beginning of the game you will be asked to look for a specific word
at a precise page of this manual:type this word on your keyboard and press
<RETURN>.If you give the correct answer, you will be through with this rather
unpleasant phase.Otherwise, we will give another chance, but it will be the
last one...If you give two wrong answers, the disk will catch fire and your
address will be at once given to competent authorities.

III.CONTROLS:
 Use the mouse to control the game on Atari ST/STE and Amiga.On Amstrad
CPC/CPC+, you can use the joystick or the keyboard.On IBM PC & Compatibles,
you can use all three of them.

IV.THE GAME:
 BOOLY is a simple game: you just have to bring all the objects you see on
your screen to their "GOOD" state which is indicated on the control panel.
For example, all the blue squares on the first level must become grey.You
click on the objects to reverse their color.But, as we like to make things
difficult for you, some of the objects may be connected, so if you click on
one of them, others may react too and be reversed.Normally the connections
are invisible but you have the possibility to see them by simultaneously
pressing the two buttons of your mouse, or by pressing the <RETURN> key
(if you don't have a mouse).If you choose to see the connections, your time
potential is discounted pretty rapidly, so be moderate...
Click to quit.
To win a stage is very satisfying and allows you to score a number of points
equal to 50 times the number of seconds you have left on the chronometer.
These points will be a great help for you to play the next "CHALLENGE" stage.
When you win a "CHALLENGE", you have access to a code that you will use next
time you play in order to start from the level you won.

V.TIME:
 At the bottom of your screen , you can see two chronometers: the first one
shows the remaining total time, the second one shows the time left to the
current player.In case of a one player game, they show identical times.

VI.CHALLENGES:
 At the end of each "LEVEL", that it, after solving three stages, you arrive
to a "CHALLENGE" stage.The rule of the game remains the same:all the objects
must be turned to grey.

 The main differences between these stages are:
 ----------------------------------------------
  .You play on the whole surface of the screen, that is, 10x6 objects.
  .The objects have 3 different states instead of 2.
  .It is impossible to see the connectors.
  .The time available to you to solve a stage depends on the number of points
    you scored at the previous "LEVEL".
  .If you win a "CHALLENGE" stage, you get 50.000 points and a one minute
    bonus for the next stages.
  .To loose a "CHALLENGE" is not eliminatory, but you ill be brought back to
    the same "CHALLENGE" stage till you find the solution.
  .There is no bonus for these stages.
  .A player disqualified during a "CHALLENGE" will get back into the game at
    the next level.

 During a "CHALLENGE", you have the possibility to see the time you have left
by clicking on the right-side button of the mouseor by pressing the Space Bar
on CPC.To quit the "CHALLENGE" mode, click twice on the upper left side of
the screen.

VII.SEVERAL PLAYERS GAME:
 In a several players game, each player disposes of 5 tries before passing,
as well as a certain time corresponding to a total time divided by the number
of players.Only the one who solves a stage will score,and the player supposed
to play right after him will begin the next stage.

VIII.BONUSES
 While playing, you will notice that some of the objects can get you a bonus.
You get this bonus when you solve a line (horizontal,vertical or diagonal),
and the more objects there are on this line, the more bonuses you get.If you
simultaneously solve several lines, you grow very rich...
It's up to you to discover the ropes of the system.

IX.OPTIONS
 You go this panel by clicking on the right-side button of the mouse or by
pressing the Space Bar on CPC.
You quit the same way.
