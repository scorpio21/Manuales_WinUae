                          BATMAN, THE CAPED CRUSADER

This is an 'arcade adventure' game with 'beat-em up' overtones. The game
consists of two 'plots' revolving around Batman's deadliest enemies - The
Penguin and The Joker. Each plot is played in a similar fashion - though
the various locations and problems encountered will vary.

The stories so far...

THE PENGUIN PLOT - "A BIRD IN THE HAND"

The Penguin, having been released from jail, decides to set up an umbrella
factory, near his Gotham City mansion, but, of course old habits die hard
and this is but a cover up for his ingenious plan to take over the world
using an army of robotic penguins!

As 'Batman' can you close down the hidden master control computer and stop
this evil conspiracy?

THE JOKER PLOT - "A FETE WORSE THAN DEATH"

Robin has mysteriously disappeared - the only clue found is a single
"playing card" the call sign of the infamous 'Joker'! Batman's arch
enemy has returned. On close examination the Batcomputer reveals a secret
message hidden on the flip side of the card.
"Robin heads for a fate worse than death, the fuse is lit - so don't
waste time, follow your nose and remember, there's no place like home!
Boom! Boom! Can you uncover the mystery, save Robin and defeat the Joker?
Time is running out.

GAMEPLAY

The presentation on screen simulates a comic strip with Gotham City and
all its characters appearing in 'multiple overlaid panels'. Any text (i.e.
clues, descriptions, etc) is displayed in caption boxes in the appropriate
'frame'.

The player, as the 'Batman', has complete freedom to move around and
interact with the numerous locations, solving puzzles en route.

The game is over only when the adventure is complete or Batman has
insufficient energy to continue.

THE UTILITY SCREEN

By 'pulling down' and pressing 'fire' Batman will enter the utility screen.

This displays all the objects you have 'picked up' and also the control
'icons' which are used to manipulate them.

Note - various aspects of the game's displays and sound effects may also be
changed at this point to suit the requirements of the player.

Batman's energy status bars and the 'plot completion percentage' are also
displayed on this screen.

Game percentage

Objects carried

Control icons

Bat-cursor

Energy status bars

EXAMPLE - UTILISING AN OBJECT

By moving the 'Bat-cursor' onto the object and pressing 'fire', then
selecting the 'utilise' icon in the same manner, that object will be used.

i.e.      Food eaten (energy increased)
          Key opens locked door
          Dart is thrown

HINTS AND TIPS

1. Don't eat too much too soon.

2. Some objects do more damage than good!

3. Keep ducking, to avoid bullets.

4. Never judge a book by it's cover (Joker's plot).


Well this concludes the complete Batman - The Caped Crusader Manual.
