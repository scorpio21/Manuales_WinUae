                                 BURNTIME
                                 --------


The existence of another Earth-like planet is probable.
But wherever it is it will certainly be too far away.


                         Instructions for the game                                
                         -------------------------


                                 Operation
                                 ---------


Although Burntime is a very complex strategy game we have tried to keep the
instructions  as  simple  as possible.  We believe it is important to allow
the  player  as  much  freedom  as possible to make decisions and to trade.
After  a  few minutes of playing Burntime, you will be able to use the game
easily  and  will  not  be troubled by operational problems allowing you to
concentrate on fighting your opponent.

In  this  chapter you will be given comprehensive information about all the
operational elements.  You will learn how to use and steer Burntime and all
the moves you can carry out with a mouse.

In  the  next  chapter  you  are introduced to the tactics of the game.  Of
course you will have to discover the niceties of the game for yourself, but
we  have  taken care to ensure that you have a real successful start to the
game.

After  reading both chapters you can start playing the game with style.  To
win  you have to get rid of all your opponents or to occupy all settlements
except the capital cities.


                          Installation of Burntime
                          ------------------------


PC Version
----------

The  PC  version  cannot  be  played from the disk!  Beware that at least 8
megabytes  of  free storage must be available on the hard disk!  To install
the  game  put  Disk  A  into  drive.  Now start the installation programme
INSTALL on this disk.

During  installation  you can enter another path in the register.  Normally
Burntime is installed on hard disk C as default.

Example 1:
Disk A is in drive A and Burntime should be installed on hard disk C.
- Enter: A:\INSTALL and press [ENTER]
- When you are asked which installation path is desired press [ENTER]
- Disk B should be put in Drive A when requested.

Example 2:
Disk A is in Drive B and Burntime should be installed on hard disk D.
- Type B:\INSTALL and press [ENTER]
- When requested for the desired installation path enter D.
- Disk B should be put in drive B when requested.

Start the game by typing the following:
C:\BURN\BT


AMIGA Version
-------------

If  you  want to play Burntime from the disk, put disk A in the drive.  Now
turn  the  computer  on.   You  can  also call it up by double clicking the
Burntime Icon on the on-screen display.

You can load Burntime onto the hard disk as well.  Call up the INSTALL Icon
on  the  on-screen display.  To start the game call up the Burntime-Icon on
the on-screen display.


Standard game disk AMIGA
------------------------

The  standard  game  disk  is not allowed to be write protected!  To make a
standard  game  disk  you  must format a disk (see user manual) and name it
"BURN_S".


Backup Copies
-------------

Disks can get damaged.  Normally when you are least expecting it or when no
backup copies from your master disk are available.

Therefore  it  is  imperative to make backup copies from your master disks.
From  then on only use the backup copies.  Store the master disks in a safe
and  protected place.  You should only use the backup copies to install the
game.

Protect   your  disks  from  dust,  dampness,  intense  heat  and  magnetic
influences!   In  this  way  you  will  get  years  of  enjoyment from your
software.


Starting up the game
--------------------

After  you have started the game up, an intro will follow.  This relates to
the events that happen in the game.
This  can  be interrupted at any time by pressing any of the mouse buttons.
After  the  intro the start screen will appear.  Here you can enter a name,
pick a portrait, enter the degree of difficulty and load an old game.


Player's name
-------------

By  clicking  on  the name gadget a player is activated.  You can give your
game figure a suitable name.
The  normal  confirmation with <ENTER> is not necessary.  The name that has
been entered will be automatically introduced on commencement of the game.


Player's portrait
-----------------

By clicking on the name gadget the corresponding portrait window will open.
Now  you  can  choose  a  portrait  to  match  the  game  figure  you  have
selected.You can scroll up through the portraits by clicking the left mouse
button  and  you can reveiw them by clicking the right mouse button.  There
is a choice of six portraits at your disposal.
The choice of portrait does not affect the development of the game.


Player's colour
---------------

When  you  click  on the flag, the two flags are interchanged.  They denote
the  colour  of  a  player.   Should  player one have something against the
colour red, he can change it for the calm colour green.
The choice of flag colour has no influence on the course of the game.


Degree of difficulty
--------------------

When  starting  a  new  game  you  have  the  choice  of  three  degrees of
difficulty.
The  higher  the  degree of difficulty, the more cunning the opponents are,
the harder the fight for survival becomes.
Also  the  distribution  of  vital items is influenced by the level chosen.
For  example  certain items are more difficult to come by when playing at a
higher level than at a lower one.
Of course you cannot select how well a human opponent will play.


Loading a previous game
-----------------------

You  are also able to load an old game.  By clicking on the load gadget you
will have access to the game options menu.  At this point you can select to
load a previous game.


Starting up a game
------------------

Once  a  few  preparations have been made, you can enjoy the game.  We wish
you lots of fun and success in your fight for survival and power!


Mouse cursor gives information
------------------------------

With the help of the mouse cursor you will always get information about the
items  listed.   In  the case of locations and items the corresponding name
will appear over the mouse cursor.
The colour of the person's name indicates its affilation (white=neutral).


The main screen
---------------

The key element of Burntime is the main screen.
Here you can check the time remaining on the course of the game, the amount
of  food  and  drink  necessary  for journeys, your opponents position, the
location of individual locations and the present whereabouts of your trops.
Only  on  the  main  screen  are  you able to start journeys and reveiw the
places  that  you personally are not going to stop at.  You can finish your
game  here  and  the opponent does not get a turn before time runs out.  By
moving the mouse cursor across the edge of the main screen you can move the
map excerpts of the entire game area.


Time remaining for each move in the game
----------------------------------------

Burntime  is organised in moves.  Each player has five minutes to carry out
his  desired  actions.  The time remaining can be seen in the time frame on
the main screen.


Position of the players
-----------------------

The  player's  symbols  show  the  present  position  of  the  players they
represent.  They are distinguished by the player's colours and numbers.


Settlements
-----------

In  the  inhospitable  world  of Burntime there are many diffirent types of
locations, ranging from dilapidated industrial cities to campsites.


Locations controlled by players
-------------------------------

If  a  flag  is  flying over a location then the corresponding player is in
control.   Locations  with  no  flag  flying can be entered at any time and
incorporated into your own empire.


Player's status
---------------

This  is  the  name  and  profession  of  the  player who is playing at the
moments.
For people who cannot or do not want to remember names, there is a portrait
of the player, whose turn it is.
Here  at  a glance you can see how many game game days have been played and
what  sort  of  shape  you  are in.  The frame only shows the health of the
boss.


The pop-up menu
---------------

On  the  main  screen  and  on  the location scenarios you can activate the
pop-up  menu  by  clicking  the  right  mouse button.  With the help of the
pop-up  menu  you  can carry out various actions that are explained in more
detail later on.
Click on any other part outside the menu to make it dissapear.


Travelling from location to location
------------------------------------

You  can  only  travel  from  one  location to another via the main screen.
Activate  the  pop-up  menu  and choose >>Travel<<.  The travel symbol will
appear next to the mouse cursor - you are now in travel mode.
Red lines show the travel routes that are possible at the moment.
Click  the  mouse  cursor on the chosen location and the journey can start.
The  player's symbol now travels along the red line.  Starting on a journey
ends the move.


Information about settlements
-----------------------------

Select "Info" in the menu and click on a location to get information on it.
You  will be given information about the number of men stationed there, the
storage, the degree of contamination and the gain in foodstuffs.


Name of settlement
------------------

The name of the settlement will appear in the name window.


Level of contamination
----------------------

Some  locations  are  more  contaminated  than  others.   Before entering a
location  you must check the level of contamination, otherwise after only a
few minutes your game could be over.


Number of troops
----------------

If  you  take  control  of  several locations it is hard to keep a count of
troops  you  have.   Here  it  is  possible  to  see  at  a glance how many
technicians,  soldiers  and  doctors  in  a  location  will  answer to your
command.


Supplies in storage
-------------------

If  you  have items in stored at this location, you can ask for information
about  the  amount  and types of items stored.  By using the arrows you can
scroll up and down the item report.


Food and water deposits
-----------------------

To  survive you have to be able to find food and water.  Your men will only
be  capable  of  doing this if they are equipped with the essential itemsin
the  newly captured places.  Here you can allocate what type of food should
be  produced  by  the  men  stationed there.  By clicking on the individual
picture symbols you can continue to the next type of foodstuff.  To produce
certain types of foodstuff special items of equipment are necessary.


Handling modes
--------------

The  figures  in  the  game  can  be  moved into a particular handling mode
through  the pop-up menu.  The chosen mode stays activated until you choose
another  mode.  The symbol for the activated mode always appears beside the
mouse cursor as a reminder.


Info mode (main screen)
-----------------------

This  mode  can only be used on the main screen.  Click on any location and
the corresponding information board will appear.


Travel mode (main screen)
-------------------------

This is also only at your disposal in the main screen.  Click on a location
and you can travel there.


Talking mode (location scenarios)
---------------------------------

Only possible in the location scenario.  Click on a person to talk.


Fighting mode (location scenarios)
----------------------------------

Only  in  the location scenarios.  Click on a person or animal, and you can
attack him / it.


Inventory
---------

In  the  inventory you can check your health and that of your crew, as well
as the equipment you are carrying.

In   the  written  text  you  will  find  information  on  the  profession,
experience,  health and the degree of saturation of the person in question.
The  food and water supply is always given in daily rations.  Therefore you
can  get info on how many days a person could survive without taking in any
food  or  liquid.   If  his  level  sinks  to  zero,  his  health will also
deteriorate.   When  health  reaches  zero then even the best doctor cannot
help  anymore.  Your team is then short of a man.  It pays off to check the
health of all the members of your team from time to time.

You  can  activate  the  inventories of people present in the small figures
board.   In  the boss' group all the people present are available.  However
you must position yourself very close to the activated figure.

Each  person can carry a maximum of six items.  If the inventory is already
full  and a new item should be added, then first of all, an old item should
be disposed.

Click  on  an  item with the left mouse button and it will be disposed.  It
will  appear  in  the  right of the large field of the inventory.  The item
will  lie on the ground in front of the person in question.  From there you
can  pick  it  up  again  in the same way.  Similarly you can also exchange
items between diffirent members of the group.

Click on an item with the right mouse button and you can use it.

If  the  person  present  is a technician then he will give you info on the
item  that  has  been clicked on.  In other words what he can do with these
items and also which items he still needs for their completion.


Options
-------

You  can  reach  the  options  menu via the pop-up menu on the main screen.
Move  the  mouse  cursor onto the right hand side of the television and the
control  panel  will  open  and release the control elements.  You can then
load  or save the scores of the game, turn the music on and off or also end
the game.

Back to screen:  Choosing this point in the menu will return you to the
                 main screen. All adjustments will be carried out.

Music:           maybe you need silence for thinking about your
                 strategy. Therefore you can also turn the music on and
                 off. 

New start:       You can start a new game.

Speed:           The speed of the animations can be slowed down for very
                 quick computers (0=no delay, 3= maximum delay)

To DOS:          You can return to DOS - end of game.

Load/save/delete: Up to 8 scores of the game can be saved. To save, choose
                 a free space, enter the name and click on save. Old game
                 scores can also be either simply overwritten or deleted.


Capital cities
--------------

No fighting can take place in the five capital cities and they can also not
be captured.  Items stored here are at everyones disposal.  In the capitals
you can find doctors, bars, resturants and also trading centres.


Eating and drinking
-------------------

Click  on  food  and  water  with  the  right  mouse  button and it will be
consumed.   It will always be equally distributed among the group of people
present.   What seems to be plenty for one person, is often not enough when
shared  among  a group of people.  If you only want to feed one person then
you must cut yourself off from the group for a short time so as not to have
to  share  it  out.   Be  careful  not  to sign up more people than you are
capable of feeding for the duration of the game.


Moving within the location scenario
-----------------------------------

To  move  a  person  or  an  entire  group  in  the location scenarios to a
particular  point, simply click on the point.  The person or the group will
now  attempt to get there by the shortest possible route.  Sometimes it can
happen  that  a person takes a wrong route and ends up in a dead end.  Help
him by tapping in shortest routes.


Activating the figures in the game
----------------------------------

You  can  recognise the active figure as its border will be flashing.  In a
group it is always the boss.  If you want to move a single person, you must
first  activate him.  To do this simply click on the person.  If the person
has  already  been  activated and you click on him, this will automatically
open the inventory.


Making contact with people
--------------------------

Click  on  a  game  figure  to make contact with him.  By clicking on them,
irresetive  by  clicking on them of what handling mode you have tuned into,
you  can  now  speak or fight with the person.  If the desired person is to
far  away,  the  active  figure  will  first  of  all  begin to move in the
direction of the person.  The active figure will always make contact first.
When  speaking  to a strange person you can sign him up, obtain information
from  him  or trade with him.  Making contact could also present the chance
of trading.


Storage of items
----------------

As you can only take a limited number of items with you, you need somewhere
to  store  items  for the time-being.  The most suitable places are houses,
caves or tents.

When  you  enter  such  a store you can call up the store inventory.  It is
operated  in  the  same way as the person inventory.  Items produced in the
bases will automatically be transferred to the stores.


Water sources
-------------

If  you  enter  a  water  source  with  a person or a group, he / they will
automatically drink.

The  window  at  the bottom right of the screen gives you information about
the amount of water at your disposal in daily rations.  The water available
could  vary  as  wells can dry up.  Deposited containers are also filled up
again and how long this takes depends on the amount of water.  Click on the
containers  with the right mouse button and an attempt will be made to fill
them up too.


Fighting
--------

If  you  want  to  attack a person or an animal, you will need to change to
fighting  mode.   You  will  fight  with  the  activated  figure  or group.
Weapons, to be used in the fight, can be activated by clicking on the group
inventory with the right mouse button.

By  clicking  on  a  particular  figure  you  are  indicating who should be
attacked.   Fights  against  computer  opponents  happen in real time.  Two
human  opponents  fight  against  one  another  stroke  for stroke for five
rounds.   You  can  recognise a hit by a flashing white circle that appears
over the person in question.


Exchanging items
----------------

In the world of Burntime money has no value.  Here bartering is the name of
the  game.   To  obtain a desired item you have to offer to exchange it for
another  item  which, depending on your bartering abilities, may be more or
less valuable.

You  can  exchange goods with players or traders.  Items or provisions have
no  fixed  value.  Supply and demand determine the real exchange value.  If
the  mouse  cursor is on the left hand side of the screen, you can see your
own  figures  on  the  inventory.  If the mouse cursor is on the right hand
side  of  the  screen  then  the  inventory  of your bartering partner will
appear.

If  you  now  click on an item in your own inventory, it will appear on the
exchange  board  above.   The  inventory  is  listed  as a sign that is was
approached  to  exchange.   The  approach for recieving items from exchange
partners  is  exactly  the  same.   Click  on the inventory of the exchange
partner  and it will reveal his exchange board.  By clicking on the item of
equipment once again it will disappear.

If  you agree to the exchange then click on "Exchange OK".  On the exchange
board  itself  the exchange light will change to green.  When both exchange
lights  are green, then the exchange has been confirmed.  It can occur that
you  have  to give up several less precious items to obtain a more valuable
item.   On  the  other  hand  you can take perfect advantage of the serious
situations of individual people.

If  you click on an item with the right mouse button, it will be positioned
beside  the  inventory  board.   When you leave the exchange scene you will
find  these  items still on the ground.  By clicking on them again they can
be picked up again.


Fighters
--------

Fighters  are the men for the rough work.  They work with their muscles not
their heads.

Depending  on  the  amount  of  experience they are most suitable for guard
duties or capture moves.  However the best fighters cannot achievevery much
with  their  bare fists.  You must pay specail attention and make sure your
fighters  are  always  equipped  with  weapons.  The desired weapon must be
activated  otherwise it is useless.  To do this click on the inventory with
the  right  mouse  button.  A red frame marks the active weapon.  With guns
pay attention to the limited amount of ammunition.  When ammunition has run
out,  you must stock up again with new ammunition (click on ammunition with
right mouse button).


Technicians
-----------

Technicians work with their heads.  They can create very useful things from
bits  of  scrap  metal.   They  should  only  be  involved in a fight in an
emergency.

If  a technician has an interesting item on his inventory, you can click on
this item with the right mouse button and the technician will tell you what
you  can do with this item.  He will also tell you what he needs to be able
to finish a certain item.


Doctors
-------

Small  injuries  will  heal themselves.  However if your health sinks below
70%  you  must have a doctor in your troop to cure it.  Small injuries will
heal quicker with a doctor in your troop.

If  your  health  sinks below 50%, only an expensive doctor based in one of
the  capital  cities can help you.  You must offer him food provisions.  If
it is enough the figure at the front of the inventory will be cured.


Traders
-------

With  traders  you can make good deals depending on your skills in trading.
The  price of the goods depends on supply and demand.  You will have to pay
a lot for goods that are urgently required and rare.

Traders  are  also  found in trading posts in the capital cities.  They are
heavily armed and for this reason it is best not to attack them.


                         Instructions for the game                                                    
                         ------------------------

                                 The game
                                 --------

The  adventurer John WooD set off on his first journey through the world of
Burntime.   We  thought  this  would  be more help to the beginner than the
notes  of  an experienced player.  It certainly was not easy to get hold of
this well serviced beanpole's treasures of experience.

Nobody  willingly  gives  up  their  secrets.   But experience gained under
difficult  circumstances can be the deciding factor in gaining victory over
an opponent.

It  was not until we reminded Mr.  WooD of a few dark moments in his past -
and  we  do  not  want  to  reveal them here - that he was willing, even if
through  gritted teeth and silently swearing at us, to allow us to print at
least the first few pages of his notes.

We  have provided these notes for the players of Burntime with remarks that
should  help  them come to terms with the rules of Burntime in the shortest
possible time.


What do I own?
--------------

Before i set off to explore and overthrow the world, maybe i should look at
the  items of equipment i have.  I already know that these are diffirent at
the  beginning  of the game.  A quick look at the inventory tells me that i
own a knife, a rat, a piece of meat and a full waterbag.  In this dangerous
world the knife will be of great help.

As  i  am  aware of the nutritional value of foodstuffs and the capacity of
water  containers,  i can easily calculate how far i can travel without any
problems.   I  must  be  careful  as  it  is no fun to die of thirst in the
desert.   In this case i can survive without food for nine days and without
drink for five days.


The initail yourney
-------------------

I have the choice of four journeys that i can make.  They are marked on the
main  screen  by  red lines.  As i do not know any of the four locations, i
have  to  rely on my instincts.  I have also got to take into consideration
possible  further  travel  to  locations  even  further away when i make my
choice  of  destination.  I look at the main screen more closely and decide
that  Sana, a location over to the east, might be the right destination for
me.   As  the journey takes a few days, i have to be patient until it is my
turn again.


An empty bottle
---------------

At  last  i  arrived  in Sana.  It was a hard and arduous journey, but i am
thirsty  for  action.  I explore the area a little and find several houses.
Naturally i search them, maybe i will find some usefull things.

In  the  first house i find an empty bottle that i will be able to use as a
water container.

I  hurry  up  my  search  as  i  already know:  he who arrives late will be
punished.  Where did i hear that?


The soldier
-----------

As i left the house a man approached me.  As he obviously did not intend to
do  me  any harm, i spoke to him.  After asking him for news, he told me he
had  a  sore leg.  Despite this i asked him if he wanted a job.  He offered
his  services  of  travel  companion for the price of a rat.  Rats are very
precious, so i asked him cautiously what his profession was.  He boasted of
being  a good fighter and i liked him, so i employed him as a soilder.  His
name was Hias, but i doubt that was his real name.

At  least  i  am no longer alone.  I now have to take care of my companion,
too.  But what can i achieve on my own in the world?


Follow me, follower
-------------------

I  wanted  to explore the area further, and head for the next houses.  As i
looked  behind myself i could see my companion still standing helplessly by
the house instead of following me.  I called him and ordered him to stay by
my side.

It is not easy being the boss.  In the future i must remember to give clear
orders to my crew.  I cannot expect them to react independently.  Who knows
what they would actually do?

So  when  i  send  someone  off from the group on a special contract i must
remember to recall him when he has to join the group again.  I will have to
get used to thinking for my people.


The well in front of the gate
-----------------------------

Between the houses i saw something that could be a well.  And it really was
a well with fresh water.

We quenched our thirst and filled up the bottle.  Since Hias did not have a
water container i gave him the bottle.


Exchanging items
----------------

I  simply  put  the  bottle  next  to  the  well.   Then  i called up Hias'
inventory.  Now Hias can pick up the bottle in the normal fashion.

This  only  functions  so simply when both people are in the same group and
when they are not to far away from each other.


He who looks, finds
-------------------

Time  to explore the surrounding area.  Hias and i roamed between the rocks
and  bushes like two bloodhounds.  We were sucessful in our search.  Near a
rock i found a knife.  As i already had a knife, i gave it to Hias.

At  last he was also armed.  What is the use of a soldier without a weapon?
A  little  further on we also found a snake.  We took this delicacy with us
too.


The first base
--------------

I  like  the town of Sana.  I think it could be a very useful base.  It was
finding  that  well  that confirmed my decision.  Then i activated Hias and
ordered him to stay in the camp.

I am now the proud ruler of a town.  I have occupied Sana.


Power is knowledge
------------------

A  few  pieces of information about my base would be quite helpful.  To get
this i choose "Info" from the menu.

On  the  info  board  i can see all the most important information about my
base.

Hias appears as my only member of staff.  With his knife he can scratch two
daily  rations  of  maggots from the rocks.  He is missing the equipment to
catch rats or snakes.

In  order  for  Hias  to  do  the  right  thing,  i  must enter the desired
foodstuff.   In  this  case  it is clearly maggots.  The well has plenty of
water available.  It is sufficent for five people.


Getting away from this location
-------------------------------

It  is  time to move on.  To do this i must move to the edge of the town to
be able to call up the main screen.


On the road to new destinations
-------------------------------

On the main screen my base is marked by a flag in my colours.  I decided to
stay in the vicinity of the big city.  Therefore i travelled to Bearwood, a
location in the middle of a dead forest.


Equipped for the fight
----------------------

After  arriving  in  Bearwood  i  was  fascinated  by the eery and graceful
remains of the trees.  A stray dog took advantage of my inattentiveness and
attacked me.  But luckily enough he let go of me again.

Now i realised that up until now i had been very lucky.  I had been running
around  carelessly  without  having  activated  my weapon.  I would have to
alter  this  as  fast as possible or i will most certainly come to a sticky
end.   I  opened  my inventory and equipped myself with a knife.  So when i
switched  to fighting mode, i was equipped with a weapon.  And not a minute
to early, as another dog attacked me.  This time i could defend myself.  It
tried  to escape, but i set off after him.  A bitter fight followed.  I had
to  put  up  with  a  few  bites,  but in the end i managed to overcome the
animal.   In front of me now lay a delicious leg of meat that i immediately
and happily put into my back-pack.

As  i  was  injured i tried to avoid any further fights for the time being.
Maybe i will find a doctor who can heal my wounds.


The technician
--------------

After  finding  water  in  one of the houses and quenching my thirst, i met
another  man.  He told me he was a technician.  For the price of a snake he
joined  me.   I am now sure that Lois - evidently everyone here has a cover
name  - will be of great help to me.  Unfortunately i have not got a weapon
for  Lois.   Apart from the fact that he is a technician and not a fighter.
Therefore  i  resist the attempt to occupy Bearwood and make it a base.  We
checked out our eqipment and travelled to the new city of Neu Sandez.


Nothing is for free
-------------------

A  lot  is going on in the town.  We met a trader who offered us his goods.
I  was interested in the waterbag.  I offered him a rat in exchange, but it
was  not  enough.  Gritting my teeth i added a snake.  Hopefully this was a
good deal.

I have realised that i have got to be on my toes when dealing with traders.
They  attempt  to take advantage of emergency situations.  I hope that i am
never  in  such  a  desperate  situation  to have to give up half my wordly
belongings  for  urgent items of equipment.  You can't count on generousity
in the trading houses.


At the doctors
--------------

In  a  building i met a doctor.  He was prepared to heal my wounds.  But in
return for his services he wanted my entire supply of meat.  I had faith in
my natural healing powers and turned his services down.

Perhaps  i  ought to sign up a doctor for my troop.  I was told that bigger
injuries could only be cured with the services of a doctor who was resident
in  the  troop.   In  very  serious  cases,  only  the  sevices of a doctor
stationed in one of the cities will be of help.


In the bar
----------

I could hear voices coming out of another building.  Lois and i entered the
house and found ourselves in a bar again.  I recieved some information from
two  guys  but  i  do not know what i can do with it.  I wanted to get some
water from the barman but it was to expensive.

The  aroma  of  the roast drew us into the restaurant.  It was a mockery as
five  stars  were  hanging  on  the  wall  of  this filthy restaurant.  The
exhorbitant prices made us draw a hasty retreat.


He, who likes to make things
----------------------------

While  rummaging  through  many of the houses we found batteries, eectrical
scraps, a broken display and a broken mine detector.  I asked my technician
what  he  could  do  with the broken detector.  He told me he could make it
work again with the pieces we have found.

As  he  could not think of anything else to make with the items, i gave him
the  contract  to carry out the repair.  A mine detector would certainly be
useful.


The contaminated location
-------------------------

In  the bar i heard some wonderful things about a location called Nob Hill.
On  the  main screen i can see that this is a neighbouring town to the west
of  Neu  Sandez.  So i decided to travel there as there is nothing else for
me to do in the town.  When i arrived in Nob Hill i had a bad feeling about
the  location.   A  quick  look  at  the  info  board confirmed that my bad
feelings were justified.  The town was contaminated with radioactivity.  As
we were not in possestion of protective suits we left immediately.


Back in Sana
------------

We returned to our base in Sana.  Hias had been working hard there.  He had
collected  three daily rations of maggots and had hidden them in one of the
houses.  I only had room for one daily ration, so i gave the Lois the other
two rations.

We  found  a  rat trap.  Hias can catch rats with it now.  I entered "rats"
under production on the info board.

After a last chat with Hias we set off for Neu Sandez again.


A new base
----------

In a trading centre i came across an axe for Lois.  He is now armed too and
in  this way we set off for Bearwood.  I ordered Lois to go to the camp and
now I have two bases.

I should now see to it that I get more followers.  But I have to be careful
as  i  also  have  to  be  able  to  feed them.  I also want to explore the
surrounding  area.   Above  all  the  caves  in the north appear to worth a
visit.   But  also  another large city would appeal to me.  However this is
another adventure!



 
 
That's all mates, have fun with this game and remember...
