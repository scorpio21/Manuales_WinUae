INSTEL reports that Commander Berry Mayers and Commander Lori Bergin are being held hostage by Barrax forces. Pulse-variable communications indicate that they were attacked by a Barrax Nova Cruiser at 3900 hours S.R.T. in the Karnus Sector, 671 988 4360.

The commanders were able to partially transmit a final message.  Trace Lok analysis follows: "ability to....invisible...limited.. time.....fast.t..acce....brigg.ht.light..beaming us aboard..."

Shorty after the attack, Inter Trak scans identified a massive energy source in the same sector moving toward the planet Terrainia.  It is believed that the hostages are being held in the inner recesses of that planet.

Mayers and Bergin were returning from a succesful mission to Urania, the home planet of the Barrax Empire, and are in possession of information that is integral to the defense of Earth and the success of any future counteroffensice actions.

SATIII-0845 PULSCOM BULLETIN
EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION: ALERT STATUS 1

TO: Squadron Commander/Battle Group V
From: GALAX LUNAR HQ
Subject: Mission Briefing
Mission Code: C61-178DE
Date:01/09/2400
----------------------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Eliminate Barrax lifeforms from the planet's surface and subterranean emplacements.  Proceed without delay and begin immediate rescue efforts of the hostages.  It is imperative that we free commanders Mayers and Bergin before Barrax interragators are able to break through their psychological defenses.

INSTEL Brief: Barrax activities have escalated in the Terrainian region for the last 10 years.  An analysis of transport patterns and laser scan results indicate that this planet is a major weapons research and development center for the Barrax Empire.  It is highly probable that any offensive action will be met by genetically engineered, biological weapons technology never before encountered in this galaxy.






INSTEL Recommendation: A large attacking force would prove counterproductive, due to the 100% probability that early warning Barrax defenses would be alerted.  The only chance for a succesful rescue mission(50% confidence level) is to send a small strike force comprised of one or two Delta II class cruisers with stealth capabillity.

Game Options

Two Player Mode

    In two-player mode, each ship has full-scrolling mobility across the screen.  It is not necessary for the player who starts on the left to remain on the left during battle.  When missile upgrades or "smart bomb" capsules become visible (See Acquiring Weapons), only the first player to catch the capsule acquires the weapon.  When you wish to enter a new level (see Changing Levels), both players must access the entry point simultaneously.

	*  Team Combat - In team combat, both players are working        together to rescue cammanders Mayer and Bergin from the          Barrax Empire.  You will have to keep track of your              partners progress and difficulties, as well as your own, in      order to succeed on this perilous mission.  It is                recommended that your team carefully collect the "Nova"          missile capsules and ensure that neither player exhaust          their supply.

     *  Free-for-All Competition - During free-for-all                   competition each player is trying to collect the most            points.  Proceed with caution at entry points to new             levels, because both players must enter simultaneously.
    
Single Player Mode

	In single player mode, you won't encounter the same number of enemy air and ground emplacements as in two-player combat.  You will be using the controller selected for Player 1 on the Setup Options screen.  Nevertheless, it is a more difficult mission to complete as a single player.

Game Play

Changing Levels

	You can enter the subterranean levels on Terrainia by moving your ship onto the entry point identified by an "Enter Here" sign.  Care must be execised in two-player combat, because both players must simultaneously place their ship on the sign.
	Each time you enter a new level, the number of enemies increases and new weapons will be fired at your ship.  It is advisable to upgrade your weapons and collect additional "Nova" missilie before taking on the challenge of a new level.

Acquiring Weapons

	You will find it difficult to succeed on your mission using only the weapons supplied on your Delta 1 Strike Cruiser.  New weapons and upgrades can be acquired on Terrainia if your combat skills are uo to the test (See Weapons Systems for details on weapons types).  Previous engagements with Brrax fighters have led to the discovery that certain jettisoned Barrax weapons can be recovered for use by your spacecraft.
	Once you have destroyed specific targets, you will notice a rectangular capsule moving back and forth on your computer display.  Two different capsules have been identified:

	[X] This glowing capsule changes color at every turn. The            weapon you acquire or upgrade is based on the color              when you catch it.  For example, if you have captured a          "red" magtorp, you can upgrade the weapon by capturing           another red capsule.

     [M] This capsule is released whatever you defeat a 4-member          Barrax fleet.  You automatically receive a "Nova"                missle for capturing this one!
 
Game Play

Joystick, Mouse and Keyboard Control
	
	Your joystick or mouse can control the movement of you ship, the firing of particle beam weapons and the release of "Nova" smart bombs (See Startup Options).

	*  Your joystick/mouse controls the movement of your ship in              eight different dirrections.  Simply move the joystick in the          direction your want your ship to move.

     *  To fire a laser or acquired weapon, press the joystick fire            button or the left mouse button.

   
     *  To fire a "Nova" smart bomb, rotate the joystick lever in a            counterclockwise direction while holding down the fire button.         With a mouse, press the right button to fire your "Nova."

     *  To pause the game, press "P" and "ESC."

Game Play and Difficulty Options

	You can change specific game play features and change the diffuculty of the game.  Press the Spacebar when the initial options screen is displayed to access a submenu of options.  Highlight your selection and press the joystick or mouse button to select the following:

	*  The number of lives you possess at startup.
	*  Your initial ready weapon.
	*  The maximum number of enemy bullets.

Weapons Systems

You will discover 25 different weapons confiqurations in Battle Squadron.  As you work your way through the various levels, you will find find that certain weapons are best used in specific situations.

"Nova" Smart Bomb

      *  *         The "Nova" smart bomb is the only weapon that can
    *     *        help you out of the tightest jams.  When you've
 *           *     been backed into a corner and destruction seems
 *    | |    *     imminent, launch a "Nova" and you will destory
     /@@@\         most of the enemies on your computer screen.  Use
   * -----  *      the joystick or mouse to fire your "Nova" in a 
    *       *      specific direction.
	
	You enter the fray armed with three smart bombs.  Additional "Novas" can be acquired by catching the special capsule marked with an "M".

Magnetic Torps (Red)

      * *     These balls of energy are absolutely devastating, but in
   *       *  the first versions you acquire, enemy ship can slip         *  | |  *  right through.  There are six upgrades available and the      /@@@\    last one cuts the widest swath through Barrax defenses
     -----

Anti-Matter Particle Beam (Blue)

      * *
      * *   
      | |      This radiant blue beam weapon is deadly and accurate,        /@@@\     and will fire with amazing rapidity.  One of the             -----     upgrades is the only weapon in your repetoire that            * *      fires backward and forward at the same time. At one le        * *      level, that's a distinct advantage.  This weapon,       however, cuts the narrowest path through the opposition.

Magma Wave (Orange)

    *   *
     * *
     | |        The swirling magma wave may provide the best               /@@@\       combination of raw power, speed and accuracy.  The         -----       width and duration of its "devastation zone" are amazing.

Emerald Laser (Green)

     !!!!! 
     !!!!!      This laser sends the longest burst into space 
      | |       after a few upgrades and fires very quickly.  Its 
     /@@@\      upgrades are nevr very wide, but a single shot is
     -----      enough to annihilate most enemies.  The emerald
laser is favored by "hot-shots" pilots who depend on decisive maneuvers and lightning reflexes to gain advantage over the enemy.
