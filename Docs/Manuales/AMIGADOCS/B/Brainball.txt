 your options from the menu screen, To control the balls you must place the
 cursor on the ball you wish to move, Click the LMB, This will then give you
 an option of hitting the ball from various directions, Choose one of these
 by clicking again on the LMB, (The direction you are allowed to hit the ball
 from all depends on where the ball is at the time) Once you have deceided on
 your direction press the RMB for strength of your hit, The power of your hit
 is shown on a window at the bottom of the screen. When you let go of the RMB
 the plunger will hit the ball and move it along.

        ( This is handy for when you get stuck or a ball gets lost )

                                 THE PUZZLE
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~
 The balls are made of Glass (red), Wood (Brown) and Iron (Silver), To reach
 the next level you must move all three balls into the three cups, On some
 screens it is best to move the cursor around the screen to have a look at
 the full screen before taking a shot. Watch out for water, Remember that a
 wooden ball will float on water, The glass and iron balls will sink, Avoid
 getting stuck against wooden walls, You cannot bounce a ball off wood, You
 can bounce balls off striped walls, balloons and flippers. The glass ball
 is light so use this to pass over a brown wooden grating, Using the wooden
 ball to pass over gratings will make a dent in the grating, If you move the
 wooden ball again over this dent it will make a hole in it and the ball will
 be lost. Trying to move an iron ball over a grating will end in trouble as
 the iron is very heavy and it will fall through.

 On some screens wooden walls and stones can have their uses, These can stop 
 movement of a ball. Look out for special switches which open gates etc. A
 switch can be operated by moving a ball on to it, These switches can be red,
 yellow or blue, They are small coloured buttons set in squares.
