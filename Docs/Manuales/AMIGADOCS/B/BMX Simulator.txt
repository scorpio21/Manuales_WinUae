                        BMX SIMULATOR

Typed in by CHUCKLES. Edited by PARASITE.


Richard Darling's BMX SIMULATOR is a brilliant follow-up to  his
original BMX RACERS.  Eye in the sky viewing, amazingly realistic
simulation - the starting ramp, burms, bumps, water splashes etc,
all have a realistic effect on the rider.
  A two player option is included. Seven different, progressively
harder, courses will test even the best games player.
   Richard has achieved yet another breakthrough with  the  first
ACTION  REPLAY option;  Whenever there is a close finish you  can
see it again on the REPLAY - and if that's not enough,  press the
"S" key and watch it in slow motion.

ACTION REPLAY
Press "A" at the end of each course for the ACTION  REPLAY.  Then
hold down "S" when you want to view the action in slow motion.

HINTS
Demonstration  mode runs automatically.  Press "N" to change  the
number  of courses in the championship.  You must  complete  each
course  within it's time limit in order to qualify for  the  next
one. Press "S" to start the race.
You are then told RIDERS READY - PEDALS READY - GO!
Press  Accelerate  the  instant you are told to go  -  timing  is
vital, don't lose precious tenths of a second. Race as though you
are  in a real BMX championship.  The burms help  you  turn,  the
rough  ground slows you down.  All the hills and different  grade
surfaces effect the rider in real life.
The  number of laps raced and the time elapsed are shown  at  the
bottom of the screen for both riders.
The  time  limit  of the course you are racing is  shown  on  the
bottom  line  of the screen,  in the centre.  There is  an  award
ceremony at the end of a two player game.
