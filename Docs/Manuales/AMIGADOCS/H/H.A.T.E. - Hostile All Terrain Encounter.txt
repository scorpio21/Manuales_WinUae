                                H.A.T.E.

                     HOSTILE ALL-TERRAIN ENCOUNTER

SCENARIO
The year is AD2320 and the Galaxy is in turmoil.  With the alien threat
ever increasing, the lack of experienced assault personnel is severely
undermining the defences of civilised sectors.  You are needed to repel
the hostile alien forces--but you have to qualify first.  Prepare to go
to Stripworld--the training ground for all Galactic Fighter Pilots!
     
Initially controlling a Star Fighter, PLASMA CELLS lining the route must
be collected and taken through the barrier.  Upon completion of this
level you will take the controls of the ground assault vehicle.
Manoeuvre the GAV to the next barrier, again collection Plasma Cells to
power the waiting Star Fighter.  This will continue until you can
advance no further.

To test you to the limit, alien defences line the way and must be
overcome. Ground skimming projectiles, intelligent missiles, enemy star
fighters, mine barriers and many more obstacles will challenge even the
most advanced Fighter Pilot.

GAME PLAY
You begin with four lives.  Each time your craft is destroyed a life
is lost.  Extra lives are gained by collecting the PLASMA CELLS (the
remains of the nuclear generators).  If your craft s hit whilst carrying
one or more cells one cell will be destroyed whilst saving you from
destruction.  The number of Plasma Cells carried through determines the
number of lives for the next level.
