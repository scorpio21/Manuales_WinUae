     COMPLETE DOCUMENTS FOR HEIMDALL 2

STORYLINE

IT IS THE AGE OF RAGNAROK,THE AGE OF A THOUSANDS YEARS,THAT ENDS WITH THE
EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN THE GODS OF ASGARD AND THE OUTCAST FORMER GOD LOKI AND
HIS ARMIES.

THE AGE BEGAN WHEN LOKI WAS EXILED FROM ASGARD AND IN REVENGE STOLE THE
WEAPONS OF THE GODS THOR,ODIN AND FREY.HEIMDALL,GUARDIAN OF THE RAINBOW
BRIDGE,SACRIFICED HIS DIVINITY SO THAT HE COULD WALK THROUGH THE EARTH IN
SEARCH OF THESE STOLEN WEAPONS.ONCE HIS QUEST WAS SUCCESSFUL,HE RETURNED TO
ASGARD WITH THE MISSING WEAPONS AND REGAINED HIS STATUS AS A GOD.THIS
MARKED A BITTER DEFEAT FOR LOKI,WHO SWORE TO AVENGE HIMSELF AGAINST HIS
ETERNAL ENEMY,HEIMDALL.

TWO HUNDRED YEARS PASSED IN THE AGE OF RAGNAROK.IN MIDGARD,THE LAND OF
HUMANS AND UTGARD,THE LAND OF STRANGE CREATURES SUCH AS DWARVES AND
GIANTS,LOKI'S WARRIORS,THE HAKRATS RAVAGED THE LAND ATTACKING WHEREVER THEY
COULD,FROM THE SMALLEST VILLAGE TO THE LARGEST CITY.THEIR ATTACKS ALWAYS
MET WITH RESISTANCE,SOME SUCCESSFUL,SOME NOT,BUT THE INHABITANTS OF THE
WORLD,KNOWN AS YGGDRASIL,WERE WEAKENING AND BEFORE LONG THE HAKRATS WOULD
BECOME TOO POWERFUL FOR ANY TO RESIST AT ALL.

IN ASGARD,THE GODS WERE CONCERNED.UNABLE TO INTERVENE,THEY COULD ONLY WATCH
AS EVENTS UNFOLDED.WHAT THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WAS WHY LOKI HIMSELF DID
NOT APPEAR WITH HIS WARRIORS BECAUSE UNLIKE THE OTHER GODS,LOKI WAS ABLE TO
WALK ON THE EARTH DURING RAGNAROK.THIS WAS BECAUSE LOKI WAS STRIPPED OF
SOME OF HIS POWERS AS A PUNISHMENT FOR STEALING THE WEAPONS FROM
ASGARD.THIS MADE HIM LESS POWERFUL THAN THE OTHER GODS AND THEREFORE HE DID
NOT HAVE THE SAME RESTRICTIONS AS THEY DID.

ANOTHER PUZZLE WAS THE OCCURRENCE OF A FEW RANDOM AND INEXPLICABLE
INCIDENTS.ONCE,A VILLAGE WAS BURNT TO THE GROUND,BUT THERE WERE NO TRACES
OF ENEMY TRACKS LEADING TO THE VILLAGE.NO OTHER VILLAGES IN THE AREA WERE
TOUCHED,AND THERE WASN'T A HAKRAT WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES WHO COULD HAVE
SNEAKED IN AND ATTACKED IT.THE ASSAILANTS SEEMED TO JUST APPEAR,BURN THE
VILLAGE AND THEN DISAPPEAR.

EVENTUALLY,ODIN THE ALLFATHER GATHERED THE GODS IN HIS HALL TO DISCUSS
WHAT ACTION,IF ANY,COULD BE TAKEN AGAINST LOKI.AS THEY TALKED THEY REALIZED THAT
IF THEY SIMPLY DEFEATED LOKI,HE WOULD JUST RETURN AND CONTINUE HIS EVIL AS
AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE.WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO WAS TRAP LOKI IN SUCH A WAY
THAT HE COULD NEVER CAUSE TROUBLE AGAIN.BUT HOW? AS THE YOUNG GODS DISCUSSED
WAYS OF TRAPPING LOKI,ODIN SAT DEEP IN THOUGHT.AFTER A WHILE HE CALLED THEM
TO BE QUIET AND ROSE TO SPEAK.

ODIN TOLD THEM OF THE TIME SHORTLY AFTER THE CREATION OF YGGDRASIL,WHEN HE
AND HIS BROTHERS HAD JUST BUILT ASGARD,AND THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS STILL
FORMING INTO THE LANDS THAT WE NOW KNOW - MIDGARD,UTGARD AND NIFLHEIM.THIS
WAS THE TIME WHEN ODIN FIRST DISCOVERED THE HALL OF WORLDS,A MAGICAL HALL
WHICH CONTAINS THE GATES AND PORTALS THAT LEAD TO VARIOUS POINTS IN THE
LANDS.ODIN USED THE PORTALS OFTEN AS AN EASY AND QUICK MEANS OF EXPLORING
HIS NEW HOME.AS HE TRAVELLED MORE,HE DISCOVERED THE DESTINATION OF EACH
PORTAL,AND LEARNT A LITTLE ABOUT HOW THE PORTALS OPERATED.THERE WERE
HOWEVER,A FEW STRANGE GATES IN THIS HALL WHICH ODIN FOUND HE WAS UNABLE TO
TRAVEL THROUGH.AS HE STUDIED THESE GATES FURTHER HE BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT
THEY LEAD NOT TO PLACES IN THE WORLDS OF YGGDRASIL,BUT IN FACT TO OTHER
HALLS IN DISTANT PARTS OF THE UNIVERSE.THESE OTHER HALLS WERE UNDOUBTEDLY
EACH CONNECTED TO ENTIRE WORLDS OF THEIR OWN,TOTALLY ALIEN TO THOSE THAT
ODIN KNEW.

INTRIGUED,ODIN WAS FACED WITH THE PROBLEM OF OPENING THESE GATES.TRAVEL
THROUGH THE NORMAL PORTALS WAS POSSIBLE BY POSSESSING A MAGIC TALISMAN
UNIQUE TO THAT PORTAL.EACH TALISMAN ACTED LIKE A KIND OF KEY AND ACTIVATED
THE PORTAL FOR USE.ODIN HAD FOUND THESE TALISMAN IN VARIOUS FORMS
THROUGHOUT THE WORLDS,SO HE DECIDED TO SEARCH ONCE MORE FOR A SIMILAR
TALISMAN THAT WOULD OPERATE ONE OF THESE OTHER GATES.

ODIN'S EFFORTS WERE EVENTUALLY REWARDED WHEN HE FOUND A STRANGE TALISMAN IN
THE TOWER OF NIFLHEIM.RETURNING WITH IT TO THE HALL OF WORLDS HE APPROACHED
ONE OF THE LOCKED GATES IN WHICH A SHADOWY VEIL APPEARED,SIGNALLING THAT IT
WAS NOW OPEN.WITH ANTICIPATION HE STEPPED THROUGH.

AS HE ADJUSTED HIS BEARINGS HE SAW THAT HE WAS IN A HALL THAT WAS SIMILAR TO
THE ONE HE KNEW,BUT ALSO VERY DIFFERENT.LOOKING AROUND HE SAW THAT ANOTHER
ONE OF THE PORTALS WAS OPEN,SO HE STRODE FORWARD AND STEPPED THROUGH IT.

THE SIGHT THAT GREETED HIM WAS BREATHTAKING.ASGARD WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THIS
LAND,BUT HE WAS AWE-STRUCK AT HOW DIFFERENT IT WAS.AS HE EXPLORED,HE SAW
SOME OF THE INHABITANTS AND DISGUISED HIMSELF AS ONE OF THEIR KIND,SO THAT
HE COULD PASS UNNOTICED.AS HE TRAVELLED HE CAME ACROSS A HUGE FOREST WITH A
CLEARING IN IT'S CENTER.IN THE CLEARING STOOD A STRANGE LOOKING BUILDING.IT
SEEMED UNINHABITED,SO ODIN ENTERED.

INSIDE THE BUILDING,IN THE CENTRE OF IT'S MAIN HALL,STOOD A PEDESTAL THAT
HAD AN AMULET MOUNTED ON IT.THIS AMULET WAS LIKE NONE THAT ODIN HAD EVER
SEEN BEFORE.WHILE HE WAS STANDING THERE,HE WAS SUDDENLY STARTLED BY A VOICE
BEHIND HIM.HE SPUN ROUND AND SAW BEFORE HIM A MAN WHO WAS NO DIFFERENT FROM
THE OTHERS HE HAD SEEN.THE MAN GREETED ODIN,SAYING THAT ALL TRAVELLERS WERE
WELCOME,AND OFFERED THE AMULET TO ODIN AS A GIFT FROM HIS PEOPLE.ODIN
SUSPECTED THAT THIS STRANGE MAN KNEW THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY TRAVELLED FROM
ANOTHER WORLD YET ODIN ACCEPTED THE OFFER OF HIS GIFT BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT
THE AMULET HAD MAGICAL PROPERTIES.AS HE TOOK THE AMULET DOWN FROM THE
PEDESTAL,THE MAN SAID THAT HE HOPED THAT ODIN HAD ENJOYED HIS VISIT
AND,WITHOUT WARNING,ODIN FOUND HIMSELF NO LONGER IN THE BUILDING BUT
STANDING BESIDE THE GATE IN HIS OWN HALL OF WORLDS.HE HELD THE AMULET IN
HIS HANDS AND,TROUBLED BY THIS STRANGE TURN OF EVENTS,HE MADE HIS WAY BACK
TO ASGARD.

ONCE IN ASGARD,ODIN AND HIS BROTHERS INSPECTED THE AMULET TO SEE WHAT IT'S
PURPOSE MIGHT BE.IT LOOKED AS IF IT WAS MADE TO BE WORN,SO THEY DECIDED
THAT THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IT'S PURPOSE WAS TO TRY IT ON.ODIN'S YOUNGEST
BROTHER,VILI,VOLUNTEERED.AS HE PLACED IT AROUND HIS NECK HE
FROZE,STATUE-LIKE.TO ODIN AND HIS BROTHERS,WATCHING IN HORROR,IT SEEMED
THAT VILI WAS KILLED BY THE AMULET.QUICKLY THEY PULLED THE AMULET FROM
THEIR BROTHER AND,AS IT FELL,VILI RETURNED TO HIS NORMAL SELF.ODIN STILL
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THIS AMULET WAS BUT KNEW IT WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERPOWER
A GOD.TOGETHER THEY BROKE THE AMULET INTO FOUR PIECES AND CAST EACH PIECE
THROUGH A DIFFERENT PORTAL IN THE HALL OF WORLDS.THUS THEY REASONED THAT
THE PIECES WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER AND HENCE THE AMULET WOULD NO
LONGER BE A THREAT.THEN THEY RETURNED TO ASGARD AND PUT ALL THOUGHT OF THE
AMULET BEHIND THEM.

AS ODIN FINISHED HIS STORY,HE SAT BACK IN HIS SEAT AND WAITED FOR THE OTHER
GODS TO SPEAK.AS THEY TALKED,THEY ALL SEEMED TO AGREE THAT THE AMULET WAS
THE MEANS THEY WERE LOOKING FOR TO DEAL WITH LOKI SAFELY AND
PERMANENTLY.THERE WAS ONLY ONE OPTION.AS BEFORE,ONE OF THEM HAD TO
SACRIFICE HIS DIVINITY SO THAT HE COULD WALK THE EARTH IN SEARCH OF THE
AMULET PIECES.ONLY THEN WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT THE AMULET AND
USE IT AGAINST LOKI.THE NEXT PROBLEM WAS WHERE TO SEARCH.ODIN SUGGESTED THE
ANSWER.HE REASONED THAT,AS EACH PIECE OF THE AMULET PASSED THROUGH A
PORTAL,IT WOULD BE ATTRACTED TO THE RO'GELD- THE SOURCE OF ALL MAGIC IN
THAT PARTICULAR WORLD.FIND A RO'GELD AND THERE YOU WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD
FIND A PIECE OF THE AMULET.

THE GODS LISTENED AND THEN REALIZED THEIR PLAN.ONE OF THEM HAD TO TRAVEL
THROUGH THE PORTALS INTO EACH WORLD,FIND THAT WORLD'S RO'GELD AND SEE IF A
PIECE OF THE AMULET WAS THERE.WHEN THEY HAD FOUND ALL THE PIECES THEY WOULD
THEN HAVE TO FIND LOKI AND USE THE COMPLETED AMULET TO IMPRISON HIM.THE
NEXT QUESTION WAS WHO SHOULD GO.HEIMDALL'S IMMEDIATE THOUGHT WAS 'HERE WE
GO AGAIN'BUT ODIN INTERVENED SAYING THAT ONE OF THE YOUNGER GODS SHOULD GO
BECAUSE HEIMDALL HAD GONE BEFORE.EVENTUALLY BALDUR,THE YOUNGEST SON OF
ODIN,WAS CHOSEN.ONCE AGAIN THOR TRAVELLED TO THE EDGE OF ASGARD.THERE HE
TOOK BALDUR AND CAST HIM DOWN TO MIDGARD IN MORTAL FORM SO THAT HE COULD
BEGIN HIS SEARCH.

IN ASGARD, THE GODS WATCHED ANXIOUSLY AS BALDUR TRAVELLED THROUGH THE
LANDS. BALDUR WAS HINDERED BY THE FACT THAT THE TALISMAN FOR SOME OF THE
PORTALS FROM THE HALL OF WORLDS HAD BEEN LOST. HE NOT ONLY HAD TO SEARCH
FOR THE PIECES OF THE AMULET BUT FOR THE MISSING TALISMAN AS WELL.

AS BALDUR APPROACHED WHAT HE THOUGHT TO BE THE FIRST RO'GELD, LOKI APPEARED
WITH A HOST OF HAKRATS. LOKI HAD LED BALDUR TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS
APPROACHING A RO'GELD BUT IT WAS A TRAP. ALTHOUGH BALDUR WAS VASTLY
OUTNUMBERED, HE FOUGHT WITH THE SPIRIT AND COURAGE OF ASGARD. MANY HAKRATS
FELL BEFORE HE WAS FINALLY CAUGHT BY A STRIKE FROM LOKI HIMSELF. LAUGHING,
LOKI AND HIS REMAINING FOLLOWERS LEFT BALDUR'S BODY WHERE IT HAD FALLEN.
WITH SADNESS THE GODS WATCHED AS HELA, THE RULER OF NIFLHEIM,ROSE UP FROM
THE GROUND TO CLAIM BALDUR'S BODY AND TAKE IT BACK WITH HER TO HER REALM.

ODIN MOURNED THE LOSS OF HIS SON, BUT HAD TO THINK ABOUT THEIR NEXT MOVE.
DESPITE THE LOSS, HE DECIDED THAT WHAT BALDUR HAD ATTEMPTED WAS STILL THE
ONLY WAY THAT LOKI COULD BE DEFEATED. ANOTHER HAD TO GO IN HIS PLACE. AS
SOON AS HE SPOKE OF THIS, HEIMDALL STOOD AND VOLUNTEERED TO RETURN. ODIN
KNEW THAT HEIMDALL WAS THE MOST LIKELY OF ALL THE GODS TO SUCCEED, BECAUSE
OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND FAMILIARITY WITH BEING MORTAL.

HAVING ALREADY LOST ONE OF THERE NUMBER TO ONE OF LOKI'S DEVIOUS TRICKS,THE
OTHER GODS INSISTED THAT HEIMDALL OUGHT TO AT LEAST HAVE SOMEONE WITH HIM TO
WATCH HIS BACK.ODIN AT FIRST DISAGREED,AS NO ONE ELSE HAD ANY EXPERIENCE OF
DEALING WITH THE MORTAL'S WORLD.THEN THOR SPOKE UP POINTING OUT THAT THE
VALKYRIES DEALT WITH MORTALS ALL THE TIME.NOT ONLY WERE THE VALKYRIES
EXCELLENT WARRIORS BUT THEIR JOB WAS CONDUCTING THOSE MORTALS WHO HAD DIED
IN THE BATTLE TO THE HALLS OF VALHALLA.WHILE THE VALKYRIES DIDN'T NORMALLY
COLLECT SUCH SOULS DIRECTLY FROM THE MORTAL'S WORLD BUT RATHER FROM THE
HALF-WORLD OF THE NEWLY DEAD,SOME EXPERIENCE WAS PROBABLY BETTER THAN
NONE.ODIN HAD TO CONCEDE AND A YOUNG VALKYRIE NAMED URSHA VOLUNTEERED TO
ACCOMPANY HEIMDALL ON HIS QUEST.SHORTLY THEREAFTER,THOR,HEIMDALL AND URSHA
JOURNEYED TO THE EDGE OF ASGARD AND HEIMDALL RETURNED ONCE MORE TO THE LAND
OF MIDGARD.ONLY THIS TIME HE WAS NOT ALONE...

                     OF MAGIC, MANA, RUNES AND RO'GELDS.

A LONG TIME PAST THE WORLDS WERE CREATED USING MAGIC.EVEN NOW.MAGIC IS THE
VERY ROOT OF EXISTENCE OF MANY THINGS.AS EACH WORLD WAS CREATED,THE
POWERFUL MAGICAL ENERGY (MANA) USED IN THAT CREATION,COALESCED INTO A
PHYSICAL FORM.A RO'GELD.EACH WORLD HAS IT'S OWN RO'GELD THAT LEAKS OUT
MANA,KEEPING THE WORLD RUNNING.THE RO'GELD IS THEREFORE THE SOURCE OF ALL
MAGIC FOR A WORLD AND THE CLOSER YOU ARE TO IT THE MORE POWERFUL MAGIC
BECOMES AND THE EASIER SO IT IS TO MANIPULATE.BEING CLOSE TO A RO'GELD IS
OFTEN NO EASY FEAT TO MANAGE.IF SUCH POWERFUL OBJECTS WERE SIMPLY LEFT
LYING AROUND WHERE ANYONE COULD GET AT THEM THEN THE UNIVERSE WOULD
PROBABLY HAVE ENDED A LONG TIME AGO.SO OVER THE AGES EACH RO'GELD HAS
EITHER DEVELOPED OR BEEN GIVEN IT'S OWN SET OF DEFENCES.SOME ARE SIMPLY
DISGUISED,SOME ARE PROTECTED BY ALL MANNER OF DEADLY DEVICES AND SOME ARE
SIMPLY DIFFICULT TO GET AT BUT ALL HAVE SOME FORM OF DEFENCE.

MANIPULATING MAGIC IS EASY - IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THE GODS.(IN WHICH
CASE,YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THIS!)MORTALS HOWEVER,CANNOT GRASP THE WHOLE
POWER OF MAGIC AT ONCE,IT IS TOO MUCH FOR THEM.THROUGH GENERATIONS OF
ARCANE STUDY THOUGH,THEY HAVE DEVELOPED THE RUNES AS A WAY OF HARNESSING
THE SIMPLE ELEMENTS OF MAGIC WHILE BEING PROTECTED FROM IT'S RAW POWER.EACH
RUNE SYMBOLISES A SINGLE THREAD OF THE OVERALL NATURE OF MAGIC.WHEN
PROPERLY INSCRIBED ON SOMETHING THE RUNE HARNESSES THE POWER OF THAT
PARTICULAR THREAD OF MAGIC AND,WHEN USED BY SOMEONE IN SKILLED IN
RUNELORE,CAN CHANNEL MANA THROUGH THAT PERSON TO PRODUCE A MAGICAL
EFFECT.COMBINING RUNES COMBINES DIFFERENT PROPERTIES OF MAGIC AND HENCE
DIFFERENT SPELLS ARE FORMED.

BUT BE WARNED! EACH PERSON HAS A TOLERANCE FOR THE AMOUNT OF MANA THEY CAN
HANDLE AND MAGIC CAN BE DANGEROUS TO THE UNSKILLED.NOT DANGEROUS IN AN
ACTIVE SENCE (FOR MAGIC IS NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL AND HAS NO WILL OR
PURPOSE,IT SIMPLY IS)BUT SHOULD A USER OF MAGIC OVERREACH THEMSELVES.USE
UNWISE COMBINATIONS OF RUNES,OR SIMPLY LACK THE RUNELORE TO CONTROL A
PARTICULAR SPELL THEN THAT SPELL MAY WELL BACKFIRE AND THEN ANYTHING COULD
HAPPEN.AT THE VERY LEAST THE SPELL CASTER WILL HAVE A HANGOVER THAT THOR
HIMSELF WOULD WINCE AT! SOMETIMES,ALL THE RUNELORE IN THE WORLD IS TO NO
AVAIL AND A SPELL WILL SIMPLY GO AWAY.FORTUNATELY,SUCH INCIDENTS ARE
RARE.MOST ACCIDENTS ARE CAUSED BY THE MAGICIANS THEMSELVES AND ACT AS A
SORT OF NATURAL SELECTION FOR THE MAGICALLY TALENTED.

THE WISE MAGICIAN PRACTICES THE MAGIC THEY KNOW.IN PREFERENCE THEY DO SO
NEAR TO A RO'GELD WHERE IT IS EASIER TO CONTROL AND TAKE LESS EFFORT.IN
GENERAL,THE MORE MANA A SPELL REQUIRES,THE MORE RUNELORE YOU WILL NEED TO
KNOW TO STAND A GOOD CHANCE OF CASTING IT SUCCESSFULLY.HOWEVER.THE SAYING
'RATHER A HANGOVER THAN FACE A HAKRAT'HAS IT'S OWN WISDOM.IT HAS BEEN KNOWN
FOR A MAGICIAN WITH THE BAD LUCK TO CATCH A HAKRAT SWORD IN THE RIBS TO
HAVE THE GOOD LUCK TO SURVIVE CASTING A HEALING SPELL THAT THEY THOUGHT
BEYOND THEIR SKILL.
