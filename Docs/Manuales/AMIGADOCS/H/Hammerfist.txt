HAMMERFIST INSTRUCTIONS

GAMEPLAY

The year is 2215 A.D holograms are indstingiushable from humans.  People are
selected for their special skills and then transformed into holograms to
commit murder, political crimes, or whatever their master `Centro-Holographix'
orders them to do.  In between missions, the holograms are stored in
personality computers, or mind prisons.  However, the computer storing two
of the most powerful holograms ever created, HAMMERFIST and METALISIS, has
malfunctioned, sending the two deadly assassins on one final mission - to
destroy Centro-Holographix.

You control HAMMERFIST and METALISIS on their mission.  You must smash the
security systems to gain access to later levels, kill the technicians and 
droids who try to stop you and collect the energy and weapon energy fizzles
which they leave behind.  Also, `plug into' the recharge points to top up on
energy in order that you might defeat the `Octosquab', the giant ant and the
multitude of aliens, both holographic and solid, which the master will send
out to stop you.


HINTS AND TIPS

Choice Of Character

You must change between which character you control, depending on the current
situation.  Use HAMMERFIST when lots of repetitive aliens are on screen. 
Use METALISIS to reach higher levels of the screen, ledges and table-tops.

Weapons

When no weapon is selected, HAMMERFIST uses an ordinary punch.  However,
provided that the weapon is sufficiently charged, you can use either 
lasers - Long Range, more effective than punching but unable to open doors,
or piston fist - Short Range, useful as a shield or for breaking down
obstacles and doors.  Also, METALISIS' flic-flac can be used as an
aggresive manoeuvre as well as for rapid advancing and retreating.

Flic-Flacs

There are two types of flic-flac which both have their seperate uses.
The low flic-flac is obtained by holding down the fire button and pushing
the joystick up and releasing.  However, if joystick is held in the `up'
position, METALISIS will perform a high flic-flac which is vital for reaching
higher portions of the screen.

Security Systems/Doors

Most doors are armed with a security system controlled by the master's
computer.  This system must be breached to enable the doors to be opened.

Energy

Each character has their own energy level.  These levels are reduced when
the character is hit be an alien or their weapon and increased by collecting
energy fizzles or by using recharge points built into the background.

Icons

Destruction of opponents and obstacles release energy fizzles which form into
various icons.  Picking these up recharges the character and their weapon.
If an opponent is killed ineffiectively it will leave a question mark.  These
need to be punched/lasered to turn them into an effective icon.

The Master

The power of the Master of Centro-Holographix will be present throughout
the game.  It gains strength from uncollected icons.  Once his energy bar has
risen to full, all energy fizzles dropped will be negative icons.  If these
icons are collected, your energy level will drop, as will his, if you do
not collect them.
