GAME DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hagar is essentially made up of the following parts; selection menu,
assignment, level and score (in that order). At the start of the 
game Hagar is equipped with a sword, a few additional weapons and
three lives. All in all, the game consists of a total of eight levels.
The whole game is controlled using the joystick. The password from the
table (see pages 12 and 13) is asked after the first level.

Objective of the game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The objective of the game is to successfully complete the eight levels 
one after another. To achieve this, it is necessary to survive and to 
fulfill the tasks which have been assigned by Helga to Hagar.

The Selection Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following the title picture a map appears showing eight islands. Each 
island represents one level. The game starts on the island which lies
at 9 o'clock. It is the only island where no password is needed. When 
the menu is started, the cursor is always positioned on the island,
which represents the level currently in play. The joystick is used to 
make a selection. To do this you move the indicator (sword) to an 
island and press the fire button. When a level has been successfully 
completed, the player receives the password for the next island.
The levels follow on from the first on in a clockwise direction on the 
map. Levels which have already been successfully completed, are 
depicted on the map as destroyed islands. Should you still select one
of these islands an appropriate message will appear.

The Assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before Hagar goes to a particular level, he is given an assignment by Helga.
The assignment is to collect the objects shown by Helga at that level.
The objects cannot be bought in the shop.

The Level
~~~~~~~~~
In addition to the play levelm, the level also has a shop and a tavern.
These can be reached from the play area through doors and can be exited
at the same point back into the play level. The game is made up of
8 levels, in each of which there are one or more shops or taverns. Before
you can leave a given level, the final opponent must be defeated, he is 
also reached from the play level through a door.

The Play Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following the selection menu and the assignment, Hagar finds himself in 
the level, or more precisely in the play level. When he is in this
level he can move in all directions moving as far vertically an
horizontally as the limits permit. Here Hagar can now defeat opponents,
collect objects, use doors or eat the provisions he has taken along
with him. Pay special attention to water, as long as it reaches no 
further than up to Hagars chest, he can run in it (albeit at a reduced 
speed); however, if it gets any deeper Hagar cannot Swim!

Opponents and Weapons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to defeat his opponents at the play level and the final 
opponent, Hagar hass his sword which he uses against his opponent
by pressing the fire button. By keeping the fire button pressed he
turns the sword into a super sword which posesses a greater force.
This state is shown by the reddening of the sword which is visible
in the lower status line. In addition to a sword,  Hagars basic 
equipment also includes a few special weapons which can be used
at once and which are operated using the function keys. He can
buy replacements for the additional weapons later in the shop.
On the play level the weapons are activated using the following 
function keys:

- F6 : Knife
- F7 : Spear
- F8 : Axe
- F9 : Fireball
- F10: Magic Potion (Smart Bomb).

The objects
~~~~~~~~~~~
The objects are divided into those which are important for completing
Helgas assigment, and those which serve only to enrich. The objects
mentioned in the assignment have to be found, otherwise the level is
regarded as not having been completed. The key is a special object; the
doors can only be used after it has been found. The player receives
money (profit) for each object collected. Things can be bought in the
shop or the tavern with this money. This does not include the 
objects mentioned in the assignment. 

The doors
~~~~~~~~~
The doors can only be used with the key. You can enter them by
pulling back the joystick. A distinction is made between doors 
which lead to other doors (Secret passsages), doors to a shop
or tavern and the door to the final opponent. The doors to the 
shop and tavern are marked accordingly.

The Tavern
~~~~~~~~~~
Hagar can get sustainance in the tavern. There is a book in the
status line. Its pages can be turned by moving the joystick to 
the left or right. The selection is made by pressing the fire
button. There is a choice of turkey and beer and a game of dice.
The beer increases hagars life energy. The same holds true for the
Turkey, in addition to which you get a parcel which can be eaten on 
the play level by using F5 and which also brings life energy. You 
can increase (or decrease) you wealth with the aid of a game of 
dice. The winnings are as follows based on a stake of 100:

 Double      : Your stake is doubled.
 1 Joker     : You keep your stake.
 2 Joker     : Your stake is quadrupled.
 None of them: You lose your stake.

You leave the tavern via the "end" page by pressing the fire button.

The Shop
~~~~~~~~
In the shop Hagar can acquire additional weapons and extra lives. The
selection hook is controlled moving it to the right or left. The
selection is made by pulling the joystick back. You use the fire button 
to exit the shop.

The End of the Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The scoring for the game is in two parts. Firstly, on the basis of
whether or not the assignment has been completed, and secondly, on 
the basis of how the remainder of the game proceeds. Here a 
distinction has to be made depending on whether or not Hagar is still
alive. If he is, he recieves the password for the next level; if not, the
list of top scorers appears. If Hagar is still alive but has not 
completed Helgas assignment and returns home after defeating the final
opponent, the level has, unfortunately, to be repeated.
