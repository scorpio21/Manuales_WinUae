    TO THE BALL IS HIGHLIGHTED.WHILE A PLAYER IS HIGHLIGHTED,

    DIRECTION OF THE ARROWS.  (TIP: WAIT A SECOND UNTIL YOU KNOW

    FIELDING COMMANDS.

ESSENTIALLY, HARDBALL II BREAKS DOWN THE ACTS OF PITCHING, HITTING, CATCHING, 
THROWING, AND RUNNING BASES INTO STEPS WHICH ARE USUALLY MORE SIMULTANEOUS THAN 
SUCCESSIVE.  THE FOLLOWING GIVES YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS.  

BEFORE A PITCH CAN BE THROWN, THESE THINGS CAN (AND SOMETIMES MUST) HAPPEN:

    * THE PITCHER SELECTS A PITCH.
    * THE BATTER SELECTS A TYPE OF SWING.
    * IF THERE'S A RUNNER ON BASE, THE BATTER CAN DECIDE TO TAKE LEAD OFF.BUT 
    HE MUST DECIDE BEFORE THE PITCHER AIMS HIS PITCH.  A MENU WILL APPEAR IN 
    THE BATTING TEAM'S SCREEN WHEN THE LEAD/STEAL OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE.
    * THE PITCHER SELECTS WHERE IN THE STRIKE ZONE GRID TO AIM HIS PITCH. (AT 
    WHICH TIME, THE BATTER HAD BETTER BE READY.  AS SOON AS THE PITCHER 
    SELECTS HIS AIM, THE BALL WILL BE THROWN.)
    * THE PITCHER HAS ABOUT ONE FULL SECOND TO PICK THE RUNNER OFF BASE BEFORE 
    PITCH IS THROWN.
    * TO PICK SOMEBODY OFF: AS SOON AS YOU HAVE PRESSED ENTER, AS THOUGH YOU 
    WERE MAKING A NORMAL PITCH, PRESS AND HOLD THE BASE KEY AND ENTER.  THE 
    PITCH IS INTERRUPTED AND THE SCREEN WILL CUT TO A VIEW OF THE BASE 
    INVOLVED IN THE PLAY.

AFTER A PITCH IS THROWN, THESE THINGS CAN ( AND SOMETIMES MUST) HAPPEN:

    * THE BATTER CHOOSES TO SWING OR NOT TO SWING, AND IN WHAT AREA OF THE 
    STRIKE ZONE.
    * IF THE BATTER CONNECTS, HE RUNS AUTOMATICALLY TO FIRST.
    * RUNNERS MUST BE DIRECTED TO TAKE OTHER BASES THAN FIRST, UNLESS THEY ARE 
    FORCED TO PROCEED BY OTHER RUNNERS.(THEY AUTOMATICALLY TAG UP WHEN A POP 
    FLY IS CAUGHT.)
    * FIELDERS MUST BE DIRECTED TO CATCH THE BALL AND RELAY IT TO THE PROPER 
    TEAMMATE. (A PLAY IS NOT DEAD, BY THE WAY, UNTIL THE BALL IS FIRMLY 
    ENTRENCHED IN THE PITCHERS GLOVE WHEN HE'S ON THE MOUND.)

CHAPTER 2

FIELDER BACK TO SHUT DOWN TRIPLES.

BOSTON - RIGHT HANDED BATTERS OFTEN HAVE HOME RUNS THWARTED BY THE JOLLY GREEN 
GIANT WALL IN LEFT FIELD.  LEFT HANDERS HAVE IT MUCH EASIER DOWN THE RIGHT 
FIELD LINE.

KANSAS CITY - OK, THE ARTIFICIAL TURF ADDS SPEED TO A GROUNDER - BUT WHAT A 
GREAT WATERFALL.

CHICAGO - WITH IT'S BRICK AND VINES, THESE FRIENDLY CONFINES REPRESENT THE 
EPITOME OF A CLASSIC BALL PARK.

NEW YORK - IT'S BIG, IT'S BAD, IT'S OUTFIELD IS ALIVE WITH THE GHOSTLY GREATS 
OF ITS PIN-STRIPED PAST.  

SAN FRANCISCO - WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE FROSTY AND UNPREDICTABLE, TO SAY THE 
LEAST.  SUDDEN GUSTS CAN TURN THAT TRIPLE INTO A HOME RUN - OR A DOUBLE.

TORONTO - UNDISPUTED STATE OF THE ART IN STADIUM TECHNOLOGY, BUT THE RUG CAN 
ADD YARDS TO A MESSED CATCH.

    START WARMUP
    PITCHERS IN HARDBALL II GROW TIRED AFTER PITCHING A GIVEN NUMBER OF 
    INNINGS (THE NUMBER IS LISTED IN THEIR STATS).  WHEN FATIGUE STARTS TO 
    HAMPER A PITCHER'S PERFORMANCE, YOU'D BETTER BRING IN SOME RELIEF.

    START WARMUP (CONT)
    A RELIEVER, HOWEVER, NEEDS AT LEAST ONE INNING TO WARM UP (IF HE'S 
    COLD, HIS ACCURACY SUFFERS), SO PLAN AHEAD.  BUT DON'T OVERHEAT HIM 
    EITHER, OR HE COULD BE TIRED AND INACCURATE BEFORE HE HITS THE MOUND.

    1    HIGHLIGHT START WARMUP AND PRESS ENTER.(A LIST OF AVAILABLE 
    FIREMEN FROM YOUR ROSTER NOW APPEARS.)

    2    USE THE UP AND DOWN KEYS TO SCROLL THROUGH THE LIST.

    WHEN YOU NEED A STOPPER AND THERE'S ONE READY AND WARMED UP IN THE 
    BULLPEN:

    1    HIGHLIGHT SUBSTITUTE PITCHER AND PRESS ENTER.  (THE STIFF IS NOW 
    IN THE SHOWERS, AND THE NEW GUY IS OUT THERE IN THE MOUND, 
    FINGERING THE ROSIN BAG.)


    INFIELD
    AH, STRATEGY.  HERE'S WHERE YOU CAN PROVE YOU CAN MAKE IT IN THE SHOW, OR 
    THAT YOUR MANAGERIAL ACUMEN IS STRICTLY DOUBLE A.TO ALIGN YOU INFIELDERS 
    ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION AT HAND:

    1    HIGHLIGHT INFIELD TO OPEN THE INFIELD SUB-MENU; THEN PRESS THE RIGHT 
    ARROW KEY TO MOVE INTO THE INFIELD SUB--MENU.

    APPEARS BESIDE THE SELECTED DEFENSIVE POSITIONING.

    CUSTOM AND SET CUSTOM
    IF NONE OF THE PRE-SET DEFENSIVE POSITIONS SUIT YOUR MANAGERIAL TASTE, 
    YOU CAN PLACE YOUR INFIELDERS JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE YOU WANT WITH THIS 
    CUSTOMIZING FEATURE.

    1    HIGHLIGHT SET CUSTOM AND PRESS ENTER TO SEE A FULL FIELD VIEW OF 
    YOUR TEAM.

    2    PRESS THE UP ARROW KEY TO HIGHLIGHT THE 1ST BASEMAN'S JERSEY.

    3    PRESS AND HOLD THE ENTER KEY TO MOVE THE HIGHLIGHTED PLAYER.  WITH 
    ENTER DEPRESSED, USE THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE THE PLAYER AROUND THE 
    INFIELD.

    CUSTOM AND SET CUSTOM (CONT)
    8    TO SELECT YOUR CUSTOM INFIELD AFTER YOU'VE CREATED ONE, OPEN YOUR 
    INFIELD MENU, HIGHLIGHT CUSTOM AND PRESS ENTER.  PRESTO IT IS DONE.

    OUTFIELD
    THE METHOD OF CHANGING THE DEFENSIVE POSITIONS OF YOUR OUTFIELDERS IS 
    EXACTLY THE SAME AS SHIFTING YOUR INFIELDERS.  ONLY THE STRATEGY IS 
    DIFFERENT.  BECAUSE OUTFIELD SIZES AND SHAPES VARY FROM PARK TO PARK, YOU 
    SHOULD PROBABLY CREATE A CUSTOM POSITION WHENEVER YOU START A NEW GAME.

    1    HIGHLIGHT OUTFIELD TO OPEN THE OUTFIELD SUB-MENU THEN PRESS THE RIGHT 
    ARROW KEY TO MOVE INTO THE SUB-MENU.

    2    HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS AND PRESS ENTER.  (A CHECK

    NOTHING IS MORE SATISFYING THAN TO THWART A BATTER'S STRENGTH WITH A 
    GOOD OLD-FASHIONED OUTFIELDER SHIFT.  ALSO, REMEMBER THAT THE OUTFIELD 
    IS DEEPER THAN IT APPEARS ON THE SCREEN, SO YOU MAY WANT YOU MEN A 
    LITTLE FURTHER BACK THAN YOU FIRST EXPECT.

    (YOUR OUTFIELDERS WILL BE RESET TO THEIR DEFAULT LOCATIONS.)

    8    TO SELECT YOUR CUSTOM OUTFIELD AFTER YOU'VE CREATED ONE, OPEN YOUR 
    OUTFIELD MENU, HIGHLIGHT CUSTOM AND PRESS ENTER.  ABRACADABRA, IT 
    IS DONE.


CHAPTER 4:
  HOW TO USE THE TEAM EDITOR

IF YOU HIGHLIGHT TEAM EDITOR ON THE MAIN MENU AND PRESS ENTER, YOU JOURNEY TO 
THE OFFICIAL HARDBALL II TEAM EDITOR SCREEN.  FROM HERE YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN 
TEAMS FROM SCRATCH OR MODIFY EXISTING ONES.


I  HOW TO CREATE OR CHANGE NAMES

USE THE UP AND DOWN ARROW KEYS TO MOVE FROM LINE TO LINE, THEN:

    1    TYPE IN THE NAME OF YOUR TEAM (UP TO 25 CHARACTERS, INCLUDING SPACES) 
    AND PRESS ENTER.

    2    TYPE IN THE NAME OF YOUR MANAGER (UP TO 25 CHARACTERS, INCLUDING 
    SPACES) AND PRESS ENTER.

    3    TYPE IN THE NAMES OF YOUR PLAYERS (UP TO 16 CHARACTERS, INCLUDING 
    SPACES) AND PRESS ENTER.YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 30 PLAYERS PER TEAM IN 
    THIS LEAGUE.

    *    THE FIRST NINE PLAYERS LISTED COMPRISE YOUR STARTING LINEUP: 
    EVERYBODY ELSE IS SUBSTITUTE FODDER.

    *    USE THE UP AND DOWN KEYS TO MOVE THE HIGHLIGHTER FROM PLAYER TO 
    PLAYER, AND TO SCROLL OTHER NAMES ONTO THE SCREEN.

    *    PRESS THE PAGEUP KEY TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE 
    LIST; PRESS PAGEDOWN TO LEAP TOWARDS THE BOTTOM.


II  HOW TO CREATE OR CHANGE PLAYER STATS

IN-DEPTH STATS, AS WELL AS SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES, ARE RECORDED BY CATEGORY FOR EACH
PLAYER IN THE TEAM EDITOR.  THERE ARE 41 CATEGORIES, THE FIRST 22 OF WHICH 
PERTAIN TO ALL POSITION PLAYERS (INCLUDING PITCHERS), AND 19 OF WHICH PERTAIN TO
PITCHERS ONLY.

    1    PRESS ESC TO CLOSE THE EDITOR MENU IF IT'S OPEN.

    2    HIGHLIGHT A PLAYER'S NAME, THEN PRESS THE RIGHT ARROW KEY TO HIGHLIGHT 
    THE FIRST STATISTICAL CATEGORY FOR THAT PLAYER.

    *    THE FULL NAME OF THE ABBREVIATED STAT OR ATTRIBUTE THAT IS 
    HIGHLIGHTED APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.

    *    ONLY FOUR CATEGORIES APPEAR ON THE SCREEN AT A TIME: USE YOUR 
    RIGHT OR LEFT ARROW KEYS TO MAKE MORE APPEAR.

    *    PLAYERS NAMES AND POSITIONS ARE ALWAYS DISPLAYED.

    *    PRESS THE HOME KEY (MOST KEYBOARDS) TO JUMP TO THE FIRST 
    STATISTICAL CATEGORY AND PRESS THE END KEY TO GO TO THE LAST.

    3    TO CHANGE A CURRENT STAT OR ATTRIBUTE, TYPE IN THE NEW INFORMATION; TO 
    KEEP THE EXISTING DATA, USE THE RIGHT OR LEFT ARROW KEYS TO MOVE ON TO 
    THE NEXT CHOICE.

    *    IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO MOVE RIGHT ACROSS THE SCREEN AND ENTER ALL 
    THE INFORMATION FOR ONE PLAYER AND THEN MOVE DOWN TO ENTER THE 
    NEXT PLAYER'S INFORMATION.

    *    IF YOU ENTER ILLOGICAL INFORMATION - I.E. DATA SAYS A GUY HAS HIT 
    12 HOMERS BUT HE'S ONLY BEEN UP ONCE - YOU ARE PROMPTED TO MAKE 
    CORRECTIONS BEFORE YOU CAN CONTINUE.

    4    BE SURE TO USE THE TEAM EDITOR'S MENU TO SAVE YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE YOU 
    RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU (FOR DETAILS, SEE THE APPENDIX).


IIIWHY WORRY ABOUT STATS AND ATTRIBUTES?

EVERY PLAYER HAS CERTAIN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.  ONE MIGHT BE A STRONG 
HITTER, BUT A LOUSY FIELDER.ONE MAY HAVE THE BEST CURVE IN THE GAME, BUT HE 
TIRES EARLY.  STATISTICS MEASURE THESE QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCES SO THAT MANAGERS 
AND FANS CAN PREDICT PLAYER PERFORMANCE WITH RELATIVE ACCURACY.

A GOOD MANAGER (I.E. ONE WHO WINS A LOT) HAS TO SKILLFULLY MANIPULATE PLAYERS IN
HUNDREDS, MAYBE THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.  THE GOAL IS TO HAVE PLAYERS 
ON THE FIELD IN ANY GIVEN SITUATION WHO WILL HAVE THE BEST ODDS OF SUCCESS.  AND
THOSE ODDS ARE BASED ON THE INFORMATION YOU ENTER INTO THE TEAM EDITOR.

THAT INFORMATION IS DIVIDED INTO TWO TYPES: ATTRIBUTES AND STATISTICS.

IV  ATTRIBUTES
    SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T FIND IN A BOX SCORE, BUT ARE STILL VITAL TO A PLAYER'S
    SUCCESS OR FAILURE.AROUND THE BIGS, THEY'RE CALLED ATTRIBUTES.

    THESE ATTRIBUTES REFER TO EVERYBODY:

    TEAM NAME
    TYPE IN UP TO 25 CHARACTERS.

    MANAGERS NAME
    TYPE IN UP TO 25 CHARACTERS.

    PLAYER NAMES
    TYPE IN UP TO 16 CHARACTERS.

    PLAYING POSITION (POS)
    SEE GLOSSARY FOR A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF EACH OF THE NINE POSITIONS.

    THROWING ARM (THR)
    THE CHOICES ARE EITHER THROWS LEFT (L) OR THROWS RIGHT (R).

    BATTING SIDE (BAT)
    THE CHOICES ARE EITHER THROWS LEFT (L) OR THROWS RIGHT (R) OR A SWITCH 
    HITTER (S)

    RUNNING SPEED (RS)
    ZERO MEANS THAT A PLAYER IS RUNNING WITH A FEW BRICKS IN HIS PANTS; SIX 
    MEANS HE'S A CHEETAH.  A GOOD WAY TO DETERMINE A REALISTIC RUNNING SPEED FOR
    A PLAYER IS TO CHECK HIS STOLEN BASE STATS, ESPECIALLY HOW MANY TIMES HE'S 
    BEEN CAUGHT STEALING.  OR DECIDE FOR YOURSELF IF SOMEBODY'S A TWO OR A SIX!


    THREE ATTRIBUTES REFER ONLY TO PITCHERS:

    NON FATIGUE INNINGS (NFI)
    AFTER A PITCHER HAS PLAYED THE NUMBER OF INNINGS LISTED IN THIS CATEGORY, HE
    STARTS TO BECOME TIRED.  THE CHANGE IS GRADUAL, BUT WITH EACH ADDITIONAL 
    INNING HE BECOMES LESS ACCURATE (OR DOWNRIGHT) WILD).  IF HE PITCHES FOUR OR
    FIVE INNINGS BEYOND HIS NFI RATING, HE WILL ALMOST NEVER THROW WHERE HE'S 
    AIMING.

    A REALISTIC SETTING FOR A VERY STRONG STARTER WOULD BE 3 OR 4 NFI.  THEN 
    PLAN TO BRING IN A RELIEF PITCHER ABOUT THE 6TH OR 7TH INNING.  OR, FORGET 
    ABOUT PACING, AND CREATE AN IRONMAN WITH AN NFI OF 10 AND TAKE HIM RIGHT ON 
    IN TO EXTRA INNINGS.

    PITCHING SPEED (PS)
    ONE MEANS A PITCHER'S FIREBALLING DAYS ARE OVER; TEN MEANS HE THROWS BULLETS

    BALL CONTROL (BC)
    ONE MEANS BATTERS SHOULD WEAR CAST IRON HELMETS; TEN MEANS THE GUY IS A 
    MASTER OF NEAR-PERFECT CONTROL.


V  STATISTICS

    YOU CAN'T JUST TOSS NUMBERS INTO THE STATISTICAL CATEGORIES IF YOU WANT YOUR
    GAMES TO BE REALISTIC.  THERE'S A BIT OF SCIENCE TO IT, SO WE RECOMMEND THAT
    YOU USE YOUR NEWSPAPER SPORTS PAGE, A BASEBALL ALMANAC, OR EVEN BASEBALL 
    CARDS AR A REFERENCE TOOL.  (THE TEAM EDITOR WILL STOP YOU AND ASK QUESTIONS
    IF YOU ENTER STATISTICS THAT CONTRADICT EACH OTHER.)

    YOU DO NOT NEED TO ENTER EVERY STAT YOURSELF.  HARDBALL II HELPS YOU WHERE 
    IT CAN BY CALCULATION SOME ENTRIES FROM OTHER INFORMATION YOU SUPPLY.THESE 
    ARE FILLED IN AUTOMATICALLY AS SOON AS YOU ENTER THE NUMBERS NEEDED TO RUN 
    THE CALCULATION.  (FOR COMPLETE DEFINITIONS OF ALL STATS USED IN THE TEAM 
    EDITOR, SEE THE GLOSSARY.)

    YOU CANNOT ENTER SOME INFORMATION.HARDBALL II AUTOMATICALLY PERFORMS THESE 
    CALCULATIONS FOR YOU: BATTING AVERAGE (BA), SLUGGING PERCENTAGE (SLG).  ON 
    BASE PERCENTAGE (OB), SINGLES (1B), AND TOTAL BASES (TB).


VI  THE TEAM EDITOR OPTIONS

    PRESS ESC FROM THE TEAM EDITOR SCREEN AND SIX OPTIONS APPEAR.  PRESS IT 
    AGAIN TO CLOSE THE MENU.WITH THESE SIX OPTIONS, YOU CAN DO JUST ABOUT 
    ANYTHING WITH YOUR TEAMS EXCEPT SELL THEM.

    LOAD
    WHEN YOU WANT TO BRING AN EXISTING TEAM INTO THE EDITOR FOR CHANGES:

    1    HIGHLIGHT LOAD AND PRESS ENTER.

    *    A PARTIAL LIST APPEARS OF THE TEAMS AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT DRIVE 
    AND DIRECTORY.

    *    SCROLL THROUGH THE LIST OF TEAMS WITH THE UP AND DOWN ARROW KEYS.

    LOAD (CONT)
    *    LOAD TEAMS FROM OTHER DISKS BY CHANGING THE PATH STATEMENT. (SEE 
    APPENDIX FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGING PATHS.)

    2    HIGHLIGHT THE NAME OF THE TEAM YOU WANT TO CHANGE AND PRESS ENTER.  
    (YOU ARE REUNITED WITH THE TEAM EDITOR, YOUR SELECTED TEAM IN PLACE AND 
    READY FOR MODIFICATIONS.)

    3    A TEAM INVOLVED IN LEAGUE PLAY CANNOT BE LOADED INTO THE TEAM EDITOR.
    THIS IS TO INSURE THAT MID-SEASON IMPROVEMENTS IN YOUR PLAYERS' 
    STATISTICS AND ATTRIBUTES OCCUR ONLY ON THE FIELD AND NOT IN THE 
    FRONT-OFFICE COMPUTER.  (HOWEVER, IF YOU DESPERATELY NEED TO "MODIFY" A 
    LEAGUE TEAM, SEE HOW TO CANCEL A LEAGUE.)

    SAVE
    AFTER YOU CREATE OR CHANGE A TEAM, YOU NEED TO SAVE THE INFORMATION.  TEAMS 
    CAN BE STORED IN A HARD DISK DIRECTORY OR ON SEPARATE FLOPPY DISKS.  TEAM 
    DISKS, BY THE WAY, WORK WITH OTHER COPIES OF HARDBALL II, SO YOU CAN TAKE 
    YOUR BEST SQUAD WITH YOU TO AWAY GAMES.

    1    HIGHLIGHT SAVE AND PRESS ENTER.  (YOU ARE ASKED FOR THE PATH THE 
    COMPUTER SHOULD USE TO STORE THE NEW INFORMATION.)

    2    PRESS ENTER IF YOU WANT TO USE THE DEFAULT PATH (THE LOCATION AND ROUTE
    THAT THE COMPUTER USES TO SAVE PRE-EXISTING TEAMS).  IF YOU WANT TO 
    CHANGE THE PATH, SEE THE APPENDIX.

    DELETE
    IF A TEAM'S PLAY REALLY STARTS TO STINK UP THE PLACE, AND YOU BEGIN TO 
    QUESTION ITS RIGHT TO EXIST:

    1    HIGHLIGHT DELETE AND PRESS ENTER.  (A LIST OF PURGEABLE TEAMS APPEARS.)

    2    HIGHLIGHT THE NAME OF THE TEAM YOU WOULD LIKE TO ERASE AND PRESS ENTER.

    *    CAUTION:  IF YOU PRESS ENTER, ALL RECORDS OF THAT TEAM ARE 
    PERMANENTLY ERASED.PROCEED ONLY WITH FULL CONSCIOUSNESS AND A 
    DETERMINED WILL.

    CLEAR
    THIS OPTION CLEARS ALL ENTRIES ON THE TEAM EDITOR SCREEN.  WHY?  SO THAT IF 
    YOU'RE CREATING ONE TEAM AFTER ANOTHER, YOU CAN SAVE ONE, CLEAR THE DECKS, 
    AND CREATE ANOTHER.

    1    HIGHLIGHT CLEAR AND PRESS ENTER.  IF YOU HAVEN'T SAVED THAT SCREEN'S 
    CREATIONS OR CHANGES, YOU ARE ASKED IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THEM BEFORE THE 
    INFORMATION IS CLEARED.  (SEE THE SAVE IN THIS SECTION FOR MARE 
    INFORMATION.)

    COMPRESS
    FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO TIDY ROSTER:

    1    HIGHLIGHT COMPRESS AND PRESS ENTER.  THIS MOVES ALL EMPTY PLAYER SLOTS 
    TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST.

    EXIT
    WHEN YOU'RE READY TO RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU AFTER CREATING VARIOUS AND 
    SUNDRY DREAM TEAMS:

    1    HIGHLIGHT EXIT AND PRESS ENTER.

    SECOND IS SECOND, AND SO ON.  EACH TEAM GETS ONE PICK IN EACH ROUND OF THE 
    DRAFT.

    1    TO DRAFT A PLAYER, SCROLL THROUGH THE LIST OF POOLED PLAYERS.  WHEN YOU

MOST OF US WERE NOT BORN WITH AN INNATE ABILITY TO HIT A FAST BALL OR CATCH 
FUNGOES.BUT SOMEHOW THE AMERICAN PASTIME INSINUATES ITSELF INTO OUR 
MUSCULATURE SO THAT AT THE VERY LEAST WE CAN STILL HIT AND CATCH A SOFTBALL 
WHEN OUR WAISTLINE IS BIGGER THAN OUR INSEAM.

WELL, HARDBALL II WORKS THE SAME WAY.  JUST DO IT, BABY.  THE MORE YOU PLAY, 
THE MORE COMFORTABLE YOU BECOME WITH THE CONTROLS.  THE MORE COMFORTABLE YOU 
ARE, THE MORE YOU CAN DELVE INTO STRATEGY.  HERE'S SOME TIPS ON HOW TO MAKE THE 
MECHANICS OF HARDBALL II SECOND NATURE.

I BATTING

    1.   THE HIGHER THE PLAYER'S BATTING AVERAGE, THE EASIER IT IS TO HIT THE 
    BALL.  IF YOU'RE BATTING .000, HITTING THE BALL CAN BE A HERCULEAN 
    TASK, BUT IF YOU'RE APPROACHING 1.000 IT'S MUCH EASIER.

    2.   THE FASTER THE PITCH, OBVIOUSLY, THE HARDER IT IS TO HIT THE BALL.  IF 
    YOU'RE SWINGING LATE AGAINST A REAL FIRE BURNER, THAT'S ONLY NATURAL.
    WORK ON YOUR REACTION TIME AND YOU'LL IMPROVE WITH PRACTICE.

    3.   THE KEY TO HITTING IS RESPONDING TO THE PITCHER'S STRATEGY.

    *    IF EVERY PITCH COMES RIGHT DOWN THE PIPE, MAKING CONTACT IS A 
    CINCH. PITCHERS, HOWEVER, THROW A VARIETY OF PITCHES AIMED ALL 
    OVER THE STRIKE ZONE.  SO, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE A ROOKIE, YOU 
    NEED TO KOW WHAT THE PITCHER IS THROWING.

    *    ON THE LIVELS OF PLAY SCREEN, MAKE SURE THAT YOU CHOOSE TO LEAVE 
    THE PITCHER MENUS ON SCREEN.  THAT WAY YOU CAN WATCH THE PITCHER'S 
    SELECTIONS UNTILL YOU BECOME MORE ATTUNED TO THE STRIKE ZONE.  
    LATER ON, THE MENUS CAN BE TURNED OTT TO MADE BATTING MORE 
    CHALLENGING.


II FIELDING

    1.   THE NUMBER OF ERRORS IN A PLAYER'S STATISTICS AFFECTS HOW WELL HE 
    THROWS AND CATCHES THE BALL.

    2.   DON'T ASSUME A BALL THROWN WILL BE CAUGHT WHEN ERRORS ARE A 
    POSSIBILITY. BE PREPARED TO CHASE OVERTHROWS.

    3.   TO HELP YOU REMEMBER THE THROWING COMMANDS, THINK OF THE KEYPAD AS A 
    BASEBALL DIAMOND AND PRESS THE KEY THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE BASE YOU'RE 
    THROWING TO.

    4.   SINCE A PLAY DOESN'T END UNTIL THE BALL IS RETURNED TO THE PITCHER, 
    PRACTICE THROWING THE BALL AROUND THE HORN TO GET A FEEL FOR TH 
    CONTROLS.

    5.   WHEN A BALL IS HIT, THE COMPUTER AUTOMATICALLY SELECTS THE FIELDER THAT
    YOU CAN CONTROL (BASED ON WHICH FIELDER IS CLOSEST TO THE BALL).

    *    TO CHANGE THE FIELDER THAT YOU CONTROL, RELEASE ALL CONTROLS, AND 
    THE COMPUTER WILL RESELECT A NEW PLAYER.
    *    LET THE COMPUTER DO ITS JOB.  IF YOU PRESS THE CONTROLS TOO SOON, 
    YOU'LL FIND THAT THE PITCHER WILL BE CHASING BALLS INTO THE 
    OUTFIELD. NOT A GOOD DEFENSIVE STRATEGY.


III PLAY A PRACTICE GAME

    1.   ON THE MAIN MENU, SELECT THE SANDLOT SWINGERS TO BE BOTH HOME AND 
    VISITOR TEAMS.THIS TEAM HAS BEEN PRE-SET TO GIVE A BEGINNER A GOOD, 
    FRUSTRATION FREE GAME.

    2.   TO PLAY THE SWINGERS V. SWINGERS:

    *    SELECT PLAY NEW GAME ON THE MAIN MENU.
    *    SET THE HOME TEAM'S CONTROLS TO COMPUTER. SET THE VISITOR TEAMS TO 
    WHATEVER CONTROL DEVICE YOU WOULD LIKE TO USE.
    *    SELECT BATTER'S VIEW FROM THE VIEW MENU.
    *    SELECT PLAY BALL FROM THE GAME MENU.

    3.   TO GET THE MOST BATTING PRACTICE IN THIS GAME, BAT ALL THE TIME.

    *    AS VISITOR, YOU BAT FIRST.  WHEN THE COMPUTER IS UP, CALL A 
    TIMEOUT AND GO TO THE MANAGER'S SCREEN.
    *    SWITCH CONTROLS FOR THE HOME AND VISITOR TEAMS SO THAT WHEN YOU GO 
    BACK TO THE FIELD, YOU'RE AT BAT AGAIN.
    *    SWITCH CONTROLS EVERY TIME THE TEAMS CHANGE SIDES.

   THE APPENDIX


  ALL ABOUT PATHS

A PATH (NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH A BASE PATH) IS THE LOGISTICAL INFORMATION THAT 
COMPUTER USES TO SAVE DATA OR TO RETRIEVE STORED DATA.  IN HARDBALLII, PATH 
LINES (OR STATEMENTS) NORMALLY COME INTO USE WHEN YOU ARE MANIPULATING TEAMS 
WITHIN THE TEAM EDITOR AND LEAGUE PLAY MENUS.  A PATH ENABLES YOU, FOR EXAMPLE, 
TO SAVE AND LOAD TEMAMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN STORED ON YOUR HADBALL II GAME DISKS.

I. HOW TO USE THE DEFAULT PATH

TO STORE ALL LEAGUE AND TEAM INFORMATION ON THE HARDBALL II DISKS, JUST PRESS 
ENTER WHENEVER YOU ARE ASKED WHICH PATH YOU WANT TO USE.  TH DEFAULT PATH IS 
THE STATEMENT THAT APPEARS WHEN YOU FIRST BOOT YOUR COMPUTER.

II. HOW TO CHANGE THE PATH

TO STORE OR LOAD TEAMS THAT OAR NOT ON THE HARDBALL II GAME DISKS, YOU MUST 
CHANGE THE PATH STATEMENT TO INDICATE THE DIFFERENT LOCATION.  ONCE YOU CHANGE 
A PATH STATEMENT, THE NEW STATEMENT BECOMES THE DEFAULT PATH UNTIL YOU EXIT TO 
DOS OR CHANGE THE PATH AGAIN.

    1.   HIGHLIGHT THE PATH STATEMENT LINE ON THE SCREEN.

    2.   USE THE BACKSPACE KEY TO ERASE THE OLD PATH INFORMATION.

    3.   TYPE IN THE NAME OF THE DRIVE YOU ARE USING TO STORE OR RETRIEVE 
    INFORMATION; AND IF NECESSARY (SAY THE DATA IS LOCATED IN A HARD DRIVE 
    SUB-DIRECTORY), TYPE IN THE NAME OF THE LOCATION YOU ARE USING TO STORE 
    OR RETRIEVE INFORMATION WITHIN THE DRIVE.

    *    USE NORMAL DOS SYNTAX TO SPECIFY THE DRIVE AND DIRECTORY.
    *    IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY , INSERT THE INFORMATION DISK IN THE 
    DESIGNATED DRIVE. (IF YOU ARE USING A HARD DRIVE, THERE OF COURSE 
    WILL NOT BE A DISK ).
