Introduction
------------

When the McCallisters decided to go on vacation, they forgot one very
important thing... Kevin!

Now you can play eight-year-old Kevin, trying to foil the break-in of
those inept burglars, Harry and Marv.  In the first phase of the game,
you rush throughout your gigantic home creating traps and pitfalls.
From the attic to the basement, the tree house, big brother Buzz's
cluttered bedroom and the dozens of rooms in between, you'll find
innumerable household items to aid in your defense.  Armed with 
imagination and a BB-Gun, you can create a wealth of clever contraptions,
but time is limited.  Will you be ready for the Wet Bandit Gang?

Soon, Harry and Marv come bumbling in for a hilarious chase as you try
to lure them into your snares and ploys.  Will they succeed in catching
you or can you hold out until Mom arrives in this playful quest to 
protect your home... ALONE.

Slapstick humor, comic twists and infinite variations of play, turn
Home Alone -- The Family Comedy Without The Family -- into exciting
computer action for the entire clan.

When you get near an object that you can pick up, it will begin 
flashing.  Press the F1 key to pick up this object.  If an object
is located too high for Kevin to reach, press the 0 key on the 
numeric keypad to make him jump, and then press F1 while he is in the
air.  If Kevin tries to pick up more than 3 objects, a warning will
appear.  Press SPACE to continue.

When you have objects in your inventory, press the F2 key to select 
which objects will be used for a trap.  the selected object will
highlight.

As Kevin runs around the house, possible trap locations for the
currently selected trap will be shown.  When Kevin is close to a
location, the word HERE will appear.  Press the F3 key to place
an object at that trap site.  The currently highlighted trap will be
placed.

Trap locations in the middle of a room and above Kevin's head must be 
shot with the BB gun to work.  You need to have the BB gun in your   
inventory to do this and the burglar must be directly under the trap.
To fire the BB-Gun in Phase II, press the ENTER key.

If you are ready for burglars before 9:00, you may press N to go to the
next phase.  Phase I will automatically expire at 9:00.  Kevin's
location in the house will be the same at the start of Phase II as it
was at the close of Phase I.

Phase II

The burglars will enter the house and try to catch you.  You must avoid
the burglars, and at the same time lure them through the traps.  You
must be careful not to trip the traps yourself.  Kevin must jump over
any traps that are on the floor.

The traps will inflict varying amounts of damage on the burglars.  Harry
and Marv will not always trip the traps.  They are more likely to trip
traps if they are near Kevin and chasing him.  

The amount of damage that each burglar has sustained is shown under his
name.  Each tick mark represents 5 points of damage.  You must inflict
50 points of damage on each of the burglars.  If one of the burglars 
catches you, you lose the game.

|Page 6|

The boxes on the top of the screen allow you to keep an eye on the 
burglars.  If the burglars are not in the same room as you, they will 
appear in these boxes.  You can see what happens to them as they trip 
traps in other rooms.

As a last resort, Kevin can shoot the burglars with his BB-Gun.  The
first time that he shoots a burglar, it will inflict 5 points of
damage.  Each time after that will not cause any damage, but will slow
the burglar down for a few seconds.

F2 key will show names of traps still available.

F3 key will tell where the available traps are located.

High Scores

The game saves the ten highest scores of all time.  If you have one of
these scores when you finish the game, you will be asked to input your
initials to be added to the high score screen.  Scores are determined
by the amount of damage done to Harry and Marv.  If two players have
both defeated the burglars, the one that one in the least amount of
time will be ranked first.  Otherwise, if two players have the same
number of damage points, the one that played the longest before getting
caught will be ranked first.
