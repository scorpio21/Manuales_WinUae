I. Backgroung & History
	
	It is now more than three hundred years since the Cataclysm when
the wrath of the gods descended upon Krynn. With the only  dirrect access
portal denied her, the Queen of Darkness spreads her power across the land
by awakening the evil dragons and creating the Draconians. Once in control
of Krynn, she will be free to force entry to the world. Only the
"Companions of The Lance" (they aren't 'Heroes' until they succeed) can
stop her final victory. Should they fail, the Queen of Darkness will be
free to come through from the Abyss into the world and darkness will cover
Krynn for all eternity as she and her Draconians will ontrol the largest,
most evil empire ever created.

	The only threat to her awesome power is the possibility of a
revival of the worship of the old  gods. In the years since the Cataclysm,
the inhabitants of Krynn have lost their belief in the gods. Before
opposition to Takhisis can be united, you must restore faith in the old
gods by recovering the Disks of Mashakal from the ruins of Xak Tsaroth. Use
of their knowledge will bring True Healing back to Krynn and restore faith
in the old gods, allowing them to intervene in the fate of their
worshipers. More importantly, it allows them to confront the Queen of
Darkness directly and restore the balance between Good, Evil and
Neutrality.

	This might relic is the only hope for Krynn and you must aid the
Companions in their quest to retrieve the Disks. Unfortunately, the Disks
aren't just lying in the ruins but are actively guarded by Khisanth, an
ancient, huge, black dragon, served by Draconians who have enslaved the
local Aghar (gully dwarves).

A. The DRAGONLANCE Saga

	The world of Krynn resulted from players who wanted more dragons.
The basic plot which became the basis of the entire DRAGONLANCE game
universe was put together by the TSR design staff. These concepts were then
brought to life by the TSR artists to produce teh DRAGONLANCE saga -- a
rich, diverse, gaming universe with awsome dragons and questing
adventurers. From this beginning came an entire world and its history, the
place now known to gamers as Krynn. Until now, occupation of Krynn has been
limited to the imagination of the readers of the DRAGONLANCE novels and
players of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS role playing game. How3ever,
things have changed.

	The Heroes of the Lance game gives you the chance to take part in
the quest of the 'Companions of The Lance' as they begin their fight to
save Krynn from domination by Takhisis, the Queen of Darkness. Find
yourslef in the thick of the action as you control the characters in their
life-or-death struggle against the forces of evil. Can you retrieve the
Disks of Mishakal from the lari of Khisanth, deep in the ruins of Xak
Tsaroth? Before you can even reach the lair, the companions must defeat
Draconian hordes in hand-to-hand combat and deal with powerful magic,
monstrous spiders, skeletal undead, and many more terrors that lurk amidst
the rubble of once beautiful city.

	For those familiar with the AD&D game, this is not a role-playing
game but an Action game. the computer is used to keep all of the usual 'to
hit', 'damaga inflicted,' 'saving throw,' etc., dice rolls behind the scenes
so that you can concentrate on the action on screen. You won't see the
numbers, allowing you to concentrate on what is actually visible - the
Draconian charging forward waving a sword. Can you see any traps while the
detect spell lasts or is that a potion bottle in the corner?

B. The ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Game

	Some of you may not have encountered role-playing games (RPGs)
before. Although this isn't an RPG, it is based around the concepts of what
is probably the most widely played system - the AD&D game from TSR.

	Instead of being a passive reader or observer as in a novel or
play, RPG players control one of more characters within the story. You take
an active role in determining the course of events within a game, during
which the characters (if they survive) will learn and become more
experienced, thus equipping them to deal with tougher challenges. The
players have an opportunity to interact not only with the game but also
with each other. The game is open-ended and, when one scenario has been
completed, the characters can continue to another and another...

	A 'Dungeon (or Game) Master' directs each game by controlling the
entire action within the game apart from the players' characters. This
person is responsible for describing the charaters' environment,
controlling all the monsters and traps, and dealing with combat resolution,
treasure and anything else which may occur. Many people enjoy being Dungeon
Master as much as running a character in another person's scenario.

	The Heroes of the Lance game is described to hide the dice-rolling
and table-referenceing from the player and allow him/her to concentrate on
the action as the computer takes on the mechanics of the game. But, of
course, it doesn't allow players to interact with each other in the way the
AD&D game does.

II. The Action Starts...

	Despite the various encounters with Draconians while approaching
Xak Tssaroth, the Companions are finally standing within the Great Temple
of Mishakal before the statue of the goddess. As Goldmoon, carying the Blue
Crystal Staff, approaches the statue, it animates and speaks to you:

	"...Krynn is about to face its greatest test...You must return the
truth and power of the true gods to men. It is time to restore the balance.

	"To gain the power, you shall need the truth of the gods. Far below
this temple lie the Disks of Mishakal: circular plates of platimum that are
all you need to call upon my power. You must recover these disks.

	"Your way will not be easy. The disks now lie in the lair of the
dragon. Therefore, I charge your staff: if you present it boldly, never
wavering, then you shall prevail..."

	You will find the Heroes ready to start their explorations of the
ruins of Xak Tsaroth. You must be ready for anything as Draconians aren't
the worst thing you may meet. Good luck - the fate of Krynn is in your
hands.

A. Preparing for Play

	Copying your Disks - Before beginning to play the game, you MUST
make a copy of your game disks. Set aside the original disks and play off
the copies. The original disks do not have any physical copy protection on
them. ST users will have to use a special format command, contained on Disk
C. Insert that disk and start your system. Double click on FORMAT.TOS and
follow the prompts on the screen. Because all versions will periodically
write to disk, you should not write protect your copies.

	Saving the Game - Before beginning to play, you will also need to
format a blank disk to use as a saved game disk. You can save your game
during play by selecting SAVE from the Main Menu and then following the
screen prompts. These prompts will instruct you to insert the formatted
disk at the proper time.

	Copy Protection - After you load the game but before any action
starts, you will be asked a question. This question can be answered by
referring to the rulebook. Enter the correct answer to the question and you
will be able to proceed.

	Contrast - Due to the wide variety of monitors available, some
adjustments may be necessary to the contrast and brightness controls of
your monitor in order to get the best picture.

B. Loading The Game

	AMIGA - Plug your joystick into Port 2. Turn on your system and
boot with Kickstart 1.2 or greater (either built in as ROM or by disk,
depending on model number). When the computer asks for the Workbench disk,
insert Disk A into your disk drive. The game will auto-boot and load into
the computer. Follow the screen prompts which will tell you when to swap
Disk A for Disk B and vice versa.

	ATARI ST - Plug your joystick into the second joystick port. Insert
Disk A into your disk drive. Turn on the computer. The game will load and
run automatically. Follow the screen prompts which will tell you when to
swap disks. Heroes of the Lance can be played from a hard disk provided
your machine has at least 1 megabyte of RAM. Copy all of the files over to
the hard disk, and then remove the EXEC.PRG file from the AUTO folder.
Double click on EXEC.PRG and the game will begin.

	COMMODORE 64/128 Disk - Plug your joystick into Port 2. Turn on
your disk drive and then your computer. With the C128, hold down the
Commodore Key as yyou turn the computer on to put it into C64 move. Insert
Disk A into the disk drive with the label side facing up. Type LOAD "*",8,1
and press RETURN. The game will load and run automatically. Follow the
screen prompts which will tell you when to swap disks.

	IBM PC and Compatibles - Start your computer with DOS 2.0 or
greater. If you don't see the A prompt (A>) type A: and press ENTER.
Remove the DOS disk and insert Disk A into your A disk drive. If playing
for the first time or if you wish to change a previous set-up, type
HINSTALL, and press ENTER. You will then be given a range of choices
allowing you to customize the game for your machine. These cover graphics
mode, control (IBM joystick or keypad) and hard disk installation. when you
are staisfied with your selections and accept them, they will be written to
disk. After this installation and in the future just type START and press
ENTER. Follow the screen prompts. You do not need to use INSTALL again
unless you wish to change your current set-up.

C. IBM Version Differences
	The IBM PC and Compatibles version can be played using either a
joystick or the numeric keypad. If you play with the joystick, follow the
general joystick directions given. If you play using the numeric keypad you
will control your character using the numbers on the keypad and the letters on
the keyboard. Read the rules so as to understand how the commands work. A
section at the end of the rules details the keyboard commands which you should
read throughly before beginning to play.

III. Playing the Game

	This game has been designed to give you the feel of adventuring in the
world of Krynn, a strange and dangerous place full of monsters and treasure.
There are many things you can do during the course of the game, from movement
and fighting to casting magic and collecting potions.

	To enable you to engage in all of these things, we have set up methods
to control everything  as simply as possible. Movement and physical combat are
entirely controlled from the joystick (or keypad on the IBM PC and
compatibles), and everything else is dezalt with by a mixture of Icon and Menu
selection.

	These methods have been designed to minimize interference in the flow
of the game by never requiring you to let go of the joystick during the course
of play. While playing, simply pressing the space bar will bring up the Main
Menu and pause the game as you make your selection, and then restart when you
quit the menus. The easiest way to get to the menus is press the space bar with
the side of your hand as you hold the joystick. The menus can be accessed at
any time during the game.

	The two methods of controlling actions are:

1. Joystick (and fire button) for movement. Close Combat (sword, staff, etc.),
and Ranged Combat (bow and arrows, spears etc.). Close Combat is possible when
a character and monster approach each other within a quarter of the screen
width.

2. Menu selection is for spell choice, character selection, picking objects up,
etc., and you can use it at any time by pressing the space bar to activate the
Main Menu. Use the Joystick to select an option which will either give you
further choices from a sub-menu or carry out the specified action.

A. Movement 

All movement on the screen is controlled by the joystick as shown here,
including movement towards or away from the player - into or out from the
screen. Moving the joystick in the various directions will move your
character accordingly (e.g., if you are walking left at normal speed and you
move the joystick to the upper right diagonal then your character turns
around and starts running at double speed).

The IN (joystick pushed forward) and the OUT (joystick pulled back)
directions are active only at certain times. Whenever a corridor crosses or
joins the corridor you are in, the compass direction that your character can
travel down that corridor is highlighted. You will notice that if you choose
to do down a cross-corridor, the compass direction will change. The screen
always shows your character moving left and right.


                      LEFT        IN         RIGHT
             Double Speed  \       |       /  Double Speed
                            +-------------+
           (Fire Button) ---+-O           |
                            |             |
               LEFT --------|      0      |-------- RIGHT
         Normal Movement    |             |  Normal Movement
                            |             |
                            +-------------+
                                   |
                                  OUT

                                JOYSTICK

	On the other hand, the compass is always oriented to maintain the same
absolute direction, just as a real compass. As an example, if your character
were to be traveling along an East-West corridor, the compass would show North
as being up. If the character then entered a corridor that went North, the
compass would change. North would then be on the right of the compass since
that is the direction the character is facing. This is not as complicated as it
sounds and is easily mastered when you play the game.

	Pressing the Fire Button will cause one of two options to be available,
depending on whether your character is running or stationary when the button is
actually pressed:

	STATIONARY - Pressing and holding the fire button puts the character
into one of two combat modes. The character will enter Ranged Combat mode if
the character is more than a quarter of a screen width from the monster. If
within this distance, the character will enter Close Combat mode. You will see
the word "COMBAT" displayed below the compass when your character comes within
the quarter screen width.

	RUNNING - Pressing the fire button while you are running causes the
character to JUMP in the direction of movement. This allows the character to
pass over certain types of obstacles.

B. Ranged Combat/Dodge

	This mode is used for two purposes: dodging and using a ranged weapon
(on that fires over a distance such as a bow and arrows or throwing axe). It
can only be used by a stationary character and requires pressing the fire
button to begin operating.

	With the fire button depressed, moving the joystick in the appropriate
direction will cause your character to perform the indicated action. The
character's weapon is automatically selected when you move the joystick into a
firing position. For the bows and the sling, you must first select the USE
command from the Main Menu and choose either a pouch or a quiver before the
ranged weapon can be used. The joystick positions to aim a ranged weapon are
reversed depending on which way the character is facing. As long as the
joystick is held in position, the weapon will continue to fire until it runs
out of ammunition or until a monster moves within Close Combat range. If you
push the joystick into a firing position and release it, the weapon will only
fire once.

	Fire CENTER lets you shoot parallel to the ground at about shoulder
height and is the most likely choice to use when firing at monsters. Fire LOW
and Fire HIGH allow your character to fire below or above the center line.

	DODGE allows the character to take avoiding action from an attack and
is also available in Close Combat.

	All Ranged Combat selections are cancelled, changing to Close Combat,
if the player's character and a monster move within the 1/4 screen distance. At
the same time, the character's weapon changes to the Close Combat weapon.

C. Close Combat

	The computer allows you to enter Close Combat mode whenever a monster
and a character move within one quarter of a screen of each other. You will see
the word COMBAT below the compass when you enter Close Combat mode. To enter
this mode, keep the fire button depressed. This mode stays in force until one
of the combatants is dead, they move away from each other until separated by
more than a quarter of the screen, or you release the fire button.

	When in Close Combat mode, joystick moves change to those pictured
below and the character automatically uses his or her Close Combat weapon. In
this mode, the player selects the indicated combat moves for close (melee)
fighting by moving the joystick in the relevant direction.

	The terminology used applies to sword fighting, but the physical moves
apply equally to whatever weapon the character is using whether sword, staff,
axe, etc.

	MOVE BACKWARDS means that your character keeps the current facing and
walks backwards. The character will back up (still holding his or her weapon),
moving to the edge of the screen or until reaching an impassable barrier. If
this allows the character to move beyond the combat trigger threshold (quarter
screen), movement reverts to normal joystick mode.

	DODGE is available and the character behaves the same as in Ranged
Combat, with the ability to avoid things.

	You can still make selections from the menu if required and the
computer will pause the game, making the necessary combat adjustments while any
changes and selections are made. The menus allow you to change the lead
character.

D. Screen Displays

	There are two main screen displays used during the course of game play:
STANDARD SCREEN (Character and Monster Action Window) and MAIN MENU.

1. STANDARD SCREEN - The main section of the screen shows the actual view of
the area being explored with a double row of character icons along the
right-bottom of the screen, and a compass indicating viewpoint and exits. Next
to each character, that character's Hit Point status is shown as a vertical
bar. Pressing the space bar brings up the second display - the Main Menu.

2. MAIN MENU - The main section is overlaid with a scroll of selections, with
the top selection highlighted and the lower section of the screen continuing to
hold the sam information. Selection is either by moving the highlight with the
joystick or the Up/Down cursor keys. When the required selection has been made,
pressing the fire button or the Return/Enter key (Insert on the ST) will
activate the selection. An error message is displayed if you attempt a
selection that is not available.

	There is a third type of screen: The animation sequence. Return to
normal game action by pressing the space bar.

	Choosing the Main Menu can also be used as a pause during gameplay
should you require a short break and not wish to quit the game.

E. Menus & Sub-Menus

1. Hero Select - showing Status screen:

	The order in which the characters appear on the screen has an effect on
play. The top left character is first in the party, and is the active
character. The character immediately to the right of that character is second,
and so on. The bottom right character is the last one. The icon of the first
character will appear on the screen and represents the entire party. Spells can
only be cast if the character casting the spell is one of the first four.
Characters in the bottom row cannot cast spells. The active character will
suffer the most damage in combat, but all of the top 4 characters may suffer
some damage.

	You can change the order of the characters in your party by selecting
Hero Select from the Main Menu. When you have done this, a white box will
appear around the active character. You can use the joystick or the cursor keys
to move this box over one of the characters that you want to move to a
different position. When the box is over the desired character, press the fire
button or hit the Return/Enter key (Insert on the ST). You will then get a
second white box. Move this white box over the character you wish the first
character to switch positions with. Once again hit the Return/Enter key (Insert
on the ST) or press the fire button. The characters will switch positions. If
you wish to change the order of more than one pair of characters, re-select
this option for each swap you wish to perform.

	Should Goldmoon's hit points fall to a low level, and she is the active
character, Riverwind will switch positions with her in order to protect her.
Once she is revitalized, she can once again assume the lead.

2. Magic User/The Staff of Magius Spells:

	The number in parentheses (brackets) is the number of charges used per
spell when Raistlin uses the staff of Magius. This staff holds up to 100
charges. Using scrolls and potions does not take charges. Wands use these
charges.

	Charm - each use takes 1 charge. (1)
	Sleep - uses 1 charge. (1)
	Magic Missile - each use takes 1 charge. (1)
	Web - entangles an opponent for a limited amount of time. (2)
	Detect Magic - shows location of magic items. (1)
	Detect Invisible - shows location of anything invisible. (2)
	Final Strike - destroys staff and causes intense damage when it explodes;
               provides option to cancel in case selected by mistake.
               (uses all remaining charges)
	Burning Hands - each use takes 1 charge. (1)
	Exit - return to Main Menu.

3. Clerical Staff Spells:

	This selects one of two sub-menus depending on who is using the staff.
Only Goldmoon can use the staff unless she is incapacitated or dead. In that
case Riverwind, Caramon, or Sturm can use it at a reduced capacity.

	The number in parentheses is the number of charges used per spell when
using the clerical staff. This staff holds 200 charges, but will absorb energy
if attacked by energy-using monsters.

	When you select Clerical Staff Spells, a different sub-menu is
displayed depending on whether Goldmoon is alive and conscious or one of the
other characters is controlling the staff.

3a. Clerical Staff Spells (for Goldmoon):

	Cure Light Wounds - heals minor damage to a character. (1)
	Protection From Evil - helps you against evil opponents. (1)
	Find Traps - indicates the location of a trap. (2)
	Hold Person - stops a monster in its tracks (most of the time). (2)
	Spiritual Hammer - just like a warhammer but no hands. (2)
	Prayer - a little extra help from above. (3)
	Cure Critical Wounds - more powerful healing. (5)
	Raise Dead - raises dead characters whose bodies are available. (5)
	Deflect Dragon Breath - very useful if you meet a dragon. (10)
	Exit - return to main menu.

3b. Clerical Staff Spells for Riverwind, Caramon, and Sturm:

	Cure Light Wounds - heals minor wounds to a character. (1)
	Find Traps - indicates the location of a trap. (2)
	Cure Critical Wounds - more powerful healing. (5)
	Deflect Dragon Breath - very useful if you meet a dragon. (10)

4. USE:

	This displays a list of the active character's possessions with the
exception of his/her initial equipment (i.e., personal weapons and items worn).
It includes anything acquired during the course of play such as potions,
scrolls, rings, etc. Any weapons in excess of the two usable by the character
listed here. Excess weapons can't be used by the character, although they will
contribute towards experience points total at the end of the game. A
character's carry limit is affected by quivers of arrows and pouches of
bullets.

5. TAKE:

	This command applies to the currently occupied area and lists any items
that can be readily picked up as well as any magic or invisible items that have
been found. Due to the limited number of items that any one character can
carry, it may be necessary to select a different character to pick up an item
or have the current character drop or give away an item first. Note that a
dropped item will appear under this command when it is reselected. 

	Should this list include one of the staffs (due to the death of
Raistlin or Goldmoon), there are restrictions on picking them up and using
them:

	The Staff of Magius - Nobody can pick it up apart from Raistlin, as
they are all of the wrong alignment and will take damage if they attempt it.

	Blue Crystal Staff - Apart from Goldmoon, Riverwind, Caramon, and
Sturm, anybody else will take damage from this clerical staff. Only Goldmoon
can use the staff unless she is dead or incapacitated, in which case one of the
others may use the staff.

6. GIVE:

	This lists all the items owned by the lead character which can be
transferred to another character. It does not include personal weapons or (for
Goldmoon and Raistlin) the staffs, but does include items such as potions,
arrows, etc.

	To GIVE an item, choose it on this sub-menu and press the fire button
to initiate the transfer. The highlight will then appear on the character
icons. Move it to the character you wish to receive the item and press the fire
button to complete the transfer. A character's carry limit can not be exceeded
by this procedure and the game will not allow the transfer to be completed. If
you attempt it, you will return to the start of the give menu.

7. DROP:

	Drops shows all of a character's possessions which can be dropped to
the floor. As with the other sub-menus, this option does not list personal
weapons (including Raistlin's and Goldmoon's Staffs).

8. SAVE:

	Choosing SAVE allows you to save a game for completion at a later date.
Before you perform this operation, you must have a formatted disk as mentioned
earlier. Once SAVE is selected follow the prompts provided to complete the save
procedure.

9. RESTORE:

	Use of this selection allows you to restart a previously saved game at
any time. If you are already playing a game, it will be cancelled and replaced
by the saved game which you reload. If you select it by mistake, you have the
option to return to the Main Menu before any damage is done. If you proceed
then you will be asked for the disk containing the saved game and prompted as
to the correct procedure.

10. SCORE:

	You can view your accumulated experience points during the play by
choosing this option. The number shown as a total is a summary of all points
accumulated by characters that are still alive. The number of monsters killed
is a running total of all monsters of a given type killed to that point in the
game.

11. EXIT MENU:

	This selection provides the means of returning to the main game display
and continuing the game.

F. WINNING THE GAME

	You accumulate experience points during the play of the game. You get
experience points for killing monsters, for gathering treasures, or for
surviving to the end of the game. The current total score for the party can be
viewed at any time from the Main Menu. Detailed scores (character by character
as well as total) are provided at the end of a game. At this time, scores are
listed for each character, and two party scores are given. One score is the
total number of points of all surviving characters, and the second is the total
of all characters, whether dead or alive at the end. These scores allow you to
compare games as well as giving you a numerical value as a measure of success
in any one game.

G. IBM PC & COMPATIBLES VERSIONS:
USING THE KEYBOARD
	
	Introduction - As mentioned earlier in the rules, the IBM PC and
Compatibles version can also be played using the numeric keypad and the

IV. CHARACTERS

TANIS:
~~~~~
	Orphaned by the death of his elven mother, Tanthalas, better knows by
the shorter, human form of his name as Tanis, was raised amongst the elves.
However, as a half-human, Tanis always felt somewhat of an outcast. Finally
driven by his restless nature, he left the Qualinesti and headed for Solace and
the only 'outsider' known to him, his friend Flint. By the time he became
involved with the Companions - othern than Goldmoon and Riverwind - he had
become an experienced helf-elven fighter wandering the world of Krynn in search
of True Healing and clerics. A natural leader, he has known, travelled with and
fought beside the Companions for many years. Although none of them knew it at
the time of their meeting became the start of their joint quest and the
formation of the Companions of The Lance.

	His travels through an unsettled world, combined with his early
training amongst the Qualinesti elves, have turned him into a master swordsman.
Equipped with his elven blade, there are few fighters skilled enough to match
him in combat. Of course, an enemy has to reach him first because his natural
skill, augmented by plenty of practice with the bow, will usually stop all but
the most deermined opposition before it comes within reach of his sword arm.

CARAMON MAJERE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The twin brother of Raistlin, Caramon can be considered a complete
opposite to his brother. From early childhood Caramon made himself the
protector of his weaker brother, rescuing him time and time again from bullying
tormentors. His training as a warrior while a young child, was started by his
sister, Kitara, who later became a Dragon HighLord in the service of Takhisis.
Inseparable from his brother, except when Raistlin was being schooled in the
magic arts, Caramon lived all his life in Solace. Here he met Sturm, but it
wasn't until their father's death that the twins met up with Tasslehoff and,
through this meeting, another of Solace's long-time inhabitants, Flint
Fireforge. This was the start of the friendships which led to the formation of
the Companions of the Lance.

	Although a well-trained warrior by this time, Caramon was relatively
inexperienced in combat and it was his travels with his newly acquired friends
(later to include Tanis) that turned him into a seasoned warrior. Travelling
the country with Raistlin was always an exciting adventure. One of his
brother's greatest joys was exposing false clerics as fraudulent charlatans
making money at the expense of the sick and helpless. Usually, rather than
being grateful, the people would turn on the twins who often only escaped
serious harm as a result of Caramon's increasing martial skills. It took a long
time for them to realize that people don'[t like being shown as fools even for
their own good. After some years of travel with Flint both on trading
expeditions and on their own, they all met up again at the Inn in Solace on
that fateful night where they met Riverwind and Goldmoon. The rest is history,
as they say, and in this adventure, the conclusion is up to you.

RAISTLIN MAJERE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	So weak when he was born that he wasn't expected to live, Raistlin
survived his childhood through his sister's efforts and through the
protection of his twin brother. Just before their fifth birthday, they were
taken to the fair where a conjurer was performing tricks and illusions.
Caramon watched for a while then wandered off, but his brother stayed all
day and that evening astonished his family by reproducing every trick he'd
seen performed.

	Shortly after his sixth birthday, the family took Raistlin to a
Master Mage who, although at first not overly impressed by the boy, took
him as a pupil after he was found in the mage's library reading a
spellbook, thought to be impossible without years of study. Never popular
and often bored, his studies continued despite his contempt for both fellow
students and instructors. This period reinforced Caramon's protective
attitudes towards his brother, providing the root for Raistlin's general
dislike of humanity at large, together with a dep and lasting sympathy for
the weak.

	During this period, Raistlin supplemented the family's income by
public performances of illusions and tricks, which often brought him into
open conflict with his school. One of these public disagreements led to the
twins meeting Tasslehoff and subsequently, Flint.

	Raistlin was destined to become the youngest mage to take (and
pass) the Test which confirmed his future power and gained him his Staff,
while leaving him a physical wreck.

STURM BRIGHTBLADE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The son of one of the remaining true Knights of Solamnia, Strum was
sent south with his mother for safety when his father could no longer
guarantee the security of their home. His father was to have sent for them
when things calmed down - he never did. At this time, the Knights were
looked down upon by the general population of Krynn as they were unjustly
blamed for failing in their duties and not stopping the Cataclysm.

	Conscious of his father's position and duties, Strum dedicated his
life to the Knighthood and became a well-trained but inexperienced fighter
by the time he met Caramon. Drawn together by their mutual martial
interests, they quickly became fast friends and for Caramon's sake he even
somewhat befriended Raistlin. He holds the high ideals of his father and
the Knights despite the difficulty of maintaining them in the current state
of the world.

	His rescue of Raistlin's Master's pouch caused their first meeting
with Tasslehoff and their subsequent fellowship with Flint and Tanis. Flint
taught Strum and Caramon the wilderness survival skills that were to save
their lives many times in the future. Their journeys with Flint over the
next few years formed them into the formidable group of adventurers who now
bear the survival of Krynn upon their shoulders. Finally, in the year 346,
with Flint's retirement, the companions went their separate ways. Strum
went to Solamnia to search for his heritage but they all agreed to meet at
the Inn of the Last Home in five years' time. Having gained his inheritance
by this time, Strum was equipped as a Knight of Solamnia, and this meeting
marked the start of the quest when they rescued Goldmoon and Riverwind.

GOLDMOON, CHIEFTAIN'S DAUGHTER:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Daughter of the chieftain of the Que-Shu tribe, Goldmoon's future
was mapped out from birth as whoever she married would become chieftain of
the tribe. Unknown to everyone, the gods had different plans for her. The
first inklings that none of this would come to pass came when she fell in
love with Riverwind rather than the supposed best warrior of the suitable
young men.

	When Riverwind returned from his quest to prove himself eligible
for Goldmoon, things really changed. The Staff that he returned with didn't
appear to do anything and her father condemned him to death. As the rest of
the tribe started to stone him to death, Goldmmon threw herself into his
arms as she realized that she couldn't live without him. Suddenly the Staff
flared with a brilliant blue light and they found themselves standing miles
away from the village with all their injuries healed. Rejected by their
tribe and realizing that the Staff was something special, they decided to
go to Solace and ask the Seekers for their help in discovering the Staff's
true nature. The Seekers were the nearest thing to clerics in Solace but
were also indirectly acting for Takhisis to recover the Staff.

	Before Goldmoon and Riverwind could hand the Staff over, they
became involved in a fight at the inn and were rescued by the other
Companions. So begins the story of the Heroes of The Lance which leads to
your task among the ruins of Xak Tsaroth.

EQUIPMENT:

RIVERWIND:
~~~~~~~~~~
	Born into a family of virtual tribal outcasts, there was no one in
the Que-Shy with a lower social position. Riverwind's family refused to
believe in the divinity of the tribal chieftain and were the last believers
in the old gods. Tolerated for his skills, Riverwind would probably have
been left alone to live his life were it not for his love for Goldmoon,
which led him to ask her father for permission to marry her.

	Her father gave him a task to prove his suitability for this
marriage. He ordered Riverwind to search for proof that the old gods still
existed and not to return without a powerful magic item to convince the
tribe. In reality, her father never expected to see him again. As the
months passed, it seemed as though his wishes would be fulfilled but
Goldmoon never gave up hope and her faith was eventually rewarded.

	The Riverwind that returned wasn't the same man that left. He was
harder, changed by things he had seen and unable to remember exactly where
he had been or what he had done. Later, when the Companions had formed and
made their way to Xak Tsaroth, he realized that the ruined city was the
place from which he had retrieved the Staff. in his hand he carried a blue
crystal staff but when asked to demonstrate its powers, he was unable to do
so. The chieftain mocked him, called him a liar and ordered the tribe to
stone him to death. When Goldmoon joined him in the hail of stones, the
Staff flared with blue light and teleported both of them out of the tribal
village.

TASSELHOFF BURRFOOT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Most people not only don't understand Kender but don't want to know
them. Past of the problem arises from their basic personality traits:
fearlessness, unbelievable curiosity, irresistible mobility, independence,
and the need to pick up anything not screwed down (unless they have a
screwdriver in which case....). The usual reaction to the sight of a Kender
is to lock everything up and check your pockets. Although fully justified,
this attitude is somewhat unfair because they do not see themselves as
thieves. They do not steal for profit but out of their intense curiosity
about everything. even when caught 'in the act' they will offer an amazing
range of excuses from: "You dropped it," "It probably fell in my pocket,"
to "I thought you didn't want it," and "I was just looking after it in case
it got stolen." As far as they are concerned, it is only "borrowing" and
they regard being called a thief a grave insult.

	Apart from their size, Kender would be easily recognized by the
number of pockets and pouches that festoon their clothing and their favored
weapon, the hoopak. Used exclusively by them, it is a combination of staff
(shod in iron) and a slingshot, giving Kender a lethally potent weapon.
Tasslehoff met Flint through the normal actions of a Kender - absolute
amazement at being accused of stealing a bracelet as he walked off with it
from Flint's stall. Tanis arrived to calm the situation and it wasn't long
before they were fast friends. Tass was later responsible for the meeting
with Caramon, Raistlin, and Strum.

FLINT FIREFORGE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Born and bred a hill dwarf and raised in poverty, Flint left home
as soon as he was capable of earning a living. As the years passed and his
skills as a metalsmith grew, his improved fortunes led him to buy a small
house in Solace, which became his base.

	From here, he traveled widwly due to the great demand for his
skills. As his fame spread, samples of his work came to the eattention of
the elven leader in Qualinesti, resulting in his first invitation to become
on of the few dwarves not only to visit the elven kingdom, but to become a
welcome visitor. Flint delighted in making ingenious toys which made him a
childrens' favorite wherever he worked including mongst the elves. It was
here that Flint and Tanis first met and, over the years became close
friends, for Flint was a solitary figure and Tanis always felt an outcast
dur to his human blood. When Tanis finally left Qualinesti, his natural
destination was his old friend Flint, whom he joined in Solace. He soon
made himself very useful to Flint, who made Tanis his business partner.

	One day, while Tanis was breakfasting in the Inn, Tass arrived at
flint's stall and set in motion the events that quickly let to the meeting
of all those destined to become the Companions of the Lance when they
rescued Goldmoon and Riverwind from the Seekers. In the period leading to
this rescue, the world became more perilous as the evil of Takhisis gained
a stronger grip on Krynn. Flint retired as it was no longer worth
travelling and the friends went their separate ways with a promise to meet
again after five years had passed. This fateful meeting brought them
together with Goldmoon and Riverwind, setting in motion the train of events
that brought you to the start of the quest.

V. MONSTERS
~~~~~~~~~~~
	During your travels through the ruins of Xak Tsaroth, you will meet
many different beings ranging from ferocious animals to evil and
intelligent followers of Takhisis. The best response you can expect is
indifference but the most usual is active hostility either because you are
enemies or look like food. All opposition is described as monsters.

	If you meet anything, remember that it is safer to defend yourself
by Ranged Combat than to wait until within Close Combat. You can more
easily retreat from Ranged Combat than from Close Combat.

Men:
~~~
	Any humans which you meet, if they are moving around freely, are
going to be in the employ of the Dragon Highlords. Their usual equipment
includes leather armor and swords. They will be eager to fight as they are
all experienced soldiers, usually veteran mercenaries that serve as low
status guards within the ruins.

Baaz Draconians:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	These draconians are the smallest and most plentiful kind. Used as
common ground troops, they are at the bottom of the social order. Although
often used as spies, as they can easily disguise their origins under robes
with large hoods, you will have no problems recognizing them here in
territory they regard as their own. They are quite fond of humans as a
favored addition to their diet, so they will be eager to close and fight.
They wear some armor and fight with swords. When killed, their bodies turn
to stone and crumble to dust.

Giant Spiders:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Just as the name implies, these monsters are large enough to pose
problems to you and your party. Not being intelligent, giant spiders
conclude "If it moves then it must be food." They are tough opponents, and
will take a large amount of damage before dying. They attack by biting.

Trolls:
~~~~~~~
	These large, shambling humanoids are not highly intelligent but,
like so many others, regard humans as a pleasant dietary supplement. They
make very tough opponents as they are difficult to injure and, when finally
wounded, their injuries start healing automatically. They are most
efficiently injured if burnt. They come equiped with formidable jaws and
claws, capable of inflicting terrible injuries.

Spectral Minions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The spirits of humans or demihumans who died before they could
complete powerful quests or vows, they are still bound just as when they
were alive. They may not attack unless their daily routine is interfered
with, but, as this routine consists of repeating the actions leading to
their deaths, it is virtually impossible not to interfere. Very often just
being present is regarded as interference and results in an attack on the
entire party.

	Spectral Minions look exactly as they did at the time of their
deaths (i.e., like normal humans but transparent to varying degrees), so if
you see the wall through your opponent, its probably not human. They use
the weapons they died with, usually swords and are intelligent opponents
not to be taken lightly.

Bozak Draconians:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	These Draconians are slightly larger and less plentiful than their
lesser Baaz kin. They are the magic users of the Dragonmen, dedicated to
the purposes of the Dragon Lords. Highly intelligent and without mercy once
they attack. Bozak are deadly opponents. They share the general Draconian
liking for humans, similarly regarding them a favored addition to their
diet as well as opponents to the will of Takhisis. So, they will be eager
to fight. They do not wear armor but are actually harder to injure than
armored Baaz. They use magical attacks such as Magic Missile. When killed,
the flesh dries and crumbles from their bones which will then explode
causing injury to anyone too close.

Aghar (Gully Dwarves):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	As the lowest class of dwarf, the Aghar are denied kin access by
other dwarves and are regarded as comical nuisances by humans. Their
strongest instinct is survival and they see cowardice as a virtue and raise
grovelling to the status of an art form. They originated from marriages
between dwarves and gnomes in the distant past. This new race lacked all of
the better qualities of their parents and they were driven out to survive
the best they could. The Cataclysm proved their salvation by giving them
access to dozens of ruined cities including Xak Tsaroth. Gully dwarves will
remove a character's body if not raised.

Hatching Black Dragons:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	They are exactly what their names says, baby black dragons. But
don't try petting them unless you don't mind losing an arm. They will
breath acid whenever you come across them. Like all young dragons, they can
take punishment without serious injury, and although newly hatched, they
make vicious little killers since they aren't adverse to a little fresh
human now and then. Too young for magic use, with a single blast of acid
they inflict substantial damage.

Wraiths:
~~~~~~~
	The spirits of evil beings, condemned or determined to stay in our
world, these undead are amongst the most deadly opponents you could ever
meet. Needing no weapons, their very touch is deadly, not so much for
physical injuries caused, but for the life force such a touch can steal.
The wraith's black evil is only matched by its black appearance as it
glides towards you intent on stealing your life force.

Khisanth:
~~~~~~~~
	The guardian of the "Disks of Mishakal" is probably the only thing
deadlier than the wraiths, Khisanth is an ancient, hugh, black dragon. She
is skilled in the practice of staying alive, capable of lethal blasts of
acid breath. She is the final obstacle that you must overcome before
completing your task in the ruins of Xak Tsaroth.

General Advice:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Moving deeper into the ruined city, the greater the danger you face
since more dangerous monsters prefer to live in the lower reaches of the
ruins. You must learn effective ways of dealing with different monsters as
you explore. Don't be ashamed to run away if you feel you can't handle a
given encounter or are already seriously injured from  previous meetings.
Strategic withdrawals (running for your life) allow you to heal injuries
gained in other fights and thus equip you to better face a new opponent.
Beware, however, that as you progress farther and farther into Xak Tsaroth,
the party's presence will begin to draw more and more monsters. To delay is
to allow your enemies an advantage. It is not wise to start a fight with a
badly injured party unless there is no other option.  Although you will
have to fight many times, your real purpose is to recover the "Disks of
Mishakal" which will restore the worship of the old gods - the true gods of
Krynn. You may fail many times before succeeding and even then you can try
this quest again and again for there is more than one way to success. Every
new game is different. However, if you save and restore a game it will
still be the same game with already explored areas unchanged.

VI. LOST & FOUND - objects in the ruins:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The city was abandoned in a blind panic as the Cataclysm struck.
People fled in terror leaving things behind. While the more obvious items
have been looted over the following centuries, there remain many useful
items simply overlooked, lost, or abandoned by looters or later inhabitants
of the ruins. While you have the ability to find magic items, remember that
even detect spells use energy which may be more useful elsewhere. Using too
many detect spells may attract magic-sensitive monsters. Also, searching
for things takes time and may allow you to be found by things you'd rather
not meet. You must balance your actions accordingly.

Scrolls:
~~~~~~~
	These items contain pre-prepared spells that are ready for instant
use by Raistlin. Any character may pick up a scroll but only Raistlin can
use it. You must select the required scroll from the USE sub-menu and, the
next time Raistlin enters Ranged Combat Mode, it will be the first spell to
be used.

Swords:
~~~~~~
	Although the characters cannot use weapons found within the ruins,
they can gain experience points from picking up such items to improve their
standing at the end of the game. Acquired weapons cannot be used as they
are unfamiliar to the characters, who would lose their skill bonuses for
their normal weapons.

Other weapons & ammunition:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Other weaponary that may be located by characters includes quivers
of arrows and pouches of bullets for the sling user. These should be picked
up whenever they are found as combat uses up large quantities of such
things. Where possible, try to use single shots in Ranged Combat rather
than rapid fire as it will considerably reduce the expenditure of arrows
and bullets. A bullet is a small lead pellet that can inflict damage when
fired by an experienced sling user.

	There are some other items around such as bows and daggers but they
are subject to the same limitations as swords.

Potions:
~~~~~~~~
	There are many potions to be found in the ruins, mostly concealed
by magic. Many date back to the time of the Cataclysm as few people took
the time to recover concealed items while fleeing for their lives. They are
not all the same and can help in a variety of ways. The only way to find
out the effect of a potion is to try it. While they are different colors,
each type is the same color. If you try one and discover its effect, then
another of the same color has the same effect.

	Any character can pick up a potion but you may have to transfer it
to another character to use it. To drink a potion, it must be in the
inventory of the character you wish to drink it. If this is the case,
select USE from the Main Menu and the potion from the sub-menu listing
usable items. the potion is drunk and its effect applied to the character.
If you see no change, the potion may be unsuitable for that character or
you may be in the wrong location for its effect.

	Healing potions cause a permanent change by healing wounds. They
are not all of the same strength and their effects vary. They only restore
damage taken and cannot increase a characters hit points beyond the
starting value. These potions can be drunk by anyone.

	Strength and Invulnerability potions both last for a certain amount
of time (variable) and only affect Tanis, Riverwind, Caramon, Sturm, and
Flint. While their effects last, they can be very useful in dangerous
situations.

	Strength potions increase the amount of damage inflicted by the
character everytime a successful hit is inflicted on an opponent . The
amount of this extra damage can vary as some potions are stronger than
others.

	Invulnerability potions give immunity to non-magic attacks, make it
more difficult to be hit by magical attacks and increase resistance to the
effects of a magical hit. The minimum length of time for both to be
effective is the same, but invulnerability potions are capable of lasting
much longer.

	If you are lucky, you may even find potions that allow you to
control monsters for a short period of time or until you attempt to kill
them. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to discover the effect of this
type of potion as it apparently does nothing unless your characters are in
the presence of the target monster-types. However, if you do discover the
purpose of such a potion then it will usually allow you to walk right up to
a monster and attack it with no initial attempt at defense until a
character hits it.

Rings:
~~~~~
	There are several magic rings which may be used by any character.
Selecting a ring from the USE sub-menu means that it will then be worn
until it is given away, dropped, or the character is killed. Rings can have
many effects but the types you are likely to find will make the wearer more
difficult for monsters to hit. Some are more effective than others and once
put on, all work indefinitely. Until selected as above, they do nothing and
are regarded as being carried around in a pouch or a pocket rather than
being worn.

Wands:
~~~~~
	Only usable by Raistlin, wands provide a device to fire a spell.
Each one has a limited number of charges and when used, the wand crumbles
to dust. If you are lucky enough to find a wand, once it is Raistlin's
possession it can be used by selecting USE from the sub-menu and will stay
as the active Ranged Combat weapon until discharged or changed by another
selection.

Miscellaneous:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	There are various other items such as jewelry or other treasure but
these, like much of the above, are not just lying around unguarded. They
may have monsters with them or your efforts to search for things may
attract their attentions. Another possibility is a trap - some items and
areas are protected by traps which you may trigger. There may be some
indication of a trap, either something obvious or maybe a situation too
tempting to be true. Such traps can be triggered from a distance or can be
avoided if a suitable character finds them. You will learn about these and
many other things as you experience the world of the "Heros of the Lance."
Good luck.... you'll need it!
