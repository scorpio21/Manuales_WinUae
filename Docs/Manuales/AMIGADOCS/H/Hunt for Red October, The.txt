			THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER

			BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Submarines have been described as the "Capital Ships" of today. Every major
maritime power is investing in sophisticated technology and design research to
make these potent weapons harder to discover and more deadly.

The submarine's main enemy is sonar. Whilst passive measures, such as new hull
designs and anechoic (noise-absorbing) tiles have become more widespread,
submarines still have to endure the nerve-wracking hunts for their presency by
the sonar beacons carried on modern ships and aircraft.

Once located by the hunters, the traditional weapon for attacking submarines is
the depth-charge. however, to allow a modern day submarine with sophisticated
weapons systems into depth-charge range is very dangerous for a surface vessel.

Most Soviet Anti-Submarine Warfare vessels carry a rocket launcher system to
provide the greater range required. This solves the problem of a torpedo being
too slow and limited in range as it can be delivered to a point where it will
"home-in" on the target.

The U.S. Navy is about to introduce the ASW-SOW (Anti-Submarine Warfare-Stand
Off Weapon) which uses a rocket fired from a safe distance to deliver the
torpedo the the target area. The torpedo parachutes into the sea homing-in on
its target.

Submarines can fire torpedoes at other submarines, but normally the defending
submarine can outrun it.

Even greater threats to submarines are mines and aircraft. Most submarines
carry mine warning equipment to help avoid U.S.Navy Captor mines. These have no
Identification - Friend or Foe (IFF) function and automatically release an
acoustic torpedo if triggered.

The threat from the air is even more deadly as this is far more difficult for
the submarines to detect or defend against. A task force hunting down a
submarine can extend around itself a search zone far in excess of the
submarine's effective torpedo range.

A typical ASW engagement has several distinct stages.

The first stage is the search, where the hunter seeks out his quarry. At this
stage the hunter may be operating in excess of optimum ASW speed, and hence be
vulnerable. It is likely that the search will be confined to passive sensors,
aided by any other input that may be obtained from satellites or seabed
detection sensors.

Once contact has been established classification begins. The acoustic signature
of the target will be compared to those in the hunter's data banks. This will
determine the type of target and to avoid giving away the hunter's position
will be accomplished, if possible, by using passive sensors again.

The hunter then moves into an attacking position to maximise the opportunity
for success for its weapons. In the case of submarines this is about half the
maximum range of 10-12 nautical miles of its torpedoes.

If the attack is unsuccessful there follows a phase of highly manoeuvrable
"dog-fighting" between the combatants, before the engagement is terminated,
either by a fatal hit, or by one of the participants breaking off the conflict.

Once locked in combat the homing torpedo is a deadly enemy. Towed arrays
streamed about 400 yards astern can be used to generate simulated propellar
noise or flak to distract incoming torpedoes.

If a submarine threat is identified it must be fully investigated. Whilst the
main body of a task force may turn away, ASW ships and aircraft will attempt to
establish contact. Tactics such as a "noisy" sprint followed by a totally
silent "drift" to the target are still employed by modern-day nuclear submarine
commanders in order to gain advantageous attacking positions.

In summary, the commander of a nuclear powered submarine controls one of the
most powerful weapons known to mankind.

Difficult to detect. Swift to strike.

Pressurised decisions are the order of the day - one mistaken judgement could
be your last.

			    COMMANDER'S BRIEFING

As the most senior of Russian submarine commanders you are ordered to test the
latest in Soviet naval technology - a submarine so quiet, with a revolutionary
new drive system, that it is almost undetectable.

But you have decided to defect. Your officers have been hand picked and are
willing to risk their lives to join you. The enlisted crew members suspect
nothing and you must ensure that this remains the case. Your carefully worded
mission orders (which are completely fake) are designed to conceal your true
purpose.

Unfortunately, any Soviet naval vessel of importance carries a KGB-appointed
Political Officer of a rank close to or even higher than your own, and this
person would certainly recognise the falseness of your orders. Shortly after
departure you kill him. You have also alerted the Soviet authorities to the
enormity of your crimes by sending a confession on cassette to your Admiral
explaining the defection. They will try to stop you at all costs. Moreover, you
cannot rely on the Americans for 100% support. They are far from certain that
this is not some double-bluff operation.

The simulation starts in the Reykjanes Ridge. The primary aim here is to avoid
detection amongst the deep rock formations. Interspersed in this area will be
Russian vessels, both surface and submarine, U.S. attack submarines, and a
complete underwater listening network, with the sole aim of preventing vessels
such as the Red October from slipping through.

Whilst stealth is vitally important at this stage, so is the fact that progress
needs to be made. Events planned for later in the voyage include the failure of
the nuclear power plant. You will therefore need to use the diesel back-up
engines to replace the nuclear powered propulsion system. Extended use of these
engines increases the need to surfact to recharge the batteries, and therefore
increases the risk of discovery. Failure to make sufficient headway early in
the game will result in greater problems later.

Once your false orders have been read to the crew, you must not raise their
suspicion unnecessarily. To journey to the wrong part of the map will raise
worried questions from your navigation officer, and may result in your being
relieved of your command.

The plan is simple. Your orders have directed you to test the defences of the
eastern seaboard of the USA. As you cross the Atlantic, your engineering
officer will fake a leak in the nuclear power plant which necessitates the crew
being evacuated onto an American vessel. The heroic officers of Red October
will scuttle the vessel to prevent it from falling into capitalist hands.

In reality the Americans have arranged a rendezvous with Red October in order
to scuttle one of their own submarines and keep Red October for themselves.

The rendezvous is scheduled to take place just outside US territorial waters.
To enter US territorial waters may not be catastrophic for you, but docking at
a US post most certainly would be. Under maritime law the Soviets would be able
to reclaim the Red October swiftly.

This simulation gives you the chance to pit your wits and skills against the
world's most powerful fleet. Are you up to the job?

			GAMEPLAY, STRATEGY AND TACTICS

The control mechanism of the Red October is entirely icon driven to allow the
swift transmission of orders. Once an order has been issued by the Captain, the
officer responsible will acknowledge and execute it. Once complete, the officer
will confirm it via the message window.

Control of speed, depth and bearing are the three tenets by which a submarine
commander lives or dies. They are continually displayed on the left-hand panel
and allow the Captain to evaluate the main display area data.

This area can either be used to review the local position or the broader North
Atlantic projection. The latter map shows approximate positions of all known
fleets and, of course, the Red October. This data, however, may become flawed
as time progresses and the position of ships alters.

The contour screen is of greatest use to the Captain in the early part of the
game, as he negotiates the very complex series of valleys in the Reykjanes
Ridge - affectionately renamed by the crews of the Soviet Northern Red Banner
fleet as "Gorshkov's Railroad" after their Admiral Gorshkov.

]This area is the main dispersal route for Soviet ballistic missil submarines.
It is also where Soviet and US attack submarines surreptitiously wait to track
and ultimately eliminate any threat.

The contour screen allows the player to plan routes through the Ridge area, as
well as any other shallow areas. Sonar sweep can be superimposed on the contour
screen to allow identification of other vessels in the vicinity.

You may also use the display area for the periscope view which show full
details of all vessels in the area. The attack scope will lock data into the
fire control computer to allow the maximum chance of a "hit".

A submarine's main strategic strength is surprise. The ability to attack
without warning and escape into the depths silently is the key to survival.

Red October has a unique advantage over all rivals and contemporaries. It is
fitted with the caterpillar drive system, which facilitates a silent, virtually
undetectable, passage through the ocean's waters. To use this system, however,
reduces speed by nearly two-thirds. The longer Red October delays reaching its
clandestine rendezvous with the US Navy the greater the chance of detection by
the Soviet fleet. Any undue delay must be avoided - the net will tighten!

To fulfill your mission you must deliver Red October to the Americans, intact
and irretrievable. Failure means certain death.

				NAVIGATION

During the initial section of the game you must navigate through Reykjanes
Ridge, some of the most dangerous submarine landscapes known. Using the
gradiometers you can utilise projected cross sectional displays which help you
plot the safest route through the area.

The principle routes through the Ridge are well documented and known by all
submarine commanders. Both Russian, US, and NATO forces will be in position and
must be avoided. To disguise your presence requires the nerve to manoeuvre Red
October around massive obstacles and camouflage the sonar input to other
vessels.

The main danger to avoid is grounding or damaging Red October. Its carefully
designed hull is aimed at minimising noise and cavitation and fragile hull
sensors provide much of the electronic data needed for navigation. Great care
must be used.

There is also the danger from mines. "Captor mines" deployed by the US Navy
have no IFF sensors (Identification Friend or Foe). These fire acoustic
torpedoes at submarines which trigger pressure-sensitive launch mechanisms.
Other mines may also be present. They hydrophonics officer will keep you posted
on these dangers.

When other vessels are in the area the Red October comes into her own. The
caterpillar drive system minimises the risk of discovery, however, to use any
active system will negate this advantage.

To avoid detection it is vital to minimise speed and noise levels and vary
depth according to local conditions. By using the inbuilt systems advantages of
Red October and the surrounding terrain you will have a better chance of
evading pursuers.

			      UNDER ATTACK

Once located, it is possible that a submarine could track Red October without
you realizing because of the limitations of passive sonar. It is essential
therefore that the commander regularly checks that no "tail" has been acquired.
The manoeuvre known as "Crazy Ivan!", requiring a sudden 360° turn, is a useful
ploy. It results in a following submarine having to react rapidly, silently and
change its course, if it is not to be revealed.

If the Red October is attacked there are several options available.

The most simple is to outrun the torpedo. Modern torpedoes are not as fast as a
submarine at full power and the longer the missile is in the sea the greater
the potential to deflect or confuse it. This method creates a great deal of
noise, however, and precludes a long "cat and mouse" engagement.

A second option is to lay an electronic decoy. These decoys simulate propeller
noise and submarine sounds in the water and are towed about 400 yards behind
the submarine, where a missile may explode harmlessly.

A third and more risky option is to head towards the torpedo. In order to
prevent the torpedo from detonating, it must be intercepted within the "safe
detonation" area. This is the minimum distance (about 1000 meters) that a
torpedo must travel from the attack submarine before it can explode otherwise
the attack submarine itself may suffer damage. By intercepting a torpedo within
the minimum distance, it will hit your submarine but not explode.

			     ON THE ATTACK

Red October's defensive capability is restricted to four torpedo tubes.
Designed principally as a floating nuclear missile launch pad, the torpedoes
are her only method of despatching a pursuing enemy to the deep.

Having identified an enemy it is vital for the Red October to get into torpedo
range. The maximum range is ten to twelve nautical miles. Normally, however,
submarine commanders prefer to sneak in close to half that range to increase
the chances of a hit. Whilst acoustic torpedoes can be launched by using sonar
bearings through the fire control computer, it is perhaps illuminating that
many attacks are still carried out with periscope sightings, despite the
obvious risk of discovery.

If the manual override mechanism on the torpedoes has been initiated, the
bearing and elevation in relation to the target vessel are important. The
sooner the missile reaches the surface, the more likely it is to be spotted
visually and electronically. The missile should not be fired too deep as decoys
may deflect the torpedo from its target.

			    AMERICAN TACTICS

Throughout this simulation the US Navy has one aim; to track the Red October,
and assist the commanding officer to defect in accordance with its plan to get
its hands on the sub.

To achieve its objective the US fleet will shadow the searching Russian fleets
whilst trying to track Red October with attack submarines from the Reykjanes
Ridge.

Once the Red October has been located, the US Navy will try to establish
surface contact at the rendezvous point and ensure that an old US submarine is
scuttled so that Red October can take on a new identity.

The only thing that can alter the US tactics would be if Red October launched
an attack on US forces. This would rsult in the US Navy joining the Russian
forces in a "seek and destroy" mission for Red October, to prevent the "rogue
ship" from causing a nuclear war.

			    RUSSIAN TACTICS

Russian tactics are to stop the defection - at any cost.

All other nuclear ballistic missile submarines are recalled to base to prevent
the US misinterpreting their action in deploying three search fleets in the
Atlantic Ocean. Each fleet will carry out organized and joint search patterns
for Red October in the Ridge and throughout the Atlantic.

The Soviet naval air force will support each fleet through wide search patterns
to trace the missing submarine.

At the beginning of the simulation, the Soviet attack submarines will take up
position off the major US military and commercial ports on the Eastern Seaboard
of the USA to blockade entry by the Red October.

All Soviet "spy" trawlers will be instructed to trace the Red October using the
latest and most sophisticated tracking equipment. Information from these
vessels can be a source of great danger to Red Octover and her crew.

Russian tactics will vary with each game. The split second nature of decision
making and the pressure to succeed can cause surprise reactions from the
pursuing Soviet navy.

If the Red October defects, many Soviet officers face disgrace. They may lose
their jobs, perhaps even their lives.  To succeed they may take foolhardy risks
with their own ships and crew.

As the game progresses the tension and the systematic search pattern used by
the Soviet fleet increase the chance of detection. However, the Soviet navy is
renowned for the poor security of its communications concerning strategic
positions.

The careful use of ESM - Electronics Surveillance Measures - may provide that
vital piece of information on the deployment of Soviet forces to ensure your
success.

				COMMAND MANUAL

Red October is the latest Soviet nuclear ballistic missile submarine. Armed
with 26 SS-N-20 Seahawk misiles, each with eight 500-kiloton multiple
independently targetable re-entry vehicles - MIRVS - it reppresents a potent
weapon, capable of destroying two hundred cities.

Red October is also the first Soviet submarine to be equipped with the unique
"Caterpillar" propulsion system. This allows the submarine to reduce the amount
of cavitation sound it emits and therefore to remain virtually undetectable.

In this simulation of The Hunt for Red October you are Captain First Rank Marko
Ramius, Commander of Red October. Your mission is to guide Red October to the
Eastern Seaboard of the United States of America...to DEFECT.

				THE DEFECTION

The plot to defect has been devised over many months of planning. The
simulation starts as Red October begins to negotiate the Reykjanes Ridge off
the Icelandic coast. This area is the major route for Soviet submarines leaving
the ports used by the Northern Red Banner fleet for the Atlantic Ocean and the
US coastline.

To navigate this area takes great skill as the US and NATO have concentrated
their submarine detection networks on this area. The objective for the player
is to navigate to the Atlantic, rendezvous with the US Navy away from the
Soviet fleet and arrange a transfer of crew. This allows the US Navy to create
a suitable subterfuge on the fate of Red October to allow them to smuggle the
vessel secretly to port. To sail Red October openly into a US port would result
in the Soviet authorities reclaiming the vessel under maritime law.

The crew of a hundred enlisted men are not aware of the planned defection. It
is important therefore not to deviate greatly from the orders, albeit false,
given to the crew at the beginning of the voyage. These orders are that Red
October is to probe the eastern seaboard defences of the USA and on completion
to head to Cuba on a courtesy visit. Designed to disguise the true intention of
the mission as well as tantalise the crew with the excitement of the Cuban
visit, the orders are far removed from those originally given to you be the
Political Officer.

You must also take into account that the Soviet fleet's only aim is to prevent
Red October from falling into American hands. If it is necessary to destroy Red
October then it will.

	This panel provided the Captain with instant control over the major
navigational functions. Icons can be activated by a single click as follows.

	A - Speed Indicator - On this guage the Captain can change speed by
clicking on the required level and then the execute button. This is used when
the Captain wishes to change speed very quickly.
	          
 	B - Compass - The compass allows the Captain to click on a required
heading and then click on the execut button, to change course.

	C - Depth Guage - On the depth guage, by clicking on the depth
required, the Captain can make rapid adjustments whilst still analysing other
data on the main screen display. Once executed the main indicator will move to
the indicated depth position.

	D - Clock - A "gametime" clock may be accelerated by holding the mouse
button down continuously over the right-hand area of the clock. To slow the
clock to gain time, press the mouse button continuously over the left-hand side
of the clock. This speeding up of the clock allows the Captain to accelerate
the passage of time until a further order is required or message received.

N.B. It is dangerous to use this function in areas where navigation is complex,
otherwise you run the risk of grounding and damaging Red October.

	E - Speed Readout - This indicates the current speed in knots. By
clicking on the icon the Captain is given the option of increasing or
decreasing speed. (Figure 3.1).If he selects 0 knots he is giving the order of
"total silence". This may be used when trying to avoid detection.

	F - Heading Readout - This provides accurate control of the heading of
Red October. When setting a course this is the best method of ensuring that the
course set is correct. However, if the Captain wishes to perform an evasive
manoeuvre involving rapid changes of course he may elect to use the quicker
compass method outlined in B above.

	G - Depth Readout - Depth is given in meters. It is essential that the
Captain is aware of this for two reasons - first, he must not dive below the
safe pressure depth of 450 meters. Secondly, he must ensure that depth is
apprepriate for the seabed terrain.

	H - Contour Display Control - This turns the contour display map in the
main area on and off, as the Captain requires.

	I - Sonar Display Control - This turns the sonar display area on and
off, as the Captain requires.

Once the Captain has selected the parameter he wishes to change - speed,
heading or depth, he must execute the order for his officers to obey.

	A - Execute Order - Clicking on this button will execute the order
selected by the Captain. This must be done before any order form the main
control panel can be executed.

	B - Cancel Order - This cancels the order originally selected by the
Captain and can only be prior to execution. Once an order is executed then only
a fresh order countermanding it will prevent it from being carried out.

	C - Function - This shows the function that the Captain is adjusting -
speed, heading or depth.

	D - Function Readout - This shows the level of the function at the time
of the order, and can then be changed to the new level required, by using
increase/decrease buttons.

	E - Decrease Button - Decreases the level shown in "D" until it reaches
the level required by the Captain. 

	F - Increase Button - Increases the level shown in "D: until it reaches
the level required by the Captain. Combined with "E" it allows the Captain to
"fine tune" the submarine's speed, heading or depth, rather than the
approximate orders given via the main control panel.

On execution of an order the original panel (Figure 3) will return and the
Captain can adjust other parameters whilst new orders are being implemented.
Each change of the instructions must be executed and acknowledged by the
relevant officer. The officer will also report when the order has been
accomplished. Once an order has been given the Captain can concentrate on other
more pressing matters, safe in the knowledge that his hand-picked officers will
respond correctly. This flexible and simple command structure means that
numerous orders may be given and complicated manoeuvres performed with the
minimum of effort.

			GIVING ORDERS TO OFFICERS

Clicking on the Sonar Icon displays the functions of the Sonar Officer.

Sonar represents the ears of the modern submarine. Sonar technology has
developed to such a degree that listening to the sound patterns of a vessel as
it moves and operates enables trained operatives to recognise vessels with
remarkable accuracy. Submarines operate with a continuous passive sonar which
gives approximate details of targets and their identity or heading.  The data,
however, is highly subjective and it requires verification by visual sighting,
further triangulation or by the use of "active" sonar to gain an accurate fix
on the target. It also leaves vulnerable blind spots which can be exploited by
hostile attack submarines.

	A - Sonar/Contour Display - This screen calls up the contour display of
the sea bed. This accurate relief map is supplied by gradiometers fitted to Red
October which sense the depth of the Ocean, and project the known area around
the vessel.

The gradiation is by color, white being the peaks of rock formations, and the
darkest blue, the sea bed itself.

By using this information together with the sonar information supplied, and
superimposed on the map, the Captain can navigate his way through the
treacherous Reykjanes Ridge to the relative safety of the mid-Atlantic.

The contour control turns the contour display on and off, as indicated in the
main control panel section. When turned off, the contour map becomes the sonar
screen.

This screen indicates all sonar contacts picked up from either passive or
active sonar. Each reference is keyed and details of the contact are shown in
the message window. The bearing shown is from Red October to the sonar contact.
The range is in nautical miles, together with the approximate heading of the
contact. Approximate speed in knots is also shown.  This information is updated
by use of passive or active sonar. It may be considered necessary by some
commanders to verify data with visual sightings. The message window data can be
used by either the hydrophonics window or as the fire control computer to lock
onto a target for analysis or attack. Selection is made by moving the opinter
over the appropriate symbol and clicking once on the left-hand mouse button.
When there are a large number of sonar contacts on screen the list can be
scrolled up and down using the arrows shown on the left-hand side of the
message screen. The sonar information window can also be turned back to the
ordinary message window by clicking on the page symbol between the scroll
arrows.

	B - Active Sonar - Clicking on this icon authorises the emission of an
active sonar signal. The results are two-fold. An accurate sonar picture will
be given, allowing the Captain to assess a target, its speed, heading and
identity. It will also indicate to the ships on the receiving end of the active
sonar that, if they had not already discovered it, a potentially hostile
submarine is in the area and may be about to launch an attack.  This use of
active sonar may also give the target ships a fix on the submarine';s bearing.
The use of active sonar is therefore risky. But the benefits in terms of
prosecuting an attack are substantial as it will reveal detailed information on
the target vessels essential for an attack to succeed.

	C - Cross Section Window - This gives the Captain a window in the
message area which shows a cross-sectional analysis of the sea bed. This can
either be along the 90° or the 180° axis of the submarine and alternated
between them within the window. The views may also be magnified and
de-magnified to allow the careful planning of routes through the more complex
areas of the sea bed.

			DRIVE CONTROL

Figure 5: Engineering Officer

This icon calls up the Engineering Officer, and allows the selection of Red
October's propulsion method.

The most important factor in running Red October will be the Captain's choice
of power and drive. This in turn determines the amount of cavitation and
general noise level.

The advantage of the caterpillar drive is based on the use of impellers rather
than propellers. The submarine sucks water in through the bow, and the
impellers eject it from the stern, thereby moving the ship. This eliminates the
cavitation sounds caused by propellers.

When conventional propellers turn at high speed they develop an area of low
pressure behind the trailing edge of the blade. When these areas collapse under
pressure, water rushes forward against the blade, causing noise and vibration,
making detection easier.

The speed advantage of nuclear power compared with diesel power is significant.
The noise factor when using diesel power is also a problem when trying to avoid
detection. However, after day 10 of the game, the nuclear power plant is
withdrawn from use (as part of the defection plan) and the Captain is forced to
use either the diesel power, or the more silent but slower caterpillar drive.
The choice of propulsion is up to the Captain and the changeovers will be
executed by the engine room on demand.

				WEAPONS SYSTEMS

The Red October has only torpedoes to fire, and hence the Captain must decide
simply when and what to fire.

Figure 6: Weapons Officer
	This selects the weapons officer and allows control of Red October's
offensive capability - acoustic torpedoes.

Target selection can be either manual, or via the sonar messgae window which
also acts as the fire control computer. The details from this system are used
to aim the Red October's torpedoes.

Figure 6: Torpedo Tube Status
	This icon gives the status of Red October's four torpedo tubes,
including how many torpedoes are left for each tub. To change tubes, clice the
left-hand mouse button over the icon.

Figure 6.2: Manual Override
	If the Captain is unsure of the reliability or success of his acoustic
torpedoes, he may select the manual override option.

This brings into operation the heading and elevation control (Figure 6.3). By
clicking on the arrows the Captain can set the heading and elevation angle for
each torpedo. The difficulty is to avoid setting the angle too steeply to avoid
possible visual sighting of the torpedo by the target, thereby alowing it to
take evasive action.

Figure 6.4: Launch Torpedo
	
	The FIRE icon launches the torpedo. The noise and effect of launching a
torpedo is a significant danger in that it gives away your position to the
target.

Figure 6.5: Lay Flack

	This icon allows the Captain to lay electronic decoys to deflect and
confuse incoming torpedoes and missiles. The disadvantage of using such a decoy
is that it creates extra noise which highlights your presence in the area.

Whilst the Red October's primary role is to launch offensive missiles thate is
no doubt that her offensive ship-to-ship weaponry would enable her to undertake
an engagement with a surface vessel with a high degree of confidence and
success.

Figure 7: Periscope Systems

	This section of icons can only be called by the Captain when at
periscope depth. Once achieved, the Captain may select his periscope view and
check the horizon accordingly.

	This gives a horizon view and is used to test if it is safe to surface
and for identification of targets. To scroll the view, simply click over the
direction arrows.

Figure 7.5: Night Scope

	This uses the latest image intensification technology to ensure that
the Captain can also use visual reference.

Figure 7.6: Electonic Surveillance Manual (ESM)

	The ESM antennae enables any messages being transmitted between ships
to be intercepted and relayed to the Captain. It allows the overall perspective
of fleet positions on the Atlantic map to be updated and may also give useful
information about enemy intentions during the serach or rendezvous.

The use of the periscope makes it easier to be detected through radar or even
visual contact. Henct to deploy the periscope is a risky option. however, many
modern submarine commanders prefer the security of visual sightings and
identifications before launching an attack.

			       THE MESSAGE WINDOW

As the Captain gives orders and the situation changes, he will receive text
information in the message window.
