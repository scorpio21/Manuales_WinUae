ACTIONS IF YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT POINTS LEFT.BY USING YOUR POINTS WISELY YOU

ARE HIGHLIGHTED,OBVIOUSLY YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO WALK THROUGH A TREE FOR
EXAMPLE.YOU CAN CHANGE DIRECTION AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WISH BY SIMPLY
CLICKING ON A DIFFERENT DIRECTIONAL ARROW.

SECONDLY,IF YOU KNOW HOW MANY MOVEMENT POINTS YOUR CHARACTER HAS YOU CAN
USE THE MOUSE TO CLICK ON A SQUARE YOU WISH THAT THE CHARACTER TO MOVE
TO.THE CHARACTER WILL THEN MOVE TO THAT SQUARE USING THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF
MOVEMENT POINTS POSSIBLE.YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE YOUR MOVEMENT POINTS ALL AT
ONCE.YOU CAN,FOR EXAMPLE,MOVE,ENGAGE IN COMBAT OR SEARCH AND THEN MOVE
AGAIN,BUT REMEMBER YOU WILL BE RESTRICTED BY THE AMOUNT OF ACTION POINTS
YOU HAVE USED DURING YOUR TURN.A CHARACTER MAY NOT MOVE DIAGONALLY NOR MOVE
ONTO AN OCCUPIED SQUARE.YOU CAN MOVE THROUGH A SQUARE OCCUPIED BY A FELLOW
PARTY MEMBER ONLY IF THERE IS ROOM FOR YOU TO EXIT THAT SQUARE.YOU MAY
NEVER OCCUPY NOR MOVE THROUGH A SQUARE WITH A MONSTER IN IT.

THE FOOT OF THE SCREEN.THE CURSOR WILL NOW CHANGE INTO A SWORD.SIMPLY POINT
THE SWORD ONTO THE ENEMY YOU WISH TO FIGHT AND THE COMPUTER WILL RESOLVE
COMBAT.IF YOUR CHARACTERS STRIKES AN OPPONENT THREE TIMES DURING AN ATTACK
ROUND,THIS INDICATES THAT COMBAT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND THAT A HIT HAS BEEN
MADE AGAINST YOUR OPPONENT.THE TIME IT TAKES FOR ONE ROUND OF COMBAT
DEPENDS UPON WHICH CHARACTER IS FIGHTING.THE BARBARIAN AND THE FIGHTER WILL
USE UP LESS OF THEIR ACTION POINTS PER COMBAT ROUND THAN THE OTHER
CHARACTERS.YOU CANNOT ATTACK DIAGONALLY,BUT UP TO FOUR CHARACTERS CAN
ATTACK THE SAME OPPONENT.TO SAVE TIME MOVING BETWEEN CHARACTER AND ICON YOU
CAN,IF YOU WISH,CLICK ON THE COMBAT ICON WITH THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.FROM
THEN ONWARDS,EVERY TIME YOU PRESS THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON THE CURSOR WILL
CHANGE INTO A SWORD AND YOU CAN PROCEED TO ENGAGE COMBAT IN THE USUAL
MANNER.THE OPTION TO TAKE THIS SHORT CUT IS NOT RESTRICTED TO THE COMBAT
ICON,BUT CAN BE USED WITH ANY OTHER ICON I.E.SPELLS,MAP,SEARCH ETC.

MAGIC

ALL CHARACTERS CAN USE MAGIC POTIONS AND CERTAIN CHARACTERS ARE ABLE TO USE
SPELLS.THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SPELL OR POTION IS GAUGED BY THE MIND POINTS
OF THE CASTER.A POTION OF LIGHTNING BOLT THROWN BY THE BARBARIAN WILL PROVE
FAR LESS EFFECTIVE THAN ONE HURLED BY THE MYSTIC AND OF COURSE,DON'T EXPECT
THE BIG MAN TO DO MUCH ELSE THAT TURN.THE GREATER A CHARACTERS INTELLIGENCE
THE MORE POTENT THE SPELL OR POTION AND THE LESS TIME IT TAKES TO CAST.TO
CAST A SPELL OR USE A POTION CLICK ONTO THE MAGIC ICON.THIS WILL TAKE YOU
TO A SCREEN SIMILAR TO THE INVENTORY,BUT INSTEAD OF EQUIPPED AND BACKPACK
THIS HAS TWO SECTIONS HEADED POTIONS AND SPELLS (SPELLS CAN BE USED MORE

TAKE YOU BACK TO THE MAIN PLAYING SCREEN.IF THE SPELL OR POTION YOU ARE
CASTING AFFECTS AN AREA OR CAN ONLY BE USED ON THE CASTER
THEMSELVES(E.G.POTION OF HEALTH)THE MAGIC WILL NOW WORK AUTOMATICALLY.IF
THE MAGIC IS CAST AT A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL,THE PENTANGLE WILL REMAIN ON THE
SCREEN.PLACE THE PENTANGLE OVER THE CHARACTER OR MONSTER YOU WISH TO CAST
THE SPELL AT AND CLICK THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.IF YOU NOW DECIDE NOT TO CAST
THE SPELL,CLICK THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.IF YOUR MAGIC WAS SUCCESSFUL THE
EFFECTS OF YOUR MAGIC WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.REMEMBER THE EFFECTIVENESS
OF ALL MAGIC IS DEPENDANT UPON THE MINDPOINTS OF THE CASTER;DON'T BE TOO

CURSOR.THE SQUARE IS NOW SAFE TO WALK OVER.MONSTERS DO NOT SET OFF
