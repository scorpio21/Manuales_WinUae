LOADING INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

To load HEAVY METAL HEROES, set up your Amiga as shown in your user manual,
insert  the program disk into drive zero and press the CONTROL key and both
AMIGA keys together.

VIRUS NOTE:  Please ensure that your program disk is WRITE PROTECTED before
loading.  To do this, slide the square black plastic tab on the back of the
disk so that the hole is exposed.

PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

Select  the number of players from the title screen by pressing FIRE on the
joystick.   (In  the  case of a two player game, player one will start from
the left hand side of the screen.
 
The  game can be paused at any time by pressing the (HELP) key, and resumed
after  that  point with (DEL).  While paused, pressing (ESC) will abort the
game and return to the title page.

Shooting certain enemy ships will allow you to collect extra ammunition and
armour, as follows:

SHIELD -
Provides  added  protection  at  the  front of your craft.  Large, or fast,
enemy craft will, however be able to penetrate this shield.

EXTRA LIFE -
Provides an extra life, plus a short amount of invincibility.

DOUBLE FIRE -
Fires  twin  plasma  bolts,  thus  increasing  your chance of hitting enemy
craft.

SINGLE FIRE - 
Only really useful for its score value.

LASER NET -
Launches  two  pods  with  a  laser  beam  between  them.   This  will kill
practically  anything  that  gets  in  the way.  Note that only five may be
launched, and that if a pod is hit by an enemy craft, the beam will cease.

MISSILES -
Launches two missiles from the sides of your craft.

LEFT FIRE -
Fires shots from the left side of your craft.

RIGHT FIRE -
Fires shots from the right side of your craft.

ORBITALS -
Two  spheres  which  rotate  about  your  craft,  providing  an  element of
shielding.   Collecting  a  further  orbital pod will increase the speed of
rotation, and consequently the amount of protection being provided.

FIRING ORBITALS -
As above, but the spheres fire oscillating plasma bolts.

PLAYING TIPS:
-------------

KILL EVERYTHING!!

Some enemy craft may take more than one direct hit to destroy.

When  you  are killed, your next ship will flash for a few seconds.  During
this time you are invincible.  Use this time to get out of any tight spots.

Share weaponry pods when on two player mode.

High speed orbitals are very lethal against enemy craft!!

Watch out for the unexpected.

DON'T PANIC !!!!!
