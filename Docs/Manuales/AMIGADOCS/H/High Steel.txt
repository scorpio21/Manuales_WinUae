                             HIGH STEEL


     The object of the game is to build a skyscraper.  First one floor,
     then two floors, etc.

     To build a floor, you have to take the long girders and position
     them in the middle of one of the bricks you are standing on.
     The girders will then change color and you will now be able to
     climb them.  Take one of the bricks from the pile, climb the
     girder, and lay the brick on top of it.  If you can put five
     girders across and lay a brick on top of each one the game will
     register a floor.

     Every once in a while, instead of bricks, the crane will drop a
     red thing and a triangle thing.  If you get these, your energy
     will go up.

     There are certain monsters that you will come across.  First
     there are things that look like two balls together.  Push these
     off the edge of the building to get points.  Don't throw your
     wrench at these.  It will bounce off them and kill you.  On the
     second level there are monsters that hatch from eggs and plants
     that sprout from the bottom of the girders.  throw your wrench
     at these to destroy them.  Don't touch them or you will die.
     There may be different monsters at higher levels.

     Watch out for things falling from the sky such as red bricks
     eggs, etc.  They will kill you.

     This is about all I know.  I hope it helps you.  ENJOY!!!
