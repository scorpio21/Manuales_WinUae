The 

Theres A Command Which Causes You To Go Reverse But I Couldnt Find
It Again! Shit! Ok The Target Is In The Box At Top Of the Screen, Line
The Sights And Lower/Raise The Cannon To Destroy It, Also ANYWHERE In
The Game ESCAPE Brings Ya Back To Main Menu...

The FAV
--------
This Vehicle Is Controlled Entirely By Joystick And Is More Like
An Action Game, I Couldnt Find Any Keys That Did ANYTHING here!

The ADAT
--------
This Vehicle Cannot Move And Is Once Again Mostly Controlled By Joystick
There Is One Key Command Here:
 
           Space Bar - Fire Missle

Their Is An Indicator On The Target Which The Missle Has A Lock On!
It ONLY Targets One And You Have To Wait Til The Missile Detonates Before
Firing Another. This Section Is QUITE Hard Though...
