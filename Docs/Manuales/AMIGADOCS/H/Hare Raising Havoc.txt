Installing the Game

This game must be installed onto your Amiga hard disk drive.

Before you do anything else, write protect your original disks so you
can't accidentally copy over them.  You can do this by moving the tab
on the upper right corner of the disk so you can see through the window.

2. Insert Hare Raising Havoc Disk 1 in the main floppy disk drive (df0:).
3. Double-click on the Hare Raising Havoc Disk 1 icon to open its window.
4. Double-click on the INSTALL icon.  (This will automatically install
   Hare Raising Havoc in its own drawer called ROGER.)
5. Please follow the directions that appear on screen.

   Disk 6.  Hare Raising Havoc is now ready for play.

Starting the Program

1. Double-click on the ROGER drawer and then double-click on the Hare
   Raising Havoc icon.
   o If you have only 1 Meg of memory, press Ctrl-D while Workbench is
     loading (which is right after you turn on the power to your Amiga
     computer).  This prevents the Workbench program from loading, which
     leaves enough memory for the game to run properly.  To start the
     program, type CD DH0:ROGER and press Return.  The type ROGER and 
     press Return.
   o Workbench 2.0 users: Hare Raising Havoc does not support 2.0.  To
     get your Amiga to boot up using Workbench 1.3, hold down both
     mouse buttons while turning on your computer.
2. A picture of an item appears on the computer screen.  You're asked
   how many of that item Roger has in a specific pocket.  To answer
   the question, use the Hare Raising Havoc code wheel.  Find that item
   on the outer wheel and then line it up with Roger's finger on the
   inner wheel.  In the center of the code wheel, find the pocket that
   the item is in.  Above the pocket is a window that shows you the
   number of items Roger has in that pocket.  Match the number on the
   computer screen to the number on the code wheel.  To do this, press
   the up and down arrows on your keyboard to toggle through the numbers
   on the computer screen.  Once the number on the computer screen
   matches the number in the window on the code wheel, press Enter.

   NO FUCKING WAY DUDE... SKID ROW CRACKED THIS FUCKER!!!

3. Next you see the introduction screen.  You can press Return to bypass
   the screens or wait for the program to automatically continue.

Your Goal in Hare Raising Havoc

You need to help Roger out of the room or area he's stuck in so he can
capture Baby Herman before Mommy returns home.  Roger will want to try
using everything around him.  Have him pull, push, kick, slide, and
jump on objects to see if they'll help him escape.  A timer appears
on the screen to show how much time Roger has left.

Amiga Owners With Only 1 Megabyte of RAM 

While playing Hare Raising Havoc, you might notice that the animation
occasionally pauses for a second or two.  This happens when the program
is loading sound files from the hard disk drive into available RAM as
those sound files are needed, replacing previously loaded sound files.
If you have 2 megabytes or more of RAM, the program has more room for
sound storage, which lets the animation run smoothly.

To view the animation without pauses, run Hare Raising Havoc without
sound.  To do this, start the game at the DOS prompt by typing

                   ROGER QUIET

(instead of ROGER) and pressing Enter.
