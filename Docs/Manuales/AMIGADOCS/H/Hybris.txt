                         INTERSTELLAR MEMORANDUM

                        CLASSIFICATION: PRIORITY ONE

To:  Command Center Number 163, Planet Earth
From:  Space Station -- HYBRIS
DATE:  Time zone 18003426442, 2461 A.D.
RE:  Investigation of the earth colony on Planet Jurica

START MESSAGE:

We have begun our scheduled orbit of Planet Jurica.  
All attempts at communication with the earth colony have yielded no results.  
Our long-range sensors detect many strange formations on the planet's surface.  
We suspect that hostile alien forces have invaded the planet, 
and we have prepared our scouting ships to investigate.  
Two pilots have been chosen for the mission: J.P. Lovett and K. Lovett.  
Both are extremely well qualified and have explicit instructions to remain on the planet 
until they find the colony -- whatever the cost.  
Due to great distance between Jurica and Eart, we will continue to forward transcripts 
of the communication between HYBRIS and the pilots.

END MESSAGE
