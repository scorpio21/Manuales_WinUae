                             ****************

 A light hearted romantic adventure in the mold of movies such as
 "Romancing the Stone" or "Raiders of the Lost Ark", Heart of China (HOC)
 is far removed from the standard fantasy or sci-fi plots  of  most
 computer games.  Instead, HOC was designed  to take you on a whirlwind,
 globe-spanning adventure that captures the flavor and romance of exotic
 locations and characters.  To achieve  this  goal  we  had  to accomplish
 both technical and design breakthroughs.  There were two main issues on the
 technical side that are worth noting.  First was the addition of a Story
 Branch alert that signals when you've taken a pathway in the story that could
 have been approached from a different direction.  This was an important
 addition to the adventure because it allows you to actually see the
 multiple plot paths in the game.  Rise of the Dragon, HOC's predecessor,
 also had multiple story branches but the feedback we received told us that
 most people were unaware that these different pathways existed.  With the
 Story Branch alert, you'll immediately know when you've tried something that
 could have been done another way.  Also on the technical side was the
 artwork.  It was decided very early on that we would use a combination of
 live actors and  realistic,  hand painted backgrounds to achieve the rich
 "period" feel of the game.  However, combining the photographed actors with
 the painted backgrounds turned out to be much harder than we had originally
 anticipated.  Total  reworking  of  the art work was required on two separate
 occasions to get it just right.  Despite all of the difficulties encountered,
 I think the resulting "film quality" look was worth the effort.

 Along with the technical  advances  made  in  HOC,  exploring  the  chemistry
 between three very interesting characters was a top priority.  Friendships
 and romance develop over the course of the entire game, with the romance
 between Lucky and Kate being the focal point and an intriguing "buddy"
 interaction developing between Lucky and his ninja partner, Chi.  HOC's
 sidekick system (allowing interaction between three main characters) was
 essential to this process of fostering believable characters and emotional
 attachment.  The sidekick system is a powerful feature that will be a
 critical element in future Dynamix adventure games.

 Finally, I would like to thank the huge team that brought the HOC vision to
 life. Taking a look at the enormous list of credits gives you an idea of just
 how many people devoted their time and energy to this project.  It's their
 hard work combined with Sierra's patience and support that have made this
 adventure a reality.

                               * Overview *
                               ************

 Welcome to Heart of China, the second game to use the new Dynamix Game
 Development System (DGDS).  As you are about to discover, the world of
 Jake Masters is unlike anything you've seen in computer gaming.  Because
 of this, it's important that you understand the elements that make Heart of
 China so unique.

 The characters have character...
 The characters in Heart of China all have personalities and a past...  its
 important to remember this when you deal with them.  Also, just like real
 people, they remember things that you've said or done to them.  Keep this in
 mind because everything you say and do will affect their actions in the
 future.

 Time clicks on...
 Time passes in the world of Jake Masters. This means that, just like in the
 real world, things happen with or without you.  It also means that the
 passage of time becomes a factor in everything you do.

 You are the main characters...
 Heart of china unfolds almost entirely through the eyes and minds of three
 main characters.  What they see you see.  What they know you know.  There's a
 lot of informaton locked away in the minds of these individuals.  Each one
 has different skills and knowledge... learn to use them.

 What you see is what you get...
 In Heart of China. you don't type commands to make things happen.  You enter
 Jake Master's world and physically make things do what you want them to do.
 This is one of the most revolutionary concepts of the game.  Through the use
 of a point-and-click interface, you actually pick up objects and use them.
 Want to start a tank?  Simply pick up the keys, place them in the ignition
 and turn the key.  It's simple yet incredibly powerful.  The point-and-click
 commands are fully explained in the following pages.  Mastery of the basic
 techniques takes only moments, after which you can begin to explore, learn
 and grow in your interacbve abilities.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           *****************
                           * Plot Branches *
                           *****************

 One of the most unique, and potentially overlooked, elements of Heart of China
 is the multiple ways in which you can proceed through game play.  These
 multiple "plot paths" are present because the interactive storyline of Heart
 of China is NOT LINEAR in design.  There are often several ways to proceed
 into the story when faced with a puzzle or obstacle.  It's important to
 remember that your actions affect the flow and direction of the adventure you
 are playing... you truly "interact" with the game.  There are several
 entirely different endings to the story.  The ending that you experience, and
 the paths you take to reach that ending, are completely dependent upon the
 actions and decisions that you make throughout gameplay.

 Plot Branch Alert
 Because of the numerous options that plot paths present, it's important that
 you're aware when you've chosen a story pathway that could have been
 approached from a different direction.  That's why the Plot Branch alert is
 used.  It will appear at any point in the adventure when you've chosen a path
 that could have been approached in a different way.  The Plot Branch alert
 won't tell you what you've done that could be done differently, it only
 alerts you to the fact that you have bypassed a potential piece of the story.
 Also, keep in mind that the Plot Branch alert does not tell you if the choice
 you made was the best one, it simply indicates that there was another plot
 path available for you to proceed down.  Remember this if you find yourself
 at a point in the adventure that appears to be a dead end.  If you are
 absolutely "stuck," you may have ventured down a plot path that makes it
 impossible to successfully complete your mission.

 Romance Meter
 Your actions and choices will not only determinine the physical flow of the
 storyline but the relationship between Kate Lomax and "Lucky" Jake Master
 To see how you're doing in the romance department, you can access a Romance
 Meter (a small heart located in the lower left-hand corner of the screen
 during flight sequences) which visually displays Kate Lomax's current
 feelings toward Lucky.  There are three stages to the meter: Passionate,
 Neutral and Cold.  By left clicking on the icon, you'll be able to see a
 story panel that displays, through thought boxes, the feelings that the two
 characters have for one another.

                              *****************

 The essence of Heart of China is the simple action of point-and-click.  The
 small cursor on the screen represents you in the world of "Lucky" Jake
 Masters.  By moving the cursor around Lucky's world and "clicking," you
 interact with his environment.  There are only 3 basic point-and click
 actions:

   1. LOOK: single click the right mouse button while the cursor is placed
            over the object you want to look at.  This will bring up a text
            box Containing information on the object you're looking at.

   2. OPERATE: single click the left mouse button while the cursor is placed
               over the object you want to activate or select.

   3. MOVE: click and hold the left mouse button while the cursor is placed
            over the object you want to pick up and move.

              Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü Ü
              Ü NOTE: not all objects can be picked up so   Ü

 O.K., we lied.  There are more than 3 basic point-and-click commands.  We
 didn't want to discourage you! Besides, the following advanced point-and-click
 techniques are really just extensions of the big 3. Really... no spreadsheet
 functions or multi-event video cassette recorder features here.  Just the
 simple point-and-click with a bit of flare thrown in for added excitement.
 So hang in there with us! There are only 3 more clicks between you and the
 point-and-click big league.


   1. MAIN INVENTORY: Right click while the cursor is placed on Inventory
                      Icon, Windows showing a character's status and the
                      current inventory objects he or she is holding.


   2. QUICK INVENTORY: Left click while the cursor is placed on the lnventory
                       Icon.  Only your inventory window.

   3. USE: While a character is holding a usable object, such as a gun, you
           can select that object for USE by clicking and holding the right
           mouse button.  While the right button is held down the cursor
           will change to indicate that the particular item has been selected.


   USE + OPERATE: While an object is selected for USE and the on-screen cursor
   is showing the icon for the selected object, it can be OPERATED like all
   other objects, by single clicking the left mouse button.


 USING OBJECTS THAT A CHARACTER IS CARRYING
 To USE objects that a character is carrying, simply click and hold the right
 mouse button.  The on-screen cursor will change to indicate that the specific
 object being held has been selected for USE.. When the object is selected for
 USE, it can be OPERATED in the same way as other.  There will be times when
 the character's hand can be used as an object.  When the player uses a
 character's hand (holding no other objects) in this way, the cursor will
 change to display a hand.

 That's it.  You can now look at objects, move them and operate them.  You can
 also select and use objects that a character is carrying. Very simple, very
 easy, low-stress interaction.  On the following pages are more tips and
 techniques that will help you understand the interaction techniques used in
 Heart of China.  Elements such as inventory use, talking with other
 characters, game play options and more in-depth use of the cursor are
 explained.

                             * The Smart Cursor *
                             ********************

 "Hey! My cursor keeps changing!"
 Yes, that's right.  The cursor you know and love changes in DGDS games when
 moved over certain items.  That's because it's small and wants to tell you
 something about what it's pointing at.

 In addition to pointing in different directions, the cursor will, at times,
 completely change shape to inform you about items, places or people you
 should pay attention to.  We've taken the liberty of interpreting this
 language of cursor-ease for you.


    *  When the cursor changes to an exit sign it's telling you that by left
       clicking on this spot you can enter another room.

    *  When the cursor changes to a pointed exit it's differentiating between
       two closely placed, but different, exits.

    *  If the cursor changes to a conversation bubble, you can left click to
       engage in a conversation with the person the cursor is pointng at.

    *  If the cursor changes to a magnifying glass, it's your cue that you can
       left click to "zoom in" and get a closer look at what the cursor is
       pointing at.

    *  In some situations the cursor will change to a hand icon.  This tells
       you that the character may engage in hand-to-hand contact with the
       items on-screen.

                            * Multiple Characters *
                            ***********************

 While travelling, you'll find that you can pick up companions who will travel
 with you.  Because characters have their own strengths and weaknesses, you'll
 find the need to place different individuals in "control." The characters
 present in your party are represented by icons located in the bottom corners
 of the screen.  The Inventory Icon is located in the lower right-hand corner
 of the screen and always represents the character that is controlling the
 action.  The Secondary Character Icon is located in the lower left-hand
 corner and always indicates a secondary traveller who is not controlling the
 action.

 SWITCHING ACTIVE CHARACTERS
 Choosing which character to lead the adventure is an important part of puzzle
 solving in Heart of China.  Because each character has specialized skills,
 you'll need to pick who does what to successfully complete your quest.  You
 can switch the Secondary Character with the Controlling Character by simply
 left clicking on the Secondary Character Icon.

                           *********************

 INVENTORY ICON
 Located on the bottom right corner of all game play windows, the Inventory
 icon represents the Controlling Character.  It's use is straightforward and
 very simple.

   *  To give an object to one of the characters, simply move the item on the
      top of that character's icon and drop it.

   *  To access the Main Inventory Window, right click on the Inventory Icon.

   *  To access the Quick Inventory Window, left click on the Inventory Icon.

   *  To use an object, the current holder of that object must be the
      controlling character.

 MAIN INVENTORY WINDOW
 Accessed by right clicking on the Inventory Icon, the Main Inventory Window
 gives you control over all items that you have placed into a character's
 inventory.  You can drop the items from inventory, give them to the character
 to use or transfer them to the Secondary Character's inventor to use.

 QUICK INVENTORY WINDOIN
 Accessed by left clicking on the Inventory Icon, the Quick Inventory Window
 shows you only the object inventory.  While you will not be able to use the
 inventory items on the character from this menu, you can quickly move objects
 from inventory.

                                **************

 Using objets in the world of Heart of China is easy.  Simply move objects to
 where you want them to be used or perform an action on objects that need
 something to be done to them.

   *  If you want to pick something up off the ground and put it in your
      inventory, you simply move the object onto the Inventory Icon (or
      Secondary Character Icon) and drop it.

   *  If you want to use an item on something, simply take it out of inventory
      and drop it on the thing you wish to use it on.  If you want to give an
      object to a character (besides Chi, Kate, or Lucky), do the same.

   *  Sometimes to complete a task or solve a puzzle it is necessary for you
      to trade objects between different characters.  This can be accomplished
      easily from either the main or quick inventory screens.

                          * Character Interaction *
                          *************************

 "Character interaction," or talking to other characters, is a vital part of
 Heart of China.  The on-screen cursor will change to the talk bubble when it
 is moved over characters that you can talk to.  To engage in conversation
 with characters, simply left click on them when the talk bubble is active.

                           * Advanced Techniques *
                           ***********************

 Here are a few tips and hints that will be helpful once you've mastered the
 basics.

 TIME
 In Heart of China, time is an ever-present companion. People come and go,
 change moods and respond to the passages of time, just as people in
 the rael world do. Also, you must remember that each day that Lucky delays in
 recuing Kate he loses $20,000 dollars. This means that if you make a mistake
 and have to wait around to correct it... it's going to cost you!

 INVENTORY AND OBJECTS
 Always remember that objects can be dragged directly from the quick inventory
 window to the game environment. If you need to give an object to another
 character or use an object from inventory on an object in the current room,
 simply move the object from Quick Inventory to the place desired.

 CHARACTER INTERACTION
 The display duration for dialogue boxes shown during character interaction
 can be controlled in two ways.

   1. The operate command (left click) will immediately move you to the next
      dialogue box.

   2. The TEXT SPEED settings in the VCR MENU section can be adjusted to speed
      up or slow down the display duration of all dialogue boxes.

 CURSOR ICONS AND LIMITED KNOWLEDGE
 Generally speaking, the "smart cursor" in Heart of China will alert you to
 areas in interest by changing the direction it points or by changing shape.
 However, there is a limitation to the cursor's intelligence. It can only tell
 you what the controlling character knows about. For instance, if you're
 trying to locate something hidden in a room and Lucky doesn't know where the
 object is, the cursor will not change to indicate the item.  In some
 instances locating hidden objects requires the trial and error approach,
 using the OPERATE and LOOK commands to investigate areas where a character's
 knowledge is limited.

 THOUGHT BOXES AND DESCRIPTION BOXES
 When you issue a LOOK command, you will get one of two types of descriptions
 boxes:

   1. THOUGHT BOX Shown when a character has a personal comment about what you
      are looking at.  Thought boxes give insight into each of the main
      characters and valuable clues on game play.

   2. DESCRIPTION BOX Offers text descriptions of whatever you are looking at.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        *******************************
                        * Meanwhile & Story Sequences *
                        *******************************

 Heart of China operates in a living environment where events are happening
 all the time, whether you're present or not. When an event of interest occurs
 and you aren't there to witness it, a Meanwhile Screen will pop up
 introducing a sequence that shows you what's occurring. Meanwhile sequences
 are intended to convey information that heightens the cinematic experience of
 the story. It's important to note that these sequences are not interactive,
 you can't affect them, and the information given in the sequences isn't known
 to your game alteregos unless the character is pictures in the sequence. The
 fact that characters aren't knowledgeable of the events shown in meanwhile
 sequences is important to remember. It means that their questions and
 responses to other characters will only deal with elements that they are
 aware of.

                            * Keyboard Controls *
                            *********************

 The keyboard equivalents for mouse and joystick controls have been simplified
 and combined to make keyboard play less frustrating.

 Cursor Movement
 The cursor is controlled on the keyboard by the Arrow keys on the numeric
 keypad and the Tab key.  When continually pressed, the Tab key will cycle
 through known. active object locations.  The combination of Shift + Tab will
 cycle the cursor in the opposite direction.

    press Tab key once = move cursor to next object.
    press Shift + Tab once = move cursor to previous object.

 Pick Up/Drop & Operate Commands
 The multiple commands used for OPERATE and MOVE have been combined into one
 keystroke on the keyboard.  Pressing the Spacebar or 5 on the numeric keypad
 will operate objects that can be activated and Pick up or Drop objects that
 can be moved.

    press Spacebar or keypad 5 once Pick up or OPERATE object.
    press Spacebar or keypad 5 again Drop or OPERATE object again.


 Look Command
 The LOOK command is controlled by the ENTER key.

    press ENTER key once = LOOK at an object.

 VCR Menu
 The VCR Menu can be brought up at any time during game play by pressing the
 ESC key.  a Press ESC = bring up VCR Menu.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            ********************
                            * Action Sequences *
                            ********************

 The action sequences are interwoven into the evolving story.  If they are
 completed successfully, or if you choose to skip them, normal game play will
 resume.

 THE CHENGDU TANK SIMULATION
 The control of the tank is fairly straightforward.  You can move forward at
 two speeds, turn left or right and fire your single shell cannon.

   MOUSE CONTROL: left click on the desired Mouse Control Pad action icon to
   make the tank move, fire, turn or stop.

   JOYSTICK: Increase Speed = Joystick Forward
             Decrease Speed = Joystick Back
             Fire Cannon = Button #1
             

   KEYBOARD: Increase Speed = Numeric Keypad 8
             Decrease Speed = Numeric Keypad 2
             Fire Cannon = Space Bar
             Stop Tank = Numeric Keypad 5.


 THE ORIENT EXPRESS TRAIN BATTLE
 In the Orient Express action sequence, you "direct" Lucky from a side view as
 he strives to drive his attacker off the back of the speeding train.

   MOUSE CONTROLS: Directing Lucky's actions during battle are as simple as
   left clicking the command on the Mouse Control Pad.

   JOYSTICK: Attack = Button #1
             Rest = Joystick Forward
             Duck = Joystick Back

   KEYBOARD: Attack = A
