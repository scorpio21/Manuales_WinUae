THE CODEMASTERS REMOTE LINK SYSTEM

To set up this link, you must first have a Null Modem cable or
Midi cable. Amiga owners will only be able to use the Null
Modem cable. These leads can easily be acquired from your
local computer specialist.

Insert the cable into the correct port on your computer. You
may need to refer to your computer's manual for this. Now
take the other end of the lead and connect to the other
computer.

Now load the game as normal and select the option for two
player mode, requesting RS232 for the modem lead, or Midi
depending upon the lead you are using.

The game will operate as usual except you will now be racing
head-to head against the player on the other computer.

The game will link an Amiga to ST but you will require a Null
Modem cable to do this as well as an Amiga and ST copy of the
game.
