THE STREET SEGMENTS AND THE DRONE CARS .

FINALLY A HINT FOR MAKING NEW TRACKS SUCCESSFULLY , IT IS EASIER TO START 
WITH THE STREET SEGMENTS FIRST . IT USUALLY TAKES SOME EXPERIMENTING AND A 
COUPLE OF TRIES TO MAKE A CLOSED RACE TRACK . WHEN THR STREET SEGMENTS ARE 
FINE , YOU CAN START ADDING BUILDINGS , FIELDS AND CARS .



COMPONENTS OF A HARD DRIVIN II RACE TRACK
-----------------------------------------

THE HARD DRIVIN II EDITOR GENERATES AND WORKS WITH HARD DRIVIN II TRACKS .
THESE TRACKS CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS ,


OBJECTS :

OBJECTS ARE MOSTLY BUILDING OR STREET SIGNS . YOU CAN INSERT/DELETE THEM , 
ROTATE OR MOVE THEM AROUND . THEY DON'T AFFECT THE TRACK OR YOUR CAR ( AS
LONG AS YOU DON'T BUMP INTO ONE OF THEM ) THEY SIMPLY ADD SOME REALISM AND
FLAVOUR TO THE TRACK .


STREET SEGMENTS :

THE STREET ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY FORM THE 
TRACK . IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE A TRACK WITHOUT OBJECTS/CARS AND BARRIERS , 
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE A VALID TRACKS WITHOUT AT LEAST ONE CLOSED LOOP OF STREET 
SEGMENTS .


STREET ELEMENT :

EACH SEGMENT CONSIST OF ONE OR MORE ELEMENTS . THE STRAIGHT A SEGMENTS FOR 
INSTANCE HAS ONE ELEMENT , THE STRAIGHT C SEGMENT HAS 6 AND THE HILL SEGMENT 
HAS 9 ELEMENTS . IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ADD OR DELETE A SINGLEELEMENT BUT
YOU CAN CLICK ON AN ELEMENT TO SET A CHECKPOINT OR RETURNPOINT OR TO USE IT 
AS THE START OR FINISH .


BARRIERS :

YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 30 INVISIBLE BARRIERS ON THE TRACK . THEIR MAIN TASK IS
TO BLOCK ANY POSSIBLE SHORTCUTS BETWEEN STREET SEGMENTS . THE EDITOR 
DISPLAYS THEM AS THIN WHITE LINES WHICH YOU CAN ROTATE OR MOVE AROUND BY 
CLICKING UP THEIR ENDPOINTS .


CARS :

YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 12 DRONE CARS TRAVELLING ON BOTH TRACKS . THESE DRONE 
CARS ARE COMPUTER CONTROLLED AND NAVER LEAVE THE STREET SEGMENTS . BUT YOU 
CAN SET THEIR START POSITION , DIRECTION AND LANE .


TRACK 1/2 :

A HARD DRIVIN RACETRACK CONSISTS OF ONE OR TWO TRACKS . YOU ALWAYS NEED 
TRACK 1 , WHICH HAS TO BE A CLOSED LOOP OF STREET SEGMENTS WITH ONE START 
ELEMENT , ONE FINISH ELEMENT AND A CHECKPOINT . A SECOND TRACK , TRACK 2 , 
CAN BE ADDED USING A JUNCTION SEGMENT . THE SECOND MUST HAVE ONE CHECHPOINT 
AND ITS LAST STREET ELEMENT MUST TOUCH ANY ELEMENT OF TRACK 1 . AN EXAMPLE ,
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL TRACK , YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE SPEEDTRACK 
IS TRACK 1 , BECAUSE IT CONTAINS THE START AND THE FINISH . THE STUNT TRACK 
IS TRACK 2 . THE HILL SEGMENTS LINKS IT TO TRACK 1 , AND ITS LAST ELEMENT 
JOINS UP WITH TRACK 1 IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE FINISH .


JUNCTIONS :

IF YOU WISH TO USE TRACK 2 YOU WILL NEED TO INSERT A JUNCTION SEGMENT INTO 
THE TRACK 1 . THEN YOU CAN SELECT EITHER TRACK 1 OR TRACK 2 TO ADD NEW 
STREET SEGMENTS . ONLY ONE JUNCTION SEGMENT IS ALLOWED .


CHECKPOINT :
