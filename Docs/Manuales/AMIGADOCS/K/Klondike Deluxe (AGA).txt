                       KLONDIKE DELUXE V1.0 
                       ====================

                                                RE-TYPED BY SHARD - DTL

1.INTRODUCTION.
---------------

Before  we start, please understand that English is not our native language
and  the  short  time  available  to  type this document made the use of an
English  Dictionary  impossible.   So,  please  forgive us the probable big
amount of errors.

In  January  of  this year we decided to try something else on the amiga as
the  usual  stuff.  You guessed it, we wanted to make a game for the Amiga.
After  a  long  and  difficult  discussion into what kind of game we should
make,  we  decided  that  the  game was going to be a klondike game for the
Amiga with digitized pictures.

2.GAMEPLAY.
-----------

For  those  of  you  who  don't know how to play klondike don't panic, I'll
explain this in the following sections.

In  the  initial setup of klondike there are seven rows in the upper of the
screen.  In the first row lies one card, in the second two and so on, until
in  the  last  row there are seven.  You can only see the front side of the
first cards in one row.
 
In  the stock which is in the lower left corner of the screen, are the rest
of the cards.  You can now put a card of one color, on the other color, but
these cards must follow up each other.  e.g.  You can put a red three, on a
black  four.  Types of cards are not very important at this point.  You can
get cards to do this from another row or the stock in the lower left of the
screen.

If  you  can't change something in the upper of the screen.  You must click
on the stock to rotate the cards in the stock and you get a new card on top
of  the  stock.   Dependent  of the level the stock turns with one or three
cards.

On  the  four  ace  places in the lower right of the screen you can put the
aces,  followed  by  a two, three and so on.  This must be the same type of
card.  e.g.  spades.

If  you  have  a king you can put it on an empty place in the upper screen.
You can only do this with a king !!!!!

If  you played it right all cards of one kind lie on top of each other from
ace  to king.  If everything went right only the four ace places are filled
with all the cards and the rest of the screen is empty.

3.INSTALLER.
------------

With the installer you can put this game on your hard drive.

The installer makes a directory automatically called Reko-Productions.

Just click the icon and the official commodore installer does it's work.

4.PREFSFILE.
------------

In this file you can put the initial settings of the game.

You can do this by editing a small text file called REKO.PREFS.

In this file are the following lines:

#W=1    Workbench:  0=Off 1=On
#M=1    Music:      0=Off 1=On
#L=C    Level:      A=Easy B=Normal C=Hard
#C=0   Cardset:    0 to 9 at startup
#0=cards/Default.REKO
#1=cards/Default.REKO
#2=cards/Default.REKO
#3=cards/Defualt.REKO
#4=cards/Default.REKO
#5=cards/Default.REKO
#6=cards/Default.REKO
#7=cards/Default.REKO
#8=cards/Default.REKO
#9=cards/Default.REKO
#.

You can edit this prefs file with a simple edit tool. e.g. ed.

If  you  want to change something just take the right letter.  e.g.  If you
want doublepal, just type in first line :  #R=D

This  also applies for the other lines.  In the lines :  #1= / #9=, you can
choose which cardsets you can pick in the game.

5.KEYS.
----------

During the game you can change some things :

Press <a> for level a.
Press <b> for level b.
Press <c> for level c.

Press <w> for closing/opening workbench.

Press <m> for music on/off

Press <0> to <9> for different card sets.

Press <r> to restart a card game.

Press <Esc> to stop playing.

6.GENERAL.
----------

Level  A  :   the stock turns 1 card at a time.  And you can move part of a
row.

Level  B  :  the stock turns 3 cards at a time.  And you can move part of a
row.

Level C :  the stock turns 3 cards at a time.  And you can't move part of a
row.

To  move  cards  you  first  must  select  a  card  by clicking on the left
mousebutton  and  then you must click on the destination card with the left
mouse button.

Some little things:

- You can move cards automatically to the ace places by double   clicking 
  on the left mouse button.

- You can deselect a card with the right mouse button.

- If you make a wrong card move the source card will be deselected.

- You only get the bonus if you play it in level C.

- Wrong choices 'Screenflash'.

- It is possible to choose a lower level while playing. If you choose a 
  higher level the game restarts.


7.HOW TO MAKE A OWN CARD SET AND WHY ?
--------------------------------------

OK, last things first:

                       Why?
                       ====

Due  to  the effort we made to bring you this game, we hope you will reward
this by making a cardset for us.

Sending  us  a  cardset  not only tells us you like our game (so we keep on
improving it), but also gives us some other cardsets to play with.

For this reason we also organized ........

             THE CONTEST 
             -----------

If  we receive five or more cardsets a month, we intend to choose the three
best  ones,  which  will be rewarded.  If we receive less cardsets, we wait
until we received at least five (5 disks).

First prize winner gets the second and third best set (2 disks).

Second prize winner gets the first and third best set (2 disks).

Third prize winner gets the first best set (1 disk).

The  two  extra  disks  used  will be from the two worst sets of the month.
This makes the minimum number of disks mentioned before so it won't cost us
any extra disks.

In  this  way  it  will  cost us just the prize of the stamps to return the
disks.

In  case  we receive more than five disks a month, we keep these disks as a
kind of payment for the job we did.  These disks will however be re-entered
in  the  contests  of  months to come, so one great month of cardsets won't
blow your chance on winning a prize.


We also change the first card of the winning sets into e.g. 

                        /----------------\
                        |                |
                        | Mrs. CardMaker |
                        |                |
                        |   1st prize    |
                        |                |
                        |    july 93     |
                        |                |
                        |                |
                        |                |
                        |Congratulations |
                        |                |
                        |      from      |
                        |                |
                        |REKO-Productions|
                        |                |
                        \----------------/

This card will also been sent to the winners, to put in their own set.  (It
would be stupid to send your own cardset back, wouldn't it)

If possible, these cardsets will also be spread world-wide (in PD).

REMEMBER:   only  winners get their disks back.  So don't send us envelopes
with  stamps  to  send  back  your  disk(s), because we won't.  Anyway, the
stamps  will  probably  cost you more than the disk(s).  Also any envelopes
without  enough  stamps  or  stamps  that  are  tampered  with  will not be
accepted!!!

OK, I hope you will enjoy making cardsets for our game and keep'm coming.

Oh yeah, don't forget to mention your name and address in a textfile on the
disk.   This  way  we  always know which cardset belongs to who.  Otherwise
you'll never get any reply from us.

And now first things last: 

                     HOW to make a REKO cardset.
                     ===========================

To begin with there are a number of important values:

Screentype . . . . . . : hires (16 colors). 
CardHeight . . . . . . : 130 pixels. 
CardWidth  . . . . . . :  88 pixels.
Number of cards  . . . :  55 (CARD00 - CARD54)
The order of the cards : CARD00 = REKO-Production card 
                         (Please use the one we provided, or make one
                          which also mentions REKO-Productions)
                         CARD01 = Only a border to show an empty place on
                                  the table
                         CARD02 = The back of your pack of cards
                         CARD03 = Ace of Clubs
                         CARD04 = Ace of Diamonds
                         CARD05 = Ace of Hearts
                         CARD06 = Ace of Spades
                         CARD07 = Two of Clubs
                           .            .
                           .            .
                           .            .

                         CARD53 = King of Hearts
                         CARD54 = King of Spades

Remember, all the cards of one set have to use the same color palette.

The values mentioned above are absolutely neccesary!

A few helpful pictures are in the subdirectory MAKE-CARDS:

- REKO-Cutter1
- REKO-Cutter2

*--------------------------- Blue background

- BLUE/CARD00  (REKO-Productions)
- BLUE/CARD01  (Empty Position)
- BLUE/FRAME   (Border)
- BLUE/SYMBOLS (All cardsymbols)

OK, let's start:

- Get 53 different pictures.

- Change  their size  so you can cut out a card 88 x 130 big.  (You can use
  the cutters in MAKE-CARDS, to get the right size and to remove the corner
  pixels.     Load     your     picture     in     a     paint-     program
  (DPAINT/VISIONAPAINT/TRUEPAINT????)and use the cutter as brush. Then press
  the paint backgroundcolor-button.)

- Use a  program  (TAD/ADPRO/IMAGE-FX/IMAGEMASTER-PRO????) in which you can
  lock  your pallete to  get  all your palletes the same.  (Load your first
  picture (eg. CARD00), lock the palette, load the next, render new colors,
  save second picture, load the next and so on....)

- Don't forget  to  adjust the pallette of a SYMBOLS and CARD01 file if you
  don't intent to use one of our CARD00 cards.

- If you  want  a  border  around  your  cards,  you could use a FRAME from
  MAKE-CARDS.

- Now  put  the  SYMBOLS in your cards.  (Don't place them  to low, because
  then you won't be able to read them when your cards are overlapping.)

- At this point you should have 55 pictures, with matching palettes and all
  88 x 130 pixels big.

- Rename  these  pictures  so  their  names are xxxxxx00 to xxxxxx54, where
  xxxxxx is whatever you like but is the same for all 55.

- Open a shell.

- Make the subdirectory which contains your cards the current one.

- At  this  point  you  have to use the REKO command, so make sure it is in
  your search-path.  (HD-install has put it in your C:  directory.)

- Type on the commandline:  REKO xxxxxx00 55 Now a cardset is being created
  in your RAM-Disk  with  the  name  card.reko.  If everything went fine it
  should be 314670 bytes long.

- All you  have  to  do  now is rename it to whatever you like (no embedded
  spaces),  put it in  the  CARDS  subdirectory  and change your REKO-Prefs
  accordingly.

Well, thats all folks,                                  Happy Cardmaking, 

                                                        REKO-Productions
