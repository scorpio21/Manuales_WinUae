KING'S QUEST V

Long ago, in the kingdom of Daventry, there were three magical treasures
that kept the kingdom strong and prosperous: A magic mirror that 
foretold the future, an enchanted shield with the power to overthrow
any invaders, and a treasure chest that was never empty.  These treasures
were taken from Daventry by deception and stealth, and without them
Daventry grew poor and weak and King Edward, once a stout-hearted and
vigorous ruler, had become powerless and sickly.  Edward had no heir,
and everyone feared the chaos that would result on his death.

Page 5 \/

King Edward asked his bravest knight, Sir Graham, to embark upon a quest
to recover the three treasures.  Graham's quest was successful, and as
his reward, King Edward named Sir Graham his heir and granted him the
throne of Daventry.  The chronicles of Graham's search for the royal
treasures of Daventry are recounted in King's Quest I: Quest for the
Crown.

King Graham was a wise and kindly monarch, and with his great wisdom
and the return of the three treasures, Daventry prospered once again.
But Graham knew that he must soon marry and establish his own royal line
with an heir to his throne.  He searched far and wide, but no maiden in
the kingdom possessed the qualities he sought in a queen.

One day King Graham saw in his magic mirror a vision of a lovely young
woman held prisoner in a crystal tower.  The mirror told him that her
name Valanice, a girl both beautiful and good, who had been stolen
from her home and taken to a far land.  Graham vowed to find her and
set her free.  After a long journey with many trials, he did, and asked 
her to be his queen.  The chronicles of Graham's perilous journey to
rescue the lovely Valanice are related in King's Quest II: Romancing
the Throne.

In time, Queen Valanice and King Graham became the parents of twins,
a son and a daughter.  Life in Daventry was peaceful and good - for
a time.

In a land far away lived an evil and powerful wizard named Manannan.
It was his wont to kidnap infant boys and raise them to be his slaves,
killing each in turn before he was full-grown and could pose a threat
to the wizard's dominance.  His most recent vassal, a boy

Page 6 \/

he called Gwydion, was, however, unusually bright and perceptive.
He mastered several of Manannan's spells and turned them against
him to gain his freedom.

After a time, Gwydion's travels brought him to Daventry, not the 
lovely and peaceful Daventry of days gone by, but a land devastated
by a terrible affliction.  The kingdom had fallen victim to the
ravages of a dreadful three-headed dragon, which had burned the land
all around and killed many people.

Gwydion was able to use his newfound magical powers to destroy the
dragon and rescue an intended victim from its lair.  He was taken
before the King and Queen and rewarded in such a way as he never 
could have imagined in his life as Manannan's slave.  The chronicles
of Gwydion, his trials and his journeys, are told in King's Quest III:
To Heir is Human.

In later years, King Graham's health began to fail, and the royal
physicians were powerless to help him.  Only a magical fruit from the
faraway land of the Tamir could bring about a cure and restore the
health of Daventry's monarch.  Graham's daughter, Princess Rosella,
set off in pursuit of this healing magic for her father.  On her
journey, she performed many brave deeds, and had many great 
adventures.  The chronicles of Rosella's travels and experiences 
in Tamir are described in King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella.

With the king's health fully restored, and his family together once
more, it was a happy and fulfilled Graham who set out for a walk in
the forest one spring day almost a year since Rosella had returned
from Tamir.  The kingdom was peaceful and

Page 7 \/

prosperous again, and the people were content.  Birds were singing 
in the trees.  It seemed an auspicious sign.

As Graham was contemplating his good fortune, a sharp wind blew into
the woods from the east, whirling up sticks and leaves into his path,
and startling the birds into silence.  The air grew suddenly colder.
It seemed an unexpected storm was approaching.  Graham began to walk
back toward the castle, his joyful mood broken by a dark foreboding.

When he reached the top of the gentle rise overlooking his home, he
was horrified to see only empty space where the royal castle of
Daventry had stood only minutes before.  Cold fear gripped his heart.  
Where was his family?  What had happened to them?
"Whoo-hoo...whoo-hoo."  An owl hooted behind him, but Graham scarcely
heard it over the pounding of his heart.  "I can tell you what happened,"
came a voice behind him, and Graham spun around to confront a large owl
in a blue vest and spectacles.  "I know what happened to your castle.  I 
saw it all," said the owl.

Journey into the magical world of King's Quest once again on a quest for 
the missing castle and the royal family of Daventry.

SAVING YOUR GAME

IMPORTANT!! If you're playing from diskettes, you must have a separate
formatted diskette ready before you can save a game.  Since each disk
can only hold a limited number of games, we recommend that you have
more than one disk formatted, in order to assure adequate space for
save game storage.

To allow for errors in judgement and creative exploration, we recommend
that you frequently save your game in progress, and that you save
several different games from different points as you play.  You will
always want to save your game before encountering potentially
dangerous situations.  You should also save your game after you have
made significant progress.
You may named your saved games using standard English phrases.  For
example, if you are standing on a beach, you might call you game
'standing on beach`, or simply 'beach`.

   CHANGE.
3. Insert a blank formatted diskette in your secondary drive.

Page 29 \/

4. Press [Ctrl-C] to clear the command line, and type the name of your
   secondary drive (example: b: or df1:), and the name of the directory *
   you wish to save to.
5. Select OK, and press [ENTER].
6. Type the description of your saved game, and press [ENTER] to save the
   game. 

HARD DISK USERS

NOTE: If you choose to save games to your hard disk, we suggest that you
create one or more save game directories or folders on your hard disk.
See your computer's instructions for creating directories.
1. Choose the Save/Restore icon (diskette) from the icon bar and select
   SAVE GAME.  The Save Game menu will appear.
2. If you wish to save the game to a directory * other than the one you 
   are currently playing on, select CHANGE DIRECTORY *.  Press [Ctrl-C]
   to clear the command line, and type the drive and name of the new
   directory * .
3. Select OK, and press [ENTER].

RESTARTING YOUR GAME

To restart your game at any time during play, choose the Stop icon
from the icon bar and select START NEW GAME.  The game will begin

MESSAGE WINDOWS

Message windows will appear at various times during the game.  When
you have read the message, press [ENTER] to remove the window and
resume play.

NOTE: Some message windows are program controlled.

LOOK everywhere.  Thoroughly explore your surroundings.  Open doors
and drawers.  Look closely at all objects you encounter or you may
miss important details.

EXPLORE each area of the game very carefully, and DRAW A MAP as you 
progress through the game.  Make a note of each area you visit,
and include information about objects found there and dangerous
areas nearby.  If you miss an area, you may miss an important clue!

GET objects you think you will need.  You can see an inventory of
items on hand by choosing the Inventory icon at any time.

USE the items you have picked up to solve problems in the game.  
Different approaches to a puzzle may bring about a different outcome.

BE CAREFUL, and remain alert at all times - disaster may strike in
the most unlikely of places!

SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN, especially when you are about to try something new
potentially dangerous.  This way, if the worst should happen, you won't
have to start all over again from the beginning.  Save games at 
different points, so you will always be able to return to

Page 31 \/

a desired point in the game.  In effect, this will enable you to travel
backward through time and do things differently if you wish.
