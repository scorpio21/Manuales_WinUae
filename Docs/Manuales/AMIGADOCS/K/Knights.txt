1. Overview
-----------

  number of different dungeons

2. Game starting
----------------
Boot with Knights disk or run it from WB

Wait until game is loaded and irritating demo is over, and then just
press fire of either joystick or space

Because Knight #2 is controlled with joystick 0 (mouse port) selector
may move uncontrollably at the start of the game if mouse is placed
improperly on the board



-------------------
3. Game Controlling 
-------------------
Player #1 (left-side) can only be controlled with joystick #1 (left port)

Player #2 (right-side) can be controlled with joystick #0 (mouse-port)
and/or with cursor keys and right shift

Game can be terminated at any time with ctrl+C when action returns to WB
or CLI

You may switch between CLI or WB and game with LAmiga+A

You may reposition screen at almost every oppurtunity with CTRL+cursors

During game Esc is used to return to game menu and Caps Lock to pause game



----------------------------------------------------
4. Game Menu (Dungeon Enviroment Customization Menu)
----------------------------------------------------
In this menu players can select various aspects of the games.
Up/Down moves cursor and Right/Left changes value
Fire is used to gain additional information, or mark ready status at 'continue'
line



Quest:
------
There are several predetermined quests, which you can select. They are only made
to ease dungeon configuration, and do not include anything that could not be
made manually.
So, if you select some quest and then change, for example, number of gems, game
is identical to selected quest except there are more gems. If you then reduce
gems to original, quest name is still 'Custom' but it is completely identical to
that previously selected



Mission Specification:
----------------------
Main goal in the game. Requirements in each mission:

-Escape from the Dungeon-
Find the required number of gems (see below) and exit, and you are winner

-Duel to the Death-
There is no escape from the dungeon, and because lives are unlimited the only way
to win is to secure all entry points with wand (see below)

-Retrieve Wand and Escape-
You must find wand from the dungeon and escape with it. In addition, you might
need to retrieve some gems (see below)

-Retrieve Book and Escape-
You must find book from the dungeon and escape with it. Again, there might be some
gems which must be collected, too.

-Destroy book with wand-
You must find book, and then bring it to the special pentagram at the top of stairs
(very special place, it is easily distinguished from normal pentagrams)
Then you must find wand and required number of gems and hit that book in penta



Type of Book:
-------------
If you have selected mission with book, there is one hidden into the dungeon.
Book is heavy and fighting with book in hands is impossible, so care should
be taken when carrying it.

-Lost Book of Ashur-
General book with no special place or special effects.

-Necronomicon-
Book of Dark Magic is always in conjurer's room behind locked iron doors. When it
is taken powers are unleashed and many corpses near book are raised as zombies.
In addition, when book is carried Zombie activity is automatically at its maximum...

-Tome of Gnomes-
Book of Gnome Wisdom is always located behind clever traps or mechanical riddles

-Ancient Book of Knowledge-
Book is somewhere, and automatically grants map to its carrier. Alas, enemy is
always aware of your location if you carry it.



Type of Wand:
-------------
If there is any wands in dungeon they are all of same kind. Wands are carried like
any other (melee) weapons and are used like them, too. When used, areas are filled
with magical light. All targets must be physically hit with wand.

-Wand of Destruction-
Destroys any creature or wooden, breakable object

-Wand of Undeath-
Nasty wand which destroys zombies and turns enemy knight into one. In addition, no
zombie will attack wearer of this wand.

-Wand of Open Ways-
Opens target, be it locked door or creature (*grin*)

-Wand of Securing-
Wand is used to 'secure' entry points so that enemy can use them no more. After all
entry points are secured and enemy dies, he have no way to enter dungeon and have
lost the game. Securing door does not prevent securer from entering from that point
(unless other knight has already secured that location...)



Number of Wands:
----------------
This needs no clarification?
Some missions require that there is at least one wand in dungeon



Number of Gems:
---------------
Total number of gems in dungeon.
Gems are almost every time in chests but might be found from tables, too.



Gems Needed:
------------
How many gems must knight carry in addition to any other mission requirements
before he can win. 




Dungeon Type:
-------------
General layout of the dungeon.
If selected type is too 'small' for mission creation, it is automatically 
enlarged.
Snake dungeons are like very board corridors



Premapped:
----------
Option to have dungeon automatically mapped before game



Entry Point:
------------
Where shall knight enter dungeon.
Entry point will keep same unless it is secured by enemy with wand of securing,
when new is randomized.



Starting Gear:
--------------
Knights may have additional equipment at the start of the game. The amouunt of
extra stuff will decrease at each death.



Exit Point:
-----------
Where is located that place from where knight can exit dungeon. If knight arrives
at this location before collecting all required stuff he will be told what does
he still need.



Number of Keys:
---------------
How many different keys (and locks) there are. In addition to these keys, there is
always at least one lock pick which can be used to open any locked door, if time
is no problem...



Pretrapped Chests:
------------------
Some chests might be pretrapped with poison needle or blade spring if this option
is selected.



Amount of Stuff:
----------------
How much varying stuff (see below) there are lying in floor and tables.



Zombie Activity:
----------------
How quickly dead bodies will transform into the corpses and then raise to walk on
Earth...



Vampire Bats:
-------------
How much vampire killer bats there are in the dungeon.



----------------
5. Screen layout
----------------

Your game screen is divided into two parts. Upper part consists of view of room
where your knight currently is.

Lower part includes information (from left to right) like:
-Skulls-
Skulls  tell you how many times you have died. Fortunately lives are unlimited.

-Bottle- 
Bottle tells you your life status and if any special magical effect is currently
affecting you. Colors are told in equipment part (chapter 8). If level of the
liquid have lowered you should find healing potion or visit your entry point

-Equipment-
Any small equipment stuffed to your pouches is shown here.

-Map-
Dungeon map is drawn here.
Knight automatically maps any room where he enters if there are no enemies to stop
him.
In addition, you may get map-scroll, or dungeon might be premapped, when borders
for rooms not yet entered are drawn already.
There is also a scroll named 'Wipe Map'. No need to tell how nasty it is.

You are shown as a blinking dot in your map if are able to map your current room.
In addition, there are scrolls that tell you your opponent's location. He is also
shown as blinking dot in your map.



--------------------------------------
6. Controlling your Knight during game
--------------------------------------

Knight is controlled with joystick (or right sided alternatively with cursors and
right shift)

Shift+Alt is used to make suicide, if need to (never happened, but might be possible)
Use keys on your side to suicide


6.1 Moving
----------
Move your knight to desired direction by pushing joystick to that direction


6.2 Fast item manipulating
--------------------------
Press fire with direction to use your item in hands:

Sword and Maul are used to strike
Axe is throwed or is used to strike depending of your situation
Wand is zapped
Loaded crossbow is fired
Unloaded crossbow, staff or book is dropped

Crossbow is automatically reloaded if you do nothing and have quarrels with you


6.3 Parrying
------------
Your knight will automatically try to parry strikes coming from front, if he
has sword, axe or staff in his hands, and no controller is touched.
Parrying with staff is easier than parrying with sword which is easier than
parrying with axe.
Maul or X-bow are too clumsy and wand too fragile to used as parrying weapon


6.4 Item manipulation in same square
------------------------------------
By pressing fire for a while you are presented with action menu as long as you keep
fire pressed. By pushing joystick to correct direction action shown by icon is
performed. Menu will remain as long as you keep fire button pressed.
Action menu is used to pick up items, drop gems and other stuff,to set bear 
traps and to pick locks.

NOTE: You get default action simply by pressing fire for a very short period.
Default action is picking and dropping items in square. Menu must be used when
gems are dropped, daggers are thrown or bear trap is set.


6.5 Item manipulation in square front of knight
-----------------------------------------------
By first approaching adjacent square and then pressing fire (without releasing 
direction) you are presented with 'approaching' menu, which is used at the same way
as action menu, except actions are different. In this menu you can set traps,
pick locks and put to or take items from chests or tables.

NOTE: Again, you may use short click for default action. Default action is
opening, item taking and closing. Menu must be used when you want to pick lock
or set traps.


NOTE 2: Actions like opening and closing may be done in either menu.
NOTE 3: Menus are normally only used when setting traps/picking locks/throwing
	daggers, because short click is far more easier and faster





---------------------
7. Dungeon Enviroment
---------------------

Dungeon is hostile place with magical items and special places...


7.1 Entry Point
---------------
Place where your knight enters game. If you are damaged visiting your entry point
will heal your damage - slowly.
If enemy uses wand of securing against your entry point, you will be given new
entry point, which is then used for healing and re-entry.


7.2 Exit Point
--------------
Place, which you must find to win (excluding Duel to the death and book destroying)
Normally it is same as your entry point but it might be same as your enemies entry
or even any unknown.
If you must escape the dungeon with some items which you currently does not have,
you will be told what are you missing.


7.3 Pits
--------
There are bottomless pits. Do not enter. 


7.4 Switches
------------
Some switches open doors or close pits. Some drops portucullis to your back. Some 
triggers crossbows inside skulls and walls.


7.5 Pentagrams
--------------
Some pentagrams are harmless.
Others are not, and include powerful conjurations which may transfer your knight 
invisible, invulnerable or even teleport you near your enemy.
Alas, sometimes you change into the zombie.


7.6 Crystal Balls
-----------------
There are crystal balls in some dungeons. Looking into one (approach it) will tell
you where your opponent is in your map.


7.7 Doors and Chests
--------------------
All doors and chests are closed at the start of the game. In addition, they might
be locked. In that case, you must find suitable key or lock picks or simple smash
the door or chest. Unfortunately there are also iron doors which cannot be breaked,
only opened with keys or lock picks




--------------------
8. Stuff in Dungeons
--------------------

Floor and tables are filled with varying stuff...


8.1 Sword
---------
Your knight always have his sword. If you take something big, he puts it to scabbard
till you drop that new item.
Sword is best weapon in melee, but cannot be thrown (Why?! Cries our Conan-clone) 
and is hopelessly bad at breaking things


8.2 Big items
-------------
There are some items that are so big that knight can carry only one with him at 
the time.

-Axe-
Axe is acceptable melee weapon, which can also be thrown. In addition, it is far 
more better than sword when you need to destroy wooden objects

-Maul-
Maul is mighty weapon - against inanimate objects. No wooden, breakable object
can resist its force. In contrast, is it very bad melee weapon.

-Staff-
Staff cannot be used in melee in efficient way, because it is too light to cause
any damage against armored knights. Instead, it is used to disarm traps. If you
open a door or chest with staff in your hands, no trap will strike you.
(NOTE: Because staff is so bad melee weapon it is automatically dropped if you
press fire with direction (in open) If you really want to strike something with
it, you must use menu)

-Crossbow-
Crossbow is powerful weapon - if it is loaded. To load a crossbow, you must have
quarrels and patience. Knight will automatically load crossbow if you have quarrels
and stay in place. If loading is aborted (by moving, for example) it must be
started from start again.

-Bear Traps-
Bear traps in floor are armed or unarmed. Unarmed are harmless and can be picked
up or walked over without fear.
Armed beartraps are open. If knight walks into one he is damaged and stuck for
a while. After that bear trap is unarmed. Armed traps may be 'fired' by striking
them with some item. That will not harm item.
Bear traps may be carried and dropped or set to certain, strategic places. In
addition to slowing down your enemy they are quite useful 'audible alarms' because
firing one will cause enough noise to alarm you.

-Other-
Book and Wands are big items, too. About their special uses read part 4


8.3 Small items
---------------
Some items can be taken and carried with your knight

-Gems-
Some dungeons include gems, which must be at least partially retrieved. Gems are
carried like other small items, but they can be dropped, too.
(Why to drop gems? If you have many gems and your enemy kills you he gets them all
and will easily win. By hiding some of them you know that he will not win if he
just kills you...)

-Quarrels-
Quarrels are needed with crossbow. Either is useless without other.

-Daggers-
Daggers can be thrown from menu. Thay are quite harmless but not completely useless,
and might prove very dangerous when combined with magical quickness and large
quantites.

-Keys-
Keys are needed to open locked doors (well, at least if it is of iron). Fourth key
is lock pick, which can be used to open any lock, given time.

-Poison Needles-
Poison needles are traps that kill knight which tries to open item trapped with 
them unless he has poison immunity or invulnerability (or is equipped with staff)

-Spring Blade-
Set spring blade fires toward direction where it was put into the object if someone
opens or strikes the object. It is as dangerous as crossbow, and can only be
disabled with staff (or by coming from different direction)


8.4 Potions
-----------
There are magical potions in the dungeon, which can be drinked by picking them up.
Effects from them are unpredictable but mostly helpful. Here is list of different
effects and their colors (in your life force potion)

Healing (none) 				Heals your knight to uninjured state
Poison immunity (flashing white)	Gives immunity against poison
Poison (dark green)			Kills you!
Paralyzation (green)			Paralyzes you for a while
Strength* (blue)			Gives you superior strength
Quickness* (violet)			Gives you superior speed
Regeneration* (orange)			Gives you regeneration (auto-healing)
Invisiblity* (black)			Makes you invisible
Super* (multicolored)			Makes you strong, fast and regenerating

(* only one of these may be in effect at the same time)
All effects (except healing) are temporary


8.5 Scrolls
-----------
In addition to potions, there are magical scrolls, too, which are read by picking
them up. They effects are might be similar to potions, but they also have many
different, like:

Map			Map of the dungeon
Teleport		Teleports you near your enemy or him to you
Sensing			Gives you and/or your enemy knowledge of others location
Treasury Sense		Gives you places of any gems, wands or books in area
			which you have already mapped
Invulnerabilty		Makes you invincible
Map Wipe		You lose your map!
Necromancy		You turn into a zombie! (*UAAAAAA*)



-----------
9. Critters
-----------
Dungeons may include some nasty creatures...


9.1 Vampire bats
----------------
Blood-sucking bats with razor-sharp fangs which can pierce even plate armor. They
are quite easily killed but can easily kill panicked knight. In addition, their
sonar cannot be fooled with invisiblity.


9.2 Zombies
-----------
Evil magic will cause corpses to turn into zombies. Zombies only exist to kill 
living knights, they do not disrupt bats. Zombies are tough and can break down
doors and tables, so they can easily wander around dungeon...

10. Notes from Creator    
----------------------

I hope there is enough information in these documents to completely master knights

Creation of this game have been a nice way of spending my time during weekends
and evenings, and finally I feel it is ready enough to be _really_ released

I want to thank my friends for help;

Miku for supplying those awful sound effects...
Rami, Tommi, A.P. and my brother for playtesting and ideas...


And yet again, I repeat:
To fully enjoy this game, _divide_ the screen with something. There is no fun in
invisiblity if your opponent can see you just by looking at your side!


Now, I turn my attention toward Art of War, nicest tank game ever created ;) and
Visual-MUD, enormous gaming creation for UNIX

If you find any apparent bugs send me mail. 

If you like / dislike this game, send me email then, too.

I like email

You can also send me gifts, postcards etc. if you want to :)


So, now back to creating 'smart' bots for Art of war...
