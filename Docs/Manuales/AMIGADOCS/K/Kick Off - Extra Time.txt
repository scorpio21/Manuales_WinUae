INTRODUCTION: The Extra Time is an expansion disc for Kick Off and provides
a number of enhancements to the original game. The pace at all the five
levels has been increased, though the difference in pace between the levels
has been reduced. New attributes of skill in passing,shooting and tackling
play a more decisive role in determining the skill level though the teams
at the NATIONAL level retain some players of international class.

 Addition of 4 new tactics gives the players a choice of 8 tactics
altogether There is also a choice to play in one of three leagues at the
RESERVE, NATIONAL or INTERNATIONAL level. Four new playing surfaces are
provided which together with the NORMAL KICK OFF playing surface gives a
choice of 5 playing surfaces. The playing surfaces have a marked influence
on the bounce, speed and travel of the ball and also effects the pace and
stamina of the players. Another factor to influence the ball while it is in
the air is the wind. The strength of the cross wind and it's up and down
pitch vector are given.

 The instinctive control method of KICK OFF has been retained totally but
enhanced to control the power of the shot and alter it's direction from the
direction of player movement. Similarly, the player can control the Keeper
if he so wishes for Goal Kicks. There is a choice of 9 kicks.

 A new set of Referees has been introduced to control the game more
effectively at the higher level. Bring down the opponent at your peril. You
have been warned!

ATTRIBUTES: Accracy attribute in KICK OFF has been replaced by three new

together with Pace. Aggression and Stamina give more individuality to the

level of the players. The pace of the players at all levels has been

PLAYER CONTROLS: The player controls remain exactly as in Kick Off but with
some enhancements.

STOPPING THE BALL: Press F.B. BEFORE touching the ball. The ball will stop
and is now under playert control.

PASSING: Stop the ball. Move the joystick in the direction you wish to pass
and release the F.B.

DRIBBLING: The ball travel in front of the player. The distance it travels
depends on the speed of the player when he makes contact with the ball. The

MARKER line under the player will turn White as soon as the player touches
the ball and turn Black pixel by pixel. The process is repeated each time
the player touches the ball.

SHOOTING: Press the F.B. AFTER touching the ball. The strength of the shot
is determined by how many pixels of the marker line are white. Greater the
number, more powerful is the shot. Timing is all important. The direction
of the shot can also be changed by moving the joystick left or right, up or
down. The change in direction will be perceptible but not vast.

KEEPER CONTROL: The Keeper control for defending the penalties remains the
same. The player is also given the control of the Keeper for Goal Kicks, if
he so desires.To keep the game flow, if the player fails to exercise
control, the computer assumes the Keeper control as in Kick Off. The player
must therefore exercise the option quickly and well before the computer
goes into default mode.

There are 9 types of goal kicks:

                                 HARD AHEAD
