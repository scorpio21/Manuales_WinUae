                              KID GLOVES 2
                           'The Journey Back'
                           ==================

INTRODUCTION:
-------------

So Kid has hung up his gloves...

After his death-defying adventure, Kid finally made it home to safety, and put
away his magic boxing gloves.
Storing  them in the dark recesses of his attic (along with his baseball cap),
he vowed to forget the gloves and their supernatural properties.

But as time passes the magical power of the gloves engulfs Kid once again, and
he embarks on a new and more extraordinary adventure, this time accompanied by
his girlfriend Frida...

The  magic  worlds of the gloves are now ruled by Wievallard, an  evil  wizard
hungry  for  power  and  pleasure.  As  soon  as  he spots Kid's girlfriend, a
dastardly  plan  for  kidnap forms in his mind, and she is whisked away by his
overpowering sorcery, to be imprisoned in his mountain stronghold.

Now  Kid  is  searching  the  mysterious magic worlds, hot on the trail of his
beloved girlfriend and the  wizard Wievallard. Your task is to help Kid in his
undertaking - but  beware  of  the  evils  that abound in this arcane world of
magic and mystery!


CHARACTERS:
===========

A  vile  spell  has  been  cast over all of the creatures on the island within
Wievallard, the evil wizard's, domain.

This  forces  them  to  defend  the  island to the death, but don't worry - by
killing them you're setting them free to go and live in happiness and freedom,
where evil wizards cannot reach them.

Penguins            Inhabiting  the  icy regions these guys will run up to you
                    and peck you to death with their beaks. Not very nice.

Snakes              Usually  stationary,  but some snakes are able to cough up
                    fireballs, so be careful.

Teddy Bears         Unfortunately  these geezers are not out for a picnic, and
                    some of them are in fact fast movers.

Snow Balls          Bouncing blobs of ice with a mean streak.

Fish                Back home you need to eat these for dinner,but now they're
                    trying to turn the table on you.

Turtles             Surprisingly fast movers.Some jump around making them even
                    harder to hit.

Octopus             Don't admire  the  legs  too  long  or  they'll be wrapped
                    around your neck.

Hungry Piranhas     These  can catch you unawares by leaping from the water in
                    an attempt to chew your ankles.

Red-Backed Knobble-
kneed Spiders       Found nearly everywhere, these guys are some of Wievallard
                    favourite guardians.

Members of the Grim 
Reaper Training
Academy             These  students  haven't  quite  got  the  right idea yet.
                    They'll  try to take you down to Hades before you're dead.

Dancing Flames      These fiery friends will try to barbecue anything in sight

Pointy Tailed
Scopions            A  fast  formidable foe, armed with a deadly stingy thingy
                    in its butt.

Fearless Pharaohs   Guarding  their treasures these chaps will do all they can
                    to halt your progress.

Baby Dragons        Old  enough  to  spew fire but being immature their scales
                    aren't  fully  developed  making them fairly easy to kill.
                    This  is not the case when it comes to their mother at the
                    end of the Fire Island.

Fluffy Killer
Clouds              Despite their appearance these little blighters are deadly
                    clumps of vapour.

Acid Raindrops      Blobs of water with seriously corrosive tendencies.

                And now for the bad guys !!!

Greater Fanged Yeti One  of  Wievallard's first experiments in genetic engine-
                    ering.  Taking a hippopotamus and crossing it with a sabre
                    toothed  polar bear he created this abomination to protect
                    the northern area of his domain.

Celis, Siren of
the Seas            Because  his  goldfish were to placid and his piranhas too
                    small,  Wievallard  employed a terrifying mermaid to guard
                    his  coral  reefs.  Going  by  the  name  of Celia she has
                    dazzled  men with her beauty, only to dash their hopes and
                    dreams  by  removing  their  heads.  She'll  prove to be a 
                    handful!

Big Mother Dragon   Mother  of many baby dragons, this monster is very protec-
                    tive  of  her  offspring.  She'll  be outraged if you even
                    tread  on  a  measly little spider. By the time you get to
                    her she is bound to be mad!

Grand Mummy         A while back Wievallard went on a world cruise and brought
                    this mummified moron back from Egypt as a souvenir. Tiring
                    of  the  mummy's  hugging, the evil wizard sent him off to
                    guard the desert lands.

Hawk, Guardian of
the Wind Island     Mr.  Hawk  used  to  be  a placid kestrel until Wievallard
                    introduced  him  to anabolic steroids, turning him into an 
                    aggressive, irritable, feather bound freak.

Wievallard, the
evil wizard         Despite  his  immense  power  and high IQ, Wievallard is a
                    very  lonely  old  man.  Rumour  has it that his mum was a 
                    witch,  who  tested  all  her  spells  on him. Due to this
                    unstable  unpredictable  he  grew to despise all women and
                    didn't  like  men  very much either. Becoming a recluse he
                    decided to learn about the mystic arts that had caused him
                    so many problems as a child.

Fireballs           Usually  given  in  fives,  these are great for long range
                    fighting. Pull down on joystick and press fire.
Nasty Critters      These come in threes, and are operated in the same way as
                    fireballs. The difference is that instead of shooting off
                    horizontally  these  guys  bounce  on  the ground and are
                    therefore ideal for dropping down onto things.

                    charge.  Well,  it'll cost you the ten crowns, but it's a
                    bargain. Honest!
Big Boots           Grap  a  pair  of  these  and you can trample the bad guys
                    underfoot. Be careful though, you can't use your weapon if
                    your wearing these.
Trainers            The  fantastic  new  helium-filled soles on these designer
                    trainers  will  enable  you to make jumps higher than ever
                    before!
Balloon             Grab  onto  one  of  these and you can float about to your
                    heart's desire.You can't use your weapon when your holding
                    the  balloon,  but  you can fire critters and fireballs if
                    you pull down and then press fire. Just pressing fire will
                    pop the balloon and allow you to drop back to earth.
Ankh                This mystic item is very useful if you die because it will
                    allow  you to keep all the weapons that you have collected
                    so  you  can  use them in your next life. Unfortunately in
                    doing  this  is  destroys itself. If the countdown reaches
                    zero  before  you  reach  the  exit you will start loosing
                    energy,  unless you have the Ankh. When the timer runs out
                    it will reset, but again you will lose the Ankh.
Clock               Running  out  of  time? then this is for you. Pick this up
                    and the countdown will reset.
Nasty Poison        Apart  from the dagger this is the only object you'll want
                    to  avoid.  Gobble this up and you'll lose a whole unit of
                    energy. Yeuk!!
