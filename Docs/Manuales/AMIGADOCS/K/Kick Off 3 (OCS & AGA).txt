A WORD ABOUT STYLE AND TACTICS
------------------------------
Kick Off 3 is unique because each International Team has its own style of
play giving the game much more depth and superior gameplay.Kick Off 3 is a
game which won't be gathering dust in the back of a cupboard after two
weeks.The infinite variations in playing styles and team tactics results in
a game with lasting interest.It takes a long time to reach
perfection!.Below are some of the playing styles.

GERMANY 1-4-3-2

The World Champions build from the back with a Sweeper and two attacking
Full backs.The keeper rarely kicks and usually throws the ball to the
Sweeper who distributes the ball to a Full Back who runs forward with the
ball.A Playmaker in Midfield services the two Strikers.The players are very
disciplined.Their flair and agility,though,is merely average.

HOLLAND 4-1-3-2

Using much the same tactics on the Germans,the Dutch,however,play with a
Libero who plays in fron of the back four.He not only acts as a Sweeper but
is a quite capable of taking the ball to the opposition.The Midfield has
two wingers serving two Strikers.Dutch players,like the Brazilians,show
great individual flair and agility.The wingers are very comfortable on the
ball and will usually pass it to the Strikers on the ground.

ENGLAND 4-4-2

The keeper will invariably kick the ball.The Midfield has two Winders
crossing the ball in the air to seek out the Target Man and the Goal Maker
behind the Strikers.The playing formation is really more 4-3-1-2 playing a
diamond forward and midfield formation.

BRAZIL 4-3-2-1

Using 2 Liberos at the back,the ball moves forward swiftly on the
ground.Two Goal Makers will service the Lone Striker.The Brazilians play
with a high level of flair and agility and,in effect,any player is capable
of scoring goals.

CAMEROON 4-2-4

Coached by Brazilian managers but possessing the physical strength of
European Players,Cameroon play with 2 attacking Full Backs,a Playmaker and
Goal Maker in Midfield and 2 Wingers and 2 Srikers up front.They are very
attack minded but this often leads to defensive lapses.

These five examples illustrate the various styles and tactics of
International Nations.A team using the shame formation as Brazil but with
another team composition of Key Players will play in an entirly different
way.The quality of the players,specially KEY PLAYERS makes all the
difference.When you are controlling a quality Playmaker on the pitch and
press button A to pass,before he passes to the nearest player,he will look
to pass in the space for a winger or goal maker to pass and thus break the
defence.
