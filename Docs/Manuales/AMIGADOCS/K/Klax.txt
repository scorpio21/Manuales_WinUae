                              KLAX


INTRODUCTION
The concept is simple - catch the different coloured tiles as they
advance towards you and flip each tile into one of five bins.The
object is to make Klaxes: these are same coloured stacks of
tiles,Horizontals,Diagonals and Rows of three.Once a Klax is made
the tiles disappear,causing any tiles on top to drop down and
replace them.For bonus points,set up the tiles to cause a chain
reaction of Klaxes.Your paddle can hold a maximum of 5 tiles,and
once full,tiles will just drop past it.Similarly,each bin can
hold 5 tiles,and when full you will not be able to flip any more
tiles into it.

The "drop meter" in the centre of the screen,shows how many tiles
you failed to catch.Should you drop more tiles than you are
allowed,or if all the bins become full at the same time,the game
will end.

A tile that flashes multiple colours is a "wild" tile - capable
of forming part of a number of Klaxes.For example,if you flipped
a wild tile onto a stack of 2 blue tiles and it fell beside a
horizontal line of 2 green tiles,both blue and green Klaxes would
be made,and all 5 tiles would disappear.

A speed up option is available which causes all the tiles on
screen to hurtle towards you at high speed.Alternatively,use the
Throw Option to flip a tile back up the screen in order to pick
up a tile of another colour.BEWARE! You can only throw one tile
at a time,and it will still come rolling back with all the other
tiles as well!

The game is played by completing Wave after Wave.Each Wave has
its own set of criteria for you to meet,such as surviving for a
certain number of tiles,or getting a set number of diagonal
Klaxes.You will be told about these at the beginning of each
wave.
Remember,the harder the Klax,the more points you score.For
example,diagonal Klaxes are worth more than vertical or
horizontal ones.

Two players may play simultaneously with a vertical split
screen.Simply follow the on-screen instructions.
