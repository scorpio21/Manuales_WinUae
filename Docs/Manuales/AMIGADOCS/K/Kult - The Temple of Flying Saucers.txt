				   Kult.


		Your Mission.

Take part in five ordeals, if you want.
Find your friend Sci Fi.
Smash the protozorq plot before it's too late.


		How to Play.

To freeze the game momentarily, press ESC key to restart, kit any key.

The Master of Ordeals (a Protozorq in a fetching mask) will hand you an 
object which could come in handy! then he'll instruct you to a specific
Ordeal. you can obey if you want, Raven.

The Ordeals have begun and you have 1 hour to finish all five, should you
decide to take part. If you placed 5 Vort Skulls in the Changer within the
time-limit, you will have won the highest honour awarded to any Offa : to
be a Divo! Failure, on the other hand, will result in something too
disagreable to discuss at this time.


		Using the Mouse.

CONFIRM (with click or space bar) to activate your cursor. The indicator,
at bottom right, will flash to authorize your CONFIRMation when it's your
turn to act.

MOVE the cursor with the mouse or the cursor keys. A text zone, at bottom
screen, will translate what you explore as your sursor moves. When
exploring, make sure you take in everything.

THE MOUSE CURSOR
The cursor turns RED when situated on valid zone, and changes shape
according to the kind of actions you can do.

Circle with rays :.......basic cursor. There is nothing special here.
Finger :.................use this cursor to choose ideas on your brain.
Crossed arrows :.........indicates possible exits.
Arrows in circle :.......indicates something to look at or manipluate.
Human figure :...........character to select or act on.
Emptying goblet :........a full goblet ready to be emptied.
Fly :....................move this to precise area where you wish to go with
		         "stick fingers" power.
Open hand :..............place this on what you wish to manipulate with "psy
		         shift" power.

CONFIRM (click or space) when the cursor is on an element or character on
whom you wish to act (inspect, talk to, attack, etc.) The BRAIN will then
appear. This is your Tuner grey matter. It's full of ideas. They're in
bubbles placed around the brain's surface. The ideas are those which come
to mind in a particular situation.

MOVE THE CURSOR from one idea to another. At bottom right of your screen, a
text zone translates the idea.

CONFIRM any idea you'd care to try.


		The Icons

On the right-hand side of your screen you'll need for play. From top to
bottom.


	Top. (light)

OBJECTS IN THE ROOM : 

(the icon changes color when an object is available in the current room)
Confirm this to open a window containing any objects available for taking.
If you leave an object somewhere, you'll be able to pick it up again any
time you come back, unless someone else has decided to take it in the
meantime! The window won't display if no objects are available in the room.

MOVE the cursor over the objects. the identity of each is given in the text
zone at bottom right.

CONFIRM to manipulate the object of your choice.


	Second Down. (star)

PSI POWERS :

Confirm this icon to access the 8 powers you have trained long and hard to
master! These tuner powers will give you the winning edge in many
situations. Be careful not to flash them around though, since they'll prove
that you're a Tuner, and no one likes Tuners! Each time you use a power,
your psi-energy reserve will diminish, and who knows if you'll be able to
stock up in this damn Temple!


A. SOLAR EYES.		Switch on this super-vision power to see in the
			blackest darkness. It sure beats eating carrots.

B. STICKY FINGERS.	If you've ever dreamed of walking on walls, now's
			your chance! Just confirm this power and choose
			where you want to go with the cursor.

C. KNOW MIND.		Check out what that character over there is realy
			thinking! Put the cursor on him (or her) to get the
			inside story.

D. BRAINWARP.		How to turn someone helplessly Moronic! Stupidize
			your enemy by putting the cursor on him.
			Unfortunately, it only lasts a second or two.

E. ZONE SCAN.		It so happens that some things are invisible to the
			naked normal eye. Zone Scan will tell you if 
			anything is hidden in a particular room. These guys
			didn't reckon on a Tuner noising around!

F. PSI SHIFT.		Move small objects just by looking at them!
			Protozorqs, unfortunately, don't count as small
			objects.

G. EV.			That means Extreme Violence. This Psi Power turns
			you into a crazed killer! Just choose your
			unsuspecting victim with the cursor and then tear
			him apart. Lovely.

H. TUNE IN.		Your old teacher Gromek explained it this way :
			Development of the Hitachi-Gauss Amplifier led to
			perfecting of the Synonization technique where the
			unconscious psychic emanations resonating from the
			subject are sorted and regulated by the Gauss. At
			the subject's request, the Amplifier should
			normally be in a position to provide the basis for
			a solution, that is to say, the beginnings of a
			satisfactory way out of a worrying situation,
			thanks to an analysis based on the results of the
			harmonization of psycho-energetic oscillatory
			phenomena. To put it a little more clearly, you can
			use this power to make the Gauss give you an idea
			for getting out of a jam! Since you're not an
			Emcom, however, his messages may seem a little
			strange. This is normal.


	Third down (box).

WAIT :

If the best thing to do is just to wait a while, then confirm on this icon.
Time will pass. The wait will stop after a certain time or if something
happens.


	Fourth down (flash).

YOUR OBJECTS :

Confirm on this icon to check on what objects you have on you. A window
will display, containing everything you have. Just click on the object you
want to use.
To use an object, click on it and choose one of the options on your brain.
Some options (throw, give, place, etc.) you will have to designate the
"target" of your action.


	Fifth down (man).

PSI ENERGY :

When the pulsations get weak, that means your reserves are low. And no Psi
Energy means no psi powers! So go easy on the EV! The icon flashes when psi
energy reserves drop significantly or when insufficient for use of a power.


	Sixth down (disk).

SAVE :

Not your soul (Exxos deals with that), but the current game. Insert a clean
formated disk in the drive. Validate on the save icon. The game will save
automatically.


	Seventh down (disk).

LOAD :

To load and play a game you've previously saved. Insert the disk containing
the saved game you wish to play. Click on the load icon. The game will
restart at the point where you saved it.


	Eighth down (clock).

TIME :

This is useful. For instance, you can calculate how much time you have left
to get those 5 Vort skulls into the Changer.


	Nineth down (box).

INDICATOR :

Which flashes when it's youre turn to act : click to take control of the
cursor.


	SOME THINGS you'll meet in The Temple of Flying Saucers :

PROTOZORQS : The People of the Temple! These splendid beings are the result
	of a mutation which took place just after the Bum. The Protozorq's
	chief personally trait is a fanatical loathing of Offa. And since
	you're an Offa....

MASTER OF ORDEALS : A high dignitary among the Protozorqid People. His task
	is to organize the 5 Ordeals you're supposed to take part in.

PROTIZIM HARSSK : Religous political leader of the Protozorqs. Great indeed
	is his pride at being the Protizim during whose reign the Original
	Sin will soon be cleaned! Should you feel in need of an uplifting 
	message, just consult the nearest Holo-Holo.

THE PRIESTESSES : Their sacred duty is to guard the Books and intercede
	with Deilos on behalf of the People of the Temple. If you become a
	Divo, you'll be seeing them, brifly, up on the second level where
	they live.

ZORQ : Protizim Harssk assures us that Zorq is back with the Komponent for
	the Spawnomatic.

QRIICH : It's a kind of hovering squid, to be seen floating near Zorq.
	Probably a pet.

SAURA : The High Priestess. She who holds the Blade of Sacrifice. Future
	genitor (along with the god Zorq) of the Race to Come.

VORTS : A mistake. See the Book of Shame for shameful details.

DEILOS : The Power in the Abyss, temporary God during Zorq's absence.

DIVO : Triumph over the 5 Ordeals and place the skulls into the Changer in
	under an hour, and you get to be a Divo, Holder of the Egg and
	Messenger of Deilos!

ASPIRANT : Like the other Offas taking part in the Ordeals, you are an
	Aspirant, hoping to attain the glorious status of Divo! That is,
	from the Protozorq's point of view, the reason for your presence in
	the Temple. Should you fail to become a Divo, then, um....On the
	other hand, if you do attain Divo-hhod, well, uh....

THE 5 ORDEALS : What the Protozorq's brought you here for. You just go into
	one of the Ordeals, overcome the ghastly difficulties and win a
	skull. Insert 5 skulls into the Changer in under an hour, and you're
	a Divo!

THE EGG : Awarded to an Aspirant who manages to place 5 Vort skulls in the
	Changer in under an hour. The Aspirant then recieves the envied
	status of Divo and must report to the Chamber of Dreams.

THE SECOND LEVEL : That's where Saura and the other priestesses go about 
	their sacred duties. As an Offa, you have no right to even know of
	its existence, let alone consider the treacherous idea of finding a
	way to sneaking up there!

SCI-FI : Your friend. She's a prisoner somewhere in this damned Temple! You
	got yourself captured and sent to the Ordeals just to find and save
	her.

GAUSS : Also known as the Foetus. the Hitachi-Gauss Amplifier links you
	telepathatically to the nearest Tuner Network Centre. The Gauss
	lives in a jar at the centre. His telepathic voice is a little
	strange.

HOLO-HOLO : To get a thrilling and inspirational message from Protizim
	Harssk, just hook into a Holo-Holo.

TURKEYES : They adore the priestesses.

THE CHANGER : Situated in the Master"s Orbit. This is where you can leave
	your skulls, if you wish. When a skull has been inserted, you can 
	try your luck at the three-cup holograph game to exchange one of
	your objects for another of your choice. You'll need a sharp eye!

ZAPSTIK : the awesome weapon that all Protozorqa carry. Offas don't have
	the right to use them! Zapsiks appear to be left over from before
	the Burn

THE BURN : Tuner Network reasearch teams are still working to identify the
	nature of that hidous catasrophe which plunged our world into the
	chaotic nightmare we know today, friend. Trust the Network.


			The Book of Origins
				 &
			 The Book of Shame


		The Book of Origins.

Within the Mountain lived People. From the sky came Zorq, the Exalted One,
and his familiar, Oriich, in their flying appliance. And Zorq spoke to the
People, saying "I have chosen you who are less than nothing. Tommorow you
will be Sires of the New Race, and the Earth will be yours and you will
obliterize all the peoples of the Earth in a frenzy of mindless bloodlust."
And the People felt joy. "Let a female be brought to me,"barked Zorq, and
it was done fast. A female of the People, the meatiest, was brought before
Zorq who impregnated her, saying "Female, you will gender the New Race. Our
races will be one and all others will shortly be obliterized, for they are
Offa." And the female was placed in the Spawnomatik according to Zorq's
desire. In three hours she spawned a multiplicity of eggs which hatched
forthwith. And the children didi eat of their mother who thus fed her
offspring, that the Race might be the bloodthirstiest of all. And the
children did eat of each other, down to the last. And Zorq spoke, saying
"So much for that Race." And the People felt sadness, for the New Race had
contained a fairly major glitch. Zorq spoke again, saying "I leave you, for
I must seek out the Komponent. Upon my return, we will try once more. Keep
the Spawnomatik as a sign. But touch it not. Choose a Protizim from amongst
you. He will be Protizim of the People and will keep Faith until my
return." And Zorq and his familiar, Quiich, did disappear into the sky in
their flying appliance.


		The Book of Shame.

The People of the Protozorqs selected a Protizim. And Protizim Krill kept
the faith, the Spawnomatik and the Mountain which became the Temple. And
when Krill terminated, Prass was chosen as Protizim. And Protizim Prass
forgot the words of Zorq and took it upon himself to attempt the creation
of the New Race, saying "Zorq has forsaken us, for he has found another
People. But we have the Spawnomatik. Let us produce the New Race ourselces.
In this way we can obliterize all other peoples." And the People of the
Temple believed him, saying "He's right." And Prass spoke, saying "Let a
female be brought to me. And let it be a meaty one." It was done. And Prass
did impregrante her, saying "Woof Woof." Then the female was placed within
the Spawnomatik where she spawned a slimy multitude of eggs which hatched.
The children did nibble apologetically of the flesh of their mother, after
which they did snooze. Protizim Prass spoke again, saying "This Race
couldn't obliterize a squashed gerbil, let alone Offa, for they are Vorts!"
And the People felt disappointed, for they had been counting on something a
little more assertive than Vorts. Prass spoke ponce more, saying "This is
our Day of Shame. Our misery is desreved, for we have lacked faith in Zorq
who is cerily out true God. We must obliterize ourselves and our Vorts
forthwith, for we are covered in Guilt." Then spoke a Protozrq, saying "
Nay, we deserve no such gentle fate. Our People must live to bear the
crushing burden of our Crime until Zorq returns to deliver us of Shame. And
our Vorts will be our slaves, that we might see our Guilt before us every
day! And when our God, Zorq, finally creates the New Race, then will we
obliterize ourselves to wash us of our Sin. Only you, Prass, have the right
to obliterize yourself today." And the people of the Temple agreed. And
Deilos became temporary God in Zorq's Absence, for Deilos is the Abysmal
Power of the Humid Pit, and the Protozorqs deserved no better. And Protzim
Prass did terminaterize himself, saying "Let me be woken up on the Day of
the Collective Self Obliterization." And thus did die Prass who spoke one
positively last time, croaking "When Zorq returns, you will young Offa. And
form amongst them you will select those most apt to carry the message of
reborn hope to Deilos. And from amongst the Offa you will take a female,
whom you will name Saura, High Priestess, and who will genderize the New
Race according to Zorq's desire, for Zorq is our God."



						It will be done.



	             	   A WORD TO THE WISE


	    His Rapacious Nutillity, SYNAPS NODUL NERDZ IV,
   in a fit of insane generosity, hereby consents to the publication of :


			         KULT


	    in view of its socially undesirable character.


The Managment reminds all organic life-forms that thinking of any sort is no
longer necessary. Anyone caught idulging in thought processes will be
furthered for retraining as Brand X breakfast cereal.



	A long time after the Burn. It is the reign of the Tuner Network.
The PSI-mutant Tuners discreetly control the world of the Normals, who fear
and detest them utterly.

	For the Protozorqs, inhabitants of the Temple, the day of Atonement
is at hand; the god Zorq has returned, as promised in The Book of Origins,
appearing from the sky on board his flying object. In an explosion of
crazed bloodlust, the horde wreaks havoc throughout the surrouning region.
All the Normal villages are razed, and every one of their inhabitants
exterm9inated. Every one, that is, except the young males, who are herded
into the Mountain, the Tepmle of Zorq!

	Raven and his friend Sci Fi, two young Turners, approach a Normal
settlement where the Protozorqs, armed with fearsome Zapstiks, are wiping
out the last pitiful pockets of resistance. In spite of orders from the
Foetus, Raven and Sci Fi fling themselves into the fray. The situation is
hopeless, but thanks to his PSI-powers and astounding combat skills, Raven
overcomes incredible odds and finally stands alone, surrounded on all sides
by piles of broken and bloody Protozoqs corpses. He turns to Sci Fi, but
she's been dragged off to the Temple! The Network orders Raven not to try
and follow her into the mountain, but once again he defies the authority of
the Foetus!

	At present Raven's in the very heart of the Temple of Zorq!
Everwhere fanatical Protozorqs await the fateful words of their hideously
deranged leader, Protizim Harssk, Guardian of the Protozorqal Shame. To
find Sci Fi, destroy the insane Protizim's bloodcurdling plot and, finally,
hack a bloody trail to Zorq himself, you've got to be utterly determined,
ruthless, daring death at every turn! You'll need to use your PSI-Energy
wisely; it could mean the difference between total victory and a horribly
sicky end!

	First you must face the bizarre and terrifying Ordeals of Deilos.
Will you emerge Holder of the Egg and Messenger of the New Order, or will a
ghastly fate on the Altar of Atonements? The Master awaits, Raven. Your
fellow Aspirants will show no pity. The repulsive Protozorqs keep gloating
guard at every door!

	KULT, with its all-mouse easy-to-handle game system, its infinitely
rich graphic animations and the strange splendour of its scenario, offers
you an authentic future classic in the universe of computer games.


	Step into KULT, Exxos commands it!

			KULT

1. -Sergeant Bullpup fills you in.

(this section is reserved for use by life-forms wishing to soak up the
socio-politikal background. The Management would like to point out that
regarding what follows is a bad move from a life-expectancy angle.)

Sarge : As of right now, boy, you are RAVEN. Got it ?

You : ..... (say "yes". If you're a girl, say "yes")

Sarge : What'd you say Slobface ?

You : ..... (say "yes sir, sarge, sir" quite fast)

Sarge : RAVEN, that's YOU, is the HERO of this here «fun- packed game of
thrills». That makes you so happy, ain't that right, slime-bag ?

You : .... (say anything you want. He can't hear you because I've turned
his ear off.)

Sarge : I can lip-read. Now listen good, lunkhead...

The Sarge, a person with overdeveloped jaws, takes out his gun and sticks
it behind his left ear because :

	A :  His right ear got torn off in a breathing accident.
	B :  Who wants to know ?

Then the Sarge, whose eyes are piggish and closer together than his
nostrils, picks up a dog-eared sheaf of documents and reads them out loud,
because :

	A :  He wants you to listen good, lunkhead.
	B :  See A.

Okay, Sarge. It's your baby.

	Raven's a Tuner. Tuners are Psy-mutants. Appeared after the Burn,
same time as physical mutants. Normals hate mutants, specailly Tuners,
because can't tell apart from Normals physically. Normals rub out Tuner
kids every time identified. Some Tuners avoid detection. Escape. Form
Netwerk. Live in hidden centres called Antennae. Defend selves. Remove
Tuner kids from Normal communities before identified as Tuners. Normals
fear and loath Tuners. Yuk. Netwek develops Hitchi-Gauss Amplifier, called
Foetus. Allows long-distance telepathic links between Antennae. Netwerk now
covers great part of inhabited world. Watch. Start intervening in Normal
affairs to guide progress. Netwerk believes necessary to prevent Normals
developing into powerful groupings, otherwise certain destruction of
Tuners. Gasp. Netwerk maintains social stability discreetly. Normals loathe
and fear Netwerk. Yuk. Netwerk will guide events until Normals no longer
hate Tuners. Some Tuners disapprove Netwek policy. Leave Netwerk. Are
Defectivs. Hiss. Hunted by Netwerk because irresponsible and dangerous.

	Raven is young Tuner, training over. Ready to serve. Has Psy powers
like all Tuners. Raven's powers destine him Outside Teamwerk, contact with
Normals to ensure satisfactory peaceful social evolution. Sent to new
Antenna. Leaves with girl, Sci Fi. Sci Fi is Transrec, Tuner working with
Foetus, link between Contact Teams and Antenna. Sci Fi is also Feeler :
picks up Trouble Spots, directs Contact Team to Pacification Zone. raven
and Sci Fi in love. Cute. Sci Fi has Defectiv tendencies. was removed
brutally from loving Normal parents. raven explains that sad etc. bla bla,
but Netwerk only hope for safe world. Normals too dangerous for selves and
Tuners. Gulp.

	Cross region not totally under Netwerk care. Sci Fi feels Trouble
Spot. Recieve order from Antenna (thanks, Gauss) to observe, not intervene.
Witness massacre, Physical mutants attack Normal village. Kill everyone
except young men. Foetus transmits order to avoid contact. Too dangerous.
Sci Fi and Ravven disobey ! Fight mutants. Sci Fi captured. Mutants have
Zapstiks. Victims go up in smoke. Raven uses Psy combat power to kill
mutants. Sci Fi gone ! Grrr. Fleeing Normals fill Raven : mutants are
Protozorqs. Lived peacefully in mountain. Then carnage. Kill Normals,
shouting "Death to Offa. Great is Zorq. Soon ernd of Shame". Only young men
taken alive. Gauss establishes telepathic link with Raven. Sci Fi off the
airwaves. Not dead but scrambled. taken by force to mountain. Grrr. Foetus
forbids Raven to go after her. Was almost Defectiv anyway. Raven disobeys
Netwerk. Finds new massacre, gets caught. Taken to mountain. Will and must
find Sci Fi, take out Protozorqs. Banzai.

Thanks, Sarge. Really most moving.


2. -The set up right now (blood-curdling).

(the following is reserved for those life-forms wanting to know what
they're supposed to do, without wasting time on irrelevant issues. The
Management reminds personnel that the possesion of ideas or any attempt to
contaminate others with them is an offense punishable by retraining as
encyclopedias, and as we know what that means. Be a nice neighbour ; flush
that brain down the toilet.)


	So there you are in the mountain. Raven (that's you). Protzorqs
fling you unceremoniously into a dimly-lit slammer that smells like
somebody just did something. Four Normals (you're not a Normal. You're a
Tuner. That's a Psy-muatnt with powers. Neat.) are slumped around, looking
pretty glikky. You're in good shape, ready to shed quite a lot of blood to
find your girl, Sci Fi, who's a prisoner someplace in the mountain. You
decide rather wisely to keep your more spectacular powers, ones like
"stroll around the ceiling" for later, as you don't feel like getting
mashed into pulp (nobody likes Tuners). But why not sneak a look inside a
mind or two ? Well, well. These Normals sure have glikky thoughts today.
One thrilling power you have works like this : the Foetus captures your
subconscious impressions about a particular situation, and analyses them.
So that, if you cantact him, you'll get an idea ehat to do.
	It's your idea, processed by the Hitachi-Gauss Amplifier !
	If you try it now, for instance, he'll send you this message : "Pay
Shunts" (he's a glikky speler). That means it's better to wait and not use
too much psy-energy on trying out your powers.

	A slight eternity later, a bunch of Protozorqs shove you all though
a maze of corridors. You go along the Passage of the Faithful, into the
Ring and finally to the Master Orbit itself !

	The Master of the Ordeals quits his Eye, surrounded by a battery of
crazed Protozorq fanatics. His mutant voice buzzes thickly from behind a
terrifying mask !

	"YUGGA WAGGU ! Offas, the day has dawned. The stench of shame will
soon be wiped clean. Nourished be Deilos, Abysmall Power of the Humid Pit !
Zorq has returned, as was written in The Book of Origins. Soon all Offas
will be but a vomitous memory. Today you are become Aspirants, struggling
to attain the blessed state of Divos, Messenger of the New Solution. Those 
who fail will have the honour to offer themselves up to Deilos ! Who would
be Divo must first triumph over the Five Ordeals. A skull of Vort will be
awarded you for each Ordeal successfully overcome. To be a Divo, you must
place five skulls in the Changer before one hour has elapsed ! None may
re-enter a Chamber of Ordeals that he has already overcome. Bear this in
mind : none may do violence in the Otbit. Deilos Forbids. YUGGA WAGGU !"

	The Master has spoken. Well, buzzed thickly. To each Aspirant he
gives an object of some kind, directing him to one of the five Chambers of
Ordeal. Finally, he turns to you, Raven...

	Can you win the Five Skulls of Vort ? Is that the best way of
getting Sci Fi ? What dangers await within the Chamber of Ordeals from
whence wafts the fetid stench of grinning DEATH ? Just what are these
lunatic Protozorqs planning on anyhow, and can you stop them in time ?


(The management herby informs all organic life-forms that the third and
twenty-second words in each line of the following documents contain doses
of «Brain-Slurp 17». Preceding documents also. Why not pull the same
amusing gag on loved ones ? Contact Faithful Servants of Exxos Inc. for
