				KINDERAMA

LOADING PROCEDURES

1)  Kickstart V1.2 is required.  Insert Kickstart Version 1.2 into your
Amiga's disk drive and turn on your computer and monitor.

2)  When the computer asks for WorkBench insert the Kinderama program disk.
 DO NOT INSERT THE WORKBENCH DISK AS THAT IS INCLUDED WITH THE KINDERAMA
PROGRAM DISK.

The program will boot automatically.  The title, credit and Main Menu
screens will appear.

**THE DISK IS ACCESSED BY THE COMPUTER DURING ENTIRE USE OF THE PROGRAM. 
DO NOT REMOVE IT FROM THE DRIVE WHILE THE PROGRAM IS BEING USED.

Quitting (Escaping the Learning Games

Pressing the ESC Key when the computer is waiting for an answer allows you
to escape from any of the modules (except the Robot Construction module)
back to the Main Menu.

Please note that the TAB key turns speech on and off when the computer is
waiting for an answer, however, the sound effects will remain.  If you
desire no sound, please turn off the volume on the monitor.  Always use the
LEFT mouse button as the right mouse button might erase part of the screen.

PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS

The Main Menu

Move the arrow icon onto the module of your choice and click.
	Before each module (except the Robot Construction module) the
computer asks should I talk?  Type "Y" for yes or "N" for no.  The child
will then be asked to type in his or her name.  Press RETURN to continue. 
To exit the program from the Main Menu, click on the robot on the right
side of the Main Menu screen.  To restart, type Kinderama when the 1>
appears.

The Robot Story

This interactive rhyme teaches the concept of subtraction.  As the computer
displays the story and asks, "How many?" the child must answer by typing in
the correct number.  If he is unsure, he should be encouraged to count the
robots remaining on the screen.  If a mistake is made, an explanation will
appear and give the correct answer.

	NOTE: Pressing Shift and a number will take you to specific
screens.  For example, pressing Shift and 5 will take you directly to the
"Five little robots..." screen, the only exception being pressing Shift and
0, which will take you to the "Ten little robots..." screen.

Letter Match

Type "U" for upper case letters or "L" for lower case letters.  We suggest
your child master upper case letters before attempting to learn lower case
ones.  The child must type the letter that matches the one in the robot's
box.  The child will be given 3 turns before the computer asks him to find
the specific key.  After 10 correct responses, control will be returned to
the Main Menu.

Count The Robots

In this program, robots are randomly generated.  The child must count them
and press the number in answer to the question, "How many robots do you
see?"  The child is given 3 chances to answer correctly.  If he does not,
the computer will give the answer and also count the robots for him.  The
child must then type the correct answer to continue.  After 10 answers
control will return to the Main Menu.

Robot Addition

The child will be given simple addition problems.  He must answer by typing
the correct number.  He should be encouraged to count the robots on the
screen and not use his fingers.  If the answer is incorrect, a message will
appear encouraging him to try again.  After 3 incorrect answers, the
correct answer will be displayed.  The child must type the correct answer
to continue.  After 10 problems, control will return to the Main Menu.

Robot Construction

The objective is to build a robot on the body frame appearing on the right
of the screen.

	Use the mouse to move the arrow icon and select bodies.  BODIES
MUST BE SELECTED FIRST.  A choice of 3 bodies will appear.  Click the arrow
icon on the body type of your choice which will then appear on the right of
the screen.  Then click on either heads, legs or arms.  Next, click on the
part selected.  That part will appear on the body frame in the right
window.  We suggest that you follow the numerical order, that is, bodies
should be chosen first, heads second, legs third, and arms fourth. 
However, if you do not follow that format, please note that the arms will
be erased when selecting legs and that selecting bodies erases everything. 
TO ESCAPE BACK TO THE MAIN MENU, CLICK ANYWHERE ON THE ROBOT CREATED ON THE
RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN.

A Note to Parents and Teachers

Since Kinderama consists of five different learning games it succeeds in
keeping the interest of the early learner.  It also helps familiarize the
young child with the concept of computer menus, use of the mouse and
keyboard, as well as develop hand-eye coordination.

	The Robot Story is a great tool for beginning readers.  Once
children have played the game a few times along with an adult, they usually
remember it quite well.  Since the words appear on the screen, adults can
point to the words, help teach children beginning sounds, and encourage
them to follow along.  The child will begin to sight read the words as well
as develop an understanding of the concept of subtraction.

	Letter Match and Count The Robots should be continually used even
after children have mastered their ABC's and numbers to develop keyboard
familiarity.  Encourage typing with both hands!

	When using Robot Addition, always encourage children to start with
the larger numbers and count higher.  For example, in 4 + 2, ask the child
which number is higher.  Teach him to start at 4 and count 2 higher, 5 then
6.  Always try to work with visual aids (robots) and manipulatives (blocks,
pennies).  Adults can teach children to use the top row of the keyboard as
a number line.  Discourage counting on the fingers as this develops a
dependence that will be carried through the early grades.

	The Robot Construction module will help teach children about the
use of the mouse.  Parents can help children learn directions by having
them choose the legs on the upper left, arms from the lower right, etc.
