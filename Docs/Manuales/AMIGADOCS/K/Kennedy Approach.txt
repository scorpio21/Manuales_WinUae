                      DOCS FOR KENNEDY'S APPROACH

       A. VISUAL DISPLAY
      1. CONTROL AREA MAP:The largest section of the simulation 
   display is the Control Area Map. The Control Area Map is designed
   to provide you with the state of the art representation of a REAL
   Air Traffic Controller. 
        1)THE DOT GRID: A grid of dots one mile apart. The bright dots
   denote normal air traffic lanes.
        2)AIR TRAFFIC FEATURES: Entrance and exit fixes are labelled, 
   as are airports. On the approach side of each airport is a VOR tower.
   Incoming planes hold around this until they are cleared to land. 
        3)THE PLANES: There are 3 types of planes. Light jets, jet 
   airliners, and supersonic Concorde. Light planes are smaller than jet
   airliners, and the Concorde is recognized by its drop-nose and delta
   wings. The direction a plane is pointing indicates its direction of 
   travel. Below the plane are the bars indicating current altitude in 
   thousands of feet, and to the right is the planes id letter.
        4)TERRAIN FEATURES: Also on the map are mountains, storms and
   restricted zones. Planes must maintain an altitude of at least four
   thousand feet over the mountains, and they should avoid storms and 
   restricted zones althogether.
      2. THE COMMAND LINE: Just above the Control Area Map is the Command
   line. Here, messages are displayed as they are radioed between you and 
   the aircraft in your area. When you use the joystick to direct traffic
   you will see your commands written out and then see the response.
      3. FLIGHT PLANS: In the upper right-hand section of the screen are
   the flight plans for the active aircraft in your area. The uppermost 
   letter in each comumn is a plane's ID letter. Below the ID letter is the
   first letter of the origin and the first letter of the destination fix or
   airport for that plane. Below these is the altiturde in thousands of feet.
   Aircraft that are waiting to take off have a "*" in the altitude field.
      4. THE CLOCK: In the upper left-handed corner of the screen is the
   time of day clock. Your shift ends on teh hour. The passage of time in 
   the simulation is measured in real-time. Time can be accelerated by 
   holding down the space bar.
      5. ALARM AREA: Between the clock and the Command Line is the alarm
   area. Dangerous situations are reported here. These include incorrect
   exit altitudes and fixes, conflicts, and crashes.

  B.AIRCRAFT COMMUNICATIONS

      1.ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATIONS: You can establish contact with a 
   plane in two ways, by typing the ID letter, or by moving the joystick
   to move the cursor over the plane, and then five the joystick a short 
   push.(less than 1 second).
      2.ISSUING COMMANDS: To tell the pilot what direction to fly, move 
   the joystick left or right until the arrow points in that direction. To
   specify the altitude, move the stick up or down. PLEASE NOTE, EACH BAR
   INDICATES 1000 FEET OF ALTITUDE, AND THE ACTUAL POSITION OF THE PLANE
   IS REPRESENTED NOT BY THE ICON, BUT BY THE BOTTOM BAR!

  C.AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL
 
     1.LANDING: Aircraft destined for and airport must be landed by 
    heading down the runway and giving it clearance for landing. 
    (Altitude 0). Aircraft at altitude 0 can no longer be given turn 
    commands.
     2.HOLDING: Since only one aircraft can use a runway at a time,
     it may be necessary to put other planes into a holding pattern. A
     hold is continuous full turn around a VOR tower at a particular 
     altitude in either a clockwise or counter clockwise direction.
     3.EXITING THE CONTROL AREA: An aircraft that does not land in 
     your area must leave via the exit fix. All aircraft must exit at
     an altitude of four thousand feet.

  D.AIRCRAFT CHARACTERISTICS

     1.SPEED: The various types of aircraft travel at different speeds.
     Light planes move two miles(2 grid dots) every minute, jets move
     4 miles every minute, and the Concorde moves 8 miles a minute.
     2.ALTITUDE CHANGES: All of the planes have a climb/descent rate of 
     one thousand feet per mile.
     3.TURNS: All three types of planes have a turning radius of 1.5 miles.
       This gives a 45 degree per grid dot.

  E.INFLIGHT RESTRICTIONS

     1.AIRCRAFT SEPARATION: The first and foremost of these requirments
       you must maintain is a one thousand foot separation in altitude
       between aircraft flying within 3 miles of each other. Failure to 
       meet the aircraft separtion will result in a conflict condition
       and a possible mid-air crash.
     2.FUEL: Planes carry a limited amount of fuel and will run out if 
       delayed excessively. 

  F.CONTROLLER EVALUATION

     When your shift ends, you will be given onr months salary based on
     your current GS rating and bonus pay based on your performance.. $100
     is paid for each flight completion, $200 is paid for each successful
     emergency landing, and $100 is subtracted for each minute of flight
     delay. If you commit a major error, then the game will end. A major 
     error include 1)crashes, 2)bad exits, 3)lettin a plane with an
     emergency leave your area, 4)conflict time greater than 1 minute, or
     5)flight delay time greater than 45 minutes.
  
     Enjoy the game!
