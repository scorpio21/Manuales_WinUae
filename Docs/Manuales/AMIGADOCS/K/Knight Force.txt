3 - THE STORY 

On Earth, thousands of years ago, lived a nation of superior
intelligence who had the secret of time travel. The secret was
possionately sought after by other nations, but only Helias, the master
of the kingdom of Belloth had the power to use it. Helias was not a
native to the nation, but he had been appointed by the gods to guard
the gates of space and time.
That was how the kingdom of Belloth became the crossroads of time and
space, with each gate being the entrance to the past and the future
times.
The people of Belloth were a very pacifist people and each individual
respected the masters power.
But Helias was extremly intelligent and realised that evil beings could
destroy any person or a complete civilisation in order to dominate
them. So he began to teach the knight and to make him aware of the
dangers surrounding the nation and their secret. Knight of Thunder
would one day be the most powerful man in the kingdom.
When King Helias' died, Knight of Thunder, the new master, was
confronted with a trying situation. Princess Tanya had been seized by
the sorcerer, Red-Sabbath, who had recently emerged from the darkness
of the accursed mountains.
Red-Sabbath's strategy was very simple, by capturing the Princess he
aimed to trap Knight of Thunder in order to steal from him the key to
the gates of time and space. Red-Sabbath has acquired knowledge and
powers unknown to man and is able to divide himself into an infinite
number of clones, and use his powers to rule time zones. However, this
power still doesn't enable him to be the sole ruler over the kingdom.
Knight of Thunder has discovered a unique way to obtain the powers
necessary to destroy Red-Sabbath and his clones. His travels
throughtout time and space will enable him to collect the magic amulets
of power.
Unfortunately, the powers of each amulet can only be used within a
predetermined time zone.
In his quest, Knight of Thunder is taking a great risk, because in his
absence the sorcerer could enforce his evil laws on the people of
Belloth.


4 - YOUR MISSION:

You have just put on the armour of the valiant warrior, and are ready
to engage in the various adventures throughout time. In the following
screens, you discover a hill with 5 dolmens, each dolmen represents one
of the 5 time zones that you will need to visit. At this stage, you
choose one of the five gates of time and space to start your mission.
You can use your joystick or use the cursor keys on the keyboard to
position yourself in front of the chosen dolmen. When in position
press ENTER to confirm your choice. Each time zone conceals enemies and
obstacles which you will encounter as the game progresses. You will
find the enemies listed later, as well as their picture and details.
Each enemy or obstacle can only be overcome by using the necessary
assault technique found as you progress in the game.
Your enemies are the guards of the sorcerer who reside in the magic
castle. Unfortunately, each time you destroy one of the five sorcerers
the captive Princess is automatically moved to a different time zone.
You need to confront and destroy just the clones, before eliminating
the supreme sorcerer and rescuing the Princess.
This quest would be too simple without the existance of the specific
amulets for each time zone. In order to obtain each amulet, you need to
destroy the enemy who posseses it. It is up to you to eliminate as many
enemies as you can in order to find the amulets.
But beware!
The amulet that you have acquired may not be the one corresponding to
the time zone you are in. In that case, the amulet will prove useless
to you and you will have to quickly travel to another time zone to
find the corresponding amulet to the time zone you've just chosen. Each
time you acquire an amulet, you will clasp it to your belt and hold
onto it.
The sorcerers don't confront you outside of the castle, so you need to
find a way to penetrate into the castle of doom in each seperate time
zone.
If you engage in a fight with a sorcerer more powerful than you, your
powers and energy could be reduced significantly. Therefore you need to
escape from the castle as quickly as possible to try and find the magic
bird. Once you have located the magic bird you are able to return to
the dolomite mountain, from where you can continue your travels. In
order to continue your travels you need to pierce the birds heart with
your sword.

 sentenced to death. They have acquired a taste for this cruel game, and
 that's why they won't hesitate to even attack innocent passers by.

 individuals who have no mercy for their attackers. They have no
 scruples about killing and have nothing but hate for others. Any

 certain unexpected enemies can appear from nowhere. It is in this

 to prove yourself. You need to make use of your inventiveness in the
 blows you strike, and in the means you employ to avoid the ambushes
 set up along the way.

D - The Futur

 mission is to eliminate the Knight with the help of his princess
 equipped with incredable mechanised power.

 It's a machine specially created by the sorcerer, and sent out of his
 castle. This devillish invention takes his opponent by surprise only,
 and as the robot its mission is to destroy the Knight.

 This device is a part of an atomic powerplant, that was shut down due
 to an explosion that occured there hundreds of years ago.

 radiation and die.

 dared to disturb them. However, they are not able to emerge from
 Earth's depths because the Sun's radiation would destroy them.

Air-Bubbles:
 These are winged elements with a natural appearance. But these air
 bubbles come directly from the castle of doom, they emanate a boiling
 substance composed by Red Sabbath. This mixture transforms the bubbles
 into a very powerful form of energy. This power makes them formidable
 opponents.
