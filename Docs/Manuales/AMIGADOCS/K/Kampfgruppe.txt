NOTE: 521K of memory is required to run this game. You should make a copy
of the game before play. Put aside your original and play on the copy.

STARTING THE GAME: Boot your Amiga using Kickstart version 1.2 or greater.
When you are prompted for the Workbench disk, insert your game disk
instead. The game will then boot automatically.

MAKING SELECTIONS:
All selections in this game are made by pointing the cursor at the desired
location and clicking on the left mouse button. Sometimes the right mouse
button is used, but this is identified on the screen or mentioned below.
Many selections are made by command boxes at the bottom of the map. Only
those command boxes currently active will be available. At times you may be
required to click the cursor on the map to continue. This will not affect
your units or orders as long as you make sure not to double click. You can
move around the map by clicking on the arrows at the bottom of the screen.

GAME SETUP:
Once the game is booted, an introductory screen will appear allowing you to
make several choices. To toggle a player from computer control to human
control, click on the computer symbol under either the black cross (German)
or red star (Soviet). A rectangle around a side's computer indicates that
side is computer controller. To select a handicap level, click on the
desired level. To play an included scenario, click on the appropriate line.
To build your own scenario, click on the build scenario line and then
choose whether you wish to include a river and the terrain density level.
When you are ready to begin play, click on the "Begin Game" box.

SECURITY CHECK:
Before beginning play or deployment, you must pass a security check.
Answers to all questions can be found in the manual. Use the keyboard to
answer the question, and hit return when you are done. If the first answer
is incorrect, you will have one more chance to answer correctly.

BUILDING SCENARIOS:
Several menus will appear allowing you to choose the year, type of battle,
and size of battle. Click on the desired lines. You will then choose the
type of forces to use. Force selection differs from the rules in that there
is no limit on the number of units, but only on the number of points that
can be spent. If you choose autoselect the computer will choose your forces
for you. Deployment is different than mentioned in the rules in several
ways. If you wish to autodeploy, click on the "Quit" command box. A menu
will appear allowing you to autodeploy, exit the deployment phase, or abort
back to the deployment phase. Click on "Autodeploy" to do so (this can be
done several times). You also may deploy a unit yourself. In both the
Deployment Phase and the Orders Phase there are two menu levels: map mode
and unit mode. If unit information appears at the bottom of the screen, you
are in unit mode; otherwise you are in map mode. Quitting unit mode gets
you to map mode; quitting map mode exits the phase. In order to deploy a
unit yourself you must first access it. This can be done in one of three
ways (this also applies to the Orders Phase): 

A. When in map mode, click on the "Locate" command to see a listing of all
your units. Click on the desired unit. Click on "Locate" again to move the
cursor to the unit. 

B. When in map mode, click on the "HQ" command. This will take you to unit
AO, your main headquarters. Units can then be accessed in alphanumeric
order in unit mode by clicking the "Next" command box. 

C. When in map mode, scroll around the map until you see the desired unit.
Click on the unit to access it. To deploy an accessed unit, move the cursor
to the desired location and click. You may then click on "Quit" to go back
to map mode or click "Next" for the next unit. 

To embark a unit, access the carrier, click on "Embark", and then on the
desired passenger. You can debark all units in a carrier by accessing the
carrier first and clicking "Debark", or debark just one by accessing the
desired passenger first and clicking "Debark". 

Other deployment options include: 

A. Pressing the 9 key will allow you to place an entrenchment in a square.

B. Pressing the T key will allow you to change the terrain. Enter the
number of the desired terrain and press return. Click on the map at the
location for the new terrain. When you are done, click the RIGHT mouse
button. 

C. Pressing the C key will allow you to change the weapon type for a unit.
Enter the new type and press return. When you are done deploying all your
units, click on the "Quit" command box and then on "Exit" on the pop-up
menu.

				iii

ORDERS PHASE:
Those commands which differ somewhat from the rules include: 

Moving a unit: Access a unit, click on the "Move" box, and then click on
the target square. (Actually, clicking on the "Move" box is optional). 

Advancing all units: Click on the "All" box to go into all-units mode,
access the headquarters, click on "Advance", and then on the target square.
Units will stay in all-units mode until "All" is again selected. 

Bombardment: Access the spotting unit and click on "Bombard". Click on the
desired target square. If there is more than one unit eligible to bombard
the square you will be able to choose which to use (you may choose more
than one). When you wish to leave the bombardment mode select "Quit". 

Embarkation: This works as in the deployment phase except that you can also
load a whole company. Go into all-units mode and have the carrier embark
the company headquarters. Facing: Access the unit, select "Facing", and
then click on a direction arrow at the bottom of the screen. 

Inspect: Access the unit and click on "Inspect". You will see its current
target if it has one. You will then be given a list of those enemy units
visible to the friendly unit. If you click on the line of an enemy unit you
will see its location and be given the option to target it or bombard it.
If a unit already has a target you must first use the "Cancel" command to
clear the target before assigning the unit a new target. 

Range: To change a unit's range, access the unit, click on "Range", and
click on a square at the desired range from the unit. If in all-units mode
this will change the range of the whole company. 

Speed: Access the unit, press the S key, and then enter the speed using the
keyboard. When a unit is assigned to move it will automatically be assigned
its maximum speed. Change the speed only if you want a unit to move at less
than its maximum speed. 

Examining enemy stacks: Click the right mouse button on the stack. Quitting
the Orders Phase: If in unit mode, click "Quit" to get to map mode. Click
"Quit" again from map mode. You may then click the left mouse button to
exit the Orders Phase or the right mouse button to return to it. Make sure
this click is outside of the "Quit" box.

SAVING AND RECALLING A GAME:
At the end of the Deployment Phase and of every Combat Phase there is an
End of Turn Phase. You may choose to end the game, save it, or continue. If
you choose to save the game, you will see a list of those game currently
saved on the disk. Use the keyboard to enter a name for your saved game and
click "Save". To recall a saved game, click on "Saved Game" on the opening
menu as your desired scenario. After clicking "Begin Game" you will see the
list of games saved on the disk. Click on the line of the desired saved
game and then click "Restore".

ENDING THE GAME:
To end the game, click on "End Game" during the End of Turn Phase. You will
then be put into two player mode so that the disposition of both sides
forces can be seen. Victory points are not listed after choosing to end the
game. Instead the current number of victory points and the current victory
level are listed at the end of each turn. These will change as units enter
or leave the objective area.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
KAMPFGRUPPE is a platoon level tactical game of combat on the Eastern Front
from 1941 to 1945.

1.1 DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:
Each game turn consists of two phases. In the orders phase, the players,
one at a time, give orders to the units which they control. In the joint
combat phase all units carry out these orders, one unit at a time. The
combat phase represents two minutes of action, broken down into four 30
second pulses.

1.2 TALKING TO THE COMPUTER:
To enter a response to the computer that consists of numbers, type the
number into the computer and press the <RETURN> key. To select a routine
from a menu or answer a Yes/No question, just press the desired key. WHERE
THE EXIT COMMAND IS NOT SPECIFIED, PRESS <X> TO EXIT THE MENU.

1.3 SAVING A GAME:
At the end of the DEPLOYMENT PHASE and at the end of each COMBAT PHASE, the
computer will allow the player(s) to save the game in progress. You will
need a scratch disk to store the save game data. Save game disks may be
initialized for SSI use during a game by following instructions included in
the game program. Each save disk will hold approximately 4-6 games.
(Warning: the program will not inform you when you have exceeded the disk
space on your save game disk.) Once a game is saved you will be able to
restart it at the point you left off. WHEN RESTARTING A SAVED GAME YOU MUST
SET THE CORRECT NUMBER OF PLAYERS ON THE OPENING MENU.

1.4 THE MAP:
The KAMPFGRUPPE map is a 60 X 60 square grid with each square measuring 200
yards across. At the start of each game the terrain is randomized in
accordance with parameters determined by the players.

1.5 STARTING THE GAME (APPLE):
To begin the game, boot side one and the game will begin automatically. If
you are using an Apple II with Pascal you must first use your BASICS disk.
If you are using an Apple III you must first go into Apple II emulation
mode. If you elect to play a historical scenario, the computer will ask you
to insert side two of the disk so that it may read in the scenario data.
When this is complete the computer will instruct you to reinsert side one
for the remainder of the game.

1.6 STARING THE GAME (ATARI):
To begin the game, boot the Scenario side of your disk. Before beginning
remove all cartridges from your computer. Owners of the 800XL will have to
hold down the OPTION key when they turn on their computer to boot the game.
After you have deployed your forces (or after you have selected to play a
historical scenario), the computer will ask you to insert the Game side of
your disk.

1.7 STARTING THE GAME (COMMODORE):
To begin the game, insert the game disk into your disk drive. Type LOAD
"*",8 and press <RETURN>. When READY appears, type RUN and press <RETURN>.

1.8 SOUND:
During the combat phase,players may toggle the sound ON/OFF by pressing the
"S" key.

3.0 STARTING THE GAME

3.1 DETERMINING CONDITIONS OF PLAY:
At the start of the game the player(s) must determine the conditions under
which the game will be played. On the Apple version the conditions may be
charged by entering the following numbers.

(1) NEW GAME or SAVE GAME
(2) 1 DISK DRIVE or 2 DISK DRIVE
(3) SOLITAIRE or TWO PLAYERS
(4) HANDICAP LEVEL
(5) DELAY LENGTH
(6) SELECT SCENARIO

On the Atari and C-64 versions:

(1) NEW GAME or SAVED GAME
(2) SOLITAIRE or TWO PLAYERS
(3) HANDICAPPED LEVEL
(4) DELAY LENGTH
(5) SELECT SCENARIO

3.2 PLAYER DETERMINATION:
KAMPFGRUPPE may be played by either zero, one, or two players, and this is
determined by the option selected on the menu. For example, if you wished
to watch a computer controlled German force face a computer controlled
Russian force, you should select the option BOTH COMPUTER. 

3.3 HANDICAP LEVEL:
At the start of the game the players must determine the handicap
level (1-5). The effects of the handicap levels are listed below: 

Level 1: German strength reduced 50% 
Level 2: German strength reduced 25% 
Level 3: No reduction 
Level 4: Soviet strength reduced 25% 
Level 5: Soviet strength reduced 50%

EXAMPLE: At level 1 the number of weapons in German platoons would be
reduced by approximately 50%.

3.4 DELAY LENGTH:
The delay length affects messages displayed during the Combat Phase. The
greater the delay length, the longer these messages will remain displayed
during the Combat Phase. A delay length of 1 will speed up the game, but
will cause the messages to be virtually unreadable. A delay length of 9
will slow the game considerably, but will allow the player maximum time to
study the various reports provided during the Combat Phase. Any integer
between 1 to 9 may be entered.

3.5 SELECTING A SCENARIO:
You may select one of 4 historical scenarios (see section 9.0), or you may
elect to build your own scenario. If you select a historical scenario, the
computer will skip the deployment phase and go directly to turn 1. If you
elect to build your own scenario you will be asked several questions (see
sections 3.6-3.9). New players are advised to begin by playing scenarios
they have created. Creating and playing a small meeting engagement is
recommended. Do not attempt to play the historical scenarios until you are
completely familiar with the game.

3.6 BUILDING THE MAP:
At the start of the game the computer will generate a new map. Prior to
generating the map the computer will allow the player(s) to input
parameters that influence the nature of the terrain: 

(1) INCLUDE RIVER Y/N
(2) COVER TERRAIN DENSITY (0-9)

If option (1) is answered "Y" then the map will include a river. Option (2)
allows the players to control quantity of woods and broken terrain included
on the map. A "0" would allow no woods/broken terrain on the map; a "9"
would mean heavy woods/broken terrain density. Any number between 0 and 9
may be entered.

3.7 SELECTING THE TIME PERIOD:
The player(s) may select from eight different time periods. The time period
will affect the type of forces/equipment that may be used in the battle as
well as the command control capabilities of the two armies.

3.8 SELECTING THE TYPE OF BATTLE:
The player(s) may select from five different types of battle: 

(1) GERMAN PURSUIT 
A small Soviet force fights a rear guard action against a large German
force.

				1

(2) GERMAN ASSAULT
A large German force attacks a medium Soviet force. Both sides may use
off-map artillery.

(3) MEETING ENGAGEMENT
Opposing forces of equal strength advance on the same objective.

(4) SOVIET ASSAULT
A large Soviet force attacks a medium German force. Both sides may use off
map artillery.

(5) SOVIET PURSUIT
A small German force fights a rear guard action against a large Soviet
force. The player(s) must also determine the size of the battle:

	(1) LARGE
	(2) SMALL

In a "small" battle the quantity of units on both sides will be reduced by
approximately 50%.

3.9 SELECTING FORCES:
The Soviet player may select either a Tank or an Infantry type force. The
German player may select a Panzer, Motorized or Infantry type force. If
the AUTO SELECT routine is used then the computer will select a force to
suit the type of battle. The players have a limited number of selection
points (SPs) that they may use to "buy" various types of companies or
battalions. The computer will only allow the selection of formations that
are appropriate for the type of force selected. The player(s) will receive
20 victory points for each SP that is not used to buy combat formations. A
maximum of 250 points may be received in this manner.

4.0 DEPLOYMENT
When creating a new scenario, the player(s) may arrange their units on the
map before the game begins to optimize their attack or defense. Soviet
units may not be deployed west (left) of their "start line" and German
units may not be deployed east (right) of their "start line". If the AUTO
DEPLOY routine is used then the computer will automatically deploy the
units on the map. AUTO DEPLOY will not provide the best possible
deployment; it represents a "hasty" deployment. If the AUTO DEPLOY routine
is not used, the players will find their units at the top of the map.

4.1 COMBAT FORMATIONS:
All units in the game are organized into combat formations (CFs). CFs
consist of a headquarters (HQ) unit with from 1 to 8 attached combat units.
CFs are each assigned an identification letter (A-U). The units attached to
a CF are each assigned an index number (0-9). The formation letter and the
index number are combined to form the unit ID. EXAMPLE: the 3rd unit in
formation C would have C3 as its UNIT ID. The HQ unit in all CFs will be
assigned index number "0".

4.2 THE MAP DISPLAY:
The map display used in KAMPFGRUPPE is a 60 X 60 square grid. Only a
fraction of the map (20 squares wide by 10 squares high) may be viewed at
one time. By pressing the keys 1-8 the cursor can be moved around the map
(1-N, 2-NE, 3-E, 4-SE, 5-S, 6-SW, 7-W, 8-NW). If the cursor is moved to the
edge of the display then the map will scroll to reveal the hidden portions
of the map. When playing an assault type battle, the map is reduced to 60 X
30 (60 spaces east-west by 30 spaces north-south).

4.3 UNIT SYMBOLS:
All units on the map are identified by symbols that describe their function
and nationality. 

SOVIET VEHICLES are represented by vehicles silhouettes facing west. 
SOVIET INFANTRY is represented by symbols of two men underlined. 
SOVIET ARTILLERY is represented by an underlined weapon symbol. 
SOVIET STACK is represented by two overlocking white squares. 

GERMAN VEHICLES are represented by vehicle silhouettes facing east. 
GERMAN INFANTRY is represented by symbols of two men (no underline). 
GERMAN ARTILLERY is represented by a weapon symbol (no underline). 
GERMAN STACK is represented by two hollow overlapping squares.
CONFLICT (opposing forces on same square) is represented by an SU/GE
  symbol.

4.4 MAP DISPLAY MENU:
The map display menu lists the following routines:

(1-8) Move cursor.
(9) Build entrenchment (only before ASSAULT type battles).
(0) Use auto-deploy routine.
(A-T) Select unit. Press formation letter followed by unit index number -
    computer will shift to UNIT ORDERS MENU.
(U) Change terrain in square (see appendix 3 for terrain key).
(V) View. Inverses all squares with a line of sight to the cursor location.
(W) Move cursor to OBJECTIVE AREA (see 4.6) then START LINE.
(X) Exit deployment phase.
(Y) Clear units from screen to view terrain.
(Z) Examine friendly units at cursor location.

4.5 UNIT ORDERS MENU:
The unit described at the top of the text window is the "current unit". The
following routines may be used to adjust the starting location or inspect
the status of the current unit: 

(1-8) Move cursor. 
(9) Change weapon type of armored vehicle. 
(D) Disembark unit. If unit is a vehicle then it will unload all of its
    passengers' if the unit is a passenger then only that unit will unload. 
(E) Embark unit. Order must be given to a vehicle unit - the computer will
    request the ID of the unit to be embarked. 
(L) Look for unit. The cursor will move to the unit's location. 
(M) Move unit. The unit will move to the cursor location. 
(N) Next unit. The next higher numbered unit will become the current unit.
(P) List passengers. Will list the units embarked aboard the current unit.
(Q) Quit the orders menu. Return to the map display menu. 
(V) View. Inverses all squares that may be seen from the cursor location.
(X) Exit the unit orders menu. Return to the map display menu.

4.6 THE OBJECTIVE AREA:
The objective area may be located by pressing the (W) key on the map
display menu. The cursor will move to the CENTER of the objective area. The
objective area is a 19 X 19 square area. In some scenarios the players will
score points for each infantry man, gun or vehicle that ends the game in
the objective area.

4.7 SAVING THE SET-UP:
At the conclusion of the deployment phase the computer will allow you to
save the setup on a disk initialized for SSI use (disks may be initialized
at this time).

4.8 ENTRENCHMENTS:
If the type of battle is a SOVIET ASSAULT or GERMAN ASSAULT then the
players may "build" entrenchments for their units. Entrenchments are built
by moving the cursor over a clear terrain square and pressing the "9" key
when the computer is in MAP DISPLAY MODE. Entrenchment squares will look
like and have the same effect as BROKEN terrain squares. Players may build
a maximum of 50 entrenchments. Entrenchments may only be built on the
friendly side of the start line.

4.9 OFF-MAP ARTILLERY:
Off-map artillery may be available only during assault type battles.
Off-map artillery will be designated only as LIGHT, MEDIUM or HEAVY
ARTILLERY. When selecting forces the player will receive off-map artillery
by taking the German ARTILLERY DETACHMENT or the Soviet HOWITZER BATTALION,
MEDIUM ARTILLERY BATTALION or LIGHT ARTILLERY BATTALION.

				2

Off-map artillery will never be displayed on the map. Available off-map
artillery may be inspected after the game has started by using the
BOMBARDMENT routine. If AUTO-SELECT is used when playing an assault type
battle, both sides will receive off-map artillery.

4.10 CHANGING THE MAP:
During the deployment phase, players may use the U key to create any
terrain desired on any square of the map. This allows players to create any
map desired. M1vre the cursor to the square you wish to change, type U and
then type the number of the terrain (see appendix 3 for a list of terrain
types). When designing a map,keep in mind that often the computer
intelligence cannot deal with river terrain.

4.11 CHANGING WEAPON TYPES OF ARMORED VEHICLES:
Players wishing to create their own scenarios may change the weapons of any
of the armored vehicles except halftracks. To change a unit's weapons go to
the unit orders menu, type 9, and then type the number of the weapon
desired for the current unit (see section 6.0 for weapon numbers.)

4.12 VISIBILITY LEVEL:
At the beginning of the first turn of each game, the computer will randomly
determine the visibility level. The visibility level will be set between 7
and 20 and will remain constant throughout the game. The visibility level
is the maximum range at which units may spot and direct fire at enemy
units.

5.0 ORDERS PHASE
During the orders phase the player(s) may review the status of their units
and assign movement, bombardment and targeting orders.

5.1 MAY DISPLAY MENU:
The map display menu used during the orders phase is similar to the one used
during the deployment phase.

(1-8) Move cursor.
(0)   End game.
(A-U) Select unit. Press formation letter followed by unit index number -
      computer will shift to UNIT ORDERS MENU; the selected unit will be
      the "current unit".
(V)   View. The computer will inverse all squares that can be seen from the
      cursor location. 
(W)   Move cursor to center of objective area. 
(X)   Exit orders phase. 
(Y)   Clear units from screen to view terrain. 
(Z)   Examine friendly or visible enemy units at cursor location.

5.2 UNIT ORDERS MENU:
Upon selecting a unit from the map menu it will be displayed beneath the
map showing its composition (number and type of vehicles or weapons),
ammunition (shown as A, in pulses of firing remaining), facing (shown as a
compass direction), speed (in movement point rate, it is also miles per
hour), and whether it's loaded (an L is displayed when loaded). The
following routines may be used to assign orders to or inspect the status of
the current unit:

(1-8) Move cursor.
(A)*  Advance. This command is only used when the computer is in all units
      mode; the formation HQ will move to the cursor location, other units
      in the formation will move in such a way as to retain their current
      position relative to the HQ.
(B)   Bombard. The cursor location is the target square; the current unit
      is the spotter; the computer will list the artillery units eligible
      to bombard the target (see section 5.6).
(C)   Center. The map is centered around the cursor.
(D)   Disembark. If the current unit is a vehicle then it will unload all
      of its passengers; if the current unit is a passenger then only that
      unit will unloaded passengers will have a suppression level of 80.
(E)   Embark. Order must be given to a vehicle unit - the computer will
      request the ID of the unit to be embarked (see section 5.4).
(F)*  Change unit facing.
(H)   Find unit's HQ. Cursor moves to unit's HQ location; computer
      determines if a "command control" link exists between the current
      unit and the HQ; the HQ becomes the new current unit.
(I)   Inspect. Allows the player to inspect all enemy units that can be
      seen by the current unit to designate a priority target and/or
      request a bombardment (with the current unit as the spotter).
      Assigning a priority target with the (I)nspect order will cause a
      range order to be given if the target is outside of the set maximum
      range, with the maximum firing range being set equal to the distance
      to the new target (see section 5.8).
(K)*  Cancel all orders. Allows the current unit to cancel all movement and
      bombardment orders.
(L)   Look for unit. Moves the cursor to the current unit's location.
(M)*  Move unit. Orders the unit to move to the cursor location (see
      section 5.5).
(N)   Next unit. The next higher numbered unit will become the current
      unit.
(O)   Check movement objectives. Moves the cursor to the movement objective
      location(s) of the current unit; also lists the command control delay
      (see section 5.5).
(P)   List passengers. Lists all units embarked aboard the current unit.
(Q)   Quit the unit orders menu. Return to the map display menu.
(R)*  Set maximum firing range at which the current unit will select
      targets (see section 5.7).
(S)*  Set movement speed for the current unit.
(T)   Inspect the target that the current unit has selected.
(V)   View. The computer will inverse all squares that the current unit can
      see with its current facing.
(X)   Exit the unit orders menu. Return to the map display menu.
(Z)   Shift to all units mode.

5.3 ALL-UNITS MODE:
Certain orders may be given to all of the units of a particular formation.
These orders are followed by an "*" in the listing in 5.2. The computer may
be placed in "all-units mode" by pressing the letter "A" instead of the
unit index number when selecting a unit from the map display menu. From the
unit orders menu the player may shift to "all-units mode" by pressing the
(Z) key.

EXAMPLE: If the current units is C4 and the (Z) key is pressed, then the
computer will shift to all-units mode for formation C. C-ALL will be shown
at the top of the text window and C0 will become the new current unit.

When the computer is in all-units mode then the current unit will always be
the formation HQ. The computer may not be placed in all-units mode if the
formation HQ has been destroyed.

5.4 EMBARKING UNITS:
All vehicle units may embark infantry type units. Only halftrack and truck
units may embark artillery type units. Each vehicle may carry a maximum of
10 transport points. Listed below are the transport costs for each type of
passenger:

SMG, RIFLE			1
HMG				2
81MOR, 82MOR			3
120MOR				5
IG, HOW, FLACK, AT GUN		10

EXAMPLE: A platoon with 30 RIFLEs would require 3 vehicles to transport.

EXAMPLE: A battery of six 76, AT guns would require 6 trucks or halftracks
to transport.

				3

After giving the (E)MBARK command the player must enter the ID of the unit
to be embarked. If the embarking unit is in the same square as the vehicle
then it will embark immediately. If the embarking unit is not in the same
square as the vehicle then the vehicle will move to the square and load the
unit during the COMBAT PHASE.

It is possible to instruct a vehicle to embark all of the units in a
formation. Type the letter "A" instead of the index number of the passenger
unit. The vehicle must be assigned to the formation it is loading in this
manner. The vehicle will immediately embark the units in the same square
and then move to the locations of the other units (in numerical order) and
load them during the subsequent COMBAT PHASES.

If a vehicle unit receives new movement (or embark) orders, then it will
cancel any previous embark orders that have not been completed.

5.5 MOVEMENT OBJECTIVES:
Movement objectives may be assigned to the current unit by moving the
cursor to the desired objective location, pressing the (M) key and then
entering the desired speed. 

Each unit may store up to 2 movement objectives. The FIRST OBJECTIVE will
always be the first objective assigned and the SECOND OBJECTIVE will always
be the LAST one assigned. When a unit completes its move to the first
objective will become the NEW first objective. If a new objective is
assigned to a unit that already has two objectives, then the new objective
will replace the old second objective.

Command control movement delays are imposed each time a new movement
objective is assigned. Delays are not cumulative; the new delay will
replace any existing delay.

Movement objectives for the current unit may be reviewed by pressing
the (O) key. Movement objectives for the current unit may be cancelled by
pressing the (K) key.

5.6 REQUESTING ARTILLERY BOMBARDMENTS:
Indirect-fire artillery bombardments may be performed by all mortars,
off-map artillery, and the German Hummel and Wespe units. Any unit on the
map REQUEST a bombardment.

To request a bombardment move the cursor to the desired target square and
press the (B) key. The computer will list units that are in range and
capable of performing bombardments. If you wish to assign the displayed
unit to the bombardment mission press the (A) key. If you wish to skip to
the next unit without assigning the displayed artillery unit then press the
(N) key. If you wish to exit the bombardment routine press the (Q) key.

For each artillery unit displayed during the bombardment routine, the
computer will display the DELAY required before the artillery can start
firing. The delay is dependent on the relationship between the requesting
unit and the artillery unit.

(1) If the requesting unit is an HQ and the artillery unit is part of the
same formation, then there will be a 2 pulse delay.

(2) If the requestor is a non-HQ but the artillery is part of the same
formation, then there will be a 4 pulse delay.

(3) If the artillery is in the same formation as the COMMAND HQ, there will
be a 6 pulse delay.

If none of the above cases apply, then there will be an 8 pulse delay. If
more than one of the above cases apply, then the one with the shortest
delay will be used. Off-map artillery is considered to be in the same
formation as the COMMAND HQ.

When a unit ordered to bombard, or when a mortar unit begins to fire, the
unit's maximum firing range is set to zero. Do not change this until the
bombardment is completed; otherwise the unit may cancel its bombardment.

5.7 SETTING TARGET SELECTION RANGE:
Units will automatically select direct fire targets during the combat
phase. The players may prevent their units from selecting targets at
extreme ranges by adjusting the unit's target selection range. The target
selection range may be adjusted by using the (R) routine.

EXAMPLE: A Panther tank unit has its selection range set to 5; the unit
will only select targets at ranges of 5 or less even though the Panther's
weapon has a maximum range of 15.

5.8 THE INSPECT ROUTINE:
The (I)NSPECT routine may be used to review all enemy units that can be
seen by the current unit. The cursor will move to the position of each
sighted enemy unit and the player will be allowed to request a bombardment
or designate the enemy unit as a PRIORITY TARGET for the current unit.

The priority target feature allows the player(s) the option of controlling
the target selection of their units. If the priority target feature is not
used then the units will automatically select targets during the combat
phase.

5.9 ENDING THE GAME:
The player(s) may use the (0) routine on the map display menu to end the
game at any time. The computer will automatically end the game the game
after turn 30 for assault scenarios and after turn 20 for all other
scenarios. Players who wish to continue playing a game beyond its normal
limits may do so.

5.10 TIME:
During the combat phases, 2 minutes of actions are resolved. The combat
phase is divided into 4 PULSES of 30 seconds each.

5.11 EXECUTION DELAYS:
When units receive new movement or bombardment orders there will be a
delay, expressed in PULSES, before the orders can be executed (see 5.5,
5.6, 5.12). Units that use the (K) cancel routine will have a 1-pulse delay
added. A delay will be added to a carrier that disembarks units (1 pulse
per unit disembarked).

5.12 COMMAND CONTROL:
Both players will start the game with a COMMAND HQ unit. For the Soviets
this will be a corps unit with a "xxx" symbol ("xx" on the Atari). For the
Germans this will be a regiment unit with a "III" symbol.

A unit is considered to be "in command control" if an unbroken "chain of
command" exists between the unit and the COMMAND HQ. To determine command
control the computer will examine each link in the chain of command.

To establish a command control link between a non-HQ unit and its formation
HQ, the unit may not be more than 10 spaces from the HQ. If the unit cannot
"see" the HQ, then the maximum distance is 5 spaces.

To establish a command control link between an HQ unit and its next higher
HQ, the higher HQ need only exist somewhere on the map.

EXAMPLE: For an infantry platoon to be in command control it would have to
establish a command control link with its company HQ, the company HQ would
have to be linked with its battalion HQ and the battalion HQ would have to
be linked to the command HQ.

To determine the chain of command for any unit, use the (H) routine from
the unit orders menu. Continue pressing the (H) key until the cursor moves
to the command HQ.

Units that receive new movement orders will be delayed a number of pulses
before they start moving. The length of the delay varies with the time
period, nationality, and command control status of the unit. Listed below
are the movement delays for each nationality, time period and command
control status (IN COMMAND CONTROL/OUT OF COMMAND CONTROL).

TIME

6.1 SPECIAL INFANTRY WEAPONS:
All infantry PLATOONS in the game are armed with one of the following
Special Infantry Weapons (SIWs): GRENADE, FLAMETHrower, or PanzerFAUST.
SIWs will only be used when firing at ZERO RANGE against ARMORED VEHICLES
and will shoot at the back armor of the vehicle. SIWs will be fired instead
of the platoons' normal RIFLE or SMG weapons. When using SIWs, the number
of weapons firing is equal to NUMBER OF MEN in the platoon (except when
using grenades in which case the number of weapons is equal to the number
of men in the platoon divided by 10). When SIWs are used the target unit
automatically receives 50% suppression. PZFAUST and FLAMETH weapons may
only fire once during the game after which they will be replaced by the
GRENADE as the platoon SIW.

7.0 COMBAT PHASE
The combat phase of each turn represents 2 minutes of real time. The combat
phase is divided into four 30-second pulses. During each pulse units may
search, select targets, fire their weapons and/or move. Before each pulse
the computer selects one player's units to move and fire first during the
pulse. The side with the lowest command control delay rating will be more
likely to move first.

7.1 SEARCHING:
At the start of each pulse eligible units will attempt to spot enemy units
within their "field of vision". The field of vision is determined by the
unit's facing and its movement status. Moving units have a 90 degree field
of vision in the direction they are facing. Non-moving units have a 180
degree field of vision in the direction they are facing.

The enemy unit will be spotted if (1) it is within the searching unit's
field of vision, (2) there is an unobstructed line-of-sight and (3) the
enemy unit is within sighting range.

The SIGHTING RANGE equals the enemy unit's SL rating plus 1. If the enemy
unit is in cover terrain then the sighting range is divided by 3. If the
enemy unit is moving then the sighting range is tripled. The sighting range
may never exceed the Visibility Level (set at the start of the game).

Units that previously selected a target will not search if they are still
eligible to fire at that target. Units may be unable to search due to
suppression.

7.2 SELECTING TARGETS:
After searching, a unit will automatically attempt to select a target. A
target must be a sighted enemy unit that is within target selection range
(see 5.7). If there is more than one available target then the nearest unit
will be targeted. If the searching unit has an armor-piercing weapon (MP
rating greater than 0) then it will select the nearest ARMORED VEHICLE, if
one is in range.

Tanks and infantry may fire on the same pulse they select a target. Assault
guns, tank destroyers and artillery (mortars, anti-tank guns, infantry
guns, flak, howitzers, self-propelled artillery) may not fire on the same
pulse they select a target unless they are in the same square as the
target.

Units will select another target if their current target is an infantry
unit with a suppression level of 200 at a range greater than zero. A unit
will automatically change targets in order to shoot at an enemy unit that
enters its square.

7.3 DIRECT FIRE VS. ARMORED VEHICLES:
Direct fire may kill or suppress armored vehicles. Armor-piercing fire
against an armored vehicle will not cause suppression unless the range is
less than 6 and the firing unit is a vehicle with machine guns. Small arms
fire from SMG and RIFLE platoons cannot kill armored vehicles.

The effectiveness of direct fire against armored vehicles is determined by
(1) weapon accuracy, (2) the number of weapons in the firing unit, (3)
shell size, and (4) armor vs. penetration.
 
ACCURACY: At zero range, accuracy will be (90+ (WEAPON ACCURACY X PULSE
FIRED AT TARGET) SQUARED/100. At maximum range accuracy will be 1 + (WEAPON
ACCURACY X PULSES FIRED AT TARGET) SQUARED/100. Weapon accuracy ratings are
listed in section 6.0. The pulses fired at the target can never be greater
than 4.

Accuracy is HALVED if the target unit occupies a TOWN, WOODS or BROKEN
terrain square and has its current speed set to 0. Accuracy is HALVED if
the target is a MOVING vehicle. Accuracy is multiplied times the TARGET
SILHOUETTE/4. When anti-tank fire is used against armored vehicles, the
target silhouette may be adjusted due to range. The following formula is
used to increase the target silhouette when the range is under 6:6 - range.
This adjustment is added to the normal silhouette of the target, but is not
used when determining the accuracy of special infantry weapons.

KILLS: Armored vehicles are rated for both front and back armor. Front
armor (FA) protects the front 90 degrees of the vehicle (see diagram). Back
armor protects the remaining 270 degrees of the vehicle. When firing at a
range of zero, it is assumed that the fire is directed at the back armor of
the target. Weapons are rated for maximum penetration (MP). MP ratings are
modified by range and shell size (SS) into an ADJUSTED PENETRATION FACTOR
(APF). The formula for APF is: (SS X SS)/4 + MP - MP X(RANGE/MAX RANGE)/2.
The APF may not exceed 2 X ARMOR. If the APF is less than 1.25 X ARMOR then
the ACCURACY is HALVED. If the APF is less than ARMOR then the ACCURACY is
HALVED again. The number of KILLS equals (APF X ACCURACY X NUMBER OF
WEAPONS FIRING) / (ARMOR X 1200).

EXAMPLE: Let's assume that 5 PZ-IIIL tanks and 10 T-34/76C are in clear
terrain exchanging fire at a range of 3,with each target's front armor
facing the enemy. The ACCURACY of the PZ-IIILs is:

=(((5/8)x90)+(8x1))2)/100
=(64.25x64.25)/100
=41.28

This accuracy is adjusted by the target silhouette which is equal to
7(T-34C has a silhouette of 4 which is adjusted to 7 due to the range of
3). So the adjusted accuracy is equal to 72.24 (41.28X(7/4)). The APF of
the PZ-IIILs is:

=((3X3)/4+10-((10X(3/8))/2)
=9/4+10-15/8
=10.375

Since the APF is not greater than 1.25 times the T-34C front armor of 11,
the accuracy of 72.24 is cut in half to 36.12. Since the APF is not greater
than the T-34C front armor of 11, the accuracy of 36.12 is cut in half to
18.06. The number of kills due to the fire of the PZ-IIILs is:

=(10.375X18.06X5)/(11X1200)
=.071

This means that there is roughly a 7.1% chance that one T-34C will be
destroyed.

				6

If the same calculation was made for the fire of the 10 T-34Cs the result
would be a kill number of .918 which would usually lead to 1 PZ-IIIL
destroyed. Due to the thick armor of the T-34Cs, and the fact that they
outnumber the PZ-IIILs by 2 to 1, an engagement of this type would quickly
lead to a German defeat. If, however, the German player had 5 PZ-IVHs, they
would fire with a kill number of .614 while the T-34Cs would return fire
with a kill number of .937. This is a much better situation for the German
player, although he would still need to bring up another platoon of tanks
to win the engagement.

7.4 DIRECT FIRE VS. NON-ARMORED TARGETS:
The effectiveness of direct fire against non-armored targets is determined
by (1) weapon accuracy, (2) the number of weapons in the firing unit, (3)
shell size, and (4) target defense strength.

ACCURACY: Calculated the same as in 7.3 with the following exceptions: (1)
when firing at MOVING non-vehicle targets the accuracy is DOUBLED instead
of halved; (2) accuracy is QUARTERED if the target is defending in WOODS,
TOWN or BROKEN terrain irrespective of the unit's current speed setting;
(3) accuracy is not affected by the target silhouette.

KILLS: Number of KILLS equals (SS X SS X ACCURACY X NUMBER OF WEAPONS
FIRING) / (DEFENSE X 1000).

If the firing unit is in the same square as the target unit and the
target's suppression level is greater than 99%, then the target will defend
with a DEFENSE of 1, and the attacker's accuracy will be multiplied by 5.

If the firing unit is an armored vehicle and the range is less than 6 then
the attacker will add its MG strength to enhance the attack. Each MG is the
same as the HMG listed in 6.0.

If the firing unit is a German SMG or RIFLE unit, the effectiveness
(accuracy) of the fire will be increased by 50%.

7.5 INDIRECT FIRE:
All bombardments and all mortar fire constitute indirect fire. Indirect
fire will not yield reports of kills and suppression; however, it will
report when a unit has been eliminated. The effectiveness of indirect fire
is determined by (1) the view of the spotter, (2) shell size, and (3)
target defense strength or armor. For indirect fire, armored vehicles have
ARMOR equal to BACK ARMOR + FRONT ARMOR / 3.

ACCURACY: Calculated the same as 7.3 and 7.4 except for the following: (1)
the range is always considered to be the weapon's maximum range for the
purpose of calculating accuracy; (2) the pulses fired at target is equal to
zero if the spotter unit does not have a line of sight to the target
square; (3) the pulses fired at target is equal to 1 if the spotter unit
cannot see an enemy unit in the target square; (4) the pulses fired at
target is equal to 4 if the spotter unit can see an enemy unit in the
target square.

KILLS: Calculated the same as in 7.3 or 7.4. Indirect fire attacks each
enemy unit in the target square. If a friendly unit is present in the
target square then the indirect fire mission will be canceled immediately.

If the spotter is unable to see the target square, or if there are no enemy
units in the target square, then the fire will eventually "drift" into an
adjacent square which will become the new target.

Bombardment fire missions will normally continue firing for 4 pulses after
which the firing units will become available for reassignment.

7.6 SUPPRESSION:
Suppression will occur during most direct and indirect fire attacks.
Non-armored targets may receive up to 200% suppression. Armored targets may
receive a maximum of 50% suppression. If a unit is attacked more than once
in a pulse then its suppression will be cumulative. Suppression will not
occur if armor-piercing weapons fire at armored targets unless the firing
unit is a vehicle armed with machine guns and the range is less than 6.

The level of suppression added by an attack is equal to (SS X SS X ACCURACY
X ACCURACY X WEAPONS FIRING)/200. For suppression purposes the ACCURACY
will always be at least 10.

At the end of each pulse the suppression level of each unit will be halved.

7.7 SUPPRESSION EFFECTS:
Suppression may affect a unit's ability to search, fire or move.

SEARCH: Units with greater than 99% suppression may not search. If
suppression is less than 100% then there is a percentage chance, equal to
the suppression level, that the unit will fail to search. Units will always
search the square they occupy.

FIRE: The effectiveness of fire is reduced by 1/3 of the level of
suppression (i.e. a unit with a suppression of 180% will have its fire's
effectiveness reduced by 60% (180/3).

MOVE: Units with greater than 50% suppression will be pinned down and
unable to move. Note that armored vehicles will never have greater than 50%
suppression.

7.8 AMMUNITION:
All units will start the game with 40 units of ammunition. Units will
expend one unit of ammunition each time they fire. Units will be unable to
fire if their ammunition reaches zero.

7.9 MOVEMENT:
At the end of each pulse, eligible units with movement objectives will
move. Units that fired or were pinned during the pulse will not move.

At the end of each pulse, moving units accumulate movement points equal to
their current speed setting (see 6.0). Units will spend movement points to
ENTER each square on their path. Listed below are the rounded off costs to
enter each type of terrain for each type of unit:

		ARM-VEH		TRUCK		FOOT
clear		13		13		13
road		7		3		10
town		10		5		12
road-slope	10		5 		12
broken		20		27		17
woods		20		27		17
slope		20		27		17
ford		30		40		20
bridge		7		3		10

All non-vehicle units are considered to be FOOT units. The SP rating given
to each unit is very close to being equal to the unit's maximum miles per
hour speed in clear terrain (when setting speed for a unit you should
consider the SP rating to be equal to miles per hour).

7.10 DISEMBARKING UNDER FIRE:
When vehicles carrying passenger come under fire they may be forced to
unload during the combat phase. Any vehicle that suffers 1 or more KILLS
must immediately unload its passengers. If a vehicle other than a truck or
halftrack suffers 50% suppression while carrying infantry then it must
immediately unload.

If a loaded vehicle suffers KILLS then some or all of the passengers may
also be killed prior to unloading.

7.11 COMBAT REPORTS:
During the combat phase the computer will describe the occurrence of direct
or indirect fire. The computer will report the size and type of shell being
fired and in most instances the KILL and/or SUPPRESSION results.

Listed below are the criteria for describing the size and type of shell
being fired:

SMALL ARMS FIRE: RIFLE, SMG, HMG
LIGHT ARTILLERY FIRE: IG, HOW, MOR shell size <4
MEDIUM ARTILLERY FIRE: IG, HOW, MOR shell size=5
HEAVY ARTILLERY FIRE: IG, HOW, MOR shell size=6
LIGHT ANTI-TANK FIRE: AT SHELL SIZE <2
MEDIUM ANTI-TANK FIRE: AT SHELL SIZE=3
HEAVY ANTI-TANK FIRE: AT, FLAK SHELL SIZE >4
OVERRUN ATTACK: MOVING ARMORED VEHICLES FIRING FROM ZERO RANGE
FLAMETHROWER ATTACK: FLAMETH FIRED FROM ZERO RANGE
GRENADE ATTACK: GRENADE FIRED FROM ZERO RANGE
PANZERFAUST ATTACK: PZFAUST FIRED FROM ZERO RANGE

Armored vehicles with an MP rating of zero are assumed to be firing.
HOWitzer weapons. Armored vehicles with an MP rating greater than zero are
assumed to be firing AT weapons. Halftracks are assumed to be firing HMGs.

				7

During direct fire any KILLS or SUPPRESSION will always be displayed.
During indirect fire KILLS or SUPPRESSION will not be displayed.

7.12 SIGHTING FIRING UNITS:
Any unit on the map that employs direct or indirect fire has a random
chance of being sighted. The chance of sighting is equal to 2 X TURNS FIRED
AT SAME TARGET / RANGE TO TARGET.

7.13 CLOSE-COMBAT MODE:
Armored vehicle or infantry units that are currently moving and have their
engagement range set to ZERO are considered to be in CLOSE-COMBAT MODE. If
a unit in close-combat mode is fired upon by a unit within 3 squares then
the close-combat unit will attempt to move into the same square as the
firing unit before continuing towards its planned objective.

8.0 LINE OF SIGHT
The ability of a unit to see another unit on the map is affected by the
terrain that lies between them. To determine if one unit can observe
another the computer will follow the procedures listed below:

(1) Determine the straight line path from the sighting unit to the target
unit. This path is the "line of sight" (LOS).

(2) Determine if the range to the target unit is greater than the
visibility level, in which case the unit cannot be seen.

(3) Determine if the LOS is blocked (preventing observation) or clear
(permitting observation). If any square on the LOS path contains "blocking"
terrain then there is a possibility the LOS will be blocked.

(4) There are two types of blocking terrain: ELEVATED terrain and COVER
terrain. Elevated terrain is any terrain on the LOS path that has a higher
altitude level than both the sighting and target units. Cover terrain
consists of TOWN, WOODS or BROKEN terrain squares.

(5) Elevated terrain will always block the LOS. Town terrain squares will
always block a line of sight. A LOS may be traced through 1 woods square
that would have otherwise blocked the LOS but will be blocked by a second
woods square. A LOS may be traced through 2 broken squares that would have
otherwise blocked the LOS but will be blocked by a third broken square. A
LOS may not be traced through one forest and one broken square.

(6) If the LOS is not blocked and the two units are on the same altitude
level, then they may observe each other.

(7) If the LOS is not blocked by ELEVATED terrain and the two units are at
different altitude levels, then the following formula is used to determine
if a LOS exists:

LOS is clear if [h-(d X H / D]*>P

*Rounds off number to nearest integer.
H = height of higher position minus height of lower position
D = distance from higher position to lower position
h = height of higher unit
d = distance from potential obstacle to higher position
P = height of potential obstacle

Each square on the path from the higher unit to the lower unit is a
potential obstacle. Cover terrain will increase the altitude level of a
square by 1 additional level when calculating the value of "P" in the above
formula. The following diagram shows the heights of various terrain types
on a typical map. The computer is the final judge in determining LOS.
Players may use the (V)iew key to determine which squares are visible from
any particular square.

9.0 HISTORICAL SCENARIOS

9.1 MEETING ENGAGEMENT EAST OF BRYANSK (JULY 7,1942):
This is a meeting engagement with a game length of 20 turns. The German
player begins with 60 victory points, and the Soviet player begins with 0
victory points. As part of a major attack toward the Resseta River,the
German 11th Panzer Division ran into a large reserve tank force which was
able to inflict severe losses on the German advance guard.

1 = German advance guard encounters Russian tank battalion
2 = Russian tanks retreat, but German attack is ambushed by AT guns in the
    forest
3 = German force splits in order to attack both Russian groups
4 = Russian tank brigade surprises Germans and attacks flank of German
    thrust
5 = Germans withdraw to Kolsovo and defeat Russians, but only after town
    changes hand several times

9.2 ATTEMPTED RELIEF OF STALINGRAD (DECEMBER 17,1942):
This is a German assault with a game length of 30 turns. The German player
begins with 250 victory points, and the Soviet player begins with 60
victory points. The Germans are attempting to break through Russian mobile
formations in order to relieve the beleaguered German 6th Army in
Stalingrad. The Russians have established a strong position around the town
of Verkhniy Kumskiy using motorized infantry and tanks from the Third Tank
Army. Elements of the 6th and 23rd Panzer Divisions were repulsed on the
16th but eventually succeeded in taking the town on the 17th.

9.3 ATTACK TOWARD KIEV (NOVEMBER 3,1943):
This is a Russian assault with a game length of 30 turns. The German player
begins with 20 victory points, and the Soviet player begins with 250
victory points. After crossing the Dnepr River northeast of Kiev, the
Russian units in the bridgehead turned south and attacked the German 68th
Infantry Division. Although successful in clearing the woods of Germans, a
last-minute counterattack by German armor prevented the Russians from
reaching Kiev.

9.4 ATTACK TOWARD BERLIN (MARCH 22,1945):
This is a Russian assault with a game length of 30 turns. The German player
begins with 250 victory points, and the Soviet player begins with 180
victory points. After having achieved bridgeheads over the Oder River both
north and south of Kuestrin, the Russians ordered a tank corps to advance
down the main highway to Berlin. Facing the Russians was a newly formed
Panzer division which could only scrape together 55 Panther and Tiger
tanks. Fighting over flat terrain, the German tanks were able to get the
better of the uncoordinated Russian armor attacks, despite being
outnumbered by 2.5 to 1. The Panther tank once again proved that it was the
best tank of World War II.

10.0 GAME LENGTH AND VICTORY CONDITIONS

10.1 ENDING THE GAME:
The game will automatically end after 20 turns (30 turns if an assault
battle is being played). Players may also elect to end the game early if
the both agree (use the 0 key), and they may also elect to continue a game
that has ended. If they elect to continue a game that has ended, the
computer will never again end the game as this must be done by the players.

10.2 VICTORY CONDITIONS:
At the end of the game victory points (VPs) will be awarded as follows:

EACH UNUSED SELECTION POINT				20
 (maximum of 250 due to unused selection points)
FORCES IN THE OBJECT AREA:
ARMORED VEHICLE						20
ARTILLERY/TRUCK						10
INFANTRY MAN						 5
EACH KILL:
INFANTRY						 1
HMG							 2
50,81,82MOR						 3
120MOR							 5
OTHER ARTILLERY						10
TRUCK							10
ARMORED VEHICLE						10
  plus FRONT ARMOR

Only the attacking player receives points for units in the objective area.
When playing a meeting engagement type battle both players receive points
for units in the objective area (both players are considered to be the
attacker).

After the victory points have been totaled the defender's points will be
doubled (points for unused selection value may be doubled to a value no
greater than 500).

The computer will divide the total German victory points by the total
Russian victory points to arrive at a victory ratio. Compare this ratio to
the following chart to determine the victor:

2.00 and above		German Decisive Victory
1.50-1.99		German Substantive Victory
1.10-1.49		German Marginal Victory
0.92-1.09		Draw
0.67-0.91		Russian Marginal Victory
0.51-0.66		Russian Substantive Victory
0.50 and below		Russian Decisive Victory

11.0 WEAPON NOTES
			    GERMAN TANKS

PZ-IIF - Used as a recon tank prior to 1944. Its 20mm gun was ineffective
against all but the most lightly armored vehicles.

PX-IIL (Lynx) - Appeared in early 1943. Replaced the PZ-IIF. It featured
improved off-road mobility.

PZ-38T - Used as a stop-gap medium tank until mid-1942. Its 37mm gun was
ineffective against all but the most lightly protected vehicles.

PX-IIIF - Used as a medium tank until late 1942. Its 50/42 gun was
ineffective against the T34 and KV type tanks.

PZ-IIIG - A modest improvement over the PZ-IIIF. It featured better armor
and off-road mobility.

PZ-IIIJ - The first version of the PZ-III to be armed with the long 50/60
gun. Used as a medium tank during 1942 and '43. Limited effectiveness
against the T34 at short ranges.

PZ-IIIL - Used as a medium tank from late '42 to '43. Similar to the
PZ-IIIJ with additional armor protection.

PZ-IVF1 - Used as a heavy support tank before 1943. Its short 75/24 gun was
ineffective against the T34 and KV type tanks.

PZ-IVG - Used as a medium and heavy support tank from late '42 to late '43.
Its 75/43 gun was effective out to 1000 yards against the T34.

PZ-IVH - Used as a medium tank from mind-'43 until the end of the war.
Employed "armor skirts" for added protection and a longer 75/48 gun. More
than a match for the T34/76C, and only marginally weaker than the T34/85.

PZ-V (Panther) - Used as a medium tank from mid-'43 until the end of the
war. Its 75/70 gun was effective out to 2000 yards against the T34. Widely
regarded as the best tank design of the war.

PZ-VIa (Tiger) - Used as a heavy tank from late '42 until the end of the
war. Its 88/56 gun was effective out to 1500 yards against the T34.
Outclassed all Soviet tanks during 1943. Was matched by the T34/85, KV-85
and JS-II in 1944.

				11

		    GERMAN TANKS/SELF-PROPELLED GUN

PZ-VIb (King Tiger) - Used as a heavy tank from late '44 until the end of
the war. Its 88/71 gun was effective out to 2000 yards against the T-34.
Extremely heavy frontal armor made it almost invulnerable to head-on fire.

SG-IIIB - Used as an infantry support vehicle before 1943. Its short 75/24
gun was ineffective against most Soviet tanks.

SG-IIIG - Used as a tank destroyer and infantry support vehicle from late
'42 until the end of the war. Good armor, a low silhouette and the 75/48
gun made this an effective and economical anti-tank system.

SK131 (Marder) - Used as a tank destroyer from late '42 until late '44. Its
75/46 gun was effective against most Soviet tanks but its high silhouette
and thin armor made it an easy kill.

SK164 (Nashorn) - Used as a tank destroyer from late '42 until early '44.
Its 88/71 gun with special optics could hit and kill the T34 at 4000 yards.
Like the Marder it was an easy kill if Soviet tanks got close enough.

JPZ-VIp (Elefant) - Used as a tank destroyer during the battle of Kursk in
mid '43 and then withdrawn from the Eastern Front. Armed with the 88/71 gun
and protected with over 2000mm of frontal armor, its effectiveness was
limited by a cross-country speed of only 6 mph.

JPZ-IV - Used as a tank destroyer from early '44 to the end of the war. Had
better armor than the SG-IIIG and the same 75/70 gun as the Panther.

JPZ-38T (Hetzer) - Used as a tank destroyer and infantry support vehicle
from early '44 to the end of the war. Had the same 75/48 gun as the SG-IIIG
and better armor.

JPZ-V (Jagdpanther) - Used in non-divisional anti-tank units from mid '44
to the end of the war. Combined the protection and mobility of the Panther
with the 88/71 gun used by the King Tiger.

JPZ-VIB (Jagdtiger) - Introduced in late '44 in non-divisional anti-tank
units. With a 128/55 gun and 250mm of armor, the Jagdtiger was
statistically the most impressive armored vehicle of the war. However, the
128mm gun had no real advantage over the 88/71 and a cross-country speed of
8mph limited its effectiveness.

STU-H42 - A 105mm howitzer mounted on an SG-IIIG chassis. Used from late
'42 to the end of the war as an infantry support weapon. One platoon per
Stug Company.

				12

		    GERMAN SEL-PROPELLED GUN

PZFH-18 (Wespe) - A lightly armored sel-propelled 105mm field howitzer.
Used from late '42 to the end of the war as divisional artillery for panzer
formations.

PZFH-18M (Hummel) - Used from early '43 to the end of the war. Served same
function as the Wespe but mounted a 150mm field howitzer.

SK231 - Used throughout the war in divisional recon formations. Its 20mm
gun was effective only against unarmored or lightly armored targets.

SK234/2 (Puma) - Used from early '44 to the end of the war in heavy recon
companies. Its long 50mm gun provided a limited anti-tank capability.

PAK35/36 (37AT)* - Used in divisional anti-tank battalions until early '43.
Ineffective against T34 and KV type tanks.

PAK38 (50AT)* - Used 1942-43 in divisional anti-tank battalions. Effective
out to 400 yards against the T34.

PAK41 (75AT)* - Used from mid '42 to the end of the war in divisional
anti-tank battalions. Effective out to 1000 yards against the T34.

PAK43/41 (88AT)* - Used from early '44 to the end of the war in panzer
division anti-tank battalions. Could hit and kill most Soviet tanks within
4000 yards.

FLAK18/36 (88FLAK)* - Used throughout the war in panzer division flak 
battalions. Until mid '42 it was the only weapon that could effectively
stop the T34 and KV tanks. It could kill a T-34 out to 4000 yards. With a
high rate of fire and optics designed to track aircraft, it crushed slow
moving tanks with ruthless efficiency.

PANZERFAUST* - Used from late 1943 to the end of the war to provide
infantry platoons with an effective anti-tank capability. Effective against
all Soviet tanks when fired at point blank range.

FLAMETHROWER* - Issued to combat engineer platoons throughout the war.
Effective against all tanks at point blank range.

	* NOT TO SCALE.

			   SOVIET TANK

T-70 - Used in mechanized recon battalions from early '42 to the end of the
war. Its 45mm gun was effective only against lightly armored vehicles.

				13

			   SOVIET TANK

BT-7 - Used as a medium tank before 1942. Its 45mm gun was occasionally
effective against the PZ-38T, PZ-IIIF, PZ-IIIG and PZ-IVF1. Thin armor made
this tank an easy kill for any German anti-tank weapon.

T-26S - Used as a medium tank before 1942. Burdened with the same weapon
and poor armor as a BT-7 (with reduced mobility). This tank was phased out
in flames during 1941.

T-28C - Used as a heavy tank before 1942. Obsolete by mid '41, the T-28C
had weak armor for a heavy tank. Its 76/26 gun with crude optics could
punch holes in German tanks that got too close. Became extinct following
the great encirclement battles of 1941.

T34/76A - The first production version of the T34, used as a medium tank
from mid '41 until early '43. Its outstanding mobility, armor and firepower
outclassed all German tanks during the first year of the war. Its 76/30 gun
was effective out to 800 yards against the early war PZ-IIIs and PZ-IVs.

T34/76C - Used from early '42 to the end of the war as a medium tank.
Similar to the T34/76A but featured a 76/41 gun with improved range and
accuracy.

T34/85 - Used as a medium tank from early '44 to the end of the war. With
the appearance of the Tiger tanks in 1943 it became necessary to up-gun the
T34. The 85/51 gun was effective out to 1200 yards against the Tiger.

KV-II - Used as a heavy support tank until mid '42. Its 152mm howitzer
could flatten a PZ-III while its 100mm thick armor made it invulnerable to
all but the German 88FLAK.

KV-I - Used as a heavy tank until late '42. Armed with the same 76/30 gun
as the T34/76A and protected by 20% more armor. Outclassed all German tanks
during the first year of the war.

KV-Ic - Used as a heavy tank from late '42 until early '44. Similar to the
KV-I but had an improved 76/41 gun.

KV-85 - Used as a heavy tank from early '44 to the end of the war. The KV
weapon was upgraded to a 85/51 in response to the appearance of the Tiger
in 1943.

JS-II - Used as a heavy tank since early '44; it was the most widely used
heavy tank in the last months of the war. Its 122/43 gun could penetrate
the frontal armor of the King tiger at 800 yards.

JS-III - The final version of the JS tank to appear in World War II. First
appearing in early 1945, it did not reach the frontline units in time to
see much combat. Mounting the same 122/43 gun as the JS-II, its armor was
redesigned to maximize the effects of sloping.

STRATEGY NOTES

DEPLOYMENT
When deploying on defense you should entrench your infantry near the forward
edge of the objective area in company size positions. Position your
anti-tank guns and some of your armored vehicles behind this line by 3-5
squares. Place your mortars and main HQ 5-15 squares behind the infantry on
hilltops which have clear fields of vision of probable enemy approach
routes. You are attempting to create a situation in which enemy tanks first
encounter your infantry positions,and then almost simultaneously receive
medium range anti-tank fire. Try to keep at least one company of tanks in
reserve, committing them only once the axis of the main enemy attack is
determined. When attacking place your infantry in half-tracks or on tanks
and then set up in a tight formation no more than 5-10 squares wide.
Consider splitting off a task force of one tank company and one infantry
company to flank the enemy defensive positions.

COMMAND CONTROL
Be sure to protect your main HQ by placing it in the rear, but keep it on a
hilltop if possible so that it can call in off-board artillery with a
minimum delay. Keep your HQ units 1-2 squares behind the units they are
commanding. Russian tank brigade and infantry battalion HQ's and all German
battalion HQ's should only be committed to combat when absolutely
necessary.

GETTING YOUR UNITS TO MOVE
A unit will not move as long as it is firing at an enemy unit. In order to
get the unit to stop firing you must lower the unit's target selection
range. Stop! It is essential that you understand this concept, as your
setting it too high may keep the unit from moving as it fires ineffectively
at distant targets, but setting it too low may cause the unit to continue
moving into an ambush even as enemy units may appear dangerously close.

FIRING ON THE MOVE
While moving, a unit may begin to fire on an enemy target. If you wish to
keep firing at the enemy while taking advantage of cover terrain in the
unit's square, but you also want to keep the unit's current movement
objective, set the unit's speed to 0. Even if you don't want to keep the
current movement objective, it is better to set the speed to 0 than to use
the (K) cancel command, since the cancel command will eliminate any pulses
fired at a target that may already have accumulated.

TRUCKS
Never drive loaded trucks within range of enemy fire, as this is the
quickest way to lose your guns and infantry. Keep them in cover terrain or
behind hills where they cannot be spotted by enemy artillery observers.

WEAPONS
At least 50% of the strategy in Kampfgruppe is derived from the differences
between weapons systems. It is essential that you study your weapons when
beginning a scenario, as well as attempt to predict which weapons you will
face. Try to establish at what range you will attempt to engage enemy
tanks. For example if you have PZ-IIIJ tanks and expect to face T-34/76A
tanks, it would be foolish to close to 400 yards, stop and exchange fire.
The sound strategy would be to obtain back armor shots, or close to 0
range. However, if you have some 75 or 88 AT guns, it might be wise to lure
the Russian tanks towards your tanks and then open up with the AT guns at
medium range as you charge forward with your tanks. The key is
understanding under what conditions your weapons have an acceptable chance
of defeating the enemy.

SPECIAL INFANTRY WEAPONS
Infantry defending in cover terrain cannot be seen until either an enemy
unit enters its square or the infantry unit opens fire. For this reason it
is often wise to set the target selection range of defending infantry to
zero. This will allow the infantry to ambush enemy units that enter its
square. The weakness of this strategy is that each defending square,once
discovered,can be attacked piecemeal. When attacking against the 0 range
strategy, it is best to send infantry one square ahead of the attacking
tanks, as it is much better to have your infantry ambushed than your tanks.
If you don't have time for a slow infantry advance, be sure to put infantry
on your tanks, for if your tanks are ambushed, at least your infantry will
dismount and fire back in defense of the tanks. Do not allow infantry with
grenades to continue firing at your armored vehicles, for with an accuracy
of 25, their ability to hit will triple. This represents the ability of
unsuppressed infantry to eventually climb on enemy tanks and destroy them
with light weapons. Grenades represent infantry close assaulting tanks, in
which case the thickness of the armor of the defending tank becomes
insignificant; thus grenades have been given a penetration value of 25.

SUPPRESSION
In Kampfgruppe, once a unit has been fully suppressed (100+), it may easily
be destroyed by a unit entering its square. The key is to identify
soft-targets, keep them suppressed, and then send in at least one unit to
close assault the defender. Using small arms and artillery fire to suppress
armored vehicles can also be useful, as it can help keep the vehicles from
acquiring new targets.

THE COMBINED ARMS CONCEPT
Kampfgruppe rewards those who are able to use combined arms tactics. On the
attack, artillery should be used to suppress and destroy enemy anti-tank
guns,as well as suppress enemy mortar positions. Infantry is needed to
suppress and then assault defending infantry positions, as well as help is
suppressing enemy vehicles. Tanks can be used to destroy enemy vehicles and
overrun suppressed enemy infantry and gun positions. Armored cars and light
tanks should be positioned several squares ahead of the assault elements in
order to spot enemy positions and draw fire from anti-armor weapons, thus
exposing them to the fire of your artillery. On defense, use infantry to
ambush tanks and suppress any units that come too close. Artillery can be
used to keep attacking infantry pinned down, while anti-tank guns attack
vehicles that are mixing it up with the defending infantry. Tanks should be
used as a mobile reserve, fighting off major armored thrusts, or
counterattacking unsupported infantry attacks.

				APPENDIX 2:

PROGRAM TO DETERMINE KILL PROBABILITIES FOR DIRECT FIRE VS ARMORED VEHICLES

We invite you to use the program shown below to calculate kill
probabilities against armored vehicles. (Atari users: For lines 4-18,
replace INPUT "X?"; Y with PRINT "X"; :INPUT Y.)

4 INPUT "RANGE TO TARGET?";A		Input range to target.
6 INPUT "MR?';B				Input maximum range of gun.
8 INPUT "MP?";C				Input maximum penetration of gun.
10 INPUT "SS?";D			Input shell size of gun.
12 INPUT "AC?";E			Input accuracy of gun.
14 INPUT "TARGET ARMOR?";F		Input front or back armor of
                                        target.
16 INPUT "SL?";G:SL=G+6-A:		Input silhouette of target.
   IF A>5 OR B=0 THEN SL=G		Calculate increase in silhouette
					due to range of less than 6. Do not
					adjust silhouette if firing weapon
					is a SIW.
18 INPUT "PULSES FIRED AT TARGET?;H	Input pulses fired at target.
20 IF H>4 THEN H=4			Pulses fired at target cannot
					exceed 4.
22 INPUT "NUMBER OF WEAPONS FIRING?';N	Input number of weapons firing.
24 IF B=0 THEN B=1			Set B to avoid DIVIDE BY 0 error.
26 AC=((B-A)*90/B)+(H*E)^2/100		Calculate accuracy (C-64 users: Use
					key instead of (^)).
28 AC=AC*SL/4				Adjust accuracy for silhouette
					size.
30 PE=(D*D)/4)+C-(C*(A/B)/2		Calculate adjusted penetration
					factor.
32 IF PE<F THEN AC=AC/2			Adjust accuracy if penetration is
					less than armor.
34 IF PE<F*1.25 THEN AC=AC/2		Adjust accuracy if penetration is
					less than (1.25*ARMOR).
36 IF PE>2*F THEN PE=2*F		Adjust penetration cannot be
					greater than (2*ARMOR).
38 KI=(AC*PE*N)/(1200*F)		Calculate expected number of kills.
40 KI=INT(1000*KI+.0005)):KI=KI/1000	Round off expected number of kills.
42 PRINT "EXPECTED NUMBER OF KILLS EQUALS " KI  Print expected number of
					kills.

-Divide the expected number of kills by 2 if the target is moving.
-Divide the expected number of kills by 2 if the target is in cover terrain
 and has a current speed of 0.

If the program above was executed, the result would look like the following
example:

RANGE TO TARGET? 2
MR? 10
MP? 8
SS? 4
AC? 6
TARGET ARMOR? 8
SL? 4
PULSES FIRED AT TARGET? 4
NUMBER OF WEAPONS FIRING? 10
EXPECTED NUMBER OF KILLS EQUALS 2.15

In this example, a company of ten T-34/76C tanks is firing at an enemy
PZ-IVH group. The range is 2 (400 yards), and the shots are fired at the
front armor of the PZ-IVH's. The expected result is that 2.15 PZ-IVH tanks
will be destroyed.

		 APPENDIX 4: IVAN AND THE VALKYRIES
		       by Robert S. Billings

Ivan lay pressed against the fresh snow covering the flat, frozen tundra.
He felt rather than saw the other bodies parked closely around him. His
whole world was as dark as his purpose for being there. He was only a
simple peasant, though they had different words for it now. But he had been
plucked up in the nightmare summer of '41 and tossed about like a wood chip
on a vast, stormy sea. Now he was here,lying quietly with the others, and
soon he would be walking forward into the machine guns.

A flare flickered to sudden brightness above him. He looked up briefly -
then jerked his head down as the staccato of the machine thrust angry
bullets over his head. Another machine gun joined in. He heard a sickening
thud, followed by a suppressed groan. Then the flare flickered twice and
went out. The machine guns stopped. He relaxed slightly. They hadn't seen
anything. They were just shooting blindly into the vast white
emptiness,easing their night terrors. Ivan knew the feeling. Hadn't he
spent many long night hours lying behind a machine gun, seeing sudden
dangers flicker in every shadow?

Five hundred yards away Hauptmann Kraus crouched in a shallow hole, peering
intently over the edge. His eyes felt puffed and grainy from lack of sleep.
He knew his company held too long a front. But so did every other company.
The whole corps was out here hanging on a line with their flanks flapping
in the wind. So what else was new?

So that was why he was out here in the darkest hour before dawn. If the
Russkies were ready to try it again, he had to have every man on the line.
But if they weren't he had to let the men get what rest and warmth they
could. At twenty below,you try to keep every man awake and on the line all
the time and pretty soon you don't have a company. You have a laundry list
of frostbite, trenchfoot, gangrene, pneumonia...

So it was up to the company commander to take up the slack, drag himself
out here and discover or guess if they were ready to come yet. There was no
way to be sure. Give them a little fold in the ground and those Russkies
would hide a corps under your nose, so close they'd make you sneeze from
tickling the hairs in your nostrils. It was just a judgment call - and he
was tired of making judgments.

But that was what he was an officer for. Only sometimes in the darkest hour
before dawn, with the temperature way below zero and his feet numb in his
boots, the cynical voice would speak within him. Let the Fuhrer come up
here and make this god-damned judgment call for a change. Then I'll go back
to Berlin and decide whether we ought to invade China or Tibet next. Just
in case we run out of Russkies sometime in the next twenty years.

He pulled his thought back from their treasonous path and peered intently
over the edge of the hole, trying to determine whether those dark splotches
in the snow could be Russkies moving up for an attack.

Two miles to the west of Hauptmann Kraus's shallow hole, Staff Officer
Helmut Steiner examined the situation map spread out on the crude table
under the electric lantern. The regimental command post had seen more
glamorous settings - French chateaux, Ukrainian estates. Now they had been
glad to get this crude peasant's hut that smelled of sweat and animals. The
stone walls were thick and the space small enough to hold in some heat from
the fire. Right now Helmut Steiner was not thinking of past glories. His
attention was riveted on the thin, scattered lines on the situation map.

"What do we do if they come this morning?" he muttered.

"Maybe they won't," the other officer in the room said. "And if they hold
off a few more days, we should have the Tigers they keep telling us they've
sent."

Staff Officer Steiner snorted contemptuously. "Tigers, hell. With out luck
we'd get Porsches - no machine guns and clumsy as a pregnant tabby cat. How
come we never get any Panthers?"

"Panthers!" the other officer expostulated in mock surprise. The lines and
sagging skin of his face hinted at a former fullness, and his worn gray
uniform hung loosely from drooping shoulders. "What do you think you're in
- Das Reich? Your division only has a number, boy. You've got to be in a
division with a name if you want frosting on your applestrudel."

"If we just had a battalion of Panthers," Steiner said, ignoring his fellow
officer's bantering," we could wipe out any penetration before it could
start tearing things loose. Have you seen the Panther yet? It's the finest
tank in the world. Thick armor, a gun that'll stop any T-34, and it
maneuvers like a ballet dancer."

"Don't start singing Wagner about it," his fellow officer said drily.
"They're only making about two a month. I got it straight from the woman
who cleans out the Fuhrer's rest room back in Berlin. Keep 'em rare - like
diamonds. Two a month. Only for name divisions. The Fuhrer's going to
autograph each one personally.

Staff Officer Steiner smiled in spite of himself. He knew his friend had
been highly regarded in the campaign in France, and he had two medals of
valor in the '41 campaign. But for many months now he had been taking a
sour view, and he had recently been moved down the promotion list at least
twice. "You better watch that kind of talk. It gets around. In Berlin
they'd call it defeatism. And since the bombing stepped up they take a
pretty dim view of it, believe me." His friend sighed wearily. "In Berlin
they've got pretty dim view-finders. They can't see past the eastern
suburbs. This god-forsaken country doesn't even exist for them. They think
the war's being fought on some god-damned opera stage, with big-breasted
sopranos floating around overhead and swooping down every now and then to
scoop up heroes. Out here's another world. You got to keep a little sense
of humor,or the marbles rattling around in your head'll start spilling out
your ears."

"You and I may know that," Steiner said more gently. "But some pip-squeak
replacement officer may hear you sometime and think it's his duty to report
you. It's not just you and me here."

"Yes it is," his friend countered. "Only you and me in an icy hell-hole
full of Russkies. And we're just off-key baritones in the back row of the
chorus. And the Valkyries aren't swooping down for the likes of us."

Staff Officer Steiner ignored his friend's replay and went on studying the
map. He wished he knew what was going on up there where the lines stretched
pitifully thin across the front. Then he heard the rumble of artillery to
the east.

				19

Obergefreiter Weismann dove for his hole at the first sound of the incoming
artillery. Cursing the enemy for interrupting him at such a time,he lay
there on his belly, hurriedly pulling up his pants. Damn those Russkies. It
was like they'd timed it just for him. Now they'd be in for an hour or more
of steady shelling. Then the waves of infantry. Probably tanks too. It was
a hell of a place for a man with a loose bowel. He was glad Kraus had had
the extra ammo brought up. Hauptmann Kraus was a hard-headed
son-of-a-bitch. A man in his company could hardly get away with anything.
But he knew his stuff, all right. The shells now were shrieking overhead
and exploding a few hundred yards to the rear. So much the better. Give
those rear-echelon bastards a little thrill to write home about. But he
knew the relief was only momentary. Those Russkies used artillery like a
man driving a tack with a sledge hammer. No fire direction. Hell,they
didn't need it. they just lined 'em up hub-to-hub, pointed 'em straight
ahead, and started the spring plowing. And he knew it was just another
throw of the dice whether he'd end up fertilizer for the next crop. What
the hell, when your ass belongs to the Wehrmacht - shot off or froze off,
one just takes a little longer.

Suddenly the earth erupted all around him, and he cowered trembling on the
very bottom of his hole. Chunks of snow and frozen earth splattered over
him from a near miss. Now he was in for it. They said if one came into your
hole you never knew a thing. Maybe so. But how the hell would they know
that? He'd sure seen a lot it had happened to, but they weren't in
condition to give evidence. Another round landed a few feet to his front,
so close the vibration bounced him right off the bottom of the hole.

His heart was racing wildly and he held his breath waiting for the next
one. It didn't come. He waited trembling a few more moments. Had it lifted
so soon? Them damn Russkies must be running short of ammo. They hadn't
plowed up one-quarter as much terrain as they usually did.

He became aware of moans and cries of pain around him. He supposed he
should get up on his machine gun. But shells were still coming in a short
distance away on both flanks. And lying there was downright peaceful. "Get
the hell up out of there!"

Obergefreiter Weismann gazed up into the angry face of Hauptmann Kraus.
"Yessir," he said, getting up quickly and sliding his machine gun into
position. "I thought since they was still shelling on both sides of us -"

"Your job isn't to think," the company commander broke in abruptly. "Your
job is to obey orders. Is that clear?"

"Yessir," Obergefreiter Weizmann snapped. He full-loaded the gun and
crouched behind it, his face expressionless, his eyes peering straight
ahead into the dark. 

"Very well," the commander said. Then after a pause he spoke a little less
harshly.

"That's a trick the Russkies have," he said. "You've been with the outfit
long enough, I thought you knew it. Sometimes they'll lift the artillery
for just a small corridor - and then attack down it. And it looks like
we're the little corridor this time. We have to be ready for it." Then
Hauptmann Kraus turned abruptly and walked along the line of holes,
checking each one as he went by. Weizmann could see nothing yet through the
darkness. It would start to lighten now in a few minutes. Then his heart
sank as he heard, between the ca-ruumps of the shell bursts, the grinding
of tank motors to his front. Christ, he thought. Now we're really in for
it.

Hauptmann Kraus took a deep breath and dashed the last few yards to his
dug-in C.P. The radio operator, barely seventeen and new to the Eastern
front, was staring at him wide-eyed and open-mouthed. But everything looked
all right. No shell had hit the CP yet.

"Pull your jaw up and get me battalion," Kraus said. They boy snapped his
mouth shut and turned to the radio. He was a good boy, the commander
thought. Just young, and new to this god-awful mess. He'd be all right. And
then he added to himself ruefully, if he lives long enough.

The boy was having trouble getting through. It wasn't the boy's fault.
Kraus knew every company commander in the area would be trying to get
through with some desperate message. And they'd all be getting sympathy,
pep talks, and the same message. "The Fuhrer has not authorized any
withdrawal from this position. It must be held at all costs." Hell, he
wondered why he bothered to ask.

Still, he was responsible for one hundred and seven men (minus however many
he'd just lost in the artillery barrage, he corrected himself). And he owed
it to them to give somebody up there the facts and a chance to make a
sensible decision. Before he came back with that "The Fuhrer has not
authorized" crap.

Suddenly, for no reason he could think of, an image from what seemed ages
ago popped into his mind. He had been riding through the streets of some
large city in the Ukraine. It was summer, the sun was shinning in a bright
blue sky, and girls were waving as he rode past. That was when there had
been enough transport for his whole company to ride in trucks behind him.
That had seemed a helluva different war. He'd thought then of his as the
chosen generation. It really was almost like a Wagnerian opera - only
happier, less stark. Why, the people they were conquering seemed to welcome
them, to love them for what they were doing. And it all made perfect sense
to him then. Weren't the Germans liberating them from Stalin and the drab
life he had forced on them?

We liberated them all right, he thought grimly. Kraus had seen some of the
trains hauling them off like cattle to work in the factories for the German
war machine. And now to drive without a large military escort through one
of those cities was worth a German officer's life. The partisans would get
him - or some free-booter with a salvaged rifle and a heartful of revenge.
The "liberated" were now the inferior, subject races of the East. That had
been a great day in the Ukrainian city. But it had been all downhill ever
since. Then the radio's crackle roused him from his reverie.

Ivan lay still, hearing the roar of tank motors approaching from the rear.
He looked back for the first sight of them against the gray dawn sky. He
knew there was supposed to be an avenue for them to pass through the
infantry lying packed together on the snow. But he knew from past
experience what it was like in those T-34s. He had made friends with a tank
commander before a previous battle, and he knew just how little the driver
could see of where he was going. He had been allowed to ride in one, while
his friend the tank commander told him what it was like going into battle
in a T-34.

It was the best tank in any army. With its long seventy-six millimeter gun
and heavy, sloping armor, it was more than a match for the German Mark
III's small fifty millimeter. But it was a battle tank, with nothing wasted
on the comfort of them men it would take into battle. The tank commander
had shown him how difficult it was to get the gun loaded, aimed, and fired
in the tiny space provided. After nine shots they had to pull the floor up
to get at the ammunition stored beneath. And to make matters worse, the
command and his loader

				20

were seated so they didn't turn with the turret. The turret and gun moved,
but their seats, fastened to the turret ring, remained fixed (as much as
anything inside that wildly pitching chassis lurching over rough terrain
could be said to be "fixed"). And it was up to both of them to stay out of
the way of that killing recoil from the high-velocity gun. The tank
commander told him of the loader who had forgotten to lean his shoulder far
enough out of the way of the recoil on a wide-angle shot. They had heard
him scream once. Then the commander had had to both load and fire in the
cramped space until they found a chance to stop and get the loader out. His
left shoulder and part of his chest seemed to be missing, and he had bled
to death long before then. Ivan knew those tankers had too much on their
minds to worry about any little avenue left for them. He intended to watch
out for himself. He didn't want those nineteen-inch treads, supporting over
forty tons of metal, passing over him by mistake.

He saw suddenly that daylight had arrived, cold and gray. The clouds could
have been a leaden tent-roof propped over them, so low did they seem.

Obergfreiter Weizmann sighted his machine gun at the tanks waddling toward
him across the snow. He had too much sense to fire at them. His bullets
would just bounce off, and he would have revealed his position for nothing.
But there was bound to be infantry with them soon, and they were his
responsibility. He would just have to hope the two anti-tank guns would do
their work well. Which was probably assuming too much, considering one was
only a fifty millimeter, and unless it got in a shot from the flank or rear
its shells would bounce off as badly as his. But he knew the gun a hundred
yards to his right rear was an eighty-eight. That could do the job, all
right. But how long could one eighty-eight hold out against tanks with
infantry support?

Then as he watched, the first wave of infantry rose and started forward.
The tanks were just a few yards in front of them, and the two lines
advanced together. Those Russkies had sure learned a lot in a couple of
years. They didn't send the tanks through along any more. All the fun was
being squeezed out of this damned war.

He estimated they were about two hundred yards away now. Close enough for
him to start on the infantry. But he hoped something would distract those
tanks when he did. Otherwise he could end up with a seventy-six in his lap.

Machine guns were opening up now on both sides of him. He fired a long
burst at the infantrymen opposite him and saw three go down. They sure
hadn't learned to space themselves in an attack yet. They still came
practically should to shoulder. He fired another burst and saw two more go
down. The machine guns were tearing huge gaps in the line of infantrymen
plodding awkwardly forward.

Then one of the tanks fired toward the machine gun on his right. He ducked
involuntarily as pieces of shell casing whizzed past him. Other tanks were
firing now, both their machine guns and the long seventy-sixes. He ducked
again as a cluster of bullets zipped past over his head. Where the hell
were those anti-tank guns?

There was a sharp crack to his left, followed by a clang against one of the
nearest tanks. Hell, that was the fifty, and they hadn't waited long
enough. He'd bet that was the last shot for that crew. He saw two of the
long tank guns swinging toward the anti-tank gun's position. Then both guns
spoke together. Two explosions erupted as one, and from the corner of his
eye he saw part of a gun carriage fly into the air. Then there was a
sharper crack from his right, and one of the tanks that had fired seemed to
explode. That was the eighty-eight, all right. While he kept the bullets
spraying from his own gun, he wondered if the eight-eight would get another
round off. At least a couple of turrets were cranking toward the gun's
position.

Then there was a flash, followed quickly by a second. He knew that would be
the Panzerfaust men. The first round hit a tank a glancing blow and
ricocheted off. But the second hit just right. There was another explosion
and the tank jerked to a stop. Then he was firing steadily and had no time
to see anything but the awkwardly advancing figures falling to lie
motionless in the snow. Yet still they came. When would they learn they
were licked? Then for the first time he felt a sickening drop in his
stomach as the thought - when will we?

Staff Officer Steiner listened to Hauptmann Krau's voice on the radio
without hearing any of the words he was saying. He knew them all already,
and Kraus was right, and what good did it do? Steiner's superior had left
him here with one simple instruction. "No retreat is authorized." He could
feel the desperation in Kraus's voice,but what was the use? Yet he couldn't
tell the company commander the truth - that he might as well have been
talking to a phonograph.

The Hauptmann's voice had stopped. Now he would have to give the same old
record he'd been giving the others. "I know it's hard, but the orders are
clear. Hang on somehow. That's all I can tell you."

"They've just taken out my last anti-tank gun. What do I hang on with?"

"We're expecting a trainload of Mark IV's and Tigers to arrive shortly.
They'll be unloaded only ten miles from here. We've got the men to handle
them standing ready. As soon as they arrive we'll rush them up. That's all
I can tell you. That, and hang on."

And I shouldn't have told you that much over the radio, he thought. But how
could he leave a fellow officer up there, way out on a limb, with no hope
at all? He could sense the despair and disgust in Kraus's voice as he
started to sign off. Then in the midst of the transmission there was a
sudden blast and scream.

"Hauptmann Krasu, are you all right?" he asked anxiously.

There was a long moment's silence, then the radio cracked again.

"I'm just peachy," the commander's voice came back. "They just killed my
radio operator, is all. He just hung on a little too long, I guess."

Ivan ran a few steps and flopped down in a slight depression. That machine
gun, only thirty yards away now, just wouldn't be knocked out. The tanks
had already gone on past, and a second wave of infantry were well ahead on
both his flanks. Most of the first wave were lying strewn about the snow,
inert and lifeless, a few occasionally twitching and moaning. Around Ivan
there were only motionless bodies. He didn't know why he was still alive.
Perhaps it was that giant-like fellow who had fallen, a victim of the
German machine gun right in front of him. Ivan had lain there for some
time, apparently the only Russian infantryman still alive in that part of
the field. Every now and then he had heard more bullets striking the
giant-like body with a dead thud each time, like a mallet pounding a side
of beef. But he knew he had to get up and go after the machine gun.

After all, he was the only one left to do it. The battle was moving on. The
tanks already were way ahead - except for the shattered and smoldering
hulks around him. He felt a little like those hulks must feel, if they were
animals instead of piles of junk. He felt a sudden kinship to them. After
all, he had no business still being alive either. Every friend he'd made
had gone long ago.

After awhile he'd stopped making friends. It wasn't worth it. They'd almost
surely be gone after one battle. Two at most. And then there would be the
sorrow of their absence. Now the inert, motionless bodies around him were
no sorrow to him. Let their mothers and hadn't rolled off some factory
production line like the smoldering tanks that loomed up around him,
starkly cold and vacant against the dull gray sky.

				21

He raised his head slightly and tried to decide how he could get ten yards
closer before throwing the grenade.

Hauptmann Kraus figured he had about thirty men left - forty at most. There
were those with him around the CP, who had been behind the three machine
gun positions that had split the attack like a rock ledge splitting a herd
of elephants charging across a plain. One of those guns, probably
Weizmann's, was still firing. The other two had been silent for some time
now. Almost everything else was gone. He had a feeling that the firing far
to his left indicated one gun on that flank might still be working. But
there was no way to get word over there, even if he had orders to pull
back.

There was a narrow draw running toward the rear just a few feet from the
CP. If he could get permission to withdraw, there might be a chance - an
outside chance - he could get most of the little group around his CP out
through that draw. It would be hard to get Weizmann out. But if that damn
headquarters would ever wake up to what was happening and authorize a
withdrawal, he thought there was still a chance to bring him back too.

Staff Officer Steiner felt larger and larger chunks were being chipped off
his insides by a hundred little men with chisels. He had once had a vision
of himself as a solid block of granite - a true German, a man of will and
determination, equal to any challenge. That was when he had been a mere
lieutenant commanding a small group of infantry in the '41 offensive. Where
was that will and determination now? That solid block of granite had
weathered and rotted into soft,porous sandstone.

The outside door opened with a bang and his friend Hans came through it,
clanging it shut behind him. The loose folds of skin around his jaw, once
plump with flesh, quivered slightly as he shook his head to clear it of
some disastrous vision.

"Well what did you find out?" Steiner asked quickly.

"It's all gone to hell," Hans said. He walked to the fire in the grate and
stood in front of it, letting such warmth as could reach him sink into his
stiffened joints and numb flesh. "The commander's disappeared. He went to
get those six tanks we had being repaired. Going to 'counterattack - chop
'em off at the root,' he claimed. Only the tanks weren't ready, he never
got there, and all radio contact with him's been cut. I got a look at the
direction he went in. There's goddamned T-34s running all over there like
cockroaches in a house on fire.

Face it, boy. He's gone. Let's be charitable to the old son-of-a-bitch and
say the Valkyries have come to swoop him up and carry him off to Valhalla.
We will now have a one-second pause for mourning. Now, are we going to tell
Kraus and the others - if there are any others left by now - to get the
hell out of there?"

Steiner stood looking at his friend,incomprehension written on his face.
"But I can't...you can't...he can't - "

"No time for conjugating verbs, boy. We can, you better, and they have."

"Have what?"

"Shagged ass. Now, you're it."

"I don't have any authority?"

"Yes you do, boy. Best authority in the world. In fact the only authority
left, out here."

"Whose authority?"

"Rules of the game. Musical chairs. Last man left with his ass in a chair
when the music stops gets to play king of the hill."

"There are three officers above -"

"Were, boy. There were three, or six, or ten, but it's no matter now. We
got a fast-moving situation here. Those T-34s are blowing away chairs left
and right. There's fat-assed staff officers all over the floor. The
Valkyries are so loaded with heroes they're flapping their wings to near
bust a gut and barely clearing the chimney-tops. You're it, boy. Now, what
are you going to do?"

A sudden crackle came from the radio on the table. Then after a moment of
static Company Commander Kraus's voice came through clearly.

"I've just lost my gun on the left flank. No contact with any unit except
those around the CP. Tanks have gone by long ago. Infantry passing left and
right of us. Can't see any good we can do here, unless you've got those
tanks and are planning a counterattack. Any change in our orders?"

Steiner stared at the radio, his face white and numb.

"Oh, one thing I forgot," Hans interjected. "Those 'Tigers and Ferdinards'
we've been expecting. Cross them off too. Partisans knocked out the main
bridge over the river fifteen miles west of here. That railroad won't be
working by a week from Tuesday."

Staff Officer Steiner stood motionless a few moments more. His ashen face
seemed to be pleading with his friend for something solid to hold to. Hans
looked back at him sympathetically.

"There's a time for flags and parades and speeches from Der Fuhrer. It was
great fun while it lasted. But we passed that time a long time back. Der
Fuhrer hasn't learned it. If he ever does. But Der Fuhrer's in Berlin, and
you're in the middle of Eastern Nowhere, in snow drifts up to your ears -
and you better start making your own decisions now."

Steiner's lower lip trembled slightly. He stopped it by biting down so hard
blood oozed out around his teeth. He took a deep breath and strode to the
situation map.

"Where do you think's the most likely place to pick up the pieces? Back
here by the river?"

"It looks like the only chance to me," Hans said, all bantering gone from
his voice now. "It's ten miles back, and they'll run out of steam before
then. If we can get enough back and across in time -"

"Good," Steiner said, his voice firm and his jaw tight. "That's what we'll
try for. You see what we can march order out of here. I'll tell Kraus and
the others."

Obergefreiter Weizmann hadn't heard a friendly machine gun for some
minutes. It had been quiet in front of his own position since he had sent
those last few rounds at the Russkie trying to close in on him. He hoped he
had got him. But there was no way of knowing. Surrounded by dead
infantrymen and burnt-out tanks, he felt he had been left behind in an ash
heap of the war. Where the hell was everyone? Cleared out and left him with
his finger in the dike? Kraus was a son-of-a-bitch, but that didn't sound
like him. Maybe Kraus was kaput too.

Hell, I'd get out of here if I knew some way to do it. What the hell am I
doing here, anyway? Der Fuhrer said we needed the Russkies' land for
lebensraum. The hell with it. I'd be willing to settle for a little less
room. When it comes to country as cold and flat and worthless as this -
they can have my share. I wonder why these damn Russkies fight so hard for
it?

Well, damn them and damn their land. And damn all those bastards living
high back there in Berlin. And if Der Fuhrer don't like it, damn him, and
his mustache too.

He squeezed off another burst as his eye caught a glimpse of movement among
the bodies scattered in front of him on the snow.

Ivan drew in a long breath and held it. It would have to be now. No sense
putting it off now. No sense putting it off. That solider was still alive
behind that machine gun, and he wasn't going away. And that last burst had
come close. Ivan knew he had lived far beyond what he was entitled to by
the odds.

He held the grenade tightly in his hand and sprang forward.

				22

Hauptmann Kraus gave another glance around the CP and then followed the
last man out. He saw the line of men ahead of him, crawling desperately
toward the draw. Some few had already reached it. If there were just some
way to get Weizmann out of there now. But as he watched, another wave of
infantry was starting toward him from two hundred yards away. Anyone trying
to go toward Weizmann's position would be mowed down instantly. And if he
didn't get his men up that draw fast none of them would make it back. Still
he paused, knowing there was nothing he could do, but feeling something
terribly wrong in leaving without Weizmann.

Then as he waited he saw it all happen quickly. The Russian soldier
springing forward, Weizmann's gun turning on him to stitch him neatly
across the middle, the Russian falling but swinging his arm forward as he
did,the grenade black against the leaden sky and falling with precision or
maybe just luck in the middle of Weizmann's hold,exploding a fraction of a
second later and scattering snow and pieces of Weizmann in a small circle
around the hole.

Hauptmann Kraus felt his heart constrict within his chest. Well, he was
free to go now. Back to wherever they would tell him the new Eastern
Frontier of the Third Reich was being put in for him to defend. He turned
and crawled rapidly toward where the line of men was disappearing into the
draw.

Come on, let's go, "Staff Officer Steiner said urgently to his friend, who
was coming out of the peasant's hut with a last piece of equipment from the
CP. They had enough vehicles to carry everyone - but the sound of tankfire
had been getting steadily louder. Then, as he looked eastward, he thought
he saw some monstrous animal rising from a fold in the ground and swinging
its elongated snout toward the group of men clustered around the CP.

He saw the flash and heard the shell approaching at the same moment. He
didn't even have time to throw himself to the ground. There was a
shattering explosion, a flash of fire, and the corner of the stone house
they had been occupying seemed to collapse before his eyes. A shower of
objects struck him, and he was sure it was all over. But the shower ceased
and he was still standing. Then he saw the objects that had showered him
were pieces of stone blown from the house.

"Quick, get those vehicles behind the house!" he shouted. Motors were
shoved into gear, wheels spun and then took hold, and those not aboard the
vehicles ran clumping on heavy boots around the corner of the building. As
he started to run himself, Steiner saw with sinking heart his friend
stretched on the snow before the door. Oblivious of the tank, he ran to
kneel by his friend's side. He saw a gaping wound pulsing blood from his
chest.

Desperately he lifted him from the ground, half dragging and half carrying
the surprisingly light body, and made for the shelter behind the corner of
the house. He expected each moment to hear the rush of a second shell
coming in to finish the job. The corner of the house was only a few feet
away, then only a step. He breathed a sigh of relief as he slipped past the
corner to momentary safety.

For a moment panic seemed to reign. Steiner lay his friend down and spoke
with urgent authority.

"Just stay behind the house for a minute. You there, take that Panzerfaust
and get over by that corner. The rest of you load up and be ready to get
out of here when I give the order. Now don't get excited. There's an
eighty-eight only a couple of hundred yards over there. That tank's going
to be in his field of fire before he can get to this building. Move fast,
now."

Then he could bend down to his friend. The blood was oozing out more slowly
now. He couldn't tell how bad it was. His friend was conscious, looking up
at him with eyes that seemed as amused as ever. He seemed about to speak.

"Don't talk," Steiner said gently. "We'll be out of here in a minute or
two. The aid station's just a little way back there. We'll have you there
before you know it."

Hans didn't seem to know what he was saying, but was intent on some message
of his own.

"Contraltos. Every damned one." He paused to take a breath. "I saw 'em.
Heard their wings flappin'. Not a soprano in the lot."

Steiner felt something pushing up into his throat, making him choke up. He
wanted to tell his friend to cut the clowning, this was serious. Then he
realized how ridiculous that would sound.

"I saw 'em, but they didn't stop," his friend was muttering. "They went
thataway." He rolled his eyes eastward, back toward where the battle had
started that morning. "One in front...seen her some place...yeah...jus'
like a real bag use' t'sing...Berlin nightclub. Whole gang...built like
Tiger tanks."

Steiner blinked back tears and stared helplessly at his friend's face. One
corner of his mind heard the eighty-eight speak, the shell rushing through
the air, the explosion, followed by other explosions. The shell must have
penetrated and set off some of the ammunition. Now they could get out of
there.

His friend was still trying to talk. "Ain't worth it, boy. Waitin' 'round
f' those ol' bags. Not a good soprano in the lot. Most of 'em off key,
too."

Then he seemed to relax as if he had said all he had to. Then, as Steiner
watched, he closed one eye and stared up at him with a roguish wink,
child-like but all-knowing.

Steiner stood up and lifted his friend into the back seat of the vehicle.
Then he slipped into the front seat and waved the little column on toward
the west. Ivan breathed slowly and steadily. He had his hand pressed tight
against the place where the bullets had entered his mid-section. He
couldn't see the wounds, but he could feel his hand was in the right place.
The weight of his body on the hand might stop the bleeding. It might not,
too. That didn't matter. He didn't have any business being alive anyway,
after all those battles. But he was. And maybe he'd get through this one
too.

He felt suddenly faint and dizzy. It was all right. Just try to stay
conscious to let the little bearers know he was still alive when they came
by.

He heard a strange buzzing. It seemed like something flying right over him.
He brushed his left hand in front of his face, like a man brushing off
mosquitoes. They shouldn't be bothering him like this. Not in winter. He
lay there quietly and concentrated on staying conscious till the litter
bears arrived.

Above him in the fast-clearing sky, the Russian fighter-bombers droned
steadily past, heading for their targets in the west.
