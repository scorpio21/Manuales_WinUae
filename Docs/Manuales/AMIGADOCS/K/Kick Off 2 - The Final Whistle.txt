     ball. There are nine settings of shot control.

    C)Before the player reaches the ball,the ball can be given a left or right
      bias by moving the J/S left or right.The duration for which the J/S is
      kept left or right determines the amount of bias.If the J/S is not moved
      the ball will be kicked straight.

 12.0 TACTICS
 ------------
 12.1 The tactics implementation has now been completely changed giving
      a totally newgameplay.The old tactics positioned the players
      dependingon the position of the ball on the pitch irrespective as to
      which side had the possesion of the ball.This created weakness in the
      game stratagy occasionally.Now players movements depend on the ball
      position and whether the team is attacking or defending.
 12.2 Four  standard tactics are provided on the disc,other tactics will
      be available on the WINNING TACTICS data disc.
 12.3 P.Manager Designed Tactics - The tactics designed using the P.Manager
      tactics designer can still be loaded using Select Tactics Option which
      can be accessed via the OPTIONS MENU.

 13.0 IMPORTING PLAYER MANAGER
 -----------------------------
 The name structure for the players in the Final Whistle has been altered
 to allow greater flexibility in the player names on future data discs.
 The new name structure is,however,incompatible with the name structure in
 KO2 and P.Manager . A P.Manager team loaded in Final Whistle will therefor
 lose the player names. All their skills and attributes are imported.
 To keep track of the players,make a note of each players name in the team 
 and his squad number.
 For example T.J Smith listed as number 15 will appear in the no.15 position
 but under a different name.
