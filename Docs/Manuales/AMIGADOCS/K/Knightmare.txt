An Adventure Begins
-------------------

  "There is another place, a different world, a certain time," said
Tregaurd, peering down at us from the great chair, as we huddled beside
the board hearth at Dunshelm.
  Our bones were still chill from the journey, and all four of us
suffered the occasional dying shiver.
  The great fortresses of England are not built for comfort; stray far
from their banked fires, and winter howls through the dank stone
corridors, as through any mountain pass.
  "Best to think of The Quest as a living thing," said the Dungeon
Master,"though it does not live as you live - rather it does not die.."
  He looked again at each of us in turn with those strange, compelling
eyes. We were not, it is true, an impressive band.
  I was the oldest, and largest, yet still short of my full growth.
Dickon, the youngest, looked too far from home; watery blue eyes
peering with childish innocence from a pallid freckly complexion,
whilst James glared back at Treguard, trading inner fire with the
Dungeon Master, and trying at the same time to inch nearer the warm
glow from the pine logs.
Only Sean seemed composed, but i guess that like me, he was nervous
in the Dungeon Master's presence, and striving to seem relaxed.
  Four days earlier, we had assembled on the solitary strip of granite
and tarmac which serves as railway station to Lower Alcombe, our
rucksacks buldged with hastily packed sleeping bags, and our pockets
with assorted items which refused to cram into the misshapen rucksacks.
The grubby diesal railcar which grated to a halt before us did
nothing to enhance our image ass prospective Knight-errants and
adventurers par excellence, but it was transport, and we had far to
ride.
  'You'd just better be right', growled Dickon. 'I've gone and missed
Scout camp and everything. What's more we'd payed and they won't give
us a refund.' He hunched down into the grit-infested draylon.
  'An` it was the Isle of Wight,an 'I've never been there.'
  James had the big ordinance survey map open across his lap.
  Now he stabbed downwards, angrilypointing at a spot just above his
right knee.
  It's there i tell you. What's more, it's got to be the place. It's
the only the only thing that could be! Ralph, tell them not to be so
stupid!'
  I leaned across and inspected the grubby old map for what seemed
like the thousandth time. It showed a portion of Cumbria, where the
high passes rose far above the cpative lakes of Windermere and Conisten.
Printed just above the 2,000 foot contour line, was the one word
'Dungate', and beside it the indistinct icon of a solitary crumbling
tower.
  'I spect it's just an old crumbly watch tower,' said Sean. 'In any
case, it's in the wrong place. We've all read the Knightmare legend,
and if what we've read is right then Treguard's castle was part of the
northern Watchguard. You know: Hotspur and his clan-bashers. Keep out
the hairy scots. That means Dunshelm has got to be near Carlisle.'
James folded the map and stuffed it viciously into a side-pocket of
his rucksack..
  It's the way in. It's got to be. Can't be anything else, and in any
case, it's the only clue we've got.
  He hunkered down into his seat and spoke little for the rest of
the journey.
  The next day we broke camp early in the tented arena behind one
of Ambledside's many tea shoppes, and struck out to the North,
following James' map.
  As we left the lake district tourist traps behind us, and climbed
higher into the sky with the July sun, the Quest seemed little more
than a midnight dream, quite alien to this summertime hike down stone
walled lanes, where he only hazard to wayfarers was a clumsily-driven
Sierra.
We broke for wayside pasties and pies just after six, and then climbed
onward into the pink dusk of a high summer evening, its life extended
by the altitude we had reached.
  The stony lanes were now well behind and below us, as we walked the
barely discerable dotted line on the old survey map.
  'We must have passed it hours ago,' said Sean, weariness promoting
irritability. `Even if we're only doing two miles an hour, we'd have
found it - if there was anything to find!'
  There followed a fierce debate in which our estimated speed over
the ground was the subject of wide-ranging conjecture.
Then, as if exhausted by such trivia, we plodded in silence through
a narrow gap between two crumbling stone columns, and discovered on
the path ahead of us, a single,erect rectangle of nothingness.
Between it's hard, straight edges, was a blackness that made black
look colourful.
  `Elf-portal!' gasped James, triumphatly. `I told you: we've found
the way in!' He lurched forward, hawling his trailing rucksack onto
his shoulder once more. Too exhausted, and too excited to argue, the
rest of us staggered after him.
  At the threshold, James did not hesitate. The same will-power and
conviction that had driven all four of us to abandon other plans
and devote our summer to finding Dunshelm, now drove him into and
through that extreme blackness, and into...
  We followed.
On the new path beyond the gate, we jostled each other for space,
as the newly-arrived collided impatiently with the recently-
departed.
`Burr! What happened to summer?' asked Dickon.
  Beyond the portal, it was earlier in the day, but much later in
the year. The landscape also had changed for the high, narrow passes
of the peaks has give way to a plateau, hedged with broader, older
mountains. Dominating the view and the wide valley which led to it,
there squatted the grey menace of a fortress, which we knew
instinctively as Dunshelm.
Treguards banner flew from above it's crenellated towers, and light
glowed from an open entry-port.
  It was not however, the orange-yellow glow of welcoming fires, but
the electro-blue threat of another energy portal which awaited us.
Before its shimmer, we paused and re-grouped, the slight figure of
Dickon, moving to cover behind the larger bulk of myself and Sean.
James inched forward again, and only my restraining hand prevented
him from another wild lurch into the unknown.
  `Oh come on!' gasped James impatiently. `We didn't come all this
way just to...'
  An impatient `Ah-hem!' interrupted him, the deep voice seeming
to roll down the granite walls.
  It was a voice to delve dungeons with: a voice that we all knew,
as we knew that of our own schoolteachers.
  It spoke again.
  `Enter Strangers!'
  When the force-field had finished re-arranging my molecules, I
found myself standing with Sean and James in the familiar great
Anti-Chamber of Dunshelm. There was a sound like vegetables being
pulled about behind us, and Dickon staggered through the portal.
Now we all stared excitedly and fearfully at the figure that
confronted us.
  `You'd better sit, I think,' said Treguard, and the Dungeon
Master indicated some rough wooden stools which stood by a low,
carved table. Then he took his seat, and began to speak in deep,
measured tones that compelled attention.
  `First you should know, that there are many paths, but only four
goals.' Treguard shifted in his chair and motioned to the tall
figure of the Elf who lurked near the bookcase.
  Pickle removed a tan leather tome from the shelf and drifted into
the firelight, gliding with that odd catlike motion which is
perculiarly Elvish. Tregaurd took the book and opened it.
  "The first item of redemption is THE SHIELD. You may of course,
choose to redeem another object first, but i cannot advise it."
His tone left us in no doubt. It was a command, and not a
suggestion he offered.
  "Each of the Quest Objects remains symbolic, yet even a symbol
has power, and power is what you will need to redeem he more
difficult items, such as THE CUP, and of course, finally - THE
CROWN."
  "How do we find this Shield?" asked James.
  Treguard nodded to the Elf, who moved towards an arcane wall-map.
  "Dungeons twist and turn, phase and change, yet the land holds
true," said Pickle. "These are the Mines of Malapith. Old goblin
breeding ground actually. The stone-crunchers still lurk there, and
the principle tool of The Oppersition is a resident Hobgoblin.
Its name is Haag."
  The Elf gave a shudder, move distaste than fear. "It is a hybrid
- a war machine. Not bred naturally, if you can call anything
goblineese natural, but cloned and cultured from the vats.
It will not be easy to overcome."
  He shuddered again.
  Singularly, or in small groups, goblins are no great threat to
men or elves, but... That's an entirely different matter."
  The elf also moved closer to the fire, for there seemed a greater
chill in the smoky air.
  "It's not just a matter of size." said the elf. "The grand hybrids
have additional defences and overcoming them can prove quite
gruelling."
  "Yes, but not impossible," said Treguard gruffly.
  "For the second retrieval, I would suggest THE SWORD. As a Quest
it is well named, for the recovery will demand the honing and use
of advanced combat skills. The arts to be employed here are those
of the gladiator if you follow the Western legend, or the Eastern
disciplines of those called Samurai. Both must be practised if
the sword is to be won."
Pickle turned the pages, but glanced periodically to his master.
Now he interjected.
  "The guardian Master....They should know of the guardian."
Treguard nodded.
  `As the elf says there is a guardian. The lower ranks of
goblinesse have a great fear of serpents. In both fear and
ignorance they worship the largest as gods. Such a worm is Khah-Roth,
who dwells in the deep levels and guards the path to the sword. He
has lived long and will be hard to kill.'
  `Sounds like mindless hacking, so far' said James sharply.
`What of magic? What of Alchemy? What of medicine?'
  He rose to his feet and moved to examine the wall-map. Of all of
us, James appears the most likely warrior with his dark celtic
temper and quick moving limbs. But his mind is always on sorcecy,
and he has the soul of a savant.
  `Should you attempt to retrieve the cup, then mastery of lore and
spellcasting must be obtained,' said Treguard.
  `It will take more than an apprentice to recover The Cup That
Heals. The priestly healing skills must also be cultivated and
refined, for without witch-doctorhood, the mightiest band of
warriors will soon perish from the accumulation of wounds and
weariness.'
  Pickle dipped sharp chin to beast and seemed to nod a tacit
agreement.
  `And Badwife, Master? Shall i tell of her?'
  It was Treguard's turn to nod. The elf turned to a fresh page in
the tome.
  "The Opposition has ceded a portion of the dungeon to a sorceress.
Her real name is not known, but she masquerades as one of the grey
sisters, and although she is not a witch, styles herself in
witchly fashion. Badwife, she calls herself, and she is fey.'
Curiousity finally overcame Dickon's nerves, and in quavering voice
he asked the Dungeon Master which of tthe Opposition held THE CROWN.
`None hold it, my young friend,' said Treguard kindly. `None hold it
and none may wear it, yet Lord Fear himself will strive his utmost
to prevent you recovering it.'
  `Which of us must go blindfold,' asked Sean, glancing
apprehensively at the horned helmet which lay discarded on the low
table. Treguard shook his head.
  The Quest takes many forms, as well as many different paths.
None of you must go without sight, for in this case, all four of you
will be handicapped. Your path is the most dangerous of all for it
exists only in the mind-machine.'
  The elf joined at his elbow and tutted impatiently.
`They call them computers, Master. The land within the computer is
called - The Cyberspace - i think, though my own people scorn it as
necromancy.'
Treguard nodded. `The Cyberspace is as dangerous as any land beyond
the portals. It is apparently endless and limited only by the memory
capacity of machinedom. The greater dungeons now lie within it, and
you must seek them. This is the challenge you journeyed so far to
meet. If you accept it, then seize it!'
  The Dungeon Master waved his hand, and we turned to the direction
indicated. Another portal had appeared in the corner of the room.
It was an ebony obelisk like the rectangle on the path above
Ambleside.
Once again, James stepped forward without hesitation.
  `Wait,' I said. `This time we go together.'
  And we did.


The Quest Ahead
---------------

There are four quests in the world of Knightmare - each must be
completed for you to amass the knowledge to defeat Lord Fear and
banish him from this earth forever. Your trail will be a hard and
arduous one, fear will be with you constantly and death is always
around the next corner. Plan your quest well, your success depends
on the initiative and skills that you might not even know you posses.
Many will enter the domain of Knightmare and battle Lord Fear and his
deadly henchmen...few will return with their lives. Fewer with their
sanity.

Throughout the quest you will be called upon to use weapons and spells
wisely and skillfully and solve the most intricate puzzles that Lord
Fear has created in the world of Knightmare.

Arm your team with the best you can find and protect them from harm
the best way you can. Remember that the more skilled your team
members are, the stronger they become....and the more chance they
have against Lord Fear and his evil marauding creatures.


System Requirements
-------------------

Knightmare requires an Amiga or Atari ST computer with at least 512k
RAM and a mouse. If you have more than 512k of RAM then certain
aspects of the game will be enhanced - especially the music and sound
effects and the amount of disk access.

Knightmare supports more than one disk drive if connected to your
system.

In order to experience the atmosphere of the game to the full, we
recommend that you play with headphones or with your machine connected
to your Hi Fi.

Loading The Game
----------------

Turn off you computer for 30 seconds.
Insert Knightmare Disk 1 into the internal disk drive.
If availible, insert Knightmare Disk 2 into your external (or second)
disk drive.
Turn on your computer.
Knightmare will load automatically.

If you don't have a second drive attached to your computer, then you
will very occasionally have to swap Disk 1 and Disk 2 when prompted.
Once the game has loaded, you will see the introduction sequence.

Controlling The Game
--------------------

Knightmare is operated by a mouse. Refer to the instructions that
came with your computer is you are unsure which port it should be
connected to.

Moving the mouse will move the pointer on screen.

There are a number of ICONS or buttons on screen that operate the
functions of the game.

The ICONS are activated by pressing the mouse button while the pointer
is over it. This is known as "clicking" on the ICON.

The mouse has two buttons, a left and a right hand button. Most icons
have a different effect depending on which button is clicked.

For example, to MOVE forward, you must click with the left mouse button
on the forward arrow on the movement cluster. However to PUSH forward,
you must click with the right mouse of the movement cluster. If there
is nothing to push on, it will walk you forward.

The rest of this manual will refer to "clicking with the left mouse
button" or "clicking with the right mouse button" to describe the
function of the icon.

Starting The Quest
------------------

On the title screen you will see three options.

1) START GAME will take you into the quest. If you do not go to DEFINE
TEAM first then you will play with the default team.

2) DEFINE TEAM lets you set up your party of adventures for the quest
ahead.

The first task is to name each of the characters in the party. Type in
the name and press return. Next give he/she or it a title - for
example "The Moog"

Next use the slider bars to determine the characteristics of the player.

The first bar is the Breed of Character.
Choose from MAN,WOMAN,GOBLIN,OGRE,GHOUL,ELF,TROLL or INSECTOLE.

The second bar is the Profession of the Character.
Choose from ADVENTURER,GLADIATOR,SAMURAI,WIZARD,PRIEST or GENIE.

The third bar defines whether the character is LEFT or RIGHT handed.

To define a whole team, repeat the above process for all four players.

 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Note For Advanced Players:                                         |
 | -------------------------                                          |
 | For a more challenging quest. Try playing the game with less than  |
 | four members in the team. To do this simply define the number of   |
 | characters that you wish to participate (from one upward) and then |
 | ABORT to continue.                                                 |
 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+

3) LOAD GAME lets you restore a previously saved position in the quest
and play from that point onwards. Select this option and insert your
save game disk in a drive.

The filenames on the save game disk will be listed. There is provision
for only eight saved games on one disk. If the disk is not full, the
empty files are listed as NO NAME. Click on the name of the file you
want to load.

If the GET DIRECTORY prompt appears, the save game disk is not present.
Insert the disk and click on GET DIRECTORY to continue.

To EXIT or if you make a mistake, click with the right mouse button or
click on the `close box' icon (the top left hand corner of the LOAD game
window.)

To move around the world of Knight mare, you will have to direct your
party with commands via the movement cluster. This allows them to go
forward, barkwards, turn left or rightand to side step left or right.

To PUSH forward (against a wall or other object) use the right mouse
buttonon the forward arrow icon.

The UP and DOWN arrows on the movement cluster only become operational
when there is an opening above or below the party.

You can also use the numeric keypad on the keyboard to move the Team
around.

These four displays show the name and face of each of the four members
of the team. The box also displays a quick read-out of Heath, Stamina
and Magic.

The leader is the character with the Helmet on. This is the character
through who's eyes you view the action in the VIEW WINDOW.

Any character can be made leader by clicking twice with the left mouse
button on the character box or by moving the helmet to another member
of the team.

 +--------------------------------+
 | "Don't lose the helmet!" (Elf) |
 +--------------------------------+

The layout of the characters in the party has strategic significance.
You may wish to put your strongest members at the front to protect the
weaker ones behind.

You can move the players around in the formation by clicking once with
the left mouse button on each of the tow characters who you wish to
exchange places. They will then swap within the formation. Using this
method, you can postion the characters in exactly the right formation
you require and change it depending on the situation.

Saving Games
------------

During your quest you might feel that rest will do you good - especially
if the action is getting a little too hot to handle. You can SAVE your
progress on a disk and continue the adventure from where you left off
another time.

To SAVE a game, click with the left mouse button on the DISK ICON. You
will need to have a blank disk handy to put your saved games on.

If there is no save game disk already in the drive, you will be asked
to GET DIRECTORY or FORMAT. If you click on FORMAT, you will be asked
which drive the disk is in. Click on the drive that has in it the disk
you wish to format.

N.B. FORMAT WILL DESTROY ANY DATA ON THAT DISK AND USES A SPECIAL FORMAT
THAT CAN NOT BE USED FOR OTHER PROGRAMS.

If you wish to cancel at this point, click with the right mouse button
or click with the left mouse button on the Close Box icon.

You will then be prompted with the message "OK FORMAT" - click on the
button to format the disk.

GET DIRECTORY will list all of the saved game files on the disk.

To save a game, click on the position in the list of files that you
wish to fill. This will bring up a requester prompting you to name
the file. If nothing is entered the file will be stored as a blank file
name with the number of the saved game before it. You can store a save
game over the top of an existingone if you wish. The current game will
appear in the file name requestor. Delete this name if you want to
change it.

Once you have named the file, click on OK SAVE to store on the disk.

To EXIT or if you make a mistake, click with the right mouse button or
click on the `Close Box' icon (the top left hand corner of the SAVE game
window).

Objects
-------

As you move around the world of Knightmare you will come across objects
and items that may be useful to your quest. To pick up an object, move
the pointer into the VIEW WINDOW and put it in the top of the object to
be collected. Click with the left mouse button to pick it up.

While holding the object you can drop or throw it back down by clicking
with the left mouse button. Whether you drop or throw it depends on how
high off the ground the object is when you release it. Low down will 
drop it back on the ground, higher up will throw it away from you.
 
 +----------------------------------------------------------------+
 |"Often throwing an object back from whence it came will have the|
 | desired effect especially if it hits someone on the way!" (Elf)|
 +----------------------------------------------------------------+

Pickle will help by telling you about the object you are carrying if you
hold it in the pointer and click on the oval above the main View Window.
 
Objects can be out in the backpack of any of the characters within the
team or straight into their hands by placing it over the relevent cushion
on the hand icon area of the screen. To place an object in the backpack
you can press the right mouse button when in the view window to bring up
the backpack of the last chartacter viewed. To bring up the backpack of
any other character, press the right mouse button over the required
characters icon on the Team icons.

Each character in the party has a backpack which can hold a number of
items. The amount that any character can carry is limited by weight
which is indicated on the backpack screen.

With the HEAD, CHEST, LEGS and FEET boxes, you can only place objects
that shoudl belong there. For example, a jacket goes on a chest box
and boots go on a feet box.

The rest of the boxes are backpack areas in which anything can be
placed (excluding 2 hand boxes the total here is 18).

A chest may be found in which you can place an extra eight small items.

To bring up the backpack screen of any character, clikc with the right
mouse button on it's Team icon. To close the screen, click with the
left mouse button in the top left hand corner of the background screen.

Click on the name of the character at the top of the backpack screen to
view the stats screen. See below.

Comparisons between all four player's backpacks can be done by clicking
with the left mouse button on the four-player icon.

If a red box appears around the characters body part in the backpack
screen it is seriously injured. Magic will be required to cure it.

The backpack screen also shows the energy of the character...

Energy
------

This is repressented by the coloured bar in the figure in the centre.
As the character loses energy the bar will drop. If it gets to the feet
the character is starving.

If your stamina is reduced while you have no energy then it cannot be
replenished unless you use magic.

When the stamina level falls below zero then the chartacter will begin
to lose Hit Points. In this condition, the more workdone, the more
injury is accumulated.

Use the Rest Party Icon to replenish, Stamina and Magic.

 |"Sleep is such a good way to regain some of that lost stamina but      |
 | make sure you have enough food otherwise you may never wake up!" (Elf)|
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Stats Screen
------------

This screen showes the statistics of the character chosen. This will
show where it's skills and abilities lie and how they are increasing.
This is the key to developing the strengths of your characters within
the team.

STRENGTH will determine maximum encumbrance, throw range and punch power.

DEXTERITY indicates the characters skill at ranged combat - for example
archery.

AGILITY indicates the skill held at hand to hand combat - for example
swordfighting.

VILALITY is the level of healing power - i.e. how fast and how well the
character recovers from a blow or attack.

ARMOUR shows the total accumulated armour value for the whole body of
the character.

If the character is suffering any ailments, a white box will appear around
his face icon. The illness will be listed on the right side of the stats
screen. Different coloured type indicates the seriousness of the illness
that is being suffered.

Grey means it will cure itself in time. White type means it will never
cure itself without magical aid and a red type indicates a very serious
condition that will require powerful magic to cure it.

To compare the stats of all four players at once, click with the right
mouse button on the four-player icon.

Click on the name of any character to bring up the Backpack screen. Use
the right mouse button to return to the main view, or close the window
by clicking on the top left hand corner.

The Hands
---------

Across the bottem are the eight hand icons for the four players.
This shows what is held in Character's hands at any time.
As the players move within the formation, the hand positions move in
relation.

You can place an object in each hand of a character. Either by picking
up an object from the VIEW WINDOW and placing on the relevant cushion
for the player, or by going into the BACKPACK screen and placing it in
the hand position of the character.

Using Weapons And Spells In Hand
--------------------------------

When a weapon or spell casting wand is held in the hand pf a character,
it can be activated by clicking with the right mouse button.

This will drop a scroll down from which the desired weapon move or spell
type is selected. Click with the right mouse button again to activate
the desired effect.

The weapons and spells in the hand can be `progammed' to do the same
move repeatedly by clicking with the left mouse button on the desired
option from the list availible.

This will show a small triangle in the centre of the cushion to indicate
that it is programmed. Further clicks with the right mouse button on
that icon will cause the programmed effect.

 |"Choose your weapons wisely and spread them out strategically amongst  |
 | the team for the most devestating attacks!" (Elf)                     |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Encumbrance
-----------

A characterc current carried weight is shown as CURRENT WEIGHT/MAXIMUM
WEIGHT ie 21.1/43 kg. This is indicated in the Backpack screen.

The current weight is usually displayed as a brown colour. If it turns
to yellow your are overweight and the character will walk slower than
usual. If it turns to red the character has exceeded his maximum
encumbrance and will walk very slowly as well as begin to lose stamina.

 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |"Having trouble running fast enough to get somewhere important?        |
 | Try losing some weight, fatty!" (Elf)                                 |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Skills
------

A character's skill increase in levels as he uses them through experience
The lowest level is novice and the highest is master.

For example, the more a gladiator uses a samurai sword, the more his
samurai level will increase.

The weapons are assigned to a particular profession so as someone uses
them, their skill in that category will increase.

If a character is using a weapon assigned to his profession he will be
more proficient with ir than someone using it as an `unfamiliar' weapon.

Magic
-----

The use of magic is for the very skilled only - don't mess with magic -
you don't want to end up with smoke in your face if it goes wrong! If
magic is attempted by an incompetent, the resulting effect will be a
feeble FIZZ.

You need a wand to perform magic - placed in the wrong hands the
effect will be less that impressive. In the rights hands however, the
results can be devestating.

To use a spell, click on the wand when it is positioned in the hand to
bring up the types availible with that wand.

Choose the level of spell required by clicking on the number that
appears on the scroll. Use the left and right mouse buttons to go
up and down the spell casting levels.

If you don't have enough experience, then the higher levels will not
be accessible.

 |"You will need to gain experience with lower levels spells before      |
 | attempting any serious wizardry!" (Elf)                               |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
