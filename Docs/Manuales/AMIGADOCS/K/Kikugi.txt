                             Kikugi

INTRODUCTION

In ancient Japan, generations of rulers and emperors honed their skills of
concentration and strategy with Kikugi.

Now Image Tech brings this ancient game to you.  The premise of the game
begins simply: jump pieces and remove as you go.  But quickly the strategy
becomes more and more intricate as you progress.  Each move you make limits
the number of remaining moves, making additional moves more and more
critical.  The playing increases in intensity until finally culminating in
a last few critical moves.

The game play is ADDICTIVE.  Each new game pattern demands to be solved. 
The more you play, the better your skills of concentration and strategy
become.  If you desire a game that challenges your mind as well as being
fun to play, then Kikugi is the game for you.

There are 15 different boards in the enclosed software, which is like 15
different games in one!

GETTING STARTED

System requirements:	Amiga 500, 1000, 2000
			512K memory minimum

To load Kikugi, turn on your Amiga (Amiga 1000 owners must load Kickstart
1.2 or 1.3).

When the "Insert Workbench" prompt appears, insert the Kikugi disk into the
internal disk drive.

Enter color code (follow instructions on enclosed color chart).

Kikugi contains stereo digitized sounds.  For the best results, hook your
Amiga up to a stereo sound system.

   !-------------------------------------------------------------------!
   !  WARNING:  The sounds in Image Tech software products contain a   !
   !  substantially wide dynamic range.  Damage could result to        !
   !  speakers or other stereo components if the sound is played back  !
   !  at excessively high levels.                                      !
   !-------------------------------------------------------------------!

USING THE MOUSE

Whenever the term "double-click" is used in this instruction manual, click
twice with the mouse pointer over the desired icon with the LEFT mouse
button.

When the term "single-click" is used, repeat the above instructions,
however, only click once on the desired icon.

PLAYING THE GAME

The rules for Kikugi are simple- it is played by jumping one piece over
another piece into an empty space, removing the piece that was jumped. The
goal is to remove as many pieces as possible. Ideally, only one piece
should be left on the board at the end of the game. On some boards, the
last piece must also be left in the "center" position on the board (the
position that was blank at the beginning of the game). Specific details
about where the last piece should be left can be found in the "Help!" menu
by selecting "strategy". If at the end of the game only one piece is left
and in the correct position, then you have won the game and are rewarded
amply.

Example move:

	X X X X                                  X X X X
        X X X X                                  X X X X 
        X   O X <--Piece to move                 X X
        X X X X  O--Piece to be removed          X X X X 
        X X X X                                  X X X X

The Playing board

This is where all the pieces are moved from.

Timer clock

The time can be turned on from the "Options" menu. Each move may be timed
5, 10, or 15 seconds. Also, the entire game may be timed (amount of time is
based on the difficulty of the current board).

on a combination of time and position. The score is active only when the
timer is turned on.

The control panel allows the user to turn the sound on/off, backup moves,
and show possible moves by clicking on the appropriate icon. The panel also
acts as a status indicator by displaying the number of players.

turned off, a red "X" will be drawn over the speakers.

Click on the back arrow to backup moves.

Click on the eye to show all possible moves. A message will be displayed in
the message area asking "Next" or "Quit" to see another move or to return
to the game.

Note: Look under "Help! menu" in this manual to learn more about the show
all moves function.

All functions in the control panel are also available from the different
menus.

MOVING

When Kikugi first loads, the "Original" board will appear. (If you wish to
play another board, select the desired board from the "Boards" menu from
the title bar.)

Note: The "Beginner's" board is recommended to new users in order to teach
      basic game play and adapt to the user interface.

Now you are ready to begin...

Move the mouse pointer over the piece you wish to move, single-click on
that piece while continuing to hold down the mouse button. You should hear
a sound confirming that you have picked up the piece.

You are now "holding" a playing piece. Next, you may "drag" the piece to
any legal empty position on the board. Legal moves are jumps left, right,
up, or down (and in some cases, diagonal) over one bordering piece and into
an empty space. If you try to make an illegal move, the computer will warn
you with an appropriate sound.

Note: You may only "pick-up" pieces that are legal to move. If you try to
      move a piece that can not be moved by clicking on that piece, nothing
      will happen.

When you have moved the piece to the correct position, release the mouse
button. You will hear a second sound confirming that you have dropped the
piece. The playing piece that has been "jumped over" will disappear.
