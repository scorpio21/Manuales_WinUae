in his pack are green.

holding it in his hand. If you want the scout to take the shield in his hand,
then right click on it.

2/ You cant see the shield .
This means the Scout is carring a maximum of 8 items and can't carry the 
shield. The fighter keeps it.

NOTE: Certain character Classes cannot carry certain objects.

THROW AWAY AN OBJECT .
To get rid of an unwanted object that one of your characters is carrying, open
his character sheet and left click on the object, keeping the button pressed

character sheet. Release the mouse button ; the object has disappeared down the
bottomless pit.

red, which means he's holding it. The text will then be displayed on the 
screen.

red). If there's a source of liquid nearby(fountain, lake....), the object will
