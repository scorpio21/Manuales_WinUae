 Grand Dizzy was feeling very down one day, so Dizzy and Daisy decided to
 cheer him up by baking him his favourite food, cherry pie! So of went Daisy
 to get some cheeries from the cupboard and there were none to be seen!

 "Pogie pinched the cheeries!" she cries, as she saw Pogies pawprint in the
  cupboard, "That darned fluffle. Come here you!" and Pogie promptly darted
  of into the enchanted forest to escape Daises rage.

 Dizzy and Daisy decided to go into the forest to catch Pogie and gather
 some more cheeries at the same time. Whilst seaching for Pogie they got 
 lost and found a castle, where they thought they would find help, but it
 seemed deserted. They looked in the castle for pogie, but Daisy caught
 herself on a mystic spinning wheel. She started feeling really sleepy, so
 she found a bed and went to sleep.
 
 "Wake up Daisy, wake up!" shoued Dizzy. But before he could wake her up,
 Rockwart the troll caught him and locked him up under groud.
