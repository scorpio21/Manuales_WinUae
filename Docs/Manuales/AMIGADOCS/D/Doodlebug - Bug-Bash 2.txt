THE STORY SO FAR:
-----------------
ANOTHER QUIET SUNNY DAY DAWNS OVER THE MAGICAL LAND OF CARTOONIA.
SUDDENLY....THE SILENCE IS BROKEN!?..`HELP....SAVE ME` CRIES PRINCESS LADY
BUG; ITS THE EVIL....HE CRY BECOMES TOO FAINT TO HEAR AS A LARGE DARK
FIGURE CARRIES HER OFF INTO THE DISTANCE.

THE KING IS VERY UPSET ABOUT THE DISAPPERANCE OF HIS DAUGHTER AND CALLS
UPON THE CREATURES OF CARTOONIA TO SAVE THE PRINCESS FROM HER TERRIBLE
FATE. THE JOURNEY THAT LAY AHEAD WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS, AND NOT ALL THE
LANDS IN THE KINGDOM HAD BEEN EXPLORED. THERE WERE STORIES THAT STRANGE
CREATURES LURKED IN THESE LANDS AND THAT MANY OF THEM DID NOT RESPECT THE
KING AND WERE,THEREFORE,BANISHED TO THE OUTER REGIONS.

HE PRESENTS THE SACRED MAGIC PENS AND ERASER THAT WERE ONCE USED BY THE
HUMANS WHO CREATED CARTOONIA, TO A BRAVE BUG LIKE CREATURE WHO STEPS
FORWARD. `THIS IS THE ONLY HELP I CAN GIVE YOU BUT REMEMBER DUDE;DONT
DAWDLE...DOODLE`.

THE MAGIC PENCILS AND ERASER
----------------------------
BLUE PENCIL; THROW THIS PENCIL TO DRAW AN UMBRELLA, WHICH WILL SLOW ANY
FALLS YOU HAVE. AN UMBRELLA IS STORED FOR USE AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU PICK
IT UP AND WILL ONLY BE USED IF YOU HAVE FALLEN FROM HIGH PLATFORMS, ECT.

RED PENCIL; THROW THIS PENCIL TO DRAW A RED BALLOON WHICH ALLOW YOU TO FLOAT
GENTLY UPWARDS WHEN PICKED UP.BEWARE IF YOU GOTO HIGH AS THE BALLOON WILL
BURST ON ITS OWN. YOU MAY ALSO BURST IT AT ANY TIME BY PRESSING THE FIRE
BUTTON WHILST THE BALLOON IS IN USE.

GREEN PENCIL; THROW THIS PENCIL TO DRAW A POTION BOTTLE CONTAINING  GREEN
LIQUID WHICH WILL GIVE DOODLEBUG A PROTECTIVE FORCE SCREEN AROUND HIS BODY

HIT.

YELLOW PENCIL: THROW THIS PENCILTO DRAW A STOP WATCH, WHICH WHEN PICKED UP
FREEZES ALL CREATURES,ECT FOR 10 SECONDS. YOU CAN STILL BE HIT AND LOSE
ENERGY IF YOU HIT A FROZEN CREATURE.

REMEMBER TO PICK UP AN OBJECT DRAWN WITH A MAGIC PENCIL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AS THEIR ENERGY FADES AND THEY WILL DISAPPEAR QUICKLY. YOU MAY ALSO USE
MAGIC PENCILS TO KILL CREATURES BY THROWING THEM DIRECTLY AT THEM. THIS IS
ALSO A USEFUL WAY OUT OF SOME TIGHT SPOTS ON VRIOUS LEVELS, BUT DO NOT
WASTE THEM. TO AVOID WASTING MAGIC PENCILS, YOU ARE ABLE TO THROW ANOTHER
PENCIL OF THE SAME TYPE IF ONE IS CURRENTLY IN USE,OR IN THE CASE OF THE
UMBRELLA PENCIL-IF YOU HAVE ONE STORED FOR USE ALREADY.

ERASER BOMB; THROW THE ERASER WHICH WILL THEN EXPLODE UP TO THREE TIMES IN
