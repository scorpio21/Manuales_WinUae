                      DeJa Vu: A Nightmare Comes True

Reference Card:

Amiga DeJa Vu brings a whole new world to your computer. Because the AMIGA
is such a special environment, the AMIGA version of the game differs in
some ways from what is described in the manual.  This card documents those
differences.

What You Need

Amiga computer with 512K
Single Drive
Monitor (Color recommended)

Loading the Program

1. Kickstart your computer with version 1.1

2. When you are asked for a Workbench disk, eject the Kickstart disk and
replace it with your Deja Vu game disk.

3. Double-click on the Deja Vu disk icon.

4. Use Preferences to make sure the time and date are set correctly and
configure your printer.

5. Double-click on the Deja Vu game icon to start the game.

Saving Games

You can save your game in progress at any point. To do so, you will need a
formatted storage disk. Follow the standard procedure as outlined in the
AMIGA documentation before you start the game. You will not be able to
format a disk once the game has started.  Make sure your storage disk is
not write protected.

When you want to save your game in progress, select SAVE or SAVE AS from
the PROJECT menu.  The first time you save a game, the two commands act
identically. You will see this requester appear.

Click on the name under which you wish to save the game, or click in the
text area and type a file name.  The requester shows the files on the
internal drive (DF0:SAVE/) by default.  You can look at a list of all files
on the external drive (or any other connected device) type typing the drive
specification and clicking OK.  For example, type DF1: and click OK to see
all the saved games on the external drive.  When you have either selected
or typed a file name, click OK to do the same.  The two commands - SAVE and
SAVE AS - differ on subsequent uses.  Once you have saved a game the first
time, selecting SAVE will save the current game over the old game
automatically.  You will not have to bother with file names.  If you want
to save your game under a new name or to a different path, you need to
select SAVE AS, which requires you to supply a file name.

Loading Games

Use the same requester as the SAVE AS command, except that you won't have
to type unless you wish to switch paths.  Simply click on the name of the
file you wish to load and click OK.

Controlling the Game

All of the commands work exactly as described in the manual.  Whenever
reference is made to pressing "the button" you should use the left-hand
mouse button.

The Windows

While the windows in the AMIGA version differ in appearance from those in
the manual, they act in essentially the same manner.  The only difference
is that you cannot double-click in the title bar to expand a window to
full-screen size.

The Menus

The menus are considerably different on the AMIGA than what is shown in the
manual.  The AMIGA version uses two menus: ABOUT and PROJECT.

The ABOUT menu tells you a little about the AMIGA version of the game.  You
may wish to select an item from this menu, just for fun.

The PROJECT menu contains the following items:

	NEW: Start a new game from the beginning.  You will be prompted to
             save the game in progress if you haven't done so.
	LOAD: Load a saved game.
	SAVE: Save the game in progress.
	SAVE AS: Save the game in progress with a new name.
	QUIT: Quit the game - you are asked if you want to save the game if
	      you haven't already done so.

			** MANUAL **

Well, just ta get ya started

The first thing ya gotta do is stick that little plastic thing labeled Deja
Vu One in the little hole on the fronta your Mac.  Then turn the thing on.
Go ahead, I'll wait.

Okay now, when it's good and ready, the Mac'll spit out the first disk
thingy and tell ya to stick in the other one (labeled Deja Vu Two - hey!
I'm a poet!) in the hole. Ya gotta do this a coupla times right at the
start, but ya probably won't hafta worry about it again until ya quit the
game.  Just do what Mac here tells ya, and you'll be aces.

Of cours, if you're a wiseacre ya probably got TWO drives, and ya's can
just stick the first disk in the disk in the Mac, and the other in the
other one, and ya'll get along just fine.

Now, ya probably ain't never seen nothin' like this before, so listen
up...I'm only gonna go through this once.

Most adventure games want ya to talk to 'em real nice and then maybe
they'll tell ya what ya need to know.  Well, in this game, ya don't talk
nice -- ya just do what needs to be done.  This here's a sample screen from
the game.  Look it over, then we'll go through it real slow and careful so
ya don't miss nothin'.

The first thing ya need to know about is this thingy here:

                 CLICK to continue

It's called the command window. Right now, its tellin' ya that there is
more text in the text window than ya can see.  If ya click the mouse button
while pointing in the window, you'll get to see more of the description. 
The text window, in case ya haven't figured it out, looks like this:

Good morning. Welcome to a nightmare come true.

You are waking from a stupor that feels like a chronic hangover after a
week in Tiajuana. There is a throbbing bump on the back of your head, big

We'll talk about the text window later.  For now, just click the mouse
button until the command window looks like this:

	Examine  |  Open    |  Close    |  Speak
      -------------------------------------------
        Operate  |  Go   |   Hit   | Consume

They call it the command window for a good reason. You tell the game what
to do by pointin' at one of the commands and pressin' your little mousie's
button.  The commands ya give will usually involve somethin' in the room
you're in.  Ya see the picture in the middle?  That's where ya are.

If ya want a description of the room just click the button on the word
EXAMINE and then click in the picture of the room.

The description'll show up in the text window.

Like I said, any time there's more to say than there's room for, the
command window'll change so it says "Click to Continue".  Ya just click the
button and the rest of the words'll pop up.  Ya can scroll back through the
last few things whats been said by using the scroll bar -- just like
MacWrite.  You know, point to the little white box on the right side of the
window, hold down the mouse button, and move it up or down. Boy, you are a
rookie, ain't ya?

The other two windows on the screen are a little tricky, so pay attention.
The one marked SELF is you.

I didn't think you'd get that. What I mean is, if you wanna do somethin'
like EXAMINE yourself or OPEN yourself (some might call that taking
inventory) you use the little SELF button as the object of the command. Get
it?  Well, I'll show ya in a minute.

The other dohickus is the EXITS window.

That shows ya where you can go.  Somethin' I've wanted to tell ya for
years!  The little white box is an exit. In this case, it's the stall door
right in front of you. You could just use the door in the picture, but in
some places there may be a way out that's outta your line of fire -- uh, I
mean outta your line of sight.

Now, just ta get ya started, I'm gonna talk through gettin' ya outta this
stall. Once ya got that down, you'll be find. Just in case ya get inta
trouble, though, I'm gonna give ya a list of what all the different
commands do. If you're real nice, I may even let ya in on some shortcuts.

Gettin' Outta the Stall

Look at the picture carefully. Ya see anythin' that you want to take with
ya? I'll give ya a clue. If ya point to somethin' and press the button,
it'll go all funny lookin'. Try it out. Point the cursor at the overcoat
and press the button.

See that? That means that the coat is somethin' you can work with.

You probably wanna take the coat with ya. So ya need to put it in your
inventory.

The window called INVENTORY shows what you got on ya. You can move the
Inventory around the screen 'til it's outta your way. You can also stretch
it out so you can see more -- just like all those other Mac windows you've
used. If ya ain't sure how that works, see your Mac User's Guide or cheat
and look in the back of this book for help. In fact, I'll tell ya a secret:
if ya wanna make the window fill up the screen, just double-click (that
means click the mouse button twice in a row) on the title bar. When the
window is all puffed up, the little grow-box in the lower right corner will
be inverted (that means it'll be white on black).  Double-click on the
title-bar again and it'll shrink back down - pretty neat, huh?

       Examine   |  OPEN     |  Close   |   Speak
       -----------------------------------------
       Operate  |  Go    |  Hit  |  Consume

                      +

                     SELF    =     INVENTORY

The Inventory is where ya put stuff ya want to carry. To take the coat,
just point to it and press the button. Now hold the button down and drag
the coat over to the Inventory. When ya let go of the coat it will be in
your Inventory. Ya probably can't see all of it in the window, but if ya
think it ain't all there, try scrolling up and down with the little
elevator thing. You should probably take the shoulder holster while you're
at it -- never know who you'll run into.

You can close the Inventory window by clickin' in the little "close box".
Ya get it back by clickin' on OPEN and then on SELF.

OPEN is important for more than just yourself, you know.  Coats have
pockets, and guns have cylinders, and you'd probably be interested in
what's inside 'em.

Now, let's get ya outta the stall. First you should click on OPEN.


       Examine   |  OPEN     |  Close   |   Speak
       -----------------------------------------
       Operate  |  Go    |  Hit  |  Consume

Then click on the door in front of you. That should open the door.

Listen up! Don't fo gettin' antsy and try movin' the mouse when ya click on
the door. Ya can't move the door around, and ya don't wanna try.  The same
goes for anything ya wanna open, examine, talk to, etc. Get it? Good.

You could just use the EXITS window as well. If ya want, you can just click
on the little white box instead of on the actual door.

Now just click on GO


       Examine   |  Open     |  Close   |   Speak
       -----------------------------------------
       Operate  |  GO    |  Hit  |  Consume

and then click in the open doorway or on the white square in the Exit
window. TA-DA!  You're outta the stall an' inta the john.

So, what're ya goin' to do now?

Baby, you are in it but deep!  You're sittin' in some dive. There's a stiff
upstairs. Somebody's out ta get ya -- and I don't mean just the cops! I
don't know if ya iced the guy, or if ya did, why, but I do know one thing:
you ain't got long to get clear. I know you. You're tough, street-smart,
and quick-thinkin'. Well -- two outta three ...

Remember -- there's no love lost with the cops, or the mob either. Don't
take no chances. Ya hear a siren, ya better run unless ya know you're in
the clear. Good luck kid, you're gonna need it ta get offa this hook!

From here on out you're on your own. I'm gonna give ya a list of all the
commands, but that's it from me.

Commands


       EXAMINE   |  Open     |  Close   |   Speak
       -----------------------------------------
       Operate  |  Go    |  Hit  |  Consume

Look ya look real close at somethin'. Click on EXAMINE and then click on
the thing ya wanna look at.

SHORTCUT:  Everything except exits will be examined if ya double-click on
'em.  In case ya ain't been payin' attention, that means point to the thing
then click the mousie twice in a row.  Ya get it?  If ya double-click right
on the thing ya wanna examine, ya don't have to use this-here command
window at all to examine somethin'.


       Examine   |  OPEN     |  Close   |   Speak
       -----------------------------------------
       Operate  |  Go    |  Hit  |  Consume

Open doors, safes, boxes, etc., if they ain't locked. Click on OPEN then on
the door or whatever (either in the picture or in the Exits window). OPEN
SELF to see your inventory.

SHORTCUT:  Doors'll usually open if ya double-click 'em. Other things may
or may not.


       Examine   |  Open     |  CLOSE   |   Speak
       -----------------------------------------
       Operate  |  Go    |  Hit  |  Consume

Pretty obvious, huh?  It's the opposite of Open. Jeesh, do I gotta spell
out everything?

SHORTCUT:  Some things close by themselves. Other than that, all ya got is
the regular way. (Did I say there was a shortcut for everything?)


       Examine   |  Open     |  Close   |  SPEAK
       -----------------------------------------
       Operate  |  Go    |  Hit  |  Consume

You may haveta talk to somebody.  Click on SPEAK, then on the person ya
wanna talk to.


       Examine   |  Open     |  Close   |   Speak
       -----------------------------------------
       OPERATE  |  Go    |  Hit  |  Consume

This is a doozy!  If ya wanna work somethin' or use a tool or a key or
whatever on somethin' else, ya gotta use OPERATE.  For instance, to dial a
phone ya need to click on OPERATE then double-click on the phone. To push a
button, click on OPERATE and then double-click on the button. To use one
thing on another, ya need to pick the two things. For instance, if ya wanna
plug a rat what's messin' with you, just click on OPERATE, then on the gun,
then on the guy ya wanna shoot. If ya wanna unlock a door, click on OPERATE
then on the key then on the door.


       Examine   |  Open     |  Close   |   Speak
       -----------------------------------------
       Operate  |  GO    |  Hit  |  Consume
 
Use GO to use a door or exit. Click on GO, then on the exit in the picture
or in the Exits window.

SHORTCUT:  Double-click on the doorway or exit in either the picture or the
EXITS window.


       Examine   |  Open     |  Close   |   Speak
       -----------------------------------------
       Operate  |  Go    |  HIT  |  Consume

You oughta be good at this one. Click on HIT, then on the Hittee. By the
way, be sure you know what you're gettin' into.

SHORTCUT: Hey, with your reputation, we figured ya didn't need one.


       Examine   |  OPEN     |  Close   |   Speak
       -----------------------------------------
       Operate  |  Go    |  Hit  |  CONSUME

Even tough guys get hungry. Click on CONSUME then on the food, drink, or
whatever.

The Menus

If ya already know about menus, ya might wanna skip this; it's just for the
rookies in the crowd.

If ya wanna see all the menus choices ya got commin' to ya, point the
little arrow at one of the words at the top of the screen and hold down the
button on yer mouse. To pick one of the commands just keep the button down
and move the pointer 'til the word ya want inverts. Then just let up on the
button. The command'll happen as soon as ya let up on the button.

Use SAVE AS whenever ya wanna save a game with a new name. SAVE will save
your current position as whatever filename you gave the last time you used
SAVE AS.  This is just like MacWrite and MacPaint. You can start a saved
game by either running it from the Finder's desktop, or by selecting OPEn
from the file menu and choosing your saved game from the list displayed.

Ya should always use QUIT when you are done playin'. That way, you are
given a chance to save your game before you leave.

For instance, if ya have a shaky memory, you can COPY and PASTE the text
from the text window into the Scrapbook or Notepad so ya won't forget
important stuff.

Use CLEAN UP if a contents window is too messy. Use MESS UP if ya think
it's too neat.

You can use this to change the font any time to anythin' ya want. The
text'll pretty itself up to match whatever font ya pick, so's ya can always
read it.

The Windows

All of the windows in the game can be moved around the screen. If a window
has a size-box (you know, that little dohickus in the lower right corner),
then the window can be re-sized as well. This is all especially nice if
you're a lucky Macintosh XL owner with lots of desktop to play with!

There are lots of things ya can do with windows, and just in case ya aren't
sure how ta do 'em, I'm gonna give ya the basics.

1) Move 'em around. All ya gotta do to move a window is point to the top
part (in the title bar, if there is one), hold down the button, and move
the mouse. When ya let go of the button, the window'll plop down right
there.

2) Bring 'em to the front.  If there's a window behind another one, just
click in the one that's behind and it'll come up top.

3) Resize 'em.  See that little dohickus in the lower right corner?  Just
point to it, hold down the button, and drag the mousie around. The
window'll end up the size ya want when ya let go of the button.

The Inventory, contents, and text windows have a nifty little trick to 'em.
If ya want a full-size screen window, just double-click in the title bar
and the window'll pop up to full size. Do it again to shrink it back to
normal. You'll know it's popped up when the little box in the lower right
is black instead of white.

4) Close 'em.  If a window has a little box thing like this in its top left
corner, you can close the window by clickin' in the box.

Multiple Selection in Windows

There's one last little trick that'll make things easy if ya gotta use or
move more than one thing at a time in an "inventory" window. You can grab
more than one thing by holdin' down the mouse button and dragging out a
selection rectangle around the stuff ya wanna work with. When ya let up on
the button, everything you picked will be selected. You get to move all of
the things at once by pointin' to one of the selected items and movin' the
mouse. When ya let go of the button, they'll all plop down in the news
spot.

The Prize

What more could ya want? If ya want it right, you survive. But if that's
not enough, keep your nose clean and turn the tables on the rats, and who
knows? Ya just might get yourself one of them awards or somethin'.
