			     Day of the Viper

What's A GAR?

July 4, 2307.  First, a quick history lesson.

Not too long ago - about 3000 years to be exact - someone at The Rore
Corporation gave in to coffee-included delusions and proposed an idea: 
Let's create a biotechnotic race.  Something with the mind of a computer,
the body of an assault vehicle, and the intuitive processes of a human
being.  It would be perfect for belt mining, wouldn't it?  Or piloting a
spaceship.

After a few decades of R & D, and billions in governement subsidies, Rore
finally came up with a prototype unit, GAR-1 (Genetic Android Race).

GAR was incredible.  He was a powerhouse.  He performed dangerous and/or
complex functions with frightening efficiency - and, for the first time in
the history of biotechnology, with a masterful intuitive grace as well.  In
GAR, researchers had truly reduced the interface between man and machine to
about the length of a cellular dendrite.

Unfortunately, GAR had these "headaches."

Neurosynthetic melding, it seems, serves up some unpleasant side effects. 
For example: Excruciating neural pain.

Back to the Future.  Well, to make a long story short, GAR went whackoid -
who wouldn't? - and has been rampaging maniacally through the defenses of
the Sun League Defense Force (SLDF) for three centuries now.  It is
difficult to overstate the unwholesome nature of his feelings toward living
organisms.  Indeed, to call GAR "vengeful" would be like calling Attila the
Hun "naughty."

You know, it wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't smarter than everybody on
Earth put together, and hadn't spawned an unstoppable robotic army whose
sole purpose is to strip the biology from every biosphere in the galaxy.

Take away all that and we'd be in pretty good shape.

Let's Get to The Piont.  Whick is this:  We're in deep moon sauce.  GAR's
brilliant bio-technoid mind has come up with innovation after military
innovation.  His shield and laz gun technology has been a generation ahead
of SLDF issue for a hundred years.

Of course, we've had good success lately.  SLDF military research has made
some remarkable advances - and there are rumors of breakthrough weapon &
shield developments unfolding even as we speak.  Ion cannons.  Krellian
power spheres.  You know, things like that.

However, recent intelligence reports indicate unusual activity in GAR bases
out in the Rim Worlds - the icy, lifeless planets onthe edge of the galaxy.
 His swarming mechanoid minions seem to be mobilizing for a daring
Napoleonic thrust into the intimate inner ionosphere of the Sun League
central systems.  (Say that last sentence five times, relly fast.)

We have reason to believe that...

Here's where you come in

Suddenly, from deep space, your attack frigate - the "SLDF Defiance" -
receives a distress signal.

After recovering from the shock of your computer's message, you blast into
hyper-drive.  You hover cautiously in the outer rim of the Targan system.
Immediately, your sensors tell you the entire star system is crawling with
elite units of GAR's bloodless BioScan Corps.

OK, maybe they look like household appliances.  But they have an attitude
problem.  With cold, efficient fury, BioScanners seek out biological life. 
Then they toast it into little pieces of black oblivion.  Rumor has it they
will relentlessly hunt down even the tiniest fibrillating bits of
unicellular biomass.  GAR, you see, sweats the details.

You decide it's kind of cozy, way out here on the rim of this star system.

GETTING STARTED

For starters, copy the Viper disks (or disk if you have an Amiga) and store
the originals away.  (The disks are not copy-protected.)  You could use the
originals, of course, but why take chances?

Atari ST Floppy Drive System

To copy the disks, place Disk 1 into the drive and double-click on the disk
icon when it appears.  Then double-click on BACKUP.PRG and follow the
on-screen prompts.  Any other method of backing up the game may cause
severe migranes.

1.  Insert Disk 1, label side up, into Drive 1, and turn on your computer.
    The game will load automatically.

2.  If you don't want to cold boot the game as in step 1, insert the Viper
    disk so that the Viper disk icon appears on your desktop.  Then, use
    the mouse to move the cursor arrow to the file VIPER.PRG - and double-
    click the left mouse button to open it.

3.  When prompted, replace Disk 1 with Disk 2, then click either mouse
    button one time.  The credits begin.

4.  To quickly bypass the credits, press the left mouse button.

5.  After the credits, the StellarDyne Systems Self Diagnostic Slide Rule
    screen will appear in order to test your space worthiness.

	Find the letter of the Circuit Board on your computer screen,
   	and notice that you are presented with a highlighted module and
	five icons to choose from.

				1

	Now take the Slide Rule (it came in the box) and move the slide
	bar until the letter in the Circuit Board window on the Slide Rule
	matches the Circuit Board letter on the computer screen.

	Find the icon on the Slide Rule that corresponds to the position
	of the highlighted module on the computer screen.

	Go back to the computer screen and click on one of the five
	on-screen icons that matches the Slide Rule icon.  Voila.

	Repeat the same process successfully two more times and you will
	emerge a new being.  Fail, and you will stay forever in the icy
	blackness of space.  Re-boot and re-try.

Atari ST Hard Drive System

1.  Turn on your computer, then insert Viper's Disk 1, label side up, into
    Drive A.  Create a folder on your hard drive and call it Viper.

2.  Drag the Disk 1 icon into the new folder.

3.  Replace the Viper Disk 1 with Viper Disk 2 and, again, drag the Disk 2
    icon into the new folder.

4.  After both disks are copied to your hard drive, double-click on 
    VIPER.PRG to begin play.

Amiga Floppy System

To make a backup copy of Viper:

1.  Insert Workbench into drive DF0: and turn on your computer.

2.  Replace Workbench with the Viper disk.

				2

3.  Click once on the Viper disk icon to highlight it.

4.  Open the Workbench menu and select Duplicate. (The right mouse button
    will open the menu.)  Follow all on-screen prompts and you'll have
    your copy.  If you run into trouble, see your Amiga manual about making
    copies.

5.  Now, to start the game from scratch, insert your copy of the Viper
    disk into drive DF0: and turn on your computer.  The game will load
    automatically. See #5 on page 1 to negotiate the off-disk copy
    protection scheme when it appears.

Amiga Hard Drive System

To install:

1.  Turn on your computer so that your hard drive is active.

2.  Enter the CLI. (See your manual if you are dumbfounded.)

3.  Insert the Viper disk into drive DF0: (Make sure that you always wait
    for the drive light to go off before you do anything else - otherwise
    you could destroy the data on your disk.)

4.  Type makedir dh0:viper and press Enter.

5.  Type copy df0:#? dh0:viper and press Enter.  The game files will be
    copied onto your hard drive.

To play:

1.  Enter the CLI and type cd dh0:viper and press Enter.

2.  Type Viper, press Enter and the game will boot.

				3

THE PROBLEM

If you pass your test, a terrifying message - Priority One Alert, from High
Command - will appear on your screen.  Read it and weep.  Then fire up your
Viper V.  (If you're impatient, press the left mouse button once to bypass
the message.)

WHAT'S A VIPER?

As one of the original members of The Nexus Project, you have been waiting
for this moment.  A Viper unit is a powerful attack android.  But unlike
GAR, a Viper is controlled from a remote location by a highly-trained human
operator - in this case, you.

In combining the Viper android with the Nexus 2000 synergy Console - the
remote link which directs the unit - The Rore Corporation has come
remarkable close to matching GAR's systemic configuration without actually
fusing living cells to component technolgoy.

Unfortunately, the cost of each Viper/Nexus unit is so prohibitive that Sun
League has only a handful.  All of them, except yours, are drydocked. 
There are indications that SLDF defense contractors have been overcharging
us.  I know you may find this shocking.

Here's what we're getting at:  No other androids are available.  Only you
can save the Sun League.

				4

WHAT'S THE MISSION?

Simple.  Regain control of the SLDF Base Complex.  Five buildings, five
floors apiece.  The only obstacle is a hoard of the most dogged storm
troopers this side of the Dog Star.

And, yeah, GAR.  The honcho himself.

Look, it's not impossible.  Just reactivate the Security Defense Computer. 
Of course, GAR destroyed the central program.  He's not stupid.  But he
doesn't know that the program was downloaded onto 25 hidden floppy disks as
well.

Direct your Viper to recover all the disks, load them into your Viper's
built-in hard-drive, then upload the data back into the Command Post Main
Computer.  Once the security system is reactivated, all intruders and ships
will be eliminated.

Here's how you do it:

1.  Recover the Floppies.  There are 25 floppy disks, one hidden in each
    of the 25 sub-floors of the SLDF Complex.  There are five buildings,
    each with five sub-floors.  Each sub-floor can have as many as 50
    rooms.

2.  Find the Disk Controller Chip.  This little silicon etching enables you
    to load floppy data onto your hard disk.

3.  Find the Computer Interface Chip.  This lets your Viper unit
    communicate with the Main Computer.

4.  Find the Main Computer Room.  It's there, somewhere.  Upload the data
    and find a way to restart (boot) the system.

5.  Kill Lots of the Enemy.  As you progress, enemy troops get nastier.
    Destroy as many as possible.

HOW TO CONTROL THE VIPER SCREEN

Viper is completely mouse-controlled: No codes, no keyboard commands.  So
in this manual, when we say "point" to something, we don't mean with your
finger.  We mean this: Move the mouse until the on-screen mouse pointer is
directly over the indicated object.

To IDENTIFY anything in the game, simply point to the object or area with
the mouse pointer and click the right mouse button once.  A short
description of the object will appear on the Message Display.

To ACTIVATE SCREEN FUNCTIONS, point to the appropriate on-screen buttons or
gauge and click the left mouse button.

To ACTIVATE OBJECTS, point to them and double-click the left mouse button. 
The Message Display will tell you what happened.

				6

To MOVE OBJECTS: First, click the left mouse button once on the object
(such as an Energy Crystal) to be moved.  A green box will highlight the
object.  Move the mouse pointer to the desired spot (such as one of the
Holding Boxes), then click the left mouse button again.  The object will
move to this new location.  If that area is already occupied by another
object, the two objects will be "swapped."

To ACTIVATE ROOMS in the SLDF Complex, put the pointer on the back wall of
the room and click the left mouse button.

To FIRE YOUR WEAPON click on the Weapon Button, then move the pointer into
the Right Monitor area where it will automatically become a cross-hair,
ready to shoot.  Click on the Weapon Button again to return the crosshair
to its benign pointer-like state.

HOW TO CONTROL YOUR VIPER MECHANOID

You've got a lot of things to monitor on your Viper module, but a few turns
around the SLDF hallways and you'll be moving like a pro.  You'd better if
you want to survive the lower floors.

Message Display - Watch this.  This is how your Vipere mechanoid
communicates with you.

Right Monitor - Your synegistic eyes.  Lets you see everything that your
Viper unit sees through a special 3-D Camera.  However, you cannot see
unlit areas without a visual aid.

Holding Boxes - Ten of these; they serve as compartments for storing disks,
energy crystals, and other objects you find.

				7

Plotter Button - Turns your Plotter Display on and off. Click it with the
left mouse button.  (The Plotter Indicator light is green when ON, black
when Off.)

Plotter Display - Maps out each floor as you progress.  You cannot detect
intruders on your plotter.  If your Plotter Chip has been damaged, you
cannot activate the plotter.  Unlike shields and firing weapons, the
plotter does not drain your energy while in use.

Current Building - (1 thru 5)

Current Floor - (1 thru 5)

Floor Coordinates - Whows your position (X and Y coordinates) on the
current floor in relation to the upper left corner of the plotter - i.e.,
upper left corner: X = 0, Y = 0.  Coordinates will help you find
previously-explored locations and previously-found objects of importance. 
Coordinates are automatically recorded when you access your Recorder.

Short Range Sensor - The danger gauge that indicates enemy presence: GREEN
for safe conditions, YELLOW for approaching danger, and RED for immediate
danger.  On the Amiga, the four-sided gauge will also light up on the side
from where the danger is coming.

Heading Indicator - Trusty direction finder.  Your computer screen is North
at the top, South at the bottom, West on the left, and East on the right. 
The indicator, however, tells you in which direction Viper is headed.  So
in order to travel up your screen, for example, make sure the compass reads
North, then click on the Move Forward Button (Up arrow) with the left mouse
button.

Scanner Button - Gives you one scan cycle - a portion of the entire floor
area that surrounds Viper will be scanned, with results displayed on your
plotter screen (if active).  It will burn up some energy, too.

				9

Movement Buttons - These move your Viper android.  For continuous movement,
hold down the arrows.

                           Move Forward
                                |
                                |
          Rotate left ---------   ----------- Rotate right
                                |
                                |
                          Move Backward

Weapon Button - Turns your particle beam weapon system or Laz Gun on and
off.  (Weapon Indicator Light = green for On, black for Off.)  When on, the
mouse hand changes to a Crosshair on the right monitor.  Aim the crosshair
at the target, then press the elft mouse button to fire the weapon that is
currently installed.

Always shoot for your opponent's "Hot Spot."   What's a Hot Spot?  It's
that one spot on a foe's person that will cause the most damage when you
hit it.  The farther away from that spot, the less damage you will cause
and the more energy you will waste.  Unfortunately, the only way to find
their Hot Spot is trial and error - the closer you come with a spot, the
larger the explosion.  If you're not close, the shot will do no damage.

To install a neew weapon, point to the new weapon and double-click the left
mouse button.  But remember: Firing weapons consume power.

				10

Shield Button - Turns your shield recharges on and off.  (Shield Indicator
Light = green for On, black for Off.)  To install a new shield,
double-click the left mouse button on the desired shield.  Activated
shields consume power because they are constantly recharging.  And when
turned off, they'll retain their energy level until hit.

Energy Level Gauge - Tells you how much energy is left in your storage
tanks.  If it hits 0%, Viper will shut down.  You lose energy by fighting,
operating weapons and shields, and running into things you shouldn't.  You
even lose power just standing around, so it's a good idea to pause the game
when you're not actively hunting Gar.  To replenish energy, gobble up all
the energy crystals you can find.

Damage Level Gauge - Shows you how much damage your Viper has sustained. 
If damage level hits 100%, Viper is destroyed.  For repairs, hunt for
repair pads.

Battered Unit Damage (B.U.D.) Light - Registers how much damage an enemy
under attack is taking on.  The more hits you make, the faster the
indicator will change from green (good as new) to yellow (50% damage:
hurting cowboy) to red (75% damage: dead meat).

				11

Weapon Temperature Gauge - Your Laz Gun Temperature Gauge.  The gun will
malfunction if it gets too hot.

Shield Strength Gauge - If this hits 0, your mechanoid can be damaged by
laser hits.

Pause Button - Freezes the game at any moment.  (Pause Indicator Light will
register red for Paused, green for Running.)  When the game is paused, the
screen will turn red.

CIRCUIT BOARD

The main control panel of your Viper.  It contains 13 precious microchips -
each can be damaged and must be replaced as needed.  To access the circuit,
click on the Circuit Button with the left mouse button.  (The Circuit
Indicator Light is green when On, black when Off.)

To install Chips and Components, point to the desired object and
double-click the left mouse button.  The object will appear on the circuit
board in the correct socket.  (You do not need the board displayed in order
to install circuits.)

Disk Menu Button - Click on this with the left mouse button (Disk Menu
Indicator Light = green for On, black for Off) and four options appear in
the left monitor area.

				13

	LOAD - Click with the left mouse button to load a previously-saved
	game.  To save a game, see How to Save A Game, page 24.

	SAVE - Click with the left mouse button to save the battle you're
	currently waging.  Only one game can be saved at a time; a 
	second save will override the first.

	QUIT - Click with the left mouse button to return to the
	operating system.  When asked if you want to quit without saving
	the current gaem, click on Yes or No.

	RECORDER ICON - Click with the left mouse button to open and close
	your Recorder or electronic notebook.  The Recorder is a nifty tool
	for tracking locations of rooms and valuable items so you can
	return for them when needed.  With the Recorder opened, just click
	on the object or room with the right mouse button and the critical
	information is automatically listed.  It can hold up to 50
	messages.

		Single Arrow - (Scrolls through messages one at a time)

		Delete Button - (Erases center highlighted message)

		Double Arrow - (Scroll through messages five at a time)

Hard Drive Gauge - Each of these five bars corresponds to one of the 5
sectors of your hard disk, each holding 5 floppy disks worth of
information.

				14

Floppy Disk Drive - Lets you load floppy disks onto your Viper's hard disk.
 To load a disk, double-click left mouse button on desired disk.  The light
on the drive will go on to indicate loading.

KNOW THINE ENEMY

Know him.  He is deadly and ubiquitous.  Many different types of GAR-goyles
roam the halls of the SLDF Complex looking for your Viper.  When their
sensors detect your guy, the ones that move, move fast.

In his quest for the ultimate warrior, Gar had made many different models. 
Each with different speed, attack logic, armor, and strength.  Some are
designed for recon work, others for communications, and then there are the
warrior units - the elite of Gar's forces.

It is extremely important to gain weapons and shield upgrades.  The more,
the better.

TRAPS TO AVOID

Many traps were placed by the enemy after their successful assault in order
to prevent a counter attack by SLDF forces.  All will cause either
disorientation, power loss, damage to Viper unit (including your circuit
board), or all of the above.  If you're fast and lucky, you might be able
to avoid detonation.  Be on the lookout for the following:

Teleport Traps slow your progress by teleporting you to a different place
onyour current floor.

Gyroscope Traps disorient you by rotating your Viper mechanoid in a
dizzying manner, then throwing you in a random direction.  Where it stops,
nobody knows.  Some are nasty enough to inflict damage.

				18

Proximity Mines emit a powerful energy disruption beam that will cause a
diminution of power.

Energy Disruptor Mines emit an even more destructive force than Force
Fields.  They want to bring your man down.

De-Plotter Traps discharge static energy bursts that can scramble your
plotter module (map view), disabling your plotter display until you replace
the module.

Proton Mines damage your Viper, might damage one chip on your circuit
board, and cause power loss.  By far the most destructive of all traps. 
Avoid religiously.

HOW TO SEARCH TH SLDF BASE COMPLEX

You know the layout:  Five underground security buildings, five floors per
building, up to 50 rooms per floor.  To move from floor to floor, seek out
a TurboLifter.  To move from building to building, find a Shuttle.

Each building has progressively higher-level SECUITY LOCKS.  To enter
locked areas, you need special, color coded Access Cards.

				16

Different colored Access Cards unlock certain colored doors.  As you can
see from the chart below, higher-level cards will unlock all lower-level
doors.

  |----------------------------------------------------------|

Here's the type of rooms you'll encounter:

Communication Rooms - Feature video displays that will scroll important
messages for you - provided you have the Communciation Module installed in
your circuit board.  Click the left mouse button on the room to activate
the communicator.  There's a different message on each floor.  Read them as
many times as you like.

Power Rooms - Here you can restore full power to your mechanoid - if you
have an Energy Syphon.  No limit to the number of times you can suck energy
from the Main Reactors.  Click left mouse button to activate generators.

Repair Rooms - Just the place to repair Viper hull damage.  You need a
Repair Room Activator, however.  Click left mouse button to activate the
repair generator.  No limit to number of repairs - but you can't fix a
circuit board here.

				17

Security Rooms - Great spots if you happen to have a Security Room
Activator.  Click the room with the left mouse button and reactivate the
Anti-Intruder System on your current floor.  Then watch your worries (and
any remaining intruders) melt away.

Shuttle Rooms - The place to catch the shuttle to another of the five
adjacent buildings.  To use the shuttle, click the left mouse button on the
room and select Yes.

Storage Rooms - like a candy store - are great places to find all sorts of
goodies to help you complete your mission.  One small problem, though: all
the storage rooms are equipped with force fields.  You will need to locate
the combination to each storage room and enter it onto a Security Lock -
which is a keypad beside the door.  A close-up of the keypad will appear
when you click on it with the left mouse button.  But no combination, no
entry.

The rooms also allow you to free up space on-board your Viper.  Unload
items into any of the six Storage Cubicles by clicking on the source object
- a green box will highlight it - then clicking on the destination cubicle.

Terminal Rooms - Provide refuge for the hidden floppy disks.

TurboLift Rooms - Fancy elevators that take you to any floor, up or down. 
Once inside, click the left mouse button on the number of the desired
floor.

Vacant Rooms - Perform no function.  However, valuable objects can often be
found inside.

				18

Computer Room - Your ultimate destination.  If you make it there... if you
have all 25 Floppy disks loaded into your hard drive ...  if you have the
Computer Interface Chip installed in your circuit board ...  then click the
left mouse button on the room to activate the computer.  The Data
automatically transfers.  But you still need to figure out how to start up
the defense computer.

VITAL OBJECTS

The SLDF Base was a research and development center for weapon and shield
technology.  Therefore, you shouldn't be surprised if you discover
prototypes of the universe's most useful, and destructive, tools.  Here is
a partial list of objects that can be found in the SLDF Base Complex.  The
rest you have to find on your own.

Combination - Needed to deactivate supply room force fields.  (One time
use.)  Double click the left mouse button to enter it into your Recorder.

Communication Module - Circuit need to activate Communication Rooms.  UMust
be installed.  Damageable.)

Computer Interface Circuit - Lets Viper communicate with Main Computer. 
(Must be installed.  Damageable.)

Circuit Etcher and Circuit Etcher Fuel - When given etcher fuel (one time
use), this etching device (also one time use) creates a valuable component
that canbe installed in your circuit board.

Circuit Repair Module - Repairs all damaged modules on your circuit board.
(One time use.)

Damage Repair Pod - Repairs damage done to Viper mechanoid.  Will not
repair circuits.  (One time use.)

HOW TO SAVE A GAME

Click the left mouse button on the Disk Menu Button and when the four
options appear, click on Save.  To load a saved game, click the left mouse
button on the Disk Menu Button, and when the four options appear, click on
Load.

Only one game can be saved at a time; a second save will overwrite the
first.  By the way, every new game - including the position of rooms, enemy
robots, objects, etc. - will be completely different from the previous one.
