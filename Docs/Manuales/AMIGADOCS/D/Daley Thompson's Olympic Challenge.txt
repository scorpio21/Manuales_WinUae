the  screen!  at the start of each training session,the bottle will be empty
and the more exercises you do,the more the bottle will fill up.if you manage

lucozade.train  well  and you can achieve a maximum of three cans.(i.e.  one
per  session).to  use these cans you will be given an option at the start of

 footwear
 ^^^^^^^^

at  the  start  of  each  event,a menu will be presented from which you must
select  the correct 'adidas' footwear for the heat,failure to make the right
choice  will  end  up  in  inferior  performance in that event!if you select
wrongly the correct chice will be stated after the choice has been made!make
a  note  of  this  for next!  in all event,power is all-important.continuous
left  and right joystcick movement builds up the poer.this is most important
in  the  track  events e.g.100m,400m,1500m,and also the high jump.however in
the  1500m,once  you have built up your power,then only a small rate of left
and right movement is needed to sustain your speed.  in the remaining events
,the  pressing  of  the fire button at the correct movement is essential for
sucsess in that event the skill of this will have to be learned,if you don't
have it!
