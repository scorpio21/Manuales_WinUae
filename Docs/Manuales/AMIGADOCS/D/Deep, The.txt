GAME PLAY

Your boat can be moved left or right using the joystick. Press FIRE BUTTON
to drop depth charges which can be dropped from the ship's side facing
the direction it is moving in.

Upon destroying some submarines, a spinning pod with any one of five letters
on it will rise to the surface and change into a flag. Remaining on the
surface for three seconds, if you pick it up within this alotted time,
the helicopter appears and drops a small package for your ship to collect.
Special features are awarded according to which flag you pick up.

FLAG "A":  Cursor Missiles: When pressing FIRE a target appears under the
           ship with a bomb above it. Move the target by holding down
           FIRE and moving in the direction required. When fire is not
           pressed, the ship can move left and right. After a few seconds
           the bomb will home in on the target destroying everything in its
           path.

FLAG "B":  Pods: The pod is used to collect tokens from the sea bed. On
           pressing ALT the ship disappears and is replaced by a pod.

FLAG "C":  Hydrofoil Speed: This flag enables the ship to reach hydrofoil
           speed which then lifts the ship up on skis to move faster than
           normal.

FLAG "D":  Smart Bomb: This will destroy all submarines on screen.

FLAG "E":  Depth Charges: This gives extra power to depth charges.

At the end of each scrolling screen there is a transition stage where a
player has to destroy a large ship by dropping bombs on the Captain's
Bridge. After achieving this the player has to destroy a large submarine
by dropping depth charges into open domes which fire nuclear missiles.

There is then a bonus screen where the player has to rescue people from an
island.

The above is separated into four sections which are:

1. Main Section - Collect the tokens using the pod.

2. Transition Section - Hit the large ship in the center using the missile.

3. Large Submarine Section - Destroy the hatches on the large submarine.

4. Hostage Section - Use the crosshair to hit the enemy missiles before
                     they hit the small boats.
