1. Introduction

History books fail to mention it, but in 1755 the British Empire was cursed
with the presence of a secret underground missionary group.  Their mission?
To rid the kingdom of people like Rob Crucade who stumbled upon a hush-hush
meeting by accident and learnt about the groups plans to kill the king.  He
was  cast  away to an island off the coast of Scotland where many wierd and
strange  people  were  sent  if  they  didn't  see  eye  to  eye  with  the
establishment.  Strangely enough a king was put in power of the island and,
being  part  of the missionary group, can be a mean old soul when he wants.
However  he  has  been known to be quite corrupt and will grant any favours
you want provided he's suitably buttered up first.

You will encounter many characters on your journey across the island.  Most
are  selfish  and  will  inevitably  use  you although their gifts, despite
seeming paltry at the time, can be put to some great uses


2. The aim

You  must  work  your  way  around  the  island,  interacting  with various
characters.   They  will  usually  ask  for a gift, giving you something in
return.  The resulting present can then be used on another person until all
of the puzzles are solved and you're eventually let free.

Some  characters  need  to  be  pestered.  This means you may have to click
twice  on  a character to get what you are after.  But you will get results
in the end.

Every puzzle can be solved with a little bit of cunning and a little bit of
logic.   Speech hold many clues but there are some puzzles which you really
need to think about.  It's quite a challenge.

3. Hints

The  water  has  a powerful suction action on Rob.  At the beginning of the
game,  you  need  to jump straight away to break it's power, or else you'll
fall into the sea and die.

Without  wanting  to give the game away too much, when you get a magic ring
and  frantically try and use it use it somewhere without avail, think along
the lines of a trap and you may just find the answer.

Joystick/Joypad Up      - Move up
Joystick/Joypad Down    - Move down
