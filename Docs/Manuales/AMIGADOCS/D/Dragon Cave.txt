A  short documentation of the game DragonCave V1.00 for the Commodore Amiga.
A detailed instruction manual is included in the program itself.


1.  Introduction
----------------

This  disk  contains  the  program  DragonCave,  a Sokoban-like game for the
Amiga.  The following features are offered:

- You  can  choose between a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional version
  of  the game.  While the 2D-mode corresponds to the conventional game, the
  3D-mode  is  even  more  difficult  to play, since it demands a lot of the
  player's ability to think in a three-dimensional way.

- The game contains 100 levels; 50 of them can be altered by you by means of
  the built-in editor.

- Each  level  can  be  entered  directly;  each one has got its own list of
  hiscores.

- You can undo up to 1000 of the preceding steps.

- When the game starts, it copies  as  many data-files as possible to the
  RAM-disk to reduce the loading-times while you're playing.

- The  possible  options  may  be  entered  when starting the game; it's also
  possible  to  start  the  game directly, skipping the intro and the
  menu.


2.  Error-Messages
------------------

In  case  an  error appears DragonCave will show you an alert (like a
Guru Meditation) and give you a number and a short description of the error.
These error-messages are explained below in a more detailed way.

 ท 1     - can't access data-file
 ท 14/15 - can't read level
   ญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญ

DragonCave  can't  read  one  of its data-files.  There may be different
reasons. First,  one  of  the  files  may  be  deleted  or
manipulated.   Second,  there may be a read-write-error on the disk.  Third,
this  error  may  result  from  two strange ways of starting the program.
That's why you SHOULDN'T do the following:
   'Path DFx: Add'
   'Run DragonCave'
or
   'Assign XYZ: DFx:DragonCave'
   'Run XYZ:'
In  this case DragonCave cannot find its data-files and will produce this
error-message.

 ท  2   - no screen
 ท  3/7 - no window
 ท  8   - no audio_port
 ท 10   - no game_port
   ญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญ

DragonCave  is  unable  to  open a Screen, a Window or a MsgPort.  This may
result from a lack of free memory.  Look at error-codes 15-26.

 ท  4 - no intuition-library
 ท  5 - no graphics-library
 ท  6 - no icon-library
 ท 11 - no gameport-device
 ท 13 - no console-device
   ญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญ

DragonCave  fails to open a Library or a Device.  Please assure that your
Amiga  is  running  under kickstart-version 1.2 or a higher one and boot it with a
standard-workbench-disk.

 ท 15-26 - not enough memory
   ญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญ

DragonCave  can't  find enough free memory.  Please finish all other running
programs,  close  all  unneeded  windows and try again.  If DragonCave fails
again, you should reboot your Amiga.

 ท  9 - no audio-channel available
   ญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญ

All audio-channels are occupied by a different program.  Finish this one and
try again.

 ท 12 - gameport still in use
   ญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญญ

The  second controller port is used by a different program.  Finish this one
and try again.


3.  Thanks
----------

We'd like to thank the following persons:

Andy Taros         - for  the  fine graphics in the game DungeonMaster which
                     is  the best game we have ever bought for Amiga (if you like
                     fantasy-roleplaying-games, you MUST play this one!)
Dirk Strobel       - for lots of hints and advice
