HERE COMES TROUBLE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Meet Dennis Mitchell. He's 5 years old, blonde, cute as a button and
trouble spelled with a capital 'T'!
His Mom and Dad are away on Business and Dennis is staying with their
next door neighbours, the eternally patient Mrs. Wilson and her hus-
band, the grouchy Mr. Wilson.
During his stay,  Mr. Wilson is planning to  exhibit his prize night
flowering orchid to the  local garden club at a Dinner at his house.
This plant will bloom once only,during the full moon and then wither
and die, and as such is Mr.Wilson's pride and joy. Unfortunately, as
is to be expected with Dennis around things do not go as planned.
Dennis has disgraced himself  once the night, and has duly been sent
to bed. While out half-pint hero is  upstairs feeling sorry for him-
self, Mr. Wilson and his guest sit  with baited breath, awaiting the
blooming of the famous orchid.
But while everyone  is otherwise  occupied, the Wilson household has
another even more unwelcome visitor, in  the shape of the villainous
drifter,  Switchblade Sam,  a petty  crook and  house breaker.  Sam,
thinking the coast is clear,is busy in the study making off with Mr.
Wilson valuable coin collection.
Dennis, being the curious  child that he is, hears the noise made by
Sam's intrusion, and makes  his way downstairs. Too late to actually
see the crook, he  finds the safe wide open  and the coin collection
gone.
With all good intention  at heart, Dennis rushes out into the garden
and shouts the terrible news to Mr. Wilson. Doing this causes every-
one to turn to face Dennis - just as the fabulous plant opens.
Mr. Wilson is furious! His life's work is gone. His  heart is broken
and his temper rising. He takes his  anger out on Dennis leaving the
small boy alone and confused.He was only trying to help, and now his
world is shattered. Dennis always seen Mr. Wilson as his best friend
in the whole world and now he  doesn't want to know him. What can he
do ? Who can he turn to ?
Dennis resolves  to run away and never bother  anyone again. His Mom
and Dad can always  have another  kid who won't be a menace, and Mr.
Wilson obviously never wants to see him again.
But just as he is stealing off into the night, he overhears Mrs.Wil-
son tell  her husband that  she has heard  that Dennis's two friends
Joey and  Margaret are missing.  Dennis knows  that whoever stole Mr.
Wilson coin collection has taken his friends ? He revolves to rescue
them and  retieve the stolen  goods. That way,  in years to come, if
people ever think  of Dennis, the small  boy who  ran away, at least
they can say that  he did at  least one good  thing in his life, and
maybe he wasn't all bad.

Now Dennis must set off on his greatest adventure ever...

HOW TO PLAY
=-=-=-=-=-=

LEVEL 1 : MR. WILSON'S HOUSE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Dennis must find his way out of Mr. Wilson's house. But first he has
to collect his  pea-shooter  and  sligshot. They are lying somewhere
about the house along with coins  dropped by inept Sam. Smaller coin
are less valuable, but the larger coin are necessary in order to ad-
vance to the  next level. On each  level there are four  large coins
spread about, and one final coin (This is surrunded by smaller spin-
ning coins and must be collected last).
Dennis must search the entire house, including the attic. There is a
rope lader leading to the attic but elsewhere there is a switch that
needs to be activated before Dennis can reach the ladder.
While doing all this, Dennis must avoid being seen by Mr. Wilson who
is walking aroung the house,unable to sleep due to the traumaticday.
If he spots Dennis he will  give chase and upon  catching him,  will
send him to bed and Dennis must start all over again !

LEVEL 2 : THE PARK
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Dennis must find all five of the large coins whilst avoiding all ob-
stacles in his path. Here Dennis will find his dog, Ruff, waiting to
pull him among on his little  red cart. Dennis must reach the end of
these sections  avoiding all  obstacles and using  the cart to reach
platforms that are otherwise too high for him to jump to.

BETTY SUE DUBROVSKI:
In the playground, Dennis discovers  Betty Sue Dubrovski. She's  the
kind of child  every parent tells  their kids to stay away from, and
for good reason. She's big, ugly and mean.
She is out late up to no good. Dennis must  avoid her as  she swings
back  and forth on the  swing whilst shooting at her with one of the
weapons  in his  arsenal. She  will swing up  into the trees causing
acorns to fall  to Dennis. Also there are mice running which  Dennis
must avoid whilst battling his female foe.

LEVEL 3 : THE BOILERS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Follow the trails of coins Dennis finds himself in the Boiler Works.
He must find all the large coins to advance to the next level.

THE GYM:
While  taking a  shortcut  through the  school gym Dennis  discovers
Coach Beeferman doing some late night exercices. He is determined to
catch  Dennis and  will throw  medecine balls  at him while bouncing
about the gym,and roll baseballs at him across the gym floor. Dennis
must use his weapons  to try and stun the  Coach long enough to make
him escape.

LEVEL 4 : THE SEWERS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Dennis's trail has led him down into the sewers beneath the streets.
Again Dennis must find all the large coins to progress.

THE FISH!
At the end of the sewers Dennis finds his exit barred by a large and
dangerous fish. Using  the rotating platforms Dennis must leap about
to avoid contact with his aquatic adversary whilst constantly firing 
at it. Once stunned, the  fish will  disappear and  the way  will be
clear for him to advance onto the final leg of his journey.

LEVEL 5 : THE WOODS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Dennis has  almost reached his goal and must collect the coins until
he reaches the edge of the wood where his greatest challenge awaits.

SWITHBLADE SAM:
Sam has Joey and Margaret tied to a tree as hostages while he  waits
to  jump the next train out of  town with his ill-gotten gains. Upon
seeing  Dennis, Sam  will throw a  constant barrage of apples in his
direction.  Dennis must avoid  all contact with  these and with Sam,
Whilst shooting at this  dastardly villain until Sam  finally slumps
into submission.
Defeat Sam and Dennis will have completed his epic adventure.

NOTE : All end of  level guardians have a blue energy meter which is
       displayed at the top of the screen. Dennis has also a red en-
       ergy meter displayed opposite the enemy meter.


PICK-UPS
=-=-=-=-

throughtout the game Dennis may pick up severals items which will be
helpful to him:
EXTRA LIVES : These are obtained by collecting  the 1-UP icons found
              around the levels.


WEAPONS
=-=-=-=

WATER PISTOL : Dennis has this at the start of the game. It can stun
               some baddies within the game - but not all of them.
SLINGSHOT    : This can be found at start of Mr. Wilson's  house and
               is an  excellent short  range weapon. It is extremely
               useful  for  hitting targets  below Dennis's  current
               position.
PEASHOOTER   : This is also hidden in Mr.Wilson's house and no small
               boy would  be complete  without one. It has a  longer
               range  than the slingshot  as it  fires in a straight
               line.

HINTS AND TIPS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Study  the movement  of your opppenents  and avoid them  accordingly
Haste can be costly !

If Dennis makes contact with your opponent, use his momentary invul-
nerability  (when he flashes)  to gain ground or  to  reach a  safer
position.

Different oppponents are vulnerable to different weapons,whilst some
are invulnerable to all attack. Be careful !

Watch out for switches that operate rope ladders.
