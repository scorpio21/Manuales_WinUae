Technical info 


Shareware  is  a  way  of getting good software in a cheap way.  You get
hold  of  the  software  for almost nothing, and can test it for a while
before deciding if you want to pay the programmer for his/her hard work.
But  remember  that  if  you  don't  pay and nobody else pays, then it's
pretty  sure  that  the  programmer  will  NOT  make  any more shareware
software.    And  that  will  in  the  end  lead to no software for your
machine!!!!  So, please pay the author of the software.

If  you  use this software & like it, then I, Edgar M.  Vigdal, would be
eternally grateful to you if you would send me the shareware fee (or any
amount  you  like),  as  payment  for  the game.  You will then become a
registered user of the game!

If  you  become  a registered user and send me a disk, I will send you a
super  version with lots of new levels (50), bonus levels (15) and other
improvements.    This version will be a personalized version for you, so
it is extremely important that you don't let others get this version, or
your personal key.

Here  is  a  list of different currencies and the amount that would be a
correct  price  in that currency.  Please round the amount up (or down?)
to the closest whole note(s).  Don't send me any coins!!

Send  me a disk for the reply, as I cannot afford all the disks!  Please
add an extra disk for Deluxe Galaga, if you want that one too, or if you
want  the next game.  The game has now grown too big and I can no longer
fit both games on one disk!

Please use a clean disk with no label on it!


If  you  only  pay  the shareware fee AND you get a later version from a
PD-dealer/BBS  or somewhere else, you should think of that version as an
update from me!  If you send a disk then you will get a new version from
me - when one is ready!!


INTERNET

If  you  have  Internet  access and an Email address and you are able to
receive  messages  that  are  upto  500  kilobytes  in size, you can get
updates through the Internet!!  This is the very best and fastest method
to  get  the new updates and extended versions!  So, get yourself a good
Email-box, and you will receive the full version a couple of hours after
I have your shareware fee!!!!

If  you  only  need  the key, then your account only needs to be able to
receive some 1000 bytes!!

This  is my personal version of the old, but still wonderful game PacMan
(or  maybe  Jelly  Monster).   It's not a copy of the original because I
have  never played the arcade machine.  This game was written after some
good  memories of the game 'Jelly Monster' on the VIC-20.  This game was
one  of  the first games I had on the old 3.5KB computer, and my brother
and  I were fighting like mad to beat each others high score.  The heart
pounded,  the  adrenaline  was flowing in great amounts, and the fingers
shivered.  I have never had so much fun with any game 
 on all the other
computers I've tried since - Hmm, maybe the SiliconGraphics, IRIS Indigo
Elan!.    Realtime  ray-tracing  in  24bit is wonderful!  (It's my dream
machine,  but,  with  a  price tag of $50000 here in Norway, it's only a
dream....) I hope you will like this version of PacMan (Jelly Monster?)!


Many  of  todays games have lots and lots of graphics, but when it comes
to  gameplay  they  really suck.  They have manuals covering hundreds of
pages,  and  you  need hours and days to get into the game.  What I want
from a game is some relaxation for a couple of minutes, and then be able
to  quit  the  game and do some more work.  And not to mark the calender
for when I want to play the 60MB hi-tech game!

The game is like this.  Our yellow hero Pacman must eat all of the pills
in  the  maze  to  get  to the next maze.  But danger lurks in the maze.
Four  evil  ghosts  are looking for Pacman, and they want to stop Pacman
from  getting  to the next maze.  In the maze there are some power pills
that Pacman can eat, and he can then kill the ghosts for a limited time.
There  are also some fruits that popup from time to time, and Pacman can
eat these for extra bonus points.  And sometimes some special tools will
appear  which,  when  eaten,  may affect Pacman or the pills or even the
ghosts.    Some  will  speed up Pacman, some will give random points and
some will lead to extra levels.

I  hope  you  have got the plot by now because it's really simple - just
survive in the maze as long as possible and get the highest score.


Here is a short description of the tools:

EXTRA..
When  you have collected all of the five letters you will be awarded one
extra life and be moved to the extra levels.

SPEED UP..
This  tool  comes  in  two  versions,  one normal speed up and one hyper
speed.

SHIELD..
This  will  protect  PacMan  against  the  ghosts.   When PacMan has the
shield, he cannot be killed by the ghosts.

GLUE..
This will slow down the ghosts.

FREEZE..
This will freeze the ghosts for a short time.

DYNAMITE..
This  will  make  the  ghosts explode, and give you 5000 points for each
ghost.

x2..
This will multiply every point you get by two.

x5..
This will multiply every point you get by five.

DIAMOND..
This will change all the pills into diamonds for a short time.

PRESENT..
This  will  give  you  a high random score for each pill you take.  Very
good !!

CLOCK..
This  will  give  you  some  extra tool time.  Each tool will last a bit
longer.

EXTRA LEVEL..
This  will  send PacMan to an extra level.  There are five extra levels,
and  if  you  manage to clear the extra level you will get 50000 points.
You  will  not lose any lives on the extra levels.  If you have the full
version there will be 15 extra levels.

JUMP..
This will send PacMan to a random level.

GUN..
This  will  make  PacMan  able  to shoot the ghost and get a random high
score for each ghost.


DISK

Start  your  machine  with Workbench, then insert the Deluxe PacMan game
disk  in  one of the diskdrives, and open up the disk by double-clicking
on  the  disk  icon.    Then  open  up  the  Deluxe  PacMan directory by
double-clicking  on  the  directory  icon.    You then start the game by
double clicking the PacMan game icon.

If you want to make a bootable game disk then format and install a disk.
Then make an 'S' directory on the disk...

               Makedir DF0:S   [RETURN]

Copy  all  of  the  Deluxe PacMan files onto the disk.  Or just copy the
Deluxe_PacMan directory over to the empty disk.

Copy the following commands on to the disk...

        CD
        SetPatch21           ;If you are using OS2.1
        SetPatch30           ;If you are using OS3.0 and AGA
        LoadWB

Make a startup-sequence in the 's' directory like this...

    -8<----------------------------------------------------------------
        SetPatch21           ;If you are using OS2.1
        SetPatch30           ;If you are using OS3.0 and AGA
        CD Deluxe_PacMan     ;If Deluxe_PacMan is the games directory!
                             ;If you don't use a Deluxe_PacMan directory
                             ;you must use a 'CD DF0:' to get the game
                             ;to start!!
        PacMan               ;Load and start the game
    -8<----------------------------------------------------------------

Reboot with the disk and test to see if it works!!


If  you want to use packed data files you should also create a directory
called  'libs'  on  the disk and copy the xpkmaster.library file and all
the files in the compressors directory.


HARDDISK

Copy  the  Deluxe  PacMan  directory  to  the  desired directory on your
harddisk,  by  dragging  the  directory icon from the Deluxe PacMan game
disk to the selected harddisk directory.

To start the game just double click on the PacMan game icon.

If  you  want  to  use  packed  data  files  you  should  also  copy the
xpkmaster.library file and all the files in the compressors directory to
your 'sys:libs' directory.


The  only  option in the 1.6 version is the PAL / NTSC switch.  This can
be  switched with the TAB key and will only work on Amigas that have the
Fat  Agnus.  If nothing happens when you press the TAB key, you probably
don't have the correct Agnus chip.

The  mode  you select will be saved, when you exit the game with the ESC
key.


NOTE!
-----

This  game  will NOT work on any 24-bit graphics card.  If Commodore had
made  a  machine with a fast enough processor to use system functions in
games, it would have worked, but they didn't and they never will!  Sorry
!!!

Amiga  is  the  best  home computer in the world, it's just too bad that
Commodore got hold of it !!!!  And that Medhi Ali was ever born!!


The game can be controlled in many ways.  You can use a joystick in port
2, the keyboard, or even the mouse.


Joystick
--------
                            Up = move Pacman up
                                    |
                                    |
        Left = move Pacman left  ---+---  Right = move Pacman right
                                    |
                                    |
                          Down = move Pacman down

Firebutton to shoot when Pacman has the gun.



Keyboard
--------

For right-handed people, the following keys can be used...


                                    [8] (keypad)
                                    [P]
                                 Cursor Up

                                     |
                  [4] (Keypad)       |         [6] (Keypad)
                  [L]            ----+----     [']
                  Cursor Left        |        Cursor Right
                                     |

                                    [2] (Keypad)
                                    [.]
                                Cursor Down


and for left-handed people, the following keys can be used...


                                    [W]

                                     |
                             [A]  ---+---  [D]
                                     |

                                    [X]

Mouse
-----

The  mouse  can also be used to control the Pacman.  Just move the mouse
in  the direction you want to turn Pacman.  This is a bit sensitive, but
with  a  bit  of training it can be used.  (I've scored over 200000 with
the mouse!) NOTE: In version 1.2 this function is improved a bit.


MUSIC

512K MEMORY

NEW FOR VERSION 1.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
XPK LIBRARY SUPPORT
NONVOLATILE LIBRARY SUPPORT


If  you get sick and tired of the music you can change it to one of your
own  favourite  Protracker modules.  You do this by changing the name of
the original music or deleting it.

Example:

rename PACMAN.MUSIC_MAIN as PACMAN.MUSIC.reserve1

And  then  you  copy your module over to the Deluxe Galaga directory and
rename it as 'PACMAN.MUSIC_MAIN'

Example:

rename MOD.MYSUPERTUNE as PACMAN.MUSIC_MAIN


NOTE!   
The  modules  that  you  want  to use must be compatible with ProTracker
1.1b.    If  you  test  your  selected  module and it is not played back
correctly, then it's most probably not compatible.

*NOTE*  
Some  Noisetracker  mods (maybe other module types too) use some strange
commands,  and  my  module  player  may  crash  if you use these kind of
modules.    If the game crashes/guru's for no apparent reason, it may be
one of the loaded modules that causes the failure!

Sorry,  but  the game has now grown out of the 512K memory of a standard
A500!!!    But  as  extra  memory is now very cheap, this is a very good
excuse for investing in a bit more memory!!

If you rename the music files (PACMAN.MUSIC_MAIN, PACMAN.MUSIC_HALL) and
use the Add44K utility, you may get the ECS version to run in 512K!

The  game  will now use the xpk (a data compressor/decompressor library)
to  load compressed modules.  Use the supplied 'pack' program to pack or
unpack datafiles.

Example:

pack hd1:PacMan/PACMAN.MUSIC_MAIN method SQSH

This  will  pack  the  file  'PACMAN.MUSIC_MAIN' on HD1:PacMan/ with the
compressor  sub-library  'xpkMASH.library'.  The compressor library must
be correctly installed for this to work.

Libs:
     xpkmaster.library
    compressors/
        xpkMASH.library
        xpkRAKE.library
        xpkSHRI.library
        xpkSQSH.library
        .
        .
        .



Use  of  the  nonvolatile  library.    If  found  the game will now save
preferences  and  hiscores  in  the  NV  device  (RAM  on  the  CD³² and
floppydisk  or  harddisks on other Amigas).  If there is enough space on
the NV device, a regular hiscore list will be saved!

If you have a disk-based Amiga, you can add an NV device by doing this:

Format  a  disk in drive n with the name 'NV', n being DF0: or any other
drive.

    Format DRIVE n NAME NV FFS NOICON               (RETURN)

Then  make a directory named 'nonvolatile' and one called 'prefs' on the
disk.

    Makedir NV:nonvolatile                          (RETURN)
    Makedir NV:prefs                                (RETURN)

Then make a directory named 'env-archive' in the 'prefs' directory.

    Makedir NV:prefs/env-archive                    (RETURN)

Then make a directory named 'sys' in the 'env-archive' directory.

    Makedir NV:prefs/env-archive/sys                (RETURN)

Then  create  a  file  in  the 'NV:prefs/env-archive/sys' directory that
contains the following:

    NV:nonvolatile

Name the file 'nv_location'.  Use Ed or another text editor to make this
file.

The next game in the Deluxe series, will probably be Deluxe Donkey Kong.
I actually started on this game after I had finished Deluxe PacMan.  But
then  I  got  another  public-domain version of Donkey Kong, that looked
almost  like  the version that I had on my old C64, & that looked almost
like  the one I had in mind.  Since I released Deluxe PacMan many people
have written to me and asked me to make a version of Donkey Kong, so now
I  am going do that.  A super-duper version of Donkey Kong!  If you have
any  tips  for  Deluxe  Donkey  Kong  then  send  them  to  me.   (Video
recordings,  graphics,  maps,  sounds  or ideas).  But when I'm finished
with  Donkey  Kong I would really like to make a version of JumpMan, one
of my all time favourites!

A version of Radar Rat Race is also coming !!!!

If  you  have any suggestions for improvements, or if you have found any
bugs then please let me know.

Good luck and have a lot of fun !!!!  PEACE !!!!

1.2                                                         251092
        - Fixed some bugs. Thanks to Christopher Salomon
          for finding that strange bug on the extra
          level, you must really have played a lot to
          find that one!
        - Added separate hall-of-fame for the 3 speeds.
          Thanks to Thorsten Kollstede for the idea.
        - Added some fading.
        - Changed the Magnet tool to a Jump function.
          The magnet didn't work as intended.
        - 'Boss wanders by' function added.
        - Fixed DOS & trackdisk version, so that it
          searches for extra module & extra music.

1.3     - Fixed some small bugs.                            301292

1.4     - Changed some routines.                            160193

1.5     - New preferences, AGA fix                          140593

1.6     - Finally  after  a very long delay, I have fixed   190595
           the game for AGA machines, and also made a real
          AGA version.
        - The  freely-distributable  version has 20 levels
          and  5  bonus  levels.  The full version has 50
          levels and 15 bonus levels.
        - There is only a DOS version now. No Trackdisk
          version!



I  have  tested the game on an A2000B/68000 with 3MB memory and 1MB chip
memory with and without harddisk.  And on an A1200 with both a 68020 and
a  33MHZ 68030/MMU and 6MB RAM.  And I have not discovered any ugly bugs
on my setup.

I  have also tested the game with Enforcer and Mungwall and neither gave
me any errors!

Many  thanks  to  everyone  who  sent  me bug reports, messages and have
helped me with this game!!!!

Please do NOT hack this game and PLEASE do NOT make any trainers for the
game!!!!!!!!!!!!    This will kill both the game and any future projects
that I had in mind!!!!!!!


   A special thanks to Toru Iwatani, for creating PacMan.
