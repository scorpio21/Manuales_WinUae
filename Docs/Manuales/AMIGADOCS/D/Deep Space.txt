	Deep Space is an interstellar adventure encompassing warfare and
	
	exploration.  You take charge of a STRIX fighter, an advanced long
	
	range raider in which you embark on a journey to find fame and
	
	fortune.

	Working for the Agency as a freelance buccaneer you venture forth

	to earn Credits for you daring deeds and with them purchase the
	
	energy and weapons to enable you to tackle some of the most deadly

	adversaries in the known universe.

	Negotiate meteor clusters and storms, clear minefields, steal

	communication satellites from out of their orbits, dog fight with

	Kogon interceptors, encounter the awesome Vexon mothership.  These
	
	and other adventures await in DEEP SPACE.

	Deep Space was produced by Psygnosis in assembly language especially

	for 68000 computers.


		      AGENCY GUIDE FOR FREELANCE OPERATORS

	BRIEFING: Stardate 97-81-24

	Following the recent antics of certain persons all operators must

	note that the agency will under no circumstances tolerate the
	
	following:

	Star Trek groupies.
	
	Do-gooders.
	
	The stranded & impoverished bumming energy drones.
	
	Idiots who burn up skimming fuel from gas giants.

	Anyone who earns too many credits.
	
	Xenophobes.

	Mirfaks.


	Any of the above silly abhorrent aberrations will results in
	
	immediate termination.

	Automatic bounty allocators have now been fitted to all ships.  All

	have been calibrated so any claims for extra credits because of
	
	inaccuracy will not be accepted.  Anti personnel devices have been

	fitted to them so tampering must be a deep philosophical decision

	for anyone contemplating interference.

	Agency scientists can now confirm that the indiscrimate firing of

	QUARK bombs through Stargates into alien systems serves no useful

	purpose as no damage ever appears to be inflicted.  The agency is
	
	therefore not prepared to pay bounties for this feat.

	For those who consider alien observation posts to be easy target

	practice 1500 cedits each, the Agency would hasten to remind you

	that their purpose is observation and they do have sub-ether coms

	links.

	The Agency is currently extremely keen to examine captured aliens.
	
	A bounty of 500 credits will be paid for any specimens.  Operators

	are expected to clean their own scoops.

	Alien satellites are the subject of intense Agency interest.  Bounties

	of 1000 credits will be paid for communication equipment, 2000 credits
	
	for observation equipment and 4000 credits for military hardware.

	Recent reports now indicate that civilised worlds now have this

	technology.

	Alien skirmishers have been messing up the star lanes with mines

	again.  A bounty of 500 credits will be paid for each one destroyed.

	Recent analysis has shown that ramming, whilst being effective is

	not the most efficient method of mine clearance.  The Agency will

	under no circumstances pay extra bounty to those heroes who attempt

	to clear homing mines or those with long-range proximity fuses.

	         __	
	  _______\ \	The Agency recommends that all rookie operatives
	 /\	    \	
	/ /~~~~~~~~\_\	should operate entirely within the Al-Nair system.
	\/__________|
		   \_\	Vexon scout ships are now pretty obsolete in their
			
			weapons technology and carry a bounty of 2500 credits.


		__
	________\ \	An increasing number of Vexon fighters have been
	|\	 ~~\	
	\ \_________\	reported in the Giobek system and some even in the
	 \|________\_\	
		   \||	Al-Nair system.  It is believed these heavier crafts

			are using a system of disposable fuel pods to increase

			their effective range.  Vexon fighter ships are worth

			5000 credits each to the Agency.
	
	
	    __		A number of Vexon Killer class ships found operating
	   /\_\
	  /\/_/-------\	in the Kogon system have been found to be fitted
	 /\/_/--------->
	 \/_/---------/	with anti-matter screens.  This class of craft is

			only surpased by interceptor class star ships
              ____		
      _______/\___\|	which have so far not ventured beyond the Inogal
     /\________\___\|
     \/________|\___\	system.  Killer class ships are worth 7500 while
	       \|___|
		  \_\	Interceptors earn a bounty of 10000 credits.


	Loses of Agency operatives haas been highest amongst those who have

	penetrated the Vexon system.  It is believed that the Vexon have

	finally perfect their much heralded mothership.  Destruction of this

	vessel will be rewarded with 250,000 Credits bounty.  Our scientists

	assure us that the new QUARK bombs are capable of demolishing

	planetary bodies and so this fabled edifice should be no problem
	
	(once it is reached).


		
			      STRIX FIGHTER	

 			    INSTRUCTIONS MANUAL


	The STRIX fighter is a deep space raider produced specifically for

	long range seek & destroy operations.  It is a highly sophisticated

	craft with many specialised functions which require detailed study

	and practise to ensure success.  This manual is required reading

	for all trainees wishing to gain profficiency in the piloting and

	efficient use of this machine.

	BASIC FAMILIARISATION

	The system console is devided into several main sections each with a

	major functional use.

MISSON CLOCK (F)
	
	+----------+	The mission clock shows a readout of mission

	+----------+	elapsed time.


ACTIVATING CONSOLE SWITCHES

	Console buttons and switches may in all cases be activated by
	
	moving the mouse pointer over them and depressing the left

	hand button on the mouse.  A successful activation will then

	always be indicated by a change in the colour or the graphics

	of the button.  All buttons also have keyboard equivalents.  The

	table at the end of this manual gives a complete list of key to

	command mappings.  


ALERTS AND MESSAGES

	Messages from the ship which are of such importance that they may

	require your attention are imaged on the status display.  An

	audible warning will announce their presence.  The small square 

	underneath gives an indication of the importance of the messages:
	
	red for "urgent", yellow for "may require action" and green for

	"information which may be of interest".  The readout below this

	is the ships master energy display.  If this ever reaches zero
	
	the ship will cease to function and will self destruct.  

	
	+---------+	The communications computer, which is selected by
	| ## #### |	
	| #### ## |	pressing the central button on the bottom row of
	| ####### |
	| ### ### |	an activated ships computer console, will always give
	+---------+
	an expanded explanation of status messages as well as any extra
	
	information that is not deemed appropriate to be presented on the
	
	status display.


MOVEMENT

	Movement of the STRIX fighter may be accomplished in any one of three

	ways.  Using the mouse you simply move the pointer over the graphic

	of the control column in the direction toward which movement is

	desired i.e. left moves the ship left and up moves the ship up.

		Movement with a joystick is a case of pushing the stick in
	
	the direction required.  The joysticks only function is to fire

	weapons or change direction and may be used in parallel with the

	mouse and/or keyboard.

		Movement from your computer keyboard is accomplished using

	the arrow (cursor) keys.  Press the key which corresponds to the

	direction in which you wish to move.

		In all cases the longer you hold a directional change the

	faster your ship will move in that direction.  Providing the ship

	has forward momentum of the control column will always alter the

	direction of motion (not just the display window).

	
	+----------+	It is posible to detach the viewing window from the
	|   /___\  |	
	| / |	| \|	direction of motion and look in other directions 
	| \ |___| /|
	|   \   /  |	whilst not disturbing that motion.  To achieve this
	+----------+
			press the top-left button on the pod.  When it locks

	and the button changes colour, viewing direction will be independent

	of motional direction.  You may now look around without disturbing

	and course which has been set.  Clicking the pod button off will

	immediately return the window to looking along the direction of 

	motion.  This operation may also be obtained with the keyboard key

	+----------+	"W".  A further option which is useful in combat
	| +-----\  |
	| | +---/  |	situations is the 'rear-view' button located in the
	| | |____  |
	| +______| |	button right position of the pod.  When activated
	+----------+
			the window is automatically freed and instantly

	swung round to point directly away from the current direction of

	motion.  The 'BACKSPACE' key will also activate the function.


SPEED CONTROL

	Speed is controlled using the Thrust lever to the left of the centre

	console.  Downward movement of this lever causes deceleration,
	
	upward movement acceleration.  The display above the level has eight
	
	lights showing graphically the amount of the acceleration/deceleration

	being applied and a sliding bar which registers current velocity.

		To move the lever simply move the mouse pointer over the lever

	and depress the left button.  Whilst keeping the button held down move

	the mouse in the desired direction - up for acceleration and down for

	deceleration.
	
		Alternatively the keyboard may be used.  The key labeled

	'RETURN' is equivalent to up movement whilst the key underneath will

	cause downwards movement of the lever.

	+----------+	The shpip can be stopped quickly by pressing the
	|  /|--    |
	| / | |___ |	retro thrust button on the pod.  This requires twice
	| \ |----| |
	|  \|      |	as much energy as using the thrust level but is far
	+----------+  
			faster at killing the ships motion.


NAVIGATION
	
	Navigation uses two special computer functions.  The long range map 
	
	the navigation computer.  The map shows all large objects within

	the confines of the navigable system and their spatial relationships

	with regards to your ships.  It also allows a specific location to

	be pin pointed.  The navigation computer then displays graphical

	information to help find this location.

	+----------+	The long range map is activated by pressing the
	| ##    ## |
	|    ##    |	ship's computer's top left button whilst it is 
	|    ##    |
	| ##    ## |	switched on.  Two screens will now be visible
	+----------+
			framed by a green border.  Each screen shows the

	same data but from a different viewpoint.  Your position is

	indicated by a white square in the centre of both screens.

		The leftmost screen is imaged as if looking down on your

	ship from a great height i.e. objects in from of you are towards

	the top of the screen, objects to your left are on the left of the

	screen.  There is no indication of above/below on this screen.  The

	other screen shows your ship from behind, with above being towards

	the top of the screen and left being to the left of the screen.

	All large objects are displayed as dots and positions are updated

	in real-time.  As your ship moves and changed direction the dots

	follow suit.  The meaning of the dots is:

	Yellow				The systems Sun
	
	Shimmering colour		Stargates

	Pale Red			Alien mother-ship

	Dark Red			Alien space-ship

	White				Alien observation post

	Pale Blue			Planet

	Dark Blue			Planetary moon

	Dark Green			Energy Drone

	Green				Repair Drone

	Pale Green			QUARK Drone

	Black				Alien missile

	There is also a small white cross displayed.  This is the destination

	point for the navigation computer.  Clicking in either screen with

	your mouse moves this cross.  Click in the left screen to set its

	left/right front/back position and in the right screen to set its

	up/down left/right position.

	+----/\----+	The navigation computer is selected by pressing
	|  /#  #\  |
	| /      \ |	the computers top right button.  This displays
	| \      / |
	|  \#  #/  |	a screen with two important components both of
	+----\/----+
			which are to help reach the destination reach the

	destination point set with the long range map.

	On the left is an indication of the distance to the point plus

	an estimate of the energy units required to reach the point.  On

	the right are a series of squares.  The course you are steering is

	correct when all squares line up perfectly.  Your destination is

	reached when all squares are the same size.  The normal colour of

	the squares is yellow but if your destination is behind you then they

	will be red.  The exact course to steer is marked most accurately

	by the smallest square which should be followed i.e. if it is to

	the left then you should steer left.

SCANNERS

	+----/\----+	The Short Range Scanners are activated by pressing
	|   /  \   |
	|  /_  _\  |	the up-arrow button on the right side of the pod.
	|   |  |   |
	|   |__|   |	This will cause a screen to rise.  The scanners
	+----------+	
			will not be active unless one of the range buttons

	(labelled 1-5 underneath) is also selected.  The scanners may be

	de-activated by pressing the same button (now a down arrow) again.

		The range of the scan is selected by the buttons (labelled

	1-5) which are located underneath the scanner screen with one

	 being the lowest and five the highest range.  Each increase in

	range doubles the effective area which is scanned and doubles the

	scanners energy consumption.

	The scanner screen shows a cube with your ships position signified by

	a central white dot.  The scan is imaged looking forwards.  Any

	large object within scanning range will be represented within this

	cube by a stalk with a dot on top.  The dot is the object whilst

	the stalk gives an indication of depth by the position itt joins the

	floors of the scanner.  All scanned objects have their positions

	updated in real time.


DEEP SPACE REFUELLING

	Deep Space refuelling of a STRIX fighter is most easily accomplished

	through the use of automatic drones.  Three types are available and

	can be ordered using the ships computer.

 	An energy drone carries 25000 units of energy.

	A repair drone carries all need spare parts to repair or replace any

	vital ship functions which may have become damaged or destroyed.  It

	also carries 10 missiles which automatically replenish ships board

	stocks.

	A QUARK drone carries 2 QUARK bombs.  This is the only way to gain

	possession of such weapons.

	These drones have to be purchased from the agency who will then

	dispatch them on auto-pilot providing that you have enough credits

	for the purchase.

	+----------+	Drones are ordered through the computer by pressing
	|  /~~~~\  |
	| | |~~| | |	the left most button of the computer console whilst
	| | |__| | |
	|  \____/  |	the computer is activated.  The display shows your
	+----------+
			current credit rating with the agency.  To order
	
	select the type of drone you require by clicking with the mouse on

	the required line until it is highlighted.  Then click on the order

	line.  If you have the required credits the cost will be debited

	from your account and the drone will be despatched.  You must then

	use your scoops to retrieve it.

	The drone will travel to the location you occupied when you ordered

	it.  The time the drone takes to reach this position and its cost in

	credits are directly proportional to the number of Stargates it

	must traverse to reach this position.

	For any impoverished and fueless pilot there is another option which

	can be taken to replenish energy stocks.  This involves scooping

	the surface of any nearby gaseous star.   This process is hazardous

	in the extreme and totally beyond description.


AUTO SCOOPS

	+----------+	To retrieve objects from space the auto scoops must
	| # # # #  |
	|  # # # # |	be used.  To activate, first turn on the ship's
	| # # # #  |
	|  # # # # |	computer and then select the second button from the
	+----------+
			left on the top row.  The screen will show an image

	with your STRIX fighter in the centre.  The yellow square underneath

	is a representation of your extended scoop.  All objects in the

	vicinity will now register their location on this screen.  The nearer

	the object is the whiter it will be.  Only objects in front of you will

	register.

	With the scoops extended satellites, drones and even life forms may

	be taken within your ship by ensuring that their image falls within

	the yellow square whilst it is at its whitest.  The scoop will then

	automatically detect their presence and tractor beams will draw them

	in.

	The scoop's imaging system is also a very good aid for negotiating

	meteor clusters, mine fields and for dodging enemy fire.


WEAPONRY

	Your shields are your most important aid to staying alive.  Without

	them you will take massive damage and possibly be destroyed by an

	enemy weapon.  The shields absorb energy and so will protect you

	from individual hits from energy weapons but they can be overloaded

	by multiple strikes in a short space of time.

	+----------+	The shields may be switched on by pressing the centre
	| /------\ |
	| | #    | |	right button on the pod.  Unless they are destroyed
	| | #### | |
	| \______/ |	they will automatically repair themselves over a
	+----------+
			period of time.  Shields are heavily energy intesive

	whilst in operation and will draw large amounts of extra energy to

	deflect potential impacts.

	+----------+	Normally standard Pulse weaponry is selected.  The
	|          |
	| ##       |	only limit to how often they are used is again the
	|   ###### |
	| ##       |	amount of energy you have in store.  They are however
	+----------+
			of limited effectiveness against shielded ships

	requiring multiple hits to break down their shields.  Missiles which

	are selected by the centre left button on the pod have far longer
	
	+----------+	ranges and can pierce shields.  The QUARK bombs are 
	|          |
	| # ####   |	the only things able to pierce the shields of alien
	|  ######  |
	| # ####   |	motherships.  QUARKs are selected by activating
	+----------+
			the lower left button on the Pod.  Weapons are fired

	with the right mouse button, the keyboard space bar or the joystick

	button.


BATTLE DAMAGE

	Whenever damage is inflicted upon your ship the damage control

	computer will use energy to protect vital areas at the expense of

	others.  The shields will absorb whatever energy they can if they

	are active and not destroyed.  The damage allocator then allocates

	damage in the following order - scanners, computer, pulse weapons

	engines.

	+----------+	A visual indication of the ships status may be
	| -------- |
	| |_O  O_| |	obtained by activating the right most button on the
	| = |__| = |
	| =      = |	bottom row of the computer console whilst the computer
	+----------+
			is on.  The display shows each major area of the ship

	and it's percentage functionality.  100% means perfect working order.

	Generally things are regarded as damaged and not to be trusted as

	reliable when their effectiveness drops below 50%.  Also shown are

	weapon quantities and current energy consumption.


ENERGY USAGE

	All ship functions require energy.  Without it your ship will perish.

	Energy is used by your ship in the following way:

	Basic ship functions			- 10 units per second

	Shields on				- 15 units per second

	Pulse weapons				- 30 units per firing

	Acceleration/deceleration		- 5* rate (1-8) units per sec

	Scanners				- 10 units per second if on
	
	Scanner ranged				- 5* range (1-5) per second

	Computer				- 5 units per second if on
		
	Map computer				- 20 units per second
	
	Scoop computer				- 10 units per second

	Navigation computer			- 5 units per second

	Drone computer				- 10 units per second

	Comms computer				- 10 units per second

	Status computer				- 5 units per second

	Stargate Entry				- 50000 units per passage

	Remember also that any damage inflicted will also use energy.


KEYBOARD OPTIONS

	All ship control functions may be controlled directly from the

	keyboard.  The following table summarises the keys to use.
