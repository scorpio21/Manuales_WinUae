FIRST POINT:
************

	I'd like to say that "dragon's pyramids" is 100% freeware,feel free
to copy it for your own  DP packages,or other,but you MUST include this
doc with.
The only contribution i ask for is one of the following little thing:
		
			- All AGA demos are welcome
			- ALL DP utils and GAMES 
			- Everything progs,libs,docs about AMOS PRO or BLITZ2
		        - any graphics,sound,modules that can help me for
			  my futur games

IMPORTANT!!!
	I 'm searching for an AGA extention for Amospro 2.0 and
	for the OS Devkit extention.



So if you want to get in touch with me (bugs report or other) Email me

THE GAME:
*********
	
	I know, another clone of shangai,dragon tiles and so on...
Well,in fact i wasn't satisfied of this two versions because the first one
was pretty cool but only allow one pyramid to be resolved.
And the second one didn't have a timer option and I didn't like the selection
of the tiles (no way to deselect a tile,no enlightement etc...)
So i decided to code a new one including the best of this two games
that means:
		- selection of the two tiles with enlightement !
		- deselection allowed (right mouse button)
		- timer included
		- a different color for each level of the pyramid
		  (from dragon tiles)
		- a restart function (again from DT)
		- a moves function that show you any other possible moves
and finally i have coded a challenge option that allow you to try futher
		pyramids before you run out of time.

THE RULES:
**********
	Rather simple: you must click on two tiles that match (same symbol)
and these two tiles must have at least a side free (no other tiles at the 
left or the rigth of the tile choosen).you can take it at any level of
the pyramid.
you win the game if you have match together all tiles (no tiles remaining)
other way ,if you can't play a move then you'll have to restart or try
a new pyramid.

THE OPTIONS:
************
	SOLITARY select this option when you want to play one pyramid at
a time.You can select the pyramid you want and a time (or not) to resolve
it .
	CHALLENGE choose one of the 3 challenges available and try to 
finish them before you run out of time !

THE END:
********

well this is v1.0 of the game and i don't plane to release an other 
version .
So,if you find bugs, or if you have general comments or new ideas for the
game let me know and i'll do my best to improve dragon's pyramids.

have fun !!!
