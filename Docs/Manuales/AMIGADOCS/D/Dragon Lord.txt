                DRAGON LORD  SPELL BOOK and CODES

        

        INTRODUCTION                                                                  
     This Spell Book gives you instructions for mixing the                            
    ingredients that let you cast spells.  Each ingredient has a                      
    specific effect.  Combined in particular ways with other                          
    ingredients, this effect can be modified or altered.                              
     Included here are descriptions of the ingredients and what                       
    they can do, basic theory of spell-casting, a summary of spell                    
    effects, and some sample spells to get you started.                               
     Spell-casting is a mysterious and inexact science tat may                        
    take some time to master.  So gather your exotic ingredients,                     
    hide yourself in your secret Spell Room, and experiment with                      
    some of the most fascinating recipes in the annals of alchemy.                    

       MAGIC STOCK                                                                    

     You begin Dragon Lord with a store of plants, minerals, and                      
    liquids native to the land of Anrea.  Your stock book provides a 
    written inventory of the ingredients you have on hand at any                     
    given time, plus descriptions of the most common ingredients and  
    a summary of their main effects. 
     As you use up the ingredients, you need to replace them.  A 
    trader occasionally appears, offering a selcetion of magic                        
    ingredents at market prices.  Naturally, the moree money you                      
    have, the more you can afford the higher prices on the rarer                      
    items.  Some rare items are not always available (or are out of                   
    your price range), so you'll have to experiment to find                           
    substitutes.                                                                      

       SPELL TARGET                                                                   

     Before you enter the Spell Room, you must choose the target                      
    of your spell.                                                                    
     At the bottom of the screen, where you view your individual                      
    dragons, is a crystal ball icon that lets you cast spells on                      
    dragons. A crystal ball at the bottom of an egg incubation screen                 
    lets you cast spells on the eggs.                                                 
     To select a village as your target, click on the village on the                  
    Detail Map, then click the crystal ball beneath the village screen.               
    To cast a spell on your character to increase money and egg                       
    supplies, click on the crystal ball in the Castle Screen.                         
     Once you've selected your target, you automatically enter the                    
    Spell Room.                                                                       
                               (1)                                                    


       SPELL ROOM                                                                     

     The shelves in the Spell Room are lined with magic                               
    ingredients.  Move the cursor over the bottle on the shelf to see the             
    name and quantity of its contents.                                                
     From left to right,                                                              
    the alchemist's tools                                                             
    are designed for                                                                  
    cutting, grinding,                                                                
    mixing, and adding as                                                             
    "normal".                                                                         
     Beneath these is a                                                               
    Bunsen burner.  Turn it                                                           
    on by clicking the ring                                                           
    just above the base, and                                                          
    increase the flame by                                                             
    moving the cursor                                                                 
    upward.  To adjust the condenser, click on the knob below the                     
    spherical bowl and move the cursor up to increase and down to                     
    decrease (notice the change in the horizontal pipe as you do this).               
     Adjust the Bunsen burner abd condenser, then click on the                        
    desired ingredient's container.  Move the container to the                        
    appropiate alchemist's tool and click to insert a measure.  You'll                
    have to reconsider the burner and condenser settings every time                   
    you add an ingredient.  Click anywhere on the shelves to return                   
    the container.                                                                    
     Be careful when mixing spells.  If the mixture is too potent, it                 
    explodes! If this happens, you loose your ingredients and it takes a              
    month for your equipment to be repaired (no spell-mixing until                    
    the tools are fixed).                                                             
     To cast the mixed spell, click on the arrow icon.  If you                        
    change your mind about casting, click on the cross (you'll lose the               
    ingredients you've mixed).                                                        
                                                                                      

        SPELL THEORY                                                                  

     All ingredients are divided into two categories - Directors                      
    and Affectors.  You must have both for a spell to work.                           
     Directors are ingredients that "direct" power at your target                     
    (dragon,egg,human, or village).                                                   
     Affectors are ingredients that "affect" an attribute of the                      
    target (combat,disease,growth,mind,power,sense, or speed).                        
                              (2)                                                     
                                                                                      

     Each element can have more than one effect, depending on the                     
    preparation method.                                                               
     Many ingredients have more than one effect.  Most ingredients                    
    also have lesser side-effects, which may or may not be                            
    beneficial, depending on your purpose.  It may be possible to                     
    increase or counteract these side effects by using a different                    
    method of including the ingredient or by adding another                           
    ingredient.                                                                       
     There is no limit on the number of ingredients you can include                   
    in your spell.  However, try not to make a spell too complex, since               
    you still have to deal with all those side-effects.  Also, a too-                 
    potent mixture will explode.  To get the best effects, use varying                
    quantities of each ingredient.                                                    
     The power level of each ingredient varies depending on the                       
    method used in adding it to the brew (mixing,grinding,cutting, or                 
    normal).  Some elements are used specifically for increasing or                   
    decreasing a spell's power.  For example, you combine a Director                  
    and an Affector to increase a village population; adding a third                  
    ingredient with a strong positive power can increase the                          
    population by a much larger amount.                                               
     If you need to use several ingredients that, together, are too                   
    potent, you can use yet another ingredient with a strong negative                 
    power to decrease the spell's effect (don't forget about side-                    
    effects when doing this).                                                         
                                                                                      

         SPELL EFFECT SUMMARY                                                         

     This chart is a quick guide to the magic properties of all the                   
    ingredients.  The left side of the chart names the ingredients; the               
    top of the chart shows the effects, subdivided into Directors and                 
    Affectors.                                                                        
     In the body of the Spell Effect Summary chart, plus and minus                    
    signs indicate the positive and negative effects of the                           
    ingredients in each effect category.  This chart represents the                   
    strongest effects the ingredient has, but doesn't show the                        
    relative power of each item, how to mix it, or its subtle side-                   
    effects.  These details are in the Spell Effect Tables.                           
     It's important to tunderstand what is meant by positive and                      
    negative effects.  For example, a positive Disease Affector                       
    causes disease; a negative Diesease Affector reduces disease. A                   
    positive Growth Affector enhances growth; a negative Growth                       
    Affector retards growth.                                                          
                            (3)                                                       
                                                                                      

     Notice on the Spell Effect Summary chart that all the noted                      
    Directors effects are positive - this means that any ingredient                   
    with a positive Director effect can be used to direct the spell at                
    that particular target.  for example, Rasgon is positive for both                 
    Dragons and Eggs.  Therefore, if you were casting a spell on                      
    either target, Rasgon is one possible ingredient for directing that               
    spell.

         SPELL EFFECT TABLES                                                          

     The large fold-out chart contains the Spell Effect Tables.                       
    These tables show you how to use the magic ingredients and what                   
    results you're likely to get.                                                     
     The first section, the key to Spell Effect Tables, is a guide                    
    that briefly explains the symbols in the chart.                                   
     The next four sections are the Director Effect Tables,                           
    followed by the seven Affector Effect Tables. A blank circle on a                 
    Table indicates there is no known effect of this ingredient in this               
    particular area.                                                                  
     Each spell ingredient is represented in the tables by a circle.                  
    The circles representing usable ingredients are divided into four                 
    quadrants, with a smaller circle in the center.  The top left                     
    quadrant show the effect of adding an ingredient as "normal".                     
    The bottom left quadrant shows the effect of grinding the                         
    ingredient.  Top right shows the effect of cutting, and bottom                    
    right shows the effect of mixing the ingredient.  The area inside                 
    the smaller circle is the negative area; the area between the                     
    inner circle and the outer edge is the positve area.                              
     A square in the quadrant shows the degree of effect that will be                 
    achieved by that method of preparation.  If no square is shown,                   
    there would be no effect.  The closer a square is to the center of                
    the inner circle, the more negative the effect; the closer to the                 
    outer circumference, the more the positive the effect.                            
     Triangles on the vertical axis show the degree of positive or                    
    negative effect when you use the Bunsen burner to heat the                        
    ingredient.  The closer the triangles are to the circumference, the               
    more positive the effect.                                                         
     Small circles on the horizonal axis show the degree of                           
    positive or negative effect when you use the condenser to cool                    
    the ingredient.  The closer the circles are to the circumference,                 
    the more positive the effect.                                                     
     For more explanation  of positive and negative effects, see                      
    Spell Effect Summary on page 3.                                                   
     If you use the Bunsen burner and the condenser at the same                       
    time, keep in mind that one may have a greater effect than the                    
    other or possibly neutralize the effect entirely.  Side-effects                   
    are also posible.                                                                 
                         (5)                                                          
                                                                                      

        A SAMPLE SPELL                                                                

     Below is a step-by-step guide to creating a spell for curing a                   
    diseased dragon.                                                                  

    STEP 1:  Select the sick dragon and click on the crystal ball                     
             icon.  This takes you to the Spell Room.                                 

    STEP 2:  Examine the Dragon Director Effect Table for the most                    
             effective ingredient you have in stock. Rasgon is the                    
             ingredient with a degree marker (square) nearest the                     
             circumference, and therefore, produces the most powerful                 
             positive effect. (if you don't have Rasgon on hand you can               
             substitute Titus, Sals, Magian< Jaluem, Ache or Yasin -                  
             they all have degree markers nearer the center, but still                
             within the positive range; but these are all weaker than                 
             Rasgon and may have undesired side-effects.                              
              Note that Rasgon's degree marker closest to the                         
             circumference is in the grinding quadrant. The Bunsen                    
             marker (triangle) in the positive area shows that heating                
             should maximise the effect.                                              
              Check the grinding quadrant of the Rasgon circles in all                
             the tables and note any side effects. For example on the                 
             Disease Affector table you see that Rasgon has an effect                 
             (the square is in the positive area). This disease side                  
             effect is minimized by heating (shown by the triangle just               
             within the negative area). No significant effects are                    
             indicated on any other tables.                                           
              Now check Rasgon's grinding quadrant in the Power                       
             Affector Effect Table and see that the spell is increased                
             by using the Bunsen burner (indicated by the triangles on                
             the vertical axis in the positive area).                                 
                                                                                      
    STEP 3:  From the Disease Affector Effect Table find an                           
             ingredient with a strong negative effect (a positive effect              
             would increase your dragon's disease!). Fanveer is the                   
             best choice but Mionacal is a good and is more readily                   
             available so use it instead for this sample.                             
              Normal is the most effective quadrant for Mionacal                      
             (where the square is closest to the center and therefore,                
             the most negative), although grinding is a posibility. The               
             small circles on the horizontal axis in the negative sector              
                          (6)                                                         

                                                                                      
             indicate that turning on thecondenser makes the effect                   
             even more negative.                                                      
              Look at the Mionacal circles in the other effect tables                 
             to see that there are no major side-effects but useful                   
             gains in the growth and conbat can be made if you grind                  
             Mionacal instead of adding as normal.                                    
              Check the Power Affector Effect Table to see that                       
             grinding produces slightly positive and condensing                       
             produces slightly negative effects so the overall power                  
             effect is neutralized.                                                   
                                                                                      
    STEP 4:  Boost the spell further by mixing in the Acrus and heating               
             to give a positive power effect (the square in the mixing                
             quadrant is nearest the circumfernce and therefore,                      
             more positive). Check through all the effect tables and                  
             you see that this ingredient is one of the few that has no               
             use other than having a power effect and thus has no side                
             effect for our current purpose.                                          
                                                                                      
    STEP 5:  Go ahead and experiment with this spell. It's best to                    
             use a differing amount of each ingredient to get the best                
             effects from your spells. Don't forget to reset the Bunsen               
             burner and condenser between ingredients as necessary.

     ACRUS  This power magnifier is found mainly in the rockier                       
            regions of Anrea. In its raw form Acrus is a yellow foul-                 
            smelling liquid.                                                          
                                                                                      
     AROLIG  When used on a dragon's wing Arolig provides a strong                    
            increase in flying strength. However an overall muscle                    
            weakening takes place and if over-used couls cause                        
            severe wasting of the dragon's strength. Arolig plants                    
            grow at the edges of cultivated land.                                     
                                                                                      
     AYHE   A raw form of Rasgon (Dragon Wish) Ayhe is washed                         
            down in mountain streams. It has a Weak dragon and                        
            village director power.                                                   
                                                                                      
     CADOAM  Found under rotting vegetation in shaded woods, this                     
            carnivorios mushroom grows rapidly and traps its prey by                  
            hallucinatory sprays. Cadoam improves mind and senses
