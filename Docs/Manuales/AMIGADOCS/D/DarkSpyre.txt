RIGHT BEFORE WE START..THIS GAME HAD 17 PAGES OF TOTAL GARBAGE AT THE START
WHICH I HAVE TOTALLY BYPASSED..IT WAS TWOODLE SO I`VE LEFT IT OUT...

THE TASK AT HAND - DARK SPYRE
-----------------------------
IT HAS BEEN SEVERAL YEARS SINCE THE GREAT BATTLE AT THE `VALLEY OFTEARS`. THE
GODS OF THE 3 WAYS,`WAR`.`MAGIC` AND `INTELLECT` HAVE BROUGHT FORTH FROM THE
ASHEN GROUND `DARKSPYRE`.. THE FINAL TEST OF MANKIND.

NOT A SINGLE CHAMPION HAS RETURNED FROM THE SPIRALLING,STRUCTURE,PORTENDING
THAT NO ONE HAS SUCCEEDED IN PASSING THE TRIALS AND TESTS THAT LIE WITHIN.
SINCE YOUR CHARACTER HAS SHOWN THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY LEARN THE BASIC ARTS OF
MAGIC AND WAR,AND ALSO BEING CLEAR OF MIND,POSSESING A NATURAL TALENT TO THINK
QUICKLY AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS,HE OR SHE IS THE NEXT CHOSEN CHAMPION.

ONCE `DARKSPYRE` IS ENTERED,THE CHAMPION SHOULD THOROUGHLY EXPLORE EACH LEVEL.
CREATURES MUST BE FOUGHT,BOTH WITH -MELEE WEAPONS- AND MAGIC, AND TRAPS MUST BE
ESCAPED. MANY PUZZLES BAR THE CHAMPIONS PATH,ONLY HIS INTELLECT WILL HELP HIM
PASS. TO PROCRESS FROM ONE LEVEL TO ANOTHER, A `GATEWAY` MUST BE FOUND AND
ENTERED. ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL PASSES THROUGH THIS INTERDIMENSIONAL
DOORWAY,THERE`S NO TURNING BACK.

SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE EVER CHANGING HALLS OF `DARKSPYRE`,LIE 5 UNIQUE RUNES OF
POWER.EACH REPRESENTS A SINGLE CHARACTERISTIC IN THE CREATION OF MANKIND...
STRENGTH,AGILITY,ENDURANCE,ACCURACY AND TALENT. ONCE ALL 5 STONES HAVE BEEN
FOUND,IT IS TIME TO ENTER,ONE BY ONE,THE LEVELS OF THE `THREE`. EACH OF WHICH
WAS CREATED BY ONE OF THE GODS,FASHIONED AFTER THE CELESTIAL BEING`S SPECIFIC
SPHERE OF CONTROL. THESE ARE THE FINAL TESTS IN WHICH THE CHAMPION MUST PROVE
THAT E CAN USE THAT WHICH HE LEARNED IN HIS QUEST THROUGH `DARKSPYRE`.

BEFORE ENTERING THE FINAL 3 LEVELS,THE CHARACTER NEEDS THE 5 RUNES TO UNLOCK 5
MAGICAL PORTS,BEHIND EACH,THERE IS A SPECIAL GIFT LEFT BY THE GODS TO AID THE
CHARACTER IN THE FINAL MOMENTS OF THE ADVENTURE. THESE ITEMS POSSESS SUCH
MAGICAL POWER,IT IS BEYOND THE COMPRHESSION OF MOST MORTAL MEN AND WOMEN.

IF NO CHAMPION OVERCOMES `DARKSPYRE` WITHIN THE NEXT 300 YEARS,THE WORLD SHALL
BE DESTROYED BY LIGHTNING AND FIRE,AND A NEW ONE SHALL BE FORMED. THE ERA OF
MANKIND WILL BE NOTHING MORE THAN A BRIEF MEMORY IN THE HISTORY OF TIME.BUT,IF
ONE CAN PROVE MANKIND WORTHY OF EXISTENCE,THE GODS SHALL GRANT UPON THEM THE
GIFT OF LIFE,THE RIGHT TO LIVE WITHOUT THE FURTHER INTERFERENCE OF CELESTIAL
INFLUENCE. THE CHAMPION WHO SUCCEEDS SHALL BE REMEMBERED FOR AGES TO
COME!.THOUGH TIME RUNS SHORT,200 YEARS HAVE PASSED,10 CHAMPIONS HAVE FALLEN,AND
NOW ITS YOUR TURN......

THE CHARACTER - A TALE OF CHAMPIONS -
-------------------------------------
A CHARACTER MUST BE FIRST CREATED BEFORE YOU CAN BEGIN PLAYING THE GAME.INLIKE
MANY OTHER ROLE PLAYING GAMES,THE CHARACTER GENERATOR IN `DARKSPYRE` IS
IMPLEMENTED IN A STORY TELLING FASHION WITH THE CHARACTER YOU ARE CREATING THE
FOCAL POINT OF THE STORY. AS THE STORY UNFOLDS, YOU`RE ASKING QUESTIONS AND
MAKING DECISIONS. THE ANSWERS TO THES DETERMINES THE CHARACTERS
STRENGTHS,WEAKNESSES AND INITIAL CAPABILITIES.

RIGHT OR LEFT HANDED.
---------------------
THROUGHOUT THE GAME,YOU CAN PUT OBJECTS,WEAPONS,SHIELDS ECT...IN BOTH THE
CHARACTERS RIGHT OR LEFT HANDS. FOR THIS REASON,YOUR ASKED IF THE CHARACTER IS
RIGHT OR LEFT HANDED. THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT
SITUATIONS,BECAUSE THE CHARACTER IS ABLE TO WIELD A WEAPON MORE EFFECTIVELY IN
HIS PRE-DOMINAT HAND.

MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS.
---------------------------
A CHARACTER CAN EITHER BE MALE OR FEMALE. THE FEMALE CHARACTER SUFFERS NO
PENALTIES AND ARE TREATED THE SAME AS MALE CHARACTERS,EXCEPT,OF COURSE,FOR THE
GRAPHICS USED WITHIN THE GAME.THE GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF THE CHARACTER WILL
MATCH THE CHOSEN SEX OF THAT CHARACTER.

ATTRIBUTES - THE STUFF CHARACTERS ARE MADE OF.
----------------------------------------------
THERE ARE 6 ATTRIBUTES(ALSO REFERRED TO AS CHARACTERISTICS) SED IN CREATING A
CHARACTER. THROUGHOUT THE GAME,EACH OF THESE ATTRIBUTES PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART
IN HOW THE CHARACTER IS INFLUENCED BY VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. AN ATTRIBUTE CAN
NEVER EXCEED 20, UNLESS BY SOME MAGICAL MEANS. THE ATTRIBUTES ARE:

STRENGTH - THIS ATTRIBUTE REPRESENTS THE CHARACTERS PHYSICAL STRENGTH IT
AFFECTS THINGS SUCH AS:

* THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE INFLICTED BY WEAPONS IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT
* THE INITIAL HIT POINTS THE CHARACTER BEGINS THE GAME WITH
* THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT IN KILOGRAMS THE CHARACTER CAN CARRY WITHOUT BEING
  ENCUMBERED.

AGILITY - THIS CHARACTER DETERMINES HOW QUICKLY AND PROFICENTLY THE CHARACTER
CAN PERFORM AN ACTION. IT PRIMARILY INFLUENCES HOW FAST THE CHARACTER CAN MOVE.

ENDURANCE - THIS IS THE CHARACTERS ABILITY TO PERFORM ACTIONS OVER A LONG
PERIOD OF TIME WITHPOUT BEING TIRED. IT INFLUENCES THINGS SUCH AS:

* HOW MANY HIT POINTS THE CHARACTER BEGINS THE GAME WITH (ALONG WITH STRENGTH)
* HOW LONG THE CHARACTER CAN FIGHT OR PERFORM STRENUOUS ACTIONS,SUCH AS 
  CARRYING EXCESSIVE WEIGHT,WITHOUT EXPERIENCING FATIGUE.

TALENT - THIS IS THE CHARACTERS NATURAL BORN ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE WORKINGS
         OF MAGIC AND CASTING SPELLS. A TALENTED CHARACTER CAN LEARN SPELLS
         AND READSCROLLS MUCH QUICKER THAN THOSE WHO ARE NOT AS TALENTED.

POWER - THIS ATTRIBUTE REPRESENTS HOW EFFECTIVELY THE CHARACTER CAN CAST
        SPELLS. A HIGHER SPELL POWER RATING MEANS THE CHARACTER IS CAPABLE OF
        CASTING MORE POWERFUL AND LONGER LASTING SPELLS.

ROLLING THE DICE - GENERATING ATTRIBUTES.
-----------------------------------------
THERE ARE SEVERAL METHODS OF GENERATING YOUR CHARACTERISTICS,YOU ARE ABLE TO
CHOOSE THE METHOD THAT BEST SUITS YOUR PREFERENCES. THE VARIOUS METHODS ARE:

METHOD 1 (THE QUICK METHOD) - ALL THE NUMBERS ARE GENERATED AND ASSIGNED TO THE
ATTRIBUTES BY THE COMPUTER. ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE FASTEST METHOD OF GENERATING
CHARACTERISTICS, IT OFFERS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF CONTROL.

METHOD 2 (THE ASSIGN METHOD) - A POOL OF POINTS IS GENERATED. THESE POINTS CAN
THEN BE ASSIGNED TO THE ATTRIBUTES IN ANY FASHION,UNTIL THE POOL IS EXHAUSTED.
A SINGLE ATTRIBUTE CANNOT BE ASSIGNED MORE THAN 20 POINTS. THIS METHOD ALLOWS
COMPLETE CONTROL OVER SETTING UP THE ATTRIBUTES, BUT DOESNT PRODUCE THE RARE
EXCEPTIONAL CHARACTERS THAT ARE SOMETIMES GENERATED IN `METHOD 1`.

METHOD 3 (THE BASE ASSIGN METHOD) - THIS METHOD IS A COMBINATION OF METHODS 1
AND 2. THE COMPUTER GENERATES AND ASSIGNS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF POINTS TO THE
ATTRIBUTES,AS WELL AS GENERATING A SMALLER POOL OF POINTS. THE POOL OF POINTS
CAN THEN BE ASSIGNED TO THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE PLAYER.

QUICKSTART CHARACTERS.
----------------------
THOUGH MANY GAME PLAYERS ENJOY THE PROCESS OF CREATING THEIR OWN
CHARACTERS,THERE ARE THOSE THAT VIEW THIS PROCESS AS A DELAY FROM GETTING
IMMEDIATELY INVOLVED IN THE GAME.FOR THIS REASON,YOU CAN OPT TO BYPASS THE
CHARACTER GENERATOR,AND PLAY THE GAME WITH A CHAMPION THATS INSTANTLY CREATED
BY THE COMPUTER. THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS GIVE THY CHAMPION A NAME.

WEAPON PROFICIENCIES AND MAGIC SKILL CLASSES.
---------------------------------------------
ONCE THE CHARACTERS ATTRIBUTES HAVE BEEN GENERATED,YOU MUST THEN CHOOSE AN
INITIAL MAGIC SKILL CLASS. AN INITIAL WEAPON PROFICIENCY CLASS IS RANDOMLY
ASSIGNED TO THE CHARACTER BY THE COMPUTER. WEAPON PROFICIENCY CLASSES REPRESENT
HOW SKILLED THE CHARACTER IS IN USING A WEAPON FROM THAT CLASS.
THE MORE A CHARACTER USES A WEAPON,THE BETTER HE BECOMES AT USING WEAPONS FROM
THAT SPECIFIC PROFICIENCY CLASS. IT PROBABLY ISNT A GOOD IDEA TO RELY HEAVILY
ON A SINGLE CLASS OF WEAPONS. YOU MAY FIND AT LATER STAGES IN THE GAME,THAT THE
CHAMPION HAS LOST HIS PREFERRED WEAPON OR IT HAS BROCKEN, AND THERE ARE NO
WEAPONS CLOSE BY THAT EXIST IN THAT CLASS.
YOU WOULD THEN FIND THE CHARACTER USING A WEAPON THAT HE`S NOT VERY SKILLED AT
WIELDING. THE WEAPON PROFICIENCY CLASSES IN THE GAME ARE:

2 HANDED WEAPONS - IT REQUIRES BOTH HANDS TO WIELD THE WEAPONS FROM THIS CLASS.
THEY ARE LARGER AND HEAVIER WEAPONS CAPABLE OF DOING MORE DAMAGE THAN SMALLER
AND LIGHTER WEAPONS, SOME EXAMPLES ARE THE `CLAYMORE` OR `GREAT SCYTHE`

LONG EDGED WEAPONS - THESE ARE VARIOUS SWORDS THAT REQUIRE ONLY 1 HAND TO
WIELD.SOME WEAPONS IN THIS CLASS ARE THE LONGSWORD AND SCIMITAR.

SHORT EDGED WEAPONS - WEAPONS FROM THIS CLASS ARE ALSO SWORDS,BUT THEY ARE
SOMEWHAT SHORTER,LIGHTER,AND SMALLER THAN THIER LONG EDGED COUNTERPARTS. SOME
EXAMPLES ARE THE `SHORT SWORD` AND `DAGGER`.

CLUBBING AND HACKING WEAPONS - MEMBERS OF THIS CLASS ARE USED BY SWINGING OR
CLUBBING AT THE ENEMY. SOME EXAMPLES ARE THE `WAR AXE` AND MACE`.

POLE ARMS - THIS CLASS INCLUDES ALL THRUSTING WEAPONS SUCH AS THE `SPEAR` OR
`TRIDENT`. WEAPONS FROM THIS CLASS ALSO REQUIRE BOTH OF THE CHARACTERS HANDS.

SMALL THROWN WEAPONS - THESE ARE WEAPONS SUCH AS THE `THROWING KNIFE` OR
`THROWING AXE`, WHICH ARE NOT MEANT TO BE USED IN CLOSE QUARTERS COMBAT. THEY
ARE EXTREMELY BALANCED AND INTENDED TO BE HURLED AT AN OPPONENT.

PROJECTILE WEAPONS -  THIS PROFICIENCY CLASS REPRESENTS ALL WEAPONS THAT SHOOT
A PROJECTILE,SUCH AS THE `LIGHT CROSSBOW`.

TO AVOID HAVING A GREAT NUMBER OF FAIRLY USELESS SPELLS BY THE END OF THE
GAME,`DARKSPYRE` ARE SET UP IN A TIERED FORMAT. THIS MEANS THAT AS A CHARACTER
INCREASES IN SKILL AT USING A SPECIFIC TYPE OF MAGIC,THE SPELL IN THAT MAGICAL
CLASS TRANSFORMS INTO A MORE USEFUL VERSION OF THE SAME BASIC SPELL. THERE ARE
6 DIFFERENT TYPES OF MAGIC THE CHARACTER HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL,THESE ARE:

WIZARDRY - THESE ARE OFFENSIVE SPELLS THAT A CHARACTER CAN USE TO ATTACK HIS
ENEMIES.

CONJURATION - THESE ARE SPELLS USED TO SUMMON THE AID OF OTHER WORLDLY BEINGS
AND CREATURES.

ENCHANTMENT - THESE ARE PROTECTIVE SPELLS THE CHARACTER CAN USE IN HIS/HER
DEFENSE.

HEALING - SPELLS FROM THIS CLASS ARE USED TO HEAL WOUNDS AND RESTORE LOST
ABILITIES OR LESSENED ATTRIBUTES.

DIVINATION - THESE ARE INFORMATIVE SPELLS THAT HELP THE CHARACTER DURING THE
TESTS AND TRIALS OF `DARKSPYRE`

SORCERY - THESE ARE MISCELLANEOUS SPELLS THAT EFFECT THE OBJECTS AND ENVIROMENT
SURROUDING THE CHARACTER.

HIT POINTS.
-----------
THE CHARACTER IS GIVEN AN INITIAL AMOUNT OF HIT POINTS. HIT POINTS REPRESENT
THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE THE CHARACTERS CAN SUBSTAIN IN COMBAT. ONCE THE CHARACTERS
HIT POINTS REACH ZERO (0) HE HAS DIED. THE CHARACTERS BEGINNING NUMBER OF
POINTS ARE CALCULATED BY ADDING HIS `STRENGTH` AND `ENDURANCE` POINTS PLUS A
RANDOM NUMBER.

* STRENGTH + ENDURANCE + RANDOM NUMBER = HIT POINTS.

THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE GAME,THE CHARACTER WILL FIND WAYS TO BOTH
PERMANTLY AND TEMPORARILY INCREASE HIS HIT POINTS.

SPELL POWER POINTS.
-------------------
A SECOND RATING THE CHARACTER IS GIVEN,IS SPELL POINTS, SPELL POINTS REPRESENT
THE AMOUNT OF MAGICAL ENERGY THE CHARACTER CAN CURRENTLY EXPEND. EACH TIME A
SPELL IS CAST, IT WILL DRAIN A PORTION OF THE CHARACTERS SPELL POINTS. IF THE
CHARACTER DOENT HAVE THE PROPER AMOUNT NEEDED TO CAST A SPELL, THEN THE SPELL
CANNOT BE USED. THE AMOUNT OF SPELL POINTS REQUIRED TO CAST A SPELL VARIES
GREATLY, AND DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF SPELL AND AT WHAT MAGIC SKILL LEVEL IS
BEING CAST AT. INITIAL SPELL POINTS ARE GENERATED BY ADDING THE CHARACTERS
`TALENT` AND `POWER` PLUS A RANDOM NUMBER.

* TALENT + POWER + RANDOM NUMBER = SPELL POINTS.

THE CHARACTER WILL FIND WAYS IN THE GAME TO TEMPORARILY INCREASE HIS SPELL
POINTS, SPELL POINTS CAN NEVER EXCEED 100, NOT EVEN THROUGH THE USE OF MAGIC.

ONCE YOU HAVE COMPLETED GENERATING YOUR CHARACTER, IT IS TIME TO BEGIN THE
GAME. THE BST OF LUCK!.

ARMOUR,SHIELDS AND HELMETS.
---------------------------
WHILE EXPLORING `DARKSPYRE`,YOU WILL FIND IT NECESSARY TO EQUIP THE CHARACTER
WITH THE VARIOUS TYPES OF ARMOUR SCATTERED THROUGH OUT `DARKSPYRE`. FROM SIMPLE
ANIMAL FURS,TO ELABORATE SUITS OF FINELY CRAFTED PLATE MAIL,ARMOUR SUSTAINS
DAMAGE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE INFLICTED UPON THE CHARACTER. NOTE: ARMOUR IN NO
WAY EFFECTS THE OPPONENTS CHANCE OF HITTING OR MISSING THE CHARACTER WITH AN
ATTACK.

AS ARMOUR BECOMES MORE AND MORE BATTLE WORN,IT BECOMES LESS EFFECTIVE AS ITS
PROMARY PURPOSE.`PROTECTION`. SOME ARMOUR TYPES CAN BE REDUCED TO AN ALMOST
USELESS STATE,WHEREAS PLATE MAIL,THOUGH BEATEN AND BATTERED,ALWAYS OFFERS A
CERTAIN DEGREE OF PROTECTION.

A DESCRIPTIVE ARMOUR RATING SYSTEM IS PROVIDED THAT ENABLES YOU TO DETERMINE
THE PROTECTIVE VALUE OF THE ARMOUR THE CHARACTER IS WEARING. THIS RATING IS
DISPLAYED WITH THE NAME OF THE ARMOUR WHEN IT IS DISPLAYED ON THE CHARACTER
SCREEN. THE RATINGS, FROM THE LEAST EFFECTIVE TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE ARMOUR
PROTECTION,ARE:

1) UNARMOURED...2) WELL CLAD...3)SAFE GUARDED...4) WELL PROTECTED...5)STOUTLY
CLAD...6) RUGGED...7) MIGHTY...8) SHIELDED...9) REINFORCED...10) FORTIFIED
11) IRON CLAD... 12) STEEL PLATED...13) UNYEILDING...14) IMPERVIOUS...
15) INVINCIBLE

VARIOUS HELMETS AND SHIELDS CAN ALSO BE DISCOVERED. WHEN DONNED BY THE
CHARACTER, THEY OFFER ADDED PROTECTION AGAINST ATTACKS. A SHIELD CAN EVEN BE
USED AS WOULD A CLUBBING WEAPON IN HAND TO HAND COMBAT. THE MOST DEADLY VARIETY
OF THESE ARE ADORNED WITH ARMOUR PIERCING SPIKES, AND ARE LARGE AND OF GREAT
WEIGHT.SHIELDS,LIKE ARMOUR,BECOME WEAKENED THROUGH CONTINUOUS USE, WHILE THE
STURDIER VARIETIES OFFER MORE PROTECTION,THEY CAN ALSO WITHSTAND MORE ABUSE.
HELMETS ONLY PROVIDE MINIMAL PROTECTION,AND EVEN WHEN BEATEN AND DENTED,ALWWAYS
PROVIDE THAT SMALL AMOUNT OF ADDED PROTECTION.

THE WEAPONS OF WAR.
-------------------
ALL OF THE WEAPONS IN THE GAME OFFER FROM 1 TO 3 TYPES OF ATTACKS,BASED ON THE
WEAPONS DESIGN. SOME ATTACKS CAN BE EXECUTED QUITE QUICKLY,WHILE OTHER
MANOUVERS ARE A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX, AND WHEN WEILDING A LARGER AND HEAVIER
WEAPON,TAKE LONGER TO ATTACK WITH. AS THE CHARACTER BECOMES MORE PROFICIENT IN
THE USE OF A WEAPON,ATTACKS CAN BE MADE WITH GRATER EFFECTIVENESS.ALSO,SOME
ATTACKS MAY BE REPLACED BY ONE THAT ONLY A SKILLED WARRIOR IS CAPABLE OF
PEFORMING IN COMBAT.

IT HAS BEEN THE ILL FATE OF MANY,TO HAVE A WEAPON BREAK IN THE HEAT OF COMBAT,
EVEN THE FINEST CRAFTSMANSHIP  CAN ONLY WITHSTAND SO MUCH ABUSE.THEREFORE,ITS A
GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A SECONDARY WEAPON CLOSE AT HAND. SOME WARRIORS EVEN
SURRENDER THE ADDED PROTECTION OF A SHIELD AND FIGHT WITH WEAPONS IN BOTH
HANDS.
A FORTUNATE FEW, MAY EVEN COME UPON WEAPONS EMPOWERED WITH MAGICAL PROPERTIES.
THESE SWORDS OF POWER ARE RARE INDEED, SAID TO BE MADE FROM SPECIAL ALLOYS AND
GIFTED WITH SPECIAL CAPABILITIES,MAGICAL, WEAPONS ARE LIGHT AS A FEATHER AND
SUPERBLY BALANCED.

DENIZENS OF `DARKSPYRE`
-----------------------
THE TWISTING CORRIDORS AND SHADOW LADEN ROOMS OF `DARKSPYRE` ARE OCCUPIED BY
CREATIONS OF ALL SORTS. GIVEN LIFE BY THE GODS OF `WAR`,`MAGIC` AND
`INTELLECT`, AND PLACED WITHIN `DARKSPYRE` AS A PART OF THE CHAMPIONS TEST.
THESE CREATURES WERE NOT ALL CREATED EQUAL,SOME MOVE WITH BLINDING SPEED,OTHERS
AT A SLOW CRAWL,WEAPONS ARE USED BY SOME,POWERFUL MAGIC BY OTHERS,WHILE MANY
ARE ARMED ONLY WITH SHARPENED CLAWS OR FANGS.

THE GREATEST WARRIOR KNOWS HIS OPPONENTS WELL, WHILE THE OBSERVANT WARRIOR WILL
TAKE NOTICE OF ENEMYS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESS. WHEN ENGAGING AN OPPONENT FOR THE
FIRST TIME,TACTICS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED.,should you fight with a sword or a bolt
of flame? the animals strenght lies in numbers,perhaps the creature is slow and
can be defeated at a distance with a crossbow?, the animals tough hide repels
the sword edge,how about a blow from an axe?.
IT IS THE QUESTIONS SUCH AS THESE,THAT SHOULD BE ASKED WHEN FIGHTING A NEW
OPPONENT. THE NEXT TIME YOU MEET IN MORTAL COMBAT,IT WILL BE THE CHARACTER THAT
HAS THE UPPER HAND. AND REMEMBER,HACK AND SLASH TECHNIQUES ARE NOT ALWAYS THE
SOLUTION.

TRAPS AND PUZZLES - LOOK BEFORE YOU STEP
-----------------
ALL OF THE DANGERS THAT AWAIT THE CHARACTER IN `DARKSPYRE` ARE NOT MADE OF
MORTAL FLESH, THE GOD OF `INTELLECT` WISHES TO SEE BRAINS AS WELL AS BRAWN.
WHILE TRAVELLING THROUGH `DARKSPYRE` THE CHARACTER WILL COME ACROSS MANY
DEVICES THAT MAY TRIGGER TRAPS,OPEN SEALED DOORS,OR TELEPORT HIM OR HER
ELSEWHERE. THE BEST WAY TO LEARN, IS THROUGH EXPERIENCE, IT WOULD`NT BE FUN IF
WE TOLD YOU EXACTLY WHAT TO LOOK FOR WOULD IT?

WHEN FIRST ENCOUNTERED, A TRAP OR DEVICE IS IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM.THIS IS DONE
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE MECHANICS BEHIND THE TRAP OR DEVICE.HOWEVER,LATER
ON,THE SAME TRAPS AND DEVICES ARE USED IN DIFFERENT WAYS,AND IN DIFFERENT
COMBINATIONS. SO ALWAYS EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED AND LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES!,AT
FIRST,PULLING THE CHAIN MAY SIMPLY OPEN THE DOOR ACROSS THE HALL.LATER YOU MAY
BE ENGULFED BY A POISON GAS SPEWED FORTH FROM SOME UNKNOWN SOURCE.
DONT BE DISCOURAGED,THERE`S ALWAYS A REASON BEHIND SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS.
THERE`S NOTHING IN THE GAME THAT HAPPENS `JUST BECUSE`,IN WHICH YOU HAVE NO
CHANCE TO THWART THE FINAL OUTCOME. AS IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE,PERHAPS THE POISON
GAS CAME FROM TINY OBSCURE HOLES IN THE WALL THAT YOU DIDNT NOTICE FIRST.
WELL,NEXT TIME YOU COME ACROSS A PULLABLE CHAIN NEXT TO SMALL HOLES IN THE
WALL,BE PREPARED!.

OBJECTS.
--------
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF OBJECTS THE CHARACTER CAN FIND AND USE,THESE OBJECTS
RANGE FROM KEYS,POTIONS AND TOKENS,TO THE RUNES OF POWER. SOME OBJECTS MAY BE
FOUND ON THE GROUND,WHILE OTHERS ARE SOMETIMES DROPPED BY A CREATURE WHEN IT IS
DESTROYED.

ALL OBJECTS MUST BE PLACED IN THE CHARACTERS HANDS BEFORE IT CAN BE USED. ONCE
PLACED IN A HAND,THE AVAILABLE ACTIONS THAT ACCOMPANY THE OBJECT WILL APPEAR IN
THE MENU SELECTIONS TO THE RIGHT OF THE CHARACTERS GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION ON
THE CHARACTER SCREEN. FOR EXAMPLE A SPELL ON A SCROLL CAN BE CAST. A POTION
QUAFFED OR A MAGIC SPHERE HURLED.

EACH OBJECT HAS THREE GRAPHIC REPRESENTIONS,ONE FOR WHEN ITS DISPLAYED ON THE
3D OVERHEAD MAP, ANOTHER FOR THE INVENTORY BLOCKS,AND A THIRD FOR WHEN ITS
PLACED IN THE CHARACTERS HAND.

PICKING UP AND DROPPING OBJECTS IS COVERED IN THE TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT.

POTIONS.
--------
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT NOT ONLY CAN POTIONS BE FOUND ON LEVELS,BUT THEY CAN
ALSO BE CREATED FROM SOME SELECT OBJECTS BY USING A LIQUEFY SPELL.POTIONS
BESTOW UPON A RECIPIENT A VARIETY OF EFFECTS,SOME TEMPORARY AND SOME PERMANENT.
ITS BEST TO KEEEP TRACK OF WHAT POTIONS DO!.

SCROLLS.
--------
ALL OF THE SPELLS IN THE GAME,ARE INITIALLY FOUND ON SCROLLS. A GOOD MANY OF
THESE SPELLS,BUT NOT ALL,CAN BE PERMANTLY TRANSFERRED INTO YOUR SPELLBOOK. ONCE
A SCROLL IS USED,WETHER THE SPELL IS CAST OR PUT INTO A SPELLBOOK,IT WILL TURN
TO DUST.

ENCUMBERANCE
------------
THE CHARACTER IS CAPABLE OF CARRYING ONLY SO MUCH WEIGHT BEFORE HE BEGINS TO
FATIGUE. AS THE CHARACTER BEGINS TO TIRE,HE WILL MOVE AND REACT SLOWER. THE 2
ATTRIBUTES THAT EFFECT HOW MUCH THE CHARACTER CAN CARRY AND HOW QUICKLY HE
TIRES IS STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE.
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU WOULD LIKE TO CARRY ALONG ALL TYPES OF EXTRA ARMOUR
AND AN ARSENAL OF EXTRA WEAPONS,BUT THIS ISNT POSSIBLE.CHOOSE WHAT YOU WISH TO
CARRY WISELY.

POSION.
-------
THOUGH MANY WARRIORS SEE NO HONOUR IN ITS USE,NO ONE CAN DENY ITS
EFFECTIVENESS.MANY TIMES,YOU MAY FIND THE CHARACTER IN A POISON CLOUD OR STRUCK
WITH A WEAPON LACED WITH VENOM.ONCE THE POISON ENTERS A SYSTEM,IT CONTINUES TO
CAUSE DAMAGE UNTIL THE CHARACTER EITHER DIES OR THE POISON IS COUNTERACTED WITH
MAGIC OR AN ANTIDOTE.

THE GAMING ENVIROMENT - LET THE GAME BEGIN
---------------------
`DARKSPYRE` IS A REAL TIME ROLE PLAYING GAME PLAYED FROM 2 SCREENS,THE 3D
OVERHEAD MAP AND THE CHARACTER SCREEN. REAL TIME MEANS THAT EVERYTHING IS
HAPPENING INSTANTANEOUS, THERE ARE NO BREAKS IN THE GAME PLAY, LIKE IN A MENU
DRIVEN GAME,PORTIONS OF BOTH THE 3D OVERHEAD SCREEN AND THE CHARACTER SCREEN
ARE DISPLAYED AT THE SAME TIME. THIS PREVENTS THE NEED TO GO FROM ONE SCREEN TO
ANOTHER AMIDST GAME PLAY.

ALL OF THE IMPORTANT ICONS AND CHARACTER INFORMATION IS DIPLAYED AT THE TOP OF
THE SCREEN. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE THE TOP PORTION OF THE CHARACTER SCREEN
VISIBLE,WHILE WANDERING ABOUT ON THE 3D OVERHEAD MAP. THE CHARACTER SCREEN CAN
BE MOVED UP TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE MAP, AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE
CHARACTER SCREEN SHOWN.

THE 3D OVER HEAD MAP.
---------------------
THE 3D OVERHEAD MAP IS USED TO DISPLAY THE LEVEL OF `DARKSPYRE` CURRENTLY BEING
EXPLORED. THE OUTER FRINGES OF EACH LEVEL ARE SURROUNDED BY STARS, THIS AREA
CAN NEVER BE VENTURED INTO,IT IS SOLELY TO INFORM YOU THAT YOU ARE ON THE EDGE
OF THE MAP, TO GET FROM ONE LEVEL OF `DARKSPYRE` TO ANOTHER,YOU MUST FIND THE
GATEWAY AND ENTER IT. ONCE THE CHARACTER LEAVES A LEVL,THERE IS NO TURNING
BACK,SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE EXPLORED AS MUCH OF THE LEVEL AS POSSIBLE.OF
COURSE,THERE ARE THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LEAVE NO OTHER OPTION OTHER THAN A
QUICK EXIT!.

THE CHARACTER SCREEN
--------------------
YOU WILL FIND ALL THE NEEDED INFORMATION AND GAME PLAY ICONS ON THE CHARACTER
SCREEN THE CHARACTER SCREEN CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING:

* AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN IS AN AREA WHERE ALL TEXT MESSAGES ARE DISPLAYED.

* BELOW THIS,AND TO THE LEFT,IS A GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF THE CHARACTER.AT
THE TOP OF THIS PICTURE IS THE CURRENT CHARACTER`S CURRENT HIT POINT RATING.
WHEN YOU WISH TO PUT SOMETHING ON THE CHARACTER OR IN HIS HANDS,IT IS DONE ON
THE REPRESENTATION. A HELMET IS PUT UPON THE HEAD,ARMOUR IS PUT UPON THE BODY,
A NECKLACE IS PLACED AROUND THE THROAT,AND MOST OBJECTS ARE PLACED IN THE
CHARACTERS HANDS.

* TO THE RIGHT OF THE CHARACTER REPRESNTATION,ARE MENU SELECTIONS FOR OBJECTS
IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT HANDS,AND SPELLS THE CHARACTER HAS CURRENTLY MEMORISED.

* ALSO TO THE RIGHT,BUT JUST BELOW THE MENU SELECTIONS, ARE THE CHARACTERS
INVENTORY BOXES. WHEN YOU WISH FOR THE CHARACTER TO CARRY AN ITEM,IT IS PLACED
INTO ONE OF THE INVENTORY BOXES. THE NUMBER OF BOXES CARRIED CAN NEVER EXCEED
THE AMOUNT OF BOXES AVAILABLE. THEREFORE, AT TIMES, YOU MAY FIND IT HARD
CHOOSING WHAT THE CHARACTER SHOULD TAKE ALONG AND WHAT TO LEAVE BEHIND.

* IN THE BOTTOM LEFT HAND PORTION OF THE SCREEN,IS A SMALL WINDOW WITH THREE
ICONS AT THE BOTTOM, THE WINDOW IS USED TO DISPLAY THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE
CHARACTERS `ATTRIBUTES`,`WEAPON PROFICIENCES` AND `MAGIC SKILL`. SINCE ONLY ONE
GROUP OF THESE CAN BE DISPLAYED AT A TIME,THERE ARE 3 ICONS USED TO SWITCH
BETWEEN THE INFORMATION BEING DISPLAYED.

* IN THE LOWER LEFT HAND PORTION OF THE SCREEN, IS ANOTHER STATUS WINDOW THAT
DISPLAYS THE CHARCTERS HIT POINTS,SPELL POINTS,AND ENCUMBERANCE STATUS. THESE
ARE REPRESENTED BY BARS,WHICH INCREASE OR DECREASE IN LENGTH AS THE CHARACTER
USES SPELL POINTS,TAKES DAMAGE OR PICKS UP MORE OBJECTS.

* AT THE VERY BOTTOM LEFT HAND PART OF THE SCREEN IS A SMALL SCROLL THAT PRINTS
OUT THE NAME,WEIGHT, AND CONDITION OF OBJECTS IN THE CHARACTERS INVENTORY. THIS
INFORMATION IS AUTOMATICALLY DISPLAYED WHEN AN OBJECT IS CHOSEN. IT IS HERE,
THAT AN ARMOURS PROTECTIVE RATING IS DISPLAYED.

RUNES OF POWER.
---------------
IN ADDITION TO THE 5 SPECIAL RUNESTONES THAT REPRESENT THE 5 BASIC CHARACTERS
OF MAN, THERE ARE 20 OTHER SYMBOLS OF POWER. EACH IS ENDOWED WITH A CERTAIN
MAGICAL TRAIT REMINISCENT OF ITS SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION.
