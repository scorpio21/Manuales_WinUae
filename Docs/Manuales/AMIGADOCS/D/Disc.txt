                      from the peecee-fixed by ]Rygar!

  Disc by Loriciel, brought to us by COMPANY is a fantastic game of action and
  skill that is reminiscent of the old Tron Disc's game, one of my personal
  old favorites.  When I asked several people how they liked the game, some
  of them replied: "Huh? I thought Disc was a utility."  Well despite the
  vagueness of it's name, this is in fact a game, and one not to be missed.

  The game offers two player competition, either human vs human or human vs
  computer.  Basically each player stands on their own platform comprised of
  eight tiles positioned in two rows of four tiles each.  The platforms have
  a wall of an additional eight tiles, two rows of eight like the floor, and
  the wall is positioned directly behind each player.  The platforms are
  suspended in mid-air and positioned face to face.  The object is to throw
  a disc or discs at the other player and try to hit him with it, thus
  draining his life meter.  Once the life meter is exhausted, the player
  dies.  Ah, but this is only half the fun.  There is an additional method
  of disposing of your opponent and that is to disintigrate the tiles that
  comprise his platform until he has nowhere left to stand and falls to his
  death.  To do this you must hit your opponent's back wall tiles with your
  disc.  You will notice certain geometrical patterns are drawn on each of
  the back wall tiles.  Each time you hit a back wall tile, the geometrical
  pattern of that tile will change to a new pattern, until all the patterns
  have run through their cycle.  When this happens, the back wall tile will
  dissappear and so will the corresponding floor tile.  The back wall tiles
  and corresponding floor tiles are labeled below:

                          --- --- --- ---
                         | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  Back Wall
                          --- --- --- ---
                         | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
                          --- --- --- ---
      Bottom Platform   / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 /
                        --- --- --- ---
  Where you Stand     / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 /
                      --- --- --- ---

  So hitting the number 2 tile on the back wall will disintigrate it and the
  number 2 tile on the bottom platform.  Hitting the back wall's number 8 tile
  will disintigrate it and the corresponding number 8 on the bottom platform.
  Keep hitting all tiles until there is nowhere left for your opponent to
  stand.  He will fall to his death into the great void and you will win the
  match.  The same can happen to you, however, so practice defensive moves
  as well as offensive.  i.e. Protect your wall by blocking your opponents
  discs, while hammering at his wall with discs of your own.  More on this
  later...

  GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS:
  =====================

  The back wall tiles use geometrical patterns to control how many times you
  need to hit a certain tile to disintigrate it.  In the early levels, one
  two or three hits and a tile is gone.  In the latter levels it takes a
  few more.  Below is a listing of the first five geometrical patterns.
  There are more as the levels get higher, but this listing will suffice
  to help you understand the concept:

                        5 Hits Left  -  Pentagon
                        4 Hits Left  -  Square
                        3 Hits Left  -  Triangle
                        2 Hits Left  -  Equals Sign "="
                        1 Hit Left   -  Circle

  The listing is showing you that when a tile starts out as a Pentagon,
  the first time you hit it, it will change to a Square, the next hit will
  change it to a Triangle, and so on down the line until finally it is gone.
  After hitting a Circle tile, the back wall tile and corresponding platform
  tile will disintegrate.

  When a tile is destroyed, a high-pitched tone sounds to let you know.  If
  you are standing on a tile and hear the tone and your tile starts to dis-
  integrate, you'd better move quick.

  There is one geometrical shape that looks like a number 8 turned sideways.
  Tiles with this pattern on them are indestructible.


  IMPORTANT KEYS TO KNOW:
  =======================

  ESCape    - Will quit and reset game back to title screen.
  Backspace - Quit & Exit to DOS from almost anywhere.
  Break Key - Pauses Game / Press any key to resume
  TAB Key   - Pauses Game / Press TAB again to resume.

  MOUSE CONTROLS:
  ===============

  This game does not appear to support mice.


  JOYSTICK CONTROLS:
  ==================

  Use the information on keyboard controls below, just substitute moving
  the joystick in the direction of the corresponding keyboard keys.  The
  action button is joystick button number one.


  KEYBOARD CONTROLS:
  ==================

  This game supports two player simultaneous combat mode so there are two
  sets of keys on the keyboard, one for each player.  I will call the two
  sets of keys "keymap one" and "keymap two".  I do this because keymap
  one isn't necessarily always used by player one.  The way it works is
  with a one player game, the player must use keymap two.  With a two
  player game, player one uses keymap one, and player two uses keymap two.

  Below are keymaps one and two.  When the action button is not being held
  down, the following keys will move the player in their corresponding
  directions as shown by the lines pointing to the letters:


                 KeyMap One                   KeyMap Two

                  Q  W  E                      I  O  P
                   \ | /                        \ | /
                 A -- -- D                    K -- -- ;
                   / | \                        / | \
                  Z  X  C                      ,  .  /

  ACTION KEY:   Letter "S"                     <ENTER>


             For the joystick, the directions are the same
           but the action key is joystick button number one.


  * The action keys for keymap one and two is the letter "S" and the <ENTER>
    key, respectively.  Usage of the Action keys is discussed in the next
    section.

  * The player using keymap two also has the option of using either the
    standard arrow keys or numeric keypad arrow keys for direction, the
    action key for keymap two remains the same, however.


  USAGE OF THE ACTION KEY:
  ========================

  When holding down the action key in conjunction with a directional key
  you can throw the disc high or low as well as block your opponents disc
  with your shield.  Here's how it's done:

                                        Forward
       Throw Disc High:            Left    |    Right
                                       \   |   /
                                         \ | /
        Throw Disc Low:           Left ---- ---- Right
                                         / | \
                                       /   |   \
            Use Shield:            Left    |  Right

                                         Front
  So, using keymap one, to throw a disc high and to the right you would
  hold down the letter "S" key, then press the letter "E".  Using the joystick
  you would hold down the joystick button then push the joystick diagonally up
  and to the right.  To deflect a disc from the left you would hold down the
  letter "S" key, then press the letter "Z".  With the joystick, you would
  hold down the joystick button then push the joystick diagonally down and
  to the left.  To block an oncoming direct hit, hold it straight down with
  the button pressed, or use the "S" and "X" keys if using the keyboard under
  keymap one.  Getting the idea of how this works?

  The action key also has a stand alone function.  If a disc of your color
  is moving near or towards you, pressing the action key by itself will
  guide the disc towards you and help you catch it.  You do not have to
  press the action key to catch a disc, but it seems to help you do it
  better.  If you don't catch a disk right, either because you are not
  centered on it, or because you're balancing yourself too close to the edge
  of a square, the disc will hit you and take some of your power away -
  Even if the disc is yours.  So try to get close as possible to your disc
  and use the action button to guide it to you and catch it properly.

  If the disc is not your color either dodge it or try to deflect it with
  your shield.  If it hits you it WILL inflict damage on your life meter,
  and if you do not deflect it with your shield, it will inflict damage to
  your platform.


  DISCS AND WHO THEY BELONG TO:
  =============================

  Depending on which type of game you choose to play, you and your opponent
  may start out holding anywhere from one to five discs between you.  Look
  at the top of the screen just under the players life meter.  A picture
  of a disc will show up under your life meter for each disc you are holding
  and same for your opponent.  Player one's life meter and disc status is
  located on the top left of the screen and player two's on the top right.

  When you throw a disc it will be of your color, either white or orange,
  depending on which player you are.  Generally player one is orange and
  player two is white.  When a disc of your color hits your opponent's body
  or his back wall, it will inflict damage.  When the disc bounces off your
  opponents back wall, it will come back towards you and you must try to
  catch it and then throw it again to try and inflict more damage.

  When you or your opponent deflect a disc with the shield, the disc will
  change from your opponents color to your color.  Also, if you fail to
  catch or deflect a disk of your own color, it will hit your back wall,
  and although it won't inflict damage to your wall, it will change to
  your opponents color and fly back towards him.

  Discs do not really belong to either player exclusively.  Ownership of
  a disc is determined by what color it is, and the color of the disc
  will change frequently as it bounces of walls and is deflected.  Always
  try to deflect your opponent's discs, and always try to catch your own
  discs and then line yourself up for another shot.  If you're involved
  in a multi-disc game, be advised that you and your opponent can both
  catch more than just one disc.  Actually a good strategy in multi-disc
  games is to wait and catch as many discs as you can, then fling them
  all at your opponent in rapid succession to confuse the hell out of
  him and inflict major damage.


  OPTIONS:
  ========

    -Two Players- (Human vs Human)

  * ONE ON ONE:  By selecting the two player option from the title menu
    you and a friend can play one on one.  Two matches are played, and at the
    end of the first match players switch sides, so be prepared.  In the
    event of a tie, another two matches are played.  Victory is achieved
    by winning both matches.  Each match lasts two and a half minutes or
    until one opponent is destroyed.


    -One Player- (Human vs Computer)

  *     TRAINING:  Start with this to get familiar with how to manuever your
                   player and discs, and for practice with hitting targets
                   as well as dodging and deflecting opponent discs.

                   You start out with target practice.  Try to hit the tiles
                   that have the "?" on them with your disc.  The next part
                   is moving target practice.  An opponent will appear and
                   try to dodge and deflect your disks as you try to hit him.
                   The next part you get to dodge and deflect discs as your
                   opponent trys to hit you with them.

  *    CHALLENGE:  You get to pick out exactly which opponent you wish to
                   challenge.  Move the cursor with the arrow keys or
                   joystick until your desired opponent is highlighted, then
                   click with your action key to select.  You will challenge
                   this opponent to one match lasting two and a half minutes.

  *   TOURNAMENT:  You play a tournament of 8 matches lasting two and a half
                   minutes each against each opponent in succession.  It's
                   all over when you lose your first match.

  * CHAMPIONSHIP:  You play one match against each opponent in succession and
                   each match lasts two minutes.  It's all over when you lose
                   one match.


  HINTS & TIPS:
  =============

  1) Matches are timed.  The timer is shown at the top center screen.  When
     the timer counts down to zero and both players are still alive, the
     player with the highest score will win.  Score is kept by giving the
     player one point for every hit on the opponent's body and one point
     for each of the opponent's tiles that the player destroys.

     The Score is located to the immediate right of each of the players
     names which are located on the top left and right of the screen for
     players one and two, respectively.

  2) You can stumble and fall!  Be careful and don't get too close to the
     edge of your platform.  Lose your balance and you will fall right off
     the edge and die.

  3) You will not fall into the holes of missing tiles if there is a tile
     on the other side.  i.e. If you are standing on tile 1 and tile 2 is
     missing, if there is a tile 3 you can move towards it and the player
     will automatically jump the gap between them.  If more than two tiles
     form a gap, do not attempt a jump to the other side as you will fall.

                          /\                                /\
          Ok to jump -->  1 34         Not ok to jump ---> 1  4
                          ^6 8                             ^ 78
                           ^                                 ^
          You could safely jump        You would die trying to
          from tile 1 to tile 3        jump from tile 1 to tile
          or from tile 1 to 6.         4 or from tile 1 to 7.

  4) Discs can get behind you, hit the wall, bounce off, hit you in the
     back, bounce and hit the wall again, hit your back again, etc...
     This will cause major damage to you and your platform and may even
     knock you clear off your platform.  Avoid this by deflecting discs
     with your shield and by moving around often.

  5) From time to time bonus tiles will appear on your opponents back wall.
     These tiles will look like a question mark within a circle.  If you
     can hit this tile you will get a special option for your disc, like
     speed disc for instance which makes your disc travel at lightining
     speeds to cripple your opponent.  Be quick because the bonus tile
     will not wait all day for you to hit it.  Also if you do hit it
     and attain a bonus disc option, use it quickly as it will not last
     long.

  6) You get to choose your character from a list of 8 different ones at
     the beginning of each game.  I have tried a few of these but not all,
     and I haven't noticed much difference in which one you choose besides
     the name and face.
