HOW TO PLAY
~~~~~~~~~~~
Dennis must find his way out of Mr Wilson's house.But first he has to collect
his pea-shooter and slingshot.
They are lying somewhere about the house along with coins dropped by the inept
Sam.Smaller coins are less valuable,but the larger the coins are necessary in
order to advance to the next level!

Dennis must search the entire house.While doing all this,Dennis must avoid
being seen by Mr Wilson who is walking around the house,unable to sleep due to
his traumatic day.If he spots dennis he will give chase and upon catching him,
will send him back to bed and Dennis must start all over again!

Once Dennis has got out of Mr.Wilson's house,he discovers that Sam has left
coins all over the place,and he must look all over the place, and he must find
them all.

On each level there are four large coins spread about,and one final coin
 (This is surrounded by smaller spinning coins and must be collected last).

After completing all levels Dennis will meet up with Switchblade Sam.

THE FINALE
~~~~~~~~~~
Sam has Joey and Margaret tied to a tree as hostages while he waits to jump
the next train out of town with his ill-gotten gains.

Upon seeing Dennis,Sam will throw a constant barrage of apples in his
direction.dennis must avoid all contact with these and with Sam,whilst
shooting at this dastardly villian until Sam finally slumps into submission.

Defeat Sam and Dennis will have completed his epic adventure.

NOTE: All end of level guardians have a blue energy meter which is displayed
      at the top of the screen.Dennis also has a red energy meter displayed
      opposite the enemy meter.

PICK-UPS
~~~~~~~~

him:

Extra Lives: These are obtained by collecting the "1-UP" icons found around
             the levels.

WEAPONS
~~~~~~~
Water Pistol : Dennis has this at the start of the game.It can stun some
               baddies within the game - but not all of them.

Slingshot    : This can be found at the start of Mr.Wilsons house and is an
               excellent short range weapon.It is exremely useful for hitting
	       targets below Dennis's current position.

Pea-Shooter  : This is also hidden in Mr.Wilson's house and no small boy would
	       be complete without one.It has longer range than the slingshot
	       as it fires in a straight line.

* Study the movement of your opponents and avoid them accordingly.Haste can be
  costly!
* If Dennis makes contact with any opponent,use his momentary invulnerability
  (when he flashes) to gain ground or to reach a safer position.
* Different opponents are vulnerable to different weapons,whilst some are
  invulnerable to all attack. Be Careful!
* Watch out for switches that operate rope ladders.
