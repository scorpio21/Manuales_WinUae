machine.  During your quest you must face and conquer the unique
dangers of several dimensions in time.

GAME INSTRUCTIONS

To Load Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp

For A-1000 owners, at the prompt you should insert KICKSTART 1.2 or
greater.  For all Amiga models, when prompted for the WORKBENCH disk,
you should insert the Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp Disk 1 into the
internal disk drive.

Starting The Game

After the game has loaded, the demo mode will automatically begin.  The
demo runs through scenes from the first disk and then returns to the
title screen and credits.  To start playing the game simply press the
(0) on the keypad at any time.  You will know the game has started
when the player score screen appears.  This screen shows your score
and the number of lives you have remaining.  The first scene will then
load automatically.

Playing Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp

You do not directly control all of Dirk's actions, rather you control
his reactions to the events that happen around him.  As you watch the
animation, you must decide in which direction Dirk should move on the
screen and when.

To finish a scene successfully you must make a move or press the fire
button (zero (0) on the numeric keypad) when Dirk is in danger.  Timing
is very critical and often you may make the correct move but at the
wrong time.  Also, many scenes require more than one move.  If you are
having trouble, watch the animation carefully and move Dirk in the
safest direction or if no direction is safe press the fire button
to use Dirk's laser gun or staff.

If you're sure you have the correct move, try varying the time when you
make the move, a little sooner or a little later.  Don't be surprised if
Dirk doesn't move immediately after you have made a move.  You must wait
for the animation to finish and if you made the correct move(s) you will
continue on to the next scene.

You have three lives and the game will end if you lose all of your lives
or when you have completed all of the scenes on the disks.

From time to time it will be necessary to change the disk in the drive.
After you have finished all the animations on a disk you will be asked to
insert the next disk do that the game can continue.  NEVER eject one
of the game disks while you are playing, unless you are prompted, or
you may damage the disk!
