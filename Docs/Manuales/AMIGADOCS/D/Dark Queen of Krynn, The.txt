                           THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN

                               Amiga Data Card

System Requirements:  DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN will run on an Amiga 500,
1000, 2000, or 3000 with 1 megabyte of system memory and 1 floppy
drive.  Playing from a hard disk in not required.  However, hard disk
installation is available on your game disks.  Your hard disk must
have at least 2 megabytes of available space to install the game.  A
minimum of 790K of free memory is required to run this program.  You
may check your free memory by using the MEM command in the CLI shell.
Should you not have enough memory, you may do the following:
   o Close all unnecessary windows in Workbench
   o Disconnect any external floppy drives
   o Remove any memory resident programs

Before Beginning Play:  Make a backup copy of your original disks with
the AmigaDOS DISKCOPY command.  Be sure to delete the words "Copy of"
from your copies.  Put your original disks away and install or play
the game from your copies.  Refer to your computer manual for information
on how to use AmigaDOS commands.  NOTE:  If you do not make copies
of your original disks, you will not be able to save your game.

Hard Disk Installation:  To install DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN to your hard
disk, follow these steps, and then follow the prompts that appear
on your screen:
   Step 1: Boot up your system using Workbench 1.2 or higher
            (Amiga 1000 users: first boot with Kickstart 1.2 or higher).
   Step 2: Insert Disk 1 into your floppy drive.
   Step 3: Double click on the Disk 1 icon.
   Step 4: Double click on the Install_DH0: icon to install the game to
           DH0: or double-click on the Install_DH1: to install to your
           DH1: partition.

Starting the Game:  To play DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN from your hard disk,
boot up your computer, open the drawer where the game is currently
residing and then double-click on the DARK QUEEN KRYNN icon.

   If you are playing from floppy disks, insert Disk 1 before booting
your system.  Turn the Amiga on (Amiga 1000 users: boot your system
using the Kickstart disk first, then insert Disk 1).  After Disk 1 has
loaded, insert Disk 3 in DF0: and Disk 2 in DF1:  This reduces the
number of disk swaps during game play.

Getting Started Quickly:  Use the pregenerated party of characters saved
as Save Game A.  These characters start at the very beginning of the game,
but they have already been outfitted with readied weapons and armor.

   Choose the LOAD SAVED GAME option from the Party Creation menu.  The
saved game will appear after you choose the TDQK option in the LOAD SAVED
GAME menu.  Load Save Game A.  Choose the BEGIN ADVENTURING option.

Saving Games:  Saved games are identified by letters.  To save or recall
a game, select the desired letter.

Transferring Characters from DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN:  When playing off of
the hard disk, select the LOAD SAVED GAME option, then DKK.  Choose the
saved game you wish to transfer to DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN.  This will load 
all of the characters, all of their equipment, and their money.

   If you wish to load only one character from DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN,
choose the ADD CHARACTER TO PARTY option and then select DKK.  A screen
with the names of all of the characters will appear.  Choose the one to
be loaded into the new party.  Note: you must have previously removed   
the character from the party in DKK.

   The only difference when using the floppy disk version of the game is
that the program will ask you to insert the DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN save
game disk.  When it does, insert the DKK save game disk in DF0: and select
the YES option.

Moving Around:  The party moves through the game in 3D/area, wilderness,
and combat modes.  Targeting spells and ranged weapons during combat is
similar to moving characters.  You can use either Keyboard or Mouse
Movement.

Keyboard Movement:  Use the following keyboard controls for both movement 
and combat:


              3D MOVE / ANY MENU               MOVE/ COMBAT / AIM
           ________________________         ________________________
          | MENU  |        | MENU  |       |\  7   |8 /|\   |9    / |
          |  UP   |  MOVE  | PG UP |       | \     |   |    |    /  |
          |_______|________|_______|       |_______|___|____|_______|
          | TURN  |        | TURN  |       |4      |5       |6      |
          | LEFT  |        | RIGHT |       |<----  |        | ----> |
          |_______|________|_______|       |_______|________|_______|
          | MENU  |  TURN  | MENU  |       |1      |2  |    |3      |
          | DOWN  |  BACK  | PG DN |       | /     |   |    |     \ |
          |_______|________|_______|       |/______|__\|/___|______\|


   An Entry in a vertical list may be highlighted by using the [Menu Up]
(7) and [Menu Down] (1) keys on the keypad.  If there are more entries
in a vertical list than will fit in the window, scroll arrows appear
on the right side of the window to move up and down the list a page at
a time.  The [Menu PgUp] (9) and [Menu PgDn] (3) keys on the keypad 
also page up and down a list.  When altering a character's attribute
scores, the Character Display acts as a vertical list.

Mouse Movement:  The mouse is active throughout the game, and may be
used for all input except to answer the Copy Protection question or to
enter an amount of money.  The mouse pointer changes shapes depending 
on its function.  When it is a sword, it is used to select an option
or an entry in a vertical list.  It becomes an arrow to indicate 
direction of movement/attack in combat, movement, or turning in 3-D
mode.  It is a crosshair when used to select a possible target location
in aiming.

   When the mouse is not active, the pointer becomes a shield.  The
keyboard may be used for all input except for creating characters or
designing or modifying the combat picture of a player-character.

   To move in 3D mode with a mouse, click the mouse cursor at the edge of 
the display window in the direction you want to move.  To move forward, 
click at the top of the window.  To turn around, click at the bottom.  
To turn right or left, click at the appropriate side.  To move in area/
wilderness mode, click the location you want to enter and the party 
goes in that direction.

   To use the mouse for combat targeting and movement, click the mouse
cursor over the target square and the cursor moves to the target.  If the 
target is off the screen, first select an intermediate square near the 
edge of the screen.  In combat, the mouse pointer is an arrow which
shows the direction of the adjacent space into which the active character
will move/attack when a mouse button is pressed.

   When aiming manually, the mouse pointer becomes a crosshair which is
used for selecting any space visible in the window  as a target.  Clicking
a mouse button on the edge of the window scrolls the viewing area in the
direction of the edge.

Amiga Combat Commands:  The following is a list of Amiga specific commands.

  <Esc>: exits from any menu.  When moving in combat, it "takes back" the
         move, but does not erase any damage taken during the move.
<Space>: returns all characters to normal control from QUICK.
  ALT/M: toggles the magic spells on/off for characters set to QUICK.
  ALT/Q: sets all characters to QUICK (computer control).
  ALT/S: toggles sound on/off (may be used any time).
  ALT/T: toggles music on/off (may be used any time).

   HINT: If you find combat too easy or difficult, use the LEVEL option
   (Rule Book page 8).

Scrolls:  Scrolls may be "joined" into bundles.  Up to 10 scrolls can
make up one bundle.  To join scrolls together, VIEW your character's
items, highlight the scroll that you wish to bundle the rest to,
and then select the JOIN option.

Spell Memorization:  To rememorize spells in Camp, select the REST option,
then rest for the preallotted time.

   If you wish to change the selection of spells to be memorized, choose
the MEMORIZE option and do not keep the spells ready for rememorization.
Follow the rule book instructions for memorizing spells.

Copy Protection:  To answer the verification question,  find the indicated
word in the Adventurer's Journal.  Type the indicated word and press 
Enter/Return.  Do not count section headings.

NOTE: Completely disregard the above paragraph, SKID ROW cracked this
      bitch.

Program Changes:  This is a list of specific program changes to DARK
QUEEN OF KRYNN that are different from DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.

   The FIX option only heals the party.  It no longer increments time
to memorize spells.  Use the REST option to memorize all spells.

   In some areas of the game, the REST and FIX options will not be
available in the CAMP menu.

   If you are using a mouse and you are modifying a character's name,
you must use the <Esc> key to abort the change.  The mouse will not
work.

   Non-human races have a distinct disadvantage in this game.  The
base experience for this game puts most non-human races at their
class maximums, even before you start the game.

Magic-users should have an intelligence of 18 or they will not be able
to use the most powerful spells.

NOTE:  When transferring characters from DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN, the
vault will not transfer.  To transfer items from the vault, you must
first give them to characters you are transferring. 

Differences in the Amiga Version:  The options for the Amiga version of
DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN are slightly different than those described in the
Rule Book:

   The LOAD option has been added to the ENCAMP menu.  This allows you
to load a saved game at any point in the game.

   You may only have up to 8 saved games at a time (depending on the
amount of space available).

   There is no MOVE option.  This option is no longer necessary.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to the official ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS computer product,
THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN, a DRAGONLANCE fantasy role-playing epic.  
This game is based on the rules and background created by TSR,
Inc. and a story line created especially for this game.

THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN begins two years after the overthrow of Lord
Soth in DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.  General Laurana, the commander of the
united forces which defeated the evil dragons in the War of the Lance,
has requested your presence at her headquarters in the city of
Palanthas.  Responding to her summons brings you face-to-face with
the greatest threat Krynn has ever known.     

Your Game Box Should Contain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Disks         o Adventurer's Journal
o Rule Book     O Data Card

This Rule Book is designed to explain all your options and guide you
through playing the game.  If you are not familiar with the ADVANCED
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game system, you will find helpful information
about how things work in the Adventurer's Journal.

The Adventurer's Journal contains a variety of information including
details about character classes, magic, combat, and an introduction
to the adventure story.  The Journal also includes the maps, information,
rumors, and stories that you need to play the game.  As you play the game,
you discover for yourself which of the tales you hear are fact and
which are fiction.

The Data Card explains how to start the game and how to select items
and menu commands with your specific computer.  It tells you how to
transfer characters to THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN from the fantasy role-
playing game, DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.  It also shows how to get
right into the game without having to read through the rules.

Transferring Characters from DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN accepts characters who have adventured in DEATH
KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.  (See your Data Card for complete details).

Before Beginning Play
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(See your Data Card for complete details). 
    
Getting Started Quickly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN comes with a ready-made party that allows
you to begin adventuring immediately.  Use the instructions on the
Data Card to load the saved game that has been provided and being playing.
Use this Rule Book to answer any questions during play.
     
Using Menus
~~~~~~~~~~~
All commands are menu based, and menus are displayed either vertically
or horizontally.

Vertical menus indicate a character, item, or spell to be acted upon.
If there are more choices than fit on the screen at one time, use the
arrow keys, or the PageUp and PageDown keys to view the additional
selections.

Example:  When purchasing items, they are highlighted on a vertical list
then purchased with the BUY command.

Horizontal menus list available actions.  In this Rule Book, menus are 
shown with all of their options, although in some cases commands are not 
available every time a menu appears.

Example:  

TREASURE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VIEW TAKE POOL SHARE DETECT EXIT

The commands TAKE and SHARE only appears if there is treasure to take.  
The command DETECT only appears if there is treasure and the active 
character has a detect magic spell available.

The Rule Book only shows the general menus.  Special menus appear at
various times to give you all available options.

The concept of the active character is central to the game.  Outside of
combat the active character's name is highlighted on the vertical menu.
During combat the active character begins his combat segment surrounded
by a cursor.

If a command affects the whole party, just select the command.  If the
command affects a single character, make that character active and then
choose the command.

Example:  To look at a character's items: highlight the character, then 
select the VIEW then ITEMS commands.  However, to have the entire party 
camp, simply select the ENCAMP command.

BEGINNING TO PLAY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To begin playing the game, you must load a saved game or generate
characters and band them together into a party.  

Starting Options

This first menu gives you the initial options.

STARTING MENU

ADD CHARACTER
CREATE CHARACTER
LOAD SAVED GAME
EXIT FROM GAME

ADD CHARACTER allows you to add characters to the party from the saved 
game disk.  A party is a group of characters composed of up to six player 
characters (called PCs) and up to two non-player characters (called NPCs).  
A party should have a balanced mix of characters with different classes.  
For more information about building parties see the "Characters and 
Parties" section in the Adventurer's Journal.  There is an ADD FROM WHERE? 
option that allows you to add characters from either THE DARK QUEEN OF 
KRYNN or DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.
 
CREATE CHARACTER is used to build a new character.  Detailed information 
about characters, races, classes and so on is available in the Adventurer's
Journal.  This command displays a menu to define the following character
attributes.  DONE is used to proceed to the next menu.

* PICK RACE lists the seven races a player-character can be in
DRAGONLANCE.

* CLASS lists the class or classes the character is qualified for
based on race.

* ALIGNMENT lists all the possible alignments for the character based on 
character class.   

* GENDER lists the sex the character can be.  Gender affects the
character's maximum strength.

After you are done selecting these attributes, the PICK DEITY menu 
appears if you have a cleric.  PICK DEITY lists all of the deities 
a cleric character can choose to worship.  Each deity confers unique
powers to its clerics, and determines which alignments a character
can be.  See the "Deities" section in the Journal for more details.


Once all of the attributes have been selected, the computer randomly 
generates the character's ability scores.  If you are not happy with the 
character's scores, you may REROLL STATS to roll them again.  Remember 
that you can use the MODIFY command to change the character's ability
scores and hit points.

Next, you must choose a name for the character.  CHARACTER NAME provides
a 15-letter space to type in the character's name.  This name is
automatically saved to disk.

After naming a character, you must select an icon which will represent
the character in combat from the 49 combat icons provided.  The standard
icon for the character's race, class, and sex is highlighted; the
arrow keys or mouse may be used to change the highlighted icon.  DONE
is used to confirm the selection of the highlighted icon.

o EXIT at any time during character creation aborts the creation of the
current character and returns you to the Party Creation/Training Hall 
Menu.

LOAD SAVED GAME permits you to resume a game that has been previously 
saved.  The saved game provided with THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN can also be
loaded.  There is a LOAD FROM WHERE? option that allows you to load
saves from either THE DARK QUEEN OR KRYNN OR DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.

EXIT FROM GAME ends play without saving the game.

Modifying Characters and Parties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Party Creation/Training Hall Menu shows the characters currently in
your party and lists the commands for creating, modifying, and training
the party.  Not all of the options are available at all times.
     
PARTY CREATION/TRAINING HALL MENU

ADD CHARACTER
REMOVE CHARACTER
MODIFY CHARACTER
TRAIN CHARACTER (Training Hall Only)
KNIGHT NEW ORDER (Training Hall Only)
VIEW CHARACTER
CREATE CHARACTER
DELETE CHARACTER
LOAD SAVED GAME
SAVE CURRENT GAME
BEGIN ADVENTURING
EXIT FROM GAME

REMOVE CHARACTER transfers a character from the party to the saved game 
disk.

MODIFY CHARACTER changes the character's ability scores and hit points.  
Use MODIFY CHARACTER to change a character generated in THE DARK QUEEN
OF KRYNN to match a favorite AD&D game character.  A character cannot be
modified once the adventure has begun.

TRAIN CHARACTER (from Training Hall Menu only) increases a character's 
level when he has gained enough experience points (EXP).  Choose the 
character to train and, if he has sufficient EXP, he will be able to 
advance one level.  If a character has gained enough experience to 
advance more than one level, he will advance only one level and then 
lose all experience points in excess of one point below that required 
for advancement to the next level.  See the section on "Experience 
Points" in the Adventurer's Journal for an example.

Advancing in levels takes no game time.  When magic-users advance, they 
may add a spell to their spell book.  See the "Maximum Level Limits by 
Race, Class and Prime Requisite" chart in the Adventurer's Journal for 
level limits.

KNIGHT NEW ORDER (from Training Hall Menu only) allows a knight of
sufficient experience and abilities to petition for admission into the
next higher order.  Look under Solamnic Knights in the Adventurer's
Journal for more information.

VIEW CHARACTER displays a character's ability scores, readied weapon and
armor, and more.  See the "Viewing Characters" section for more 
information.

DELETE CHARACTER erases a character from the saved game disk.  A deleted
character may not be recovered.
     
SAVE CURRENT GAME stores the current game to the saved game disk or
directory.

BEGIN ADVENTURING starts the game.
     
Non-Player Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During the game, the party encounters non-player characters (NPCs).  
There are three kinds of NPCs: those who volunteer to join the party, 
and those who will only fight.  NPCs that join the party are treated 
like player characters with a few differences.  The computer commands 
NPCs in battle.  They also have morale.  If things are going badly for 
the party, NPCs may run.  Items can be traded to some NPCs, but they 
cannot be traded from conscious NPCs to other characters.  If an NPC 
dies, however, you can use the TRADE command on the Items Menu to take 
his items.  Only two NPCs at a time may join the party, and they may 
take a share of all treasures found.

Viewing Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Character Summary Screen is displayed anytime you select the VIEW
command.  This screen displays important information about a character,
such as ability scores, current and maximum hit points, readied weapons
and armor, and wealth.

Characters accumulate wealth in the form of gems, jewelry, and coins as 
they go.  The value of gems and jewelry varies, and can only be 
determined by having the items appraised in a shop.  

Encumbrance is the total weight the character is carrying.

Combat Movement is how many squares a character can move during a
combat segment.  This is based on his readied armor, strength, and total
encumbrance.

Character Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OKAY status means that the character has positive hit points and can 
move and fight normally.

UNCONSCIOUS status means that the character has exactly 0 hit points.  
He cannot move or fight, but is in no danger of dying.

DEAD status means that the character has died.  Non-elf characters have
a chance of being resurrected with a raise dead or resurrection spell.  
The character's chance of being resurrected is influenced by his 
constitution.  See the "Constitution Chart" in the Adventurer's Journal.  
     
FLED status means that the character has fled from a battle.  After the
battle he rejoins the party.

DYING (combat only) status indicates the character has between -1 and
-9 HP, and is bleeding to death.  Use the BANDAGE command to have 
another character stop the bleeding before the character dies.
  
STONE status means that the character has been turned to stone.  The
character can be returned to normal with a stone to flesh spell.

GONE status means that the character has been totally destroyed.
Nothing can bring the character back to life.

From the View Menu several options are available to inspect the active
character.  Not all of these commands are available at all times.
     
VIEW MENU
~~~~~~~~~
ITEMS SPELLS TRADE DROP LAY CURE EXIT

ITEMS displays all the equipment the character is carrying and the
Items Menu.  Items preceded by a YES are ready for use.  Not all 
commands in the Items Menu are always available.

ITEMS MENU
~~~~~~~~~~
READY USE TRADE DROP HALVE JOIN EXIT

* READY changes the status of a weapon, armor or other item.  Only
readied items can be used in combat.  A character cannot ready more than
two hand-held items at once.  Arrows and crossbows are assumed to be in a
quiver and can be readied at all times.  Some items take both hands
when readied (bows, quarter staffs, etc.), some take only one (long
swords, wands, etc.), and others take no hands (rings, armor, etc.).  
READY is sometimes abbreviated RDY.

* USE activates an item.  In combat the Aim Menu appears if the item can 
be targeted.  See the "Combat" section for details about the Aim Menu.

* TRADE from the Items Menu transfers an item from one character to 
another.  Highlight an item to trade, select TRADE, then select a
character to receive the item.  Remember: a conscious NPC will not give 
up items.

* DROP permanently removes items from a character.  Dropped items
cannot be recovered.

* HALVE divides a bundle of like items into two bundles.  For example,
HALVE would turn one bundle of 42 arrows into two bundles of 21 each.  
This is handy for dividing items to distribute among party members.

* JOIN combines all like items into one group.  No more than 255
similar items can be joined.  Some items, such as potions, cannot
be joined.

SPELLS is a listing of the spells a character has memorized and can
cast.


TRADE from the View Menu transfers coins, gems, and jewelry from one 
character to another.  Select TRADE, choose what type of money and 
how much to trade, then select the receiving character.

DROP permanently removes money from a character.  Dropped money cannot
be recovered.

LAY is a healing ability of paladins.  Paladins may lay on hands and
heal two hit points per level of damage a day.  Select the LAY command, 
then select the character to be healed.  This command is only displayed 
when a paladin has not yet used it that day.

CURE is another healing ability of paladins - they may perform one sure
disease per week for every 5 levels.  For example, at 1st to 5th levels,
a paladin may perform one, at 6th and 10th levels two, etc.  This command
is only displayed if the paladin has a cure available.

ADVENTURING
~~~~~~~~~~~
After setting up your party and reading the background information in
the Adventurer's Journal, it is time to head for adventure and glory.  
The party will engage in fierce battles, find treasures, and sometimes
have to stop, recuperate, and memorize spells for future use during
adventures.

Display Screens and Points of View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN uses four different points of view: 3-D,
Area, Wilderness and Combat.

3-D appears in areas such as towns or underground.  This view appears in
the top-left view window to show the surrounding area from the party's 
perspective.  Rotate the party's facing and move using the directional 
controls that are described in your Data Card.
     
Area provides an overhead view of the party's surroundings, replacing 
the 3-D view.  Choose the AREA command from the Adventure Menu.  This 
view is not available in many regions.

A cursor in the area display shows the party's position and facing.  
Simply move the party with the direction controls around the area map.

Under the point of the view window are displayed the phases of the three
moons of Krynn.  Solinari is shown on the left, Lunitari is shown in the
center, and Nuitari is shown on the right.  For more information about the
effects of the moons, see the heading "The Moons of Krynn" in the 
Adventurer's Journal.  To the right of the point of view window is a 
list of the party members, showing their armor classes and current hit
points.  Below this list is a compass, showing the direction which the 
party is facing, and a status window, which displays the party's current
location (if known), its current activity (searching, camping, etc.) and
the current time.

Wilderness view displays a map in a large view window with a cursor 
indicating the party's current location.  You get to this view this when 
you leave a town or other developed area.  Use the direction controls
to move around on the map and go from location to location.

Combat view occurs automatically whenever the party engages in battle.
The combat screen is a detailed view of the area the party was in when the
encounter began.

Adventuring Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following menus controls basic adventuring, moving, encamping,
and casting spells.

ADVENTURE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AREA CAST VIEW ENCAMP SEARCH LOOK INV

The party can use the arrow keys or mouse to turn right or left, turn
around or move forward.  Normal movement in 3-D or Area mode takes one
minute of game time per square.  If the party has Search on, each move
takes ten minutes.  Refer to the Data Card for computer-specific 
movement information.

AREA toggles between the Area (overhead) and 3-D view.  This command may
not be available in some regions.

CAST displays the Cast Menu if the active character is a spellcaster.
See the "Magic" section for more information.  Remember: Some spells 
only work in combat, others only while encamped.

VIEW displays the Character Summary Screen and the View Menu.

ENCAMP displays the Encamp Menu.  See the "Encamping" section for a
description of the available commands.

SEARCH toggles searching on and off.  With Search Off, the party takes
one minute per move.  With Search On, the party takes 10 minutes per move 
because they are checking for secret doors, traps, etc.  When a party 
has Search on, SEARCHING is displayed on the screen to the right of the 
point of view window.  Because the party is moving very slowly with 
Search On, the chance for random encounters is greatly increased.

LOOK is used to search an individual square.  A LOOK command acts as if 
the party moved into the current square with SEARCH On.

INV displays a list of the special items and artifacts which have been
acquired by the party.

Encamping
~~~~~~~~~
The Encamp Menu includes options such as saving the game, resting to
heal and memorize spells, and changing items such as game speed or 
party order.
     
ENCAMP MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~
VIEW MAGIC REST ALT FIX LOAD SAVE EXIT

VIEW displays the View Menu and the character screen of the active 
character.

MAGIC is a very important part of THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN and is
described under its own heading on page 8.

REST allows characters to memorize spells and to heal naturally.
When spells are being memorized, the initial rest time is established
by the time necessary to memorize any spells selected with the MEMORIZE
command in the Magic Menu.  For every 24 uninterrupted hours of rest in 
camp, each wounded character regains one hit point.  Rest may be
interrupted by encounters.  If possible, find safe places to take long
rests, such as an inn or places that you are told are safe during the
game.

REST MENU
~~~~~~~~~
REST DAYS HOURS MINUTES ADD SUBTRACT EXIT
       
* REST begins resting process.  Unless interrupted, the party rests
for the indicated time.

* DAYS/HOURS/MINUTES selects the unit of time to be changed by the ADD 
and SUBTRACT commands.

* ADD/SUBTRACT increases or decreases the time that the party attempts 
to rest.  Decreasing the time may not allow spellcasters to memorize all 
of their spells.

ALT displays the Alter Menu that is used to change the characters in the 
party and the parameters of the game.

ALTER MENU
~~~~~~~~~~
ORDER DROP SPEED ICON LEVEL EXIT

* ORDER changes how the characters are listed on the screen and how
they are deployed in combat.  Characters at the top of the list tend to
be at the front line in combat.

* DROP eliminates a character from the party and erases him from the
saved game disk.  A dropped character is gone forever and may not be
recovered.

* SPEED controls the rate at which messages are printed on the screen.
If the game is running too slowly, use the FASTER command to speed up
the displays.

* ICON is used to change a character's combat icon.

* LEVEL displays the Level Menu that permits you to adjust combat 
difficulty.  
     
Level Menu
~~~~~~~~~~
NOVICE SQUIRE VETERAN ADEPT CHAMPION 

The game is preset at the Veteran level.  This is the level at which we 
consider the game to be "balanced."  To make the combat encounters easier, 
choose either the NOVICE (easiest) or SQUIRE level.  To make the combat 
more difficult, choose either the ADEPT or CHAMPION (hardest) level.

When you choose to make the game more difficult, you are rewarded
by receiving more experience points from you combat encounters.
When you choose to make the game easier, you are penalized by
receiving fewer experience points from your combat encounters.

FIX is used to heal many wounded characters with a single command.
All characters with at least first level clerical spells memorize as
many healing spells as they can, cast them on the party, and then 
rememorize their previous spells automatically.  FIX takes game time 
and may be interrupted by an encounter.  If the party is severely
damaged, you may need to select FIX more than once.

LOAD allows you to load a saved game to replace your current game without
first exiting from THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN.  This may be desirable if
your current game is an untenable position, or if you have accidentally
loaded the wrong game.

SAVE stores the characters and current game disk or directory.  Saved
games may be loaded either from the Starting Menu when you start the game
or from the Party Creation/Training Hall Menu.  Save often- especially
after surviving really tough encounters.
    
EXIT returns to the Adventuring Menu.

Magic
~~~~~
To get the Magic Menu options, the active character must be able to
cast spells.  Spellcasters can get a list of their memorized spells from
the CAST command of the Magic Menu or from the SPELLS command of the View
Menu.  Magic-users can get a list of their spells on scrolls from the 
SCRIBE command in the Magic Menu.

Spells are defined by who can cast them, when they can be cast, their 
range, duration, area of effect, and, of course, their actual effect.  
The "Spell Parameters List" in the Adventurer's Journal summarizes
all of the available spells.  When using spells from the Encamp Menu or
the Adventure Menu (such as find traps or haste), remember that one round 
equals one minute of game time (one normal move), and one turn equals ten
minutes of game time (ten normal moves).  Look in the Adventurer's Journal
for more information on spells land magic.
    
MAGIC MENU
~~~~~~~~~~
CAST MEMORIZE SCRIBE DISPLAY REST EXIT
       
CAST displays the Cast Menu and the character's list of memorized
spells.  Select the spell to cast and then indicate the target of the
spell.  Once a spell is cast, it is gone from memory until it is 
memorized again.  Some spells only have an effect when cast during 
combat and others may only be cast while encamped.

MEMORIZE displays the Memorize Menu, the character's spell book or
clerical spell list, and how many spells of each level the spellcaster
may memorize.  Once all characters have selected the spells they want to
memorize, choose the REST command to actually memorize the spells. 

Remember that spellcasters can have the same spell memorized multiple 
times, and they can automatically rememorize used spells simply by
selecting the REST command.

MEMORIZE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CHOOSE SPELL: MEMORIZE EXIT
      
* MEMORIZE selects a spell to be memorized.  A spell is not actually
memorized until it has been chosen from the Memorize Menu and the 
character has rested long enough to imprint the spell on his or her mind.  
After selecting the spells to memorize, the computer verifies your 
choices.

SCRIBE displays the Scribe Menu and a list of all of the spells
on magic-user scrolls.  Before spells can be scribed, they must
either be identified at a shop or the magic-user must cast read magic.
To scribe, select any spells to be scribed into the character's spell
book and select REST to actually scribe the spells.  Scribing a spell 
takes the same amount of time as memorizing the same spell.

SCRIBE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~
CHOOSE SPELL: SCRIBE EXIT

* SCRIBE selects a spell to transfer from a magic-user scroll into a
spell book.

DISPLAY lists the magic that currently affects the party.  This
includes spells like bless or invisibility, plus effects like diseases. 
This is an important command because diseased characters cannot regain
hit points until they have a cure disease spell cast on them.

REST is identical to the Encamp Menu command.  Remember: A character's
spells are not memorized until he has rested the necessary time.

CIVILIZATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Towns provide many valuable services and supplies for the adventurer.
In these places you find inns, shops, training halls, temples,
and taverns.  Go to town not only to adventure, but also to purchase
new equipment and magic items, and to rest and regain spells and hit
points.

Inns are safe resting places where party members can recuperate and
regain spells and hit points.

Shops are places to buy and sell equipment using the Shop Menu.

SHOP MENU
~~~~~~~~~
BUY VIEW TAKE POOL SHARE APPRAISE EXIT

BUY displays the items available in the shop.  Highlight the items that
the active character will buy and select BUY.

VIEW displays the character screen with the SELL and ID commands 
available in the Items Menu.

* SELL causes the shopkeeper to make an offer on the highlighted item.
Sold items may not be recovered.

* ID is used to identify an item.  The shop charges 20 steel pieces for
the service.

TAKE is used to pick up coins from the party's money pool.  Select TAKE
and choose the type and amount of coins, gems, or jewelry to take.

POOL places all of the party members' coins, gems and jewelry into a pool 
which any member may use to make purchases.  Use the TAKE or SHARE 
commands to pick up coins, gems, and jewelry from the money pool.

SHARE picks up all the coins, gems, and jewelry from the pool and 
distributes even shares among the party.

APPRAISE determines the monetary value of any gems or jewelry the
character has.  Select Appraise, then choose a gem or item of jewelry,
and an appraisal and purchase offer is made.  Accept the offer and the
item is sold.  Reject the offer and the gem or piece of jewelry becomes
an item on the character's item list.  Gems and jewelry cannot be used
directly for purchases, they must be appraised and sold first.

Temples offer healing spells and perform other clerical services.  
Temple services are free.
     
TEMPLE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~
HEAL VIEW REPAIR EXIT
      
HEAL displays a list of the temple's healing spells.  Select HEAL, 
choose the character on whom to cast the spell, and then the spell to 
be cast.

VIEW is identical to the Adventure Menu command.

REPAIR has the clerics cast all of the healing and restorative spells
needed to return your party to full strength and health.

EXIT returns you to the street outside the temple.

Taverns are rowdy places full of gossip, stories and information.
Buy a round of drinks and listen to the stories.

Banks are used to store items and money for you.  The following menu
appears when you select this command.

BANK MENU

VIEW TAKE POOL MONEY ITEMS EXIT

VIEW is identical to the Adventure Menu command except that in the
Items Menu, DROP is replaced by DEPOSIT, which places items in storage.
To store, select ITEMS, highlight an item, then select DEPOSIT.

TAKE allows you to retrieve items and money from storage.  Select TAKE,
then select what to retrieve.

POOL places all of the party members' coins, gems, and jewelry into
storage. 

MONEY is used to deposit money in storage.

ITEMS takes you directly to the Items Menu of the active character 
where you can store items.

EXIT returns you to the street outside of the bank.
 
ENCOUNTERS
~~~~~~~~~~
When a party comes across monsters or NPCs, an encounter occurs.  If
the party attacks immediately, it may receive a bonus to combat 
initiative.  If the monsters surprise the party, the monsters can attack
immediately and get a bonus to their combat initiative.  If the monsters
do no attack immediately, the party can react by choosing from an 
Encounter Menu.  Encounter menus vary, listing options for each situation.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COMBAT WAIT FLEE ADVANCE

In this sample menu you have opportunities to fight immediately, wait and
see, run away, or move forward.

COMBAT
~~~~~~
In this sample menu you have opportunities to fight immediately, wait and
see, run away, or move forward.

Combat

In combat the computer chooses the active character.  Characters with
higher dexterity tend to go before characters with lower dexterity. 
A character may hold his action until later with the DELAY command. 
There is more detailed description of combat in the Adventurer's Journal.

The active character is centered on the screen at the start of his
combat segment.  The active character's name, hit points, AC, and current
weapon are displayed.  The Combat Menu lists the character's options.

COMBAT MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~
AIM USE CAST TURN GUARD QUICK 
DELAY BANDAGE YELL VIEW SPEED END

The arrow keys or mouse may be used to move a character to adjacent
squares.  While moving, the number of squares of available movement
remaining is displayed, as are the options UNDO and DONE.  UNDO returns
the character to his original square, but leaves intact any damage 
suffered by the character during the cancelled move.  DONE concludes
the character's movement and allows the selection of another option;
the character may subsequently continue moving with any remaining
movement allowance if no other option is selected.

AIM allows weapons or spells to be targeted.  When aiming a ranged
weapon, the range to the target is displayed above the menu bar.
If a character moves adjacent to an enemy, and has no more movement 
remaining, the AIM command can be used to attack with a melee weapon 
(sword, mace, etc.).  The AIM command can also be used to survey the 
condition of your party and enemies.  As you move the aim cursor over 
a character or monster, information about him is displayed on the right 
of your screen- use this to survey the battlefield.

AIM MENU
~~~~~~~~
NEXT PREV MANUAL TARGET CENTER EXIT

* NEXT is used to look at all possible targets, starting with the
closest target and then going to the next farthest and so on.  NEXT 
and PREV only indicates targets in the character's line of sight.

* PREV (Previous) is the opposite of the NEXT command.  Use this
command to look at the possible targets with the farthest target and
working back toward the character.  This command is most often used to 
select a target for a missile or magical attack.

* MANUAL permits the player to aim anywhere on the map.  However, only 
targets in the character's line of sight can actually be fired at.

* TARGET is used to fire a missile or spell at the enemy where the 
cursor is currently located.  This command can also be used to attack an 
adjacent enemy with a melee weapon (sword, mace, etc.).  If this command
is not displayed, the target is out of range, not in line of sight, or 
invisible.

* CENTER centers the screen around the cursor.  This is helpful when
targeting manually.  

* EXIT returns to the Combat Menu.

USE allows a character to activate an item without having to go
through the View Menu.  Items such as scrolls and wands are then 
targeted with the Aim Menu.

CAST is only available to spellcasters when they have spells available.  
The spellcaster selects from the list of available spells and then 
targets with AIM.  If the character has been hit recently, his 
concentration may be broken and the CAST command does not appear.

TURN is a clerical power that attempts to destroy undead monsters or
drive them away from the party.  This affects only weak undead
monsters.

GUARD sets a character to stand and attack the first enemy that moves
adjacent.  GUARD is only an option if a character is armed with a melee
weapon.

QUICK turns control of the character over to the computer.  Under
computer control, a fighting character with a readied missile weapon
will tends to hang back and attack from a distance.  If a character has
no readied missile weapon, he readies a melee weapon and charges. 
Single class magic-users fire missile weapons and cast spells if magic is
turned on (see your Data Card for details).  They never rush into close 
combat, even if all of their missile attacks are expended.

Consult your Data Card for instructions on regaining manual control
and toggling magic on and off for your computer.

DELAY causes the character to hold his turn until after the other
characters and monsters have acted.

BANDAGE gives first aid to a party member who is bleeding to death.
BANDAGE stops the bleeding and keeps the character from losing more
hit points.

YELL (kender only) orders an active kender character to taunt opponents.
If the taunt is successful all opponents become enraged, suffer a 
combat penalty, and direct as many attacks as possible at the yelling
character.

VIEW displays the character screen for VIEW Menu.  The USE command 
appears on the Items Menu to permit items such as wands to be used
in combat.

SPEED changes the game speed and is described under the ALT command in
the Encamp Menu.

END quits a character's turn.

After Combat
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When combat is over, you will see how many experience points each
character receives and then the Treasure Menu is displayed.  Most of 
the Treasure Menu commands work like the commands in the Shop Menus.

TREASURE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VIEW TAKE POOL SHARE DETECT EXIT

VIEW displays the character screen and View Menu.

TAKE permits the active character to pick up treasure from defeated
monsters.  This only appears if the monsters had a treasure or the
party has pooled its funds.  A character carrying a large number
of coins and heavy equipment may be slowed in combat.

TAKE MENU
~~~~~~~~~
ITEMS MONEY EXIT

* ITEMS lists the equipment in the treasure.  Frequently, the weapons
and armor used by monsters are not listed because they are poor quality
and not worth taking.

* MONEY displays the number and type of coins, gems and jewelry in the
treasure.  Indicate the type then number of items the active character
takes.
     
POOL places all of the party members' coins into the treasure.  Use the 
TAKE or SHARE commands to pick up coins from the treasure.

SHARE picks up the money treasure, divides it into shares, and distributes
it among the party.

DETECT has the active character cast a detect magic spell.  Magic items 
in the treasure or party will be marked with an '*'.  This command only 
appears if the active character has a detect magic spell available.

EXIT leaves the scene of the battle.  If any treasure remains, the
option to return to the Treasure Menu is displayed.

	 - Dark Queen Of Krynn - Journal Entries -


Journal Entry 1: The Hag's Problem

"My name is Eshalla. Not long ago. I was
shopping in the Imperial City, just mind-
ing my own business. All of a sudden, I
looked down and saw this coin purse
Iying in the street. I innocently picked it
up and this brutish minotaur grabbed me
by the arm and accused me of stealing
his purse! I broke free and called him an
ugly cow-faced spawn of a gnome. It was
all I could do! He took this quite personal-
ly, and roared in anger. He signaled to a
mage who was in his attendance, and
before I could run away . . . poof! I am as
you see me, a withered hag, with bad
teeth, and not a friend in the world."

Journal Entry 2: Dragonmen Justice

The elders of the dragonmen finish their
council and the eldest approaches you.
"Your talk, no money. Zarketh, no guide.
No money. You talk, no money, truth
talk?" His speech is hard to understand,
but Zarketh translates for you: "You may
give witness, but you will get no money in
return. And they will not permit me to be
guide, as I swore. 'Let the drylanders
flounder and sink,' they say."

Journal Entry 3: The Guard's Tale

"Eons ago, before the minotaurs arrived
on the shores o^f Kristophan and claimed
the city for their own, my wife and I were
member's of royalty. The minotaurs forced
us into slavery, and we labored each day
with barely enough food to survive.

"With our children starving, my beloved
wife stole some crusts of bread. An old
cow caught her and we were both quickly
sentenced to an etemity of agony. My wife
was locked in this cell, where each day
she perishes anew from hunger. I was
condemncd to stand guard at the door,
lest anyone try to rescue her from this
misery, The only thing that will break the
spell is the Heart-Shaped Key, which will
unlock the door and unite us again. Alas,
the key was hidden ages ago, somewhere
in the depths of the Tomb."

Journal Entry 4: Treachery

You awake with Baldric's strange music
still playing over and over in your heads.
All of your money is gone, as are several
of your magical items. Worst of all, the
priceless dragon scale is nowhere to be
found.

Journal Entry 5: The Elevator

Looking up, you see jagged pipes and
cracked walls as light trickles out of dozens
of hallways every ten feet up. Before you,
where some sort of intricate platfonm
used to be, sits a huge, hot air bag float-
ing above a large basket. Two gnomes,
dressed in jackets, caps and white gloves,
come to attention at your approach. They
awkwardly raise a hand to their foreheads
and bid you greetings, Tas says "They're
kind of new at this." Other gnomes
squeal, "More people to test the new lift!'"

The well dressed gnomes usher you in,
then nervously climb in with you. The
other gnome swings a large pipe over
from the wall and sets the end under the
bag floating over your heads. Ile yells,
"Clear!" and all of the gnomes fall to the
floor of the basket just as hot scalding
steam gushes out, blasting you in the
face. The bag rises, and you bump and
crash your way up the shaft.

You hear a voice below saying " . . . well,
if they weren't so tall.... "

Journal Entry 6: Tasselhoff Burrfoot

"After the War of the Lance, I was bored
and someone told me about the marak
kender, here on Taladas, I was curious, and
made my way over. There was this ship
and such. But have you met the marak?
They-they-they're as uninteresting as
life gets. They worry and complain and it's
hard to believe we're even related. Then a
passing dragon mentioned the old elves
here in Tualtin. So I came to visit."

Journal Entry 7: Thenol King

"Many come to tell me that my alliance
with the draconians is a mistake. They
rant how the draconians have some dark
purpose that will kill us all. Balderdash!
The power of Thenol is on the rise, and
they wish to rush with us to glory. See
how carefully they guard my own person
and Trandamere, my valued councilor, in
Hawkbluff.

"These same people used to tell me that
the priesthood of Hith was bad for
Thenol. And see how wrong they were.
Since the Cataclysm, we have been the
most resourceful and adaptable of peo-
ples. It is the great Thenolian gift."

Journal Entry 8: Landed

You followed the monsters that landed ashore.
They killed and they burned, but also found friends.
In the men who bring fact to the dire Sharkmen's Lore.

Journal Entry 9: Mirror

"We have something in common now,
travelers, We are both among the very few
to have foiled the careful plans of Raistlin
Majere. For that you have my grudging
respect, but no less hatred, of course.

"You think you have defeated me, but of
course you are quite wrong. You are mor-
tals, do not dare to think more than mor-
tal thoughts, lest you join Raistlin.

"One day you will grow old, and weak, or
foolish. Meanwhile my malice goes on
and on, growing stronger, deeper, more
subtle. Which is why I propose this bar-
gain to you."

Journal Entry 10: Fastillion Speaks

"Hmm, well then, I suppose it's a good
thing you came after all. There's evil at
work in Thenol to the south, you know.
Or I suppose you don't know and that's
why you're here, isn't it? Well, yes, there's
evil at work in Thenol, and Trandamere's
probably behind it. He's sworn to conquer
all Taladas, actually. Never was such a
nice guy, that Trandamere. The draconi-
ans are up to no good, and Thenol's
involved, no doubt about it.


"The Hulderfolk might help. Probably
would in fact. You can find them to the
east of Trilloman. But the price is high;
the price is always high. And you ought to
go find the Oracle of Tengur in the Tombs
of Kristophan, You can't beat the Oracle
for a good augury. And that's what you
need most likely, a good augury. I had the
keys to the inner chambers of the Tombs
here somewhere."

Journal Entry 11: A Saddened Captain Daenor

"l kept my vow but slew Crysia in its keep-
ing. My heart is heavy, for she was all in
Krynn that I had. Forgive me, friends, for
there is no greater tomment than failure."
The captain's eyes rise darkly, "Let these
draconians beware, for vengeance lurks
within my heart!"

Journal Entry 14: Shipwreck

"One of our number spied your ship in
distress and summoned others. We sped
like arrows, but when we arrived the ship
was already in pieces. We pulled all the
landfolk out, cast spells upon them, and
brought them to our city Naulidis. The
ship's crew proved to be a superstitious
lot, ill-suited to life undersea, and so we
sent them back to Ansalon. 'Tis strange to
me that they who spend their life on the
sea should be so fearful of what is under-
neath it, but so it  is."


Journal Entry 15: Staff

Strike down the gnomes and hesitate not,

Wield it's power, exert its might.

Strike down the gnomes and hesitate not.

Steel your nerve, you task is right.


Journal Entry 16: Void

You stand upon a vast undulating plain. It
seems featureless, but as you look more
closely, here and there, a bit of ruin juts
above the sand. Suddenly, on a wave of
despair, all the lore you've ever heard
about the Abyss comes flooding back into
your minds. You remember hearing about
how whole houses, ships, and cities,
doomed by pride, hate, or treachery, have
been thrown into the Abyss. And how
those doomed to sojoum here, end up
begging others for death, a boon that is
seldom granted. You recall hearing that    
the abishai, minions that dwell here,
maniacally claw each other to reach the   
Red Gate of Wyrllish, where they are rein-
carnated as draconians. You remember   
the immense price that the hero lluma      
made to banish Takhisis, creator of all    
evil, to this loathsome plane. And finally
you recall the folk wisdom about the
Abyss: "Easy to get into. Impossible to
leave."

Journal Entry 17: Tremor

"You may think us cowards, but we are
the noblest of creatures, toiling under our
Burden. Because we chose not to fight  . 
Takhisis' battles for her during the Wars  
of the Lance, she struck a scale from the
chest of Kothar. our leader. and cursed
away our confidence. Since then, the
leader of the red othlorx has had Kothar's
blemish, and our Burden shall remain
until the scale returned.

"But now the puny Thenolites invade our
realm! If not for the Burden, we would
drive them back in fear and ruin!" Tremor
lowers his head. "lt is not just. Baldranous
and the other othlorx defend us. as is
only right, but the Burden is so great, we
curse Takhisis every day!" As Tremor
turns away, you notice a scale missing
from his chest.

Journal Entry 18: Air Shaft

The sounds echo so much they are barely
recognizable. Nloises of machinery blend
with the clash of weapons and the bellow
of fire creatures. Then the unmistakable
shout of a kender taunting his foes rever-
berates through the shaft. Tasslehoff
Burrfoot is going into combat!

Journal Entry 19: The Draconians Scrooll

"Command Barath -

You are hereby granted leave to make any
and all arrangements with the Thenolian
govemment necessary to acquire their full
cooperation. Do not concem yourself with
the particulars of promises made, as we
have no intention of fulfilling them.
Consider the Thenols a tool to be used
and discarded when no longer useful.
Pass this infommation on as necessary to
subordinates, then destroy this message."
At the bottom of the scroll is an impres-
sive seal.

Journal Entry 20: The Black Robed One

The hood falls to the shoulders of the
black robed figure. The pale mage smiles
cruelly,"l see you have received my call. I
am glad to see you, my fine champions. I
need your help in order to succeed with
my plan." He casually waves a thin hand
before you. Suddenly, your vision begins
to blur and you begin to feel dizzy. "My
plan is to stop you before you can inter-
fere with Her Highness' plan. I see you
will not be a problem . . . not a problem
at all."

As you fall to your knees, you see the
mage's face twist and stretch into the
hideous countenance of a draconian.
As its coarse laughter fills the chamber,
everything goes black.

Journal Entry 21: The Great Oracle

"Centuries ago, a group of humans
marched from Styrillia in search of a new
home, Led by the great Kristophus, their
trek brought them here, where they
began construction of a city. But soon,
the Minotaurs arrived from far off Ansalon
and clairned this land for their own.

"Eragas the Brutish became the new
emperor and at his side was the human
Oracle of Tengur. The Oracle led the
emperor wisely in his conquests, and for
this, some have called him a traitor. That
is a lie! The Oracle used his position to
win rights for the humans and the other
conquered races. In exchange for his wis-
dom, the Minotaurs swore to enslave only
a fraction of those whose lands they
annexed. This is a promise that is kept to
this day.

"When he died, the Oracle's spirit was
hidden somewhere within the city walls,
until it could be put to good use once
again."

Journal Entry 22: The Truth

 "Don't believe everything you hear," con-
tinues Lord Trandamere, puffing on his
pipe as he relaxes on the sofa.
"Fastillion's had it in for me since I boot-
ed him out of Thenol for counterfeiting
coin of the realm. He made himself a size-
able fortune passing around fool's gold,
before we wised up to his tricks. Last I
heard, he was hanging his hat in a light-
house up in the League someplace,
mooning after some mermaid doxy.
Anyway, I could use your help, controlling
these dragonmen which are making life
miserable for folks around here.
Interested?"

Journal Entry 23: The Sensitive Minotaur

"Superiority is clearly the right of all mino-
taurs. But, do not let this great gift work
against you! How easy it is to belittle,
insult, or even trample our servants. It is
indeed our right to do so, but it may be in
our favor to show occasional restraint.

"It is natural for other races to be resent-
ful, or even to feel hatred toward their
betters. These feelings may lead to ineffi-
ciency and sloth. So next time, instead of
flogging your human slave, try a gentle
reprimand, or even a kind word, like, 'I
am not angry at you, only at the result of
your actions. This will instill more confi-
dence in your slave, which may actually
blossom into affection towards you.
Remember, a happy slave is a productive
slave.'

"In these modern times, we must be
more sensitive to the feelings of those
beneath us. It may be time to put behind
that old adage; 'If you weren't born with
homs, you were bom to be scomed.'"

Journal Entry 24: Anthela

"We had been holding off the Sharkmen
for months. But then the draconians
came. They were well ammed and orga-
nized, and they soon killed all who resist-
ed. When the fighting was over, they went
north. They said they would breed more
draconians on the shores of the Lava Sea.
It is a dreadful prospect.

"After the draconians left, the Sharkmen
began forcing us to build boats. Hundreds
and hundreds of boats. I don't know why
they want the boats; It makes no sense.
We might have thrown off the yoke of the
Sharkmen, but there are dragons in the
woods to the north, and no one dares to
oppose them.

"You must not stay here! Go to the great
gnome citadel of Aldinanachru on the
northwest of the Lava Sea. The gnomes
are enemies to the Minions of Hiteh.
Perhaps they can stop the draconians. I
love Bai'or dearly, but what is the good of
fighting the Sharkmen if the draconians
will soon conquer all the lands? Go now
and warn the gnomes. Do not incite the
wrath of the dragons to the north, or
there may be no one left when you retum
. . . no one left in Bai'or."

Journal Entry 26: Some Relief

"And the gnomes really want to help, too.
But the King said, "Help is completely out
of the question at this point in time!!" Tas
raises his head and mimics the King.
"Our own situation is a parliament of
importance!'" Captain Daenor begins to
smile and chuckle, then, as Tasslehoff
begins stumbling around the room wig-
gling his head and crashing into things,
Daenor bursts into hysterical laughter and
says, "The good gnome peoples do not
appreciate this unwarranted interruption
in their daily schedules!"

All of the past weeks of worry and
frustration pour out of Daenor in waves
of laughter.

Journal Entry 27: Grunschka's Oath

The she-dwarf grins crookedly, as she
holds the glowing Grathanitch in her
hand  My mother once told me, 'Every
man for himself!' and my time has come.
The Dark Queen is dead, the draconians
are all gone- You don't need me anymore
or this either,"

The stone s power courses through the
dwarf, filling her until she begins to swell.
"It's mine! I feel myself growing stronger,
bigger.  Soon,  I'll  be unbeatable. I could
be King of the World . . . I mean Queen."

Journal Entry 30: First Temple

The desolate valley is dominated by a
towering pillar of rock-Hawkbluff!
Beneath the crag are assembled the
shops, offices, and other buildings that
serve those who visit the abode of Lord
Trandamere, For miles now, there have
been a constant stream of zealous pil-
grims traveling to the great Temple of
Hith, high atop Hawkbluff. And amongst
them were the rich and well-armed pro-
cessions of Lords and Senators coming to
consult with the influential Trandamere.
But all on the road give wide berth to the
undead legions. Led by Hith fanatics and
necromancers, they patrol here and all
over Thenol.


Journal Entry 31: A Word Of Warning

 "Let's see, here is the village of Vinlans,
and to the east are the Sikoni Mountains.
The vast forest to the east of that is the
realm of the Hulderfolk. As strangers to
these lands, you must be wary of them.
Every thief might not be of the Hulderfolh,
but every Hulderfolk is a thief. They are
renowned for stealing wagons from mov-
ing caravans, horses from under riders,
and even children from their mother's
bosom. Stay far away, else these boons I
give you will go for naught. You must use
this key to enter the tombs of New Aurim
through the temple. Tell the priest that I
have sent you and you have come to
receive a special blessing."

Journal Entry 32: The Hideous Cavern

The foul cavern is covered with mounds
of filth, decay, and rotting corpses. Some
of the corpses are those of enormous
spiders and huge bats. Others are of
humanoid form. The stench is overwhelm-
ing. Torn and rotting flesh is mixed with
something even fouler. The only illumina-
tion is a pale green light which comes
from all around you. By the light of this
hideous glow, you suddenly see fomms ris-
ing from the mounds of filth.


Journal Entry 33: Talhook

"I woke.  Everyone was gone. Something
was wrong! I hid under the bed. Soon
some sea-devils came in. One was swim-
ming around and around the room, pro-
claiming to the others where he would
place his possessions, when he came to
rule. The others called him Lord Prince
Talhook, Then a sea dragon arrived! I
could not understand his talk, but Talhook
could, 'You will get your eggs back when
the elves are under my command,' he
said, "Not before. Obey me, or I will cook
your progeny.' After the dragon left, the
sea-devils all snickered."

Journal Entry 34: Friends

A dragon you'll meet, more mighty than all.

To stop its rampage, seek help from three
friends:

The black robed, the winged ones, and
also the small.

Journal Entry 35: Palace

The first thing you notice is that like the
rest of New Aurim, the Palace is decrepit.
Pools of water stain what once were
glossy marble floors. Cracks web the fine
stone walls. The smell of decay is every-
where. But ahead you see something
solid and new. The way is barred by a
guard station built of hard stone and
gates of cold steel.

Journal Entry 36:  A Letter From Tandamere

"It has come to my attention that the dra-
conians being sent by you to their encamp
ment at Hawkbluff have not been arriving.
Your report that younger creatures are too
willful for the Thenol Army is unacceptable.

"I have discussed this with Yanorak and
he will accept all returned draconians for
discipline and indoctrination, In the inter-
im, all of your warehouses, taverns, and
farms should be regularly patrolled to col-
lect these young draconian recruits and
return them to the rear door of the
palace.

"In addition, you are to assign a squad of
guards to escort each group of draconians
to Hawkbluff to prevent them from wan-
dering off. Hopefully this will greatly
improe the size of our draconian army."

Journal Entry 37: Advise

"Travel north, my friends, and soon you
will come upon an ancient lighthouse. For
eons, the light has guided sailors through
the dangerous shoals of the Tiderun.

"Legend has it that the tower is deserted,
except for whatever magic keeps it glow-
ing. But I know that there is a keeper, and
his wisdom is profound. Seek his aid and
you will be richly rewarded. But be
warned, strangers are not welcome in the
ancient tower, and reaching its pinnacle
may prove to be a dangerous task."

Journal Entry 38: Martha

Davik chatters incessantly through the
grill of the locked door. "Betray my
Trandamere, will you? No you won't. No
you won't. I'll show you what happens to
those who try to betray my Trandamere! I
built this place so I should know. I should.
Yes, I should. Now Martha here is very
old, very nasty when she's hungry. And I
dare say it's been many years since she
last ate. Yes, I dare say so. But that won't
be the case long now, will it be Martha
dear? No, not long at all. Not long at all.
Ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!"

Journal Entry 39: Sensilan's Final Words

Choking back tears, Daenor cradles the
old man's head. "Sensilan, my old friend.
It's all right now, it's almost over. Soon
you'll be back at the town."

"Daenor, it gives me great pleasure to see
your face again. But, it is too late for me, I
only have a few minutes left. Oteef and I
tried to escape, but we became lost in the
labyrinth. I pray that he has made it to
freedom. Daenor, have you found Crysia?"

The Captain bows his head in grief. "Yes,
we have found her. She is with . . . them."

Sensilan clutches his hand. "Daenor,
Crysia is caught in a powerful charrn spell.
She will flee from you and fight on the
side of evil." The old man begins to cough
violently, He wipes the blood from his lips
and continues, "When you find her, you
must break the spell or she will be lost
forever."

The old man begins to cough again and
then he is still. His head slumps against
Daenor's chest. The Captain begins to
sob quietly.

Journal Entry 40: The Bard

Your first warning is the tinkling of silver
bells, Then, who should walk up but a fat,
cheery bard, strumming a strident chord
on a Iyre. "Hello! I am Baldric. Pleased to
meet you! I was just going out to look for
work, but then I saw you. Perhaps I can
entertain you? Oh, you may wonder how
a mere bard can survive this swamp.
Well, I have some small talent for sooth-
ing the ruffled beast." With this, he strums
another cacophonous chord.

Journal Entry 41: Words

The bright key opens the door to the
crypt.

Within you will find some words you

Within its pages, words you must read.

Journal Entry 42: The War Council

The king's advisors file into the room and
take their seats at the enormous table.
King Telemandarklosminarus IV enters,
wrapped from head to toe in blankets.
"It's fr-eep- freezing in here!" Suddenly,
the door bursts open and Baldric stonms
into the room. "Friends! I come bearing
grave news. The draconian ammy is even
larger than we had feared!"

Driven by this new inforrnation, the
Council agrees to a threefold plan. The
elite corps of gnome wan iors. the
Company of the Dead, will ride the fire-
fleets and attack the lower region of the
Tower of Flame. The gnome army. accom-
panied by Baldric, Tremor, and Tasslehoff,
will march on the draconian camp to the
south. Meanwhile, you will ride the wind-
ships and infiltrate the Tower from the top
balconies while the Dragons guarantee
your safe entrance.

Just then, a gnome bursts into the room.
"The clouds over the Lava Sea have
become the face of the dark goddess
Erestem." There is no time to lose, the
Dark Queen has descended!

Journal Entry 43: Barber's Gossip

Ah, your hair is long I see, but not as
long as one of my recent customers. You
see, I cut the hair of Temple prisoners,
those prestigious enough to get a last
audience with His Lordship Trandamere.
Just the other day, I gave Davik the 'royal
treatment,' so to speak. You don't know
Davik? Why, he's the architect of the
Temple. Quite a celebrated man until he,
well, you know. Every so often, His
Eminent Lordship forgets how to open a
secret lock or where a particular passage
goes, and hauls Davik out of the dungeon
to demonstrate. Davik is a good cus-
tomer, he sits still, and doesn't talk much.
Well, there you go, fresh as can be!"

Journal Entry 44: Glorious Thenol!

After our arrny crushed the remains of the
Annach invaders surrounded at Neul, the
famed Thenolite anmy successfully
repulsed the attack by the minotaur cows
and their human toadies from across the
Drungar Frontier. Gathering the carrion of
our enemies, our beloved priests of Hith
assembled a massive army of undead
minotaurs and humans, Together with
specially trained servants of Hith, our
forces destroyed two ordines of the League
overrun during our advance through the
Spindle Gap. With the minotaurs in
retreat, our armies are again victorious
with the aid of Hith.

Peace is at hand, all give thanks to Hid-
dukel. You can help preserve the peace
with a prayer at the Hith Temple. If you're
down on your luck, ask for a special
blessing The Church of Hith is always
willing to help the less fortunate.

Journal Entry 45: Eric Strongbond

"Have you seen all the boats in our small
harbor? To think that just a few short
months ago. Bai'or was an insignificant
little village Now just look at us! Why, it
makes a man proud to be part of some-
thing like this. Soon we'll have a boat for
every man, woman, and child in Bai'or,
and the gods will reward us with great
riches. It just goes to show what can be
accomplished when everyone pulls together
and works as a team!"

Journal Entry 46:  Fastillion

"One of those opens the inner chambers
of the Tombs. That should help." He
glances down at his models and seems
lost in thought. Then he looks up. "I did
notice that you've been fighting beholders.
I can see the signs of it on your anmor.
There weren't supposed to be evil things
in my tower. The gorgons are supposed to
keep them out. I bet they were working
with the beholders weren't they? Hmff. I
really should get around to training them.
Oh well, time flies."

Journal Entry 47: The Mayor's Story

"Thank you. thank you, kind champions.
Those monsters destroyed our beautiful
town and then herded us on board a ship
like cattle. They forced Aolan, a great
sailor, to steer the ship, and to sail straight
across the ocean. We told them there was
nothing there. that they were mad. Then
they struck us and told us not to ask
questions.

"While the monsters were busy fighting
among themselves. Aolan steered the
ship onto the rocks. hoping to give us a
chance to escape. But fate was cruel. the
ship did not sink immediately. The mon-
sters were able to drag us ashore and into
these accursed caves. As for Aolan. they
rewarded his brave act by slitting his
throat. He died a hero.

"These monsters speak freely in front of
us. They constantly complain about not
being able to complete their great joumey
to the other side of the world. They say
the Dark Queen will be very displeased
with them. I hope she strikes them all
dead!

"As for that wench, Crysia, I know her
well. The traitor! They chose her from
among us, and soon we saw her caring
and grooming these disgusting monsters.
Now they allow her to move around
freely, as if she were one of them. She
deserves to be sent to the Abyss, where
she can spend etemity with her consorts."

Journal Entry 48: The Tavern Song

There was an old skeleton named Trey,

Who comes to life when they pray.

His handler cut down, while charging a
town,

He bounces 'gainst their wall to this day.

Journal Entry 49: Teary Goodbye

You overhear his wife saying, "You're
going to get yourself killed! You've never
even flown one of those stupid things
before! How am I supposed to raise our
children without you? "Perkelanamord
whispers, "If I don't go, our children may
never get the chance to grow up."

On that note, he abruptly turns and crash-
es headlong into the band drummer, who
falls over, thumping the tuba player in the
stomach with his mallet. With an echoing
"Pphblaaaat-ooofff," the tuba falls forward
knocking the band leader senseless with
a thud. The leader falls. arms flailing for
balance, and pokes the flutist in the eye
with his stick. Grimacing with pain, the
woman bites off the end of her flute and
swallows it, gasping and wheezing for air.
The marching song suddenly turns into a
hideous cacophony of groans, wheezes,
crashes, and thumps.

Perkelanamord hunies away muttering,
'Oops, sorry, I didn't..., sony," as his wife
falls screaming to the ground, tears blub-
bering down her round, little face.

Journal Entry 50: Instructions Of Preparation Of Black Pudding

"Black pudding is considered a delicacy in
the Fire Fleet, particulary after several
months on the Boiling Sea. As black pud-
ding is a ravenous cannivore, it first must
be caught, before being prepared for con-
sumption. Pages 2,976,341 through
3,123,882 of Volume LXXIII of
Thrapskaddidlogrumpanaciouslaxzitinity's
semi-authoritative study of monster hunt- 
ing, How people Try to Catch Monsters,
contain some 8,647 methods for acquir-
ing puddings, Many of these techniques
are not recommended, as they leave the
black pudding in an inedible fomm. Black
pudding must be kept in secure ceramic
containers prior to cooking, to limit dam-
age to culinary personnel. Special long-
handled asbestos ladles are ideal for
transporting black pudding from these
containers to the deck of the vessel. They
are also used for cooking the black pud-
ding. Black pudding is traditionally
cooked by immersi^On in boiling lava.
(Drikulomengrabaciflatorengulixfreibie,
Navigating the Buming Sea, page 323,
column 77), although the breath of a
cooperative red or gold dragon may be
substituted in a pinch. Four to five minutes
of immersion per pint of black pudding is
a reasonable cooking time; properly
cooked black pudding will have a syrupy,
gelatinous texture. Extreme Care must be
taken not to serve undercooked black
pudding; catastrophic cases of indigestion
may result from improper preparation.

After removing the black pudding from
the boiling lava, it must be set aside for
about three hours, until the coating of
basalt has fully congealed. After chipping
off the basalt, the black pudding should
be seasoned liberally with celebdil, ground
caradhras, and fanuidhol seeds, then
served hot- One quart of black pudding
should serve two to three gnomes, unless
they are especially hungry. Leftover black
pudding may be served for several weeks,
although its consistency will suffer.

"If you know where I can find Raistlin,

has happened. Without his help Tika will
die. I . . . I couldn't go on without her, not
after everything that has happened. I'm
sure you know where I can find my broth-
er. You must tell me!" Tears spring to the
big man's eyes as he slowly unsheathes
his sword and steps toward you.

Journal Entry 54: The General

"It has been but a short time since you so
valiantly helped us crush the draconian
army. Yet, such is the nature of these
creatures, that to sever the head from the
beast only invites it to grow another. My
emissaries have reported that some dra-
conian scum may have survived, and are
again gathering to the south. We must
know if this is true. Every day we wait is
foolhardy. for the danger may be growing.

"But, the good people of Palanthas
deserve the hard-won peace they now
enjoy. From time to time, I still see the
shadows of old fears fleeting across their
faces. I will not add to their troubles by
letting this unproven rumor reach their
ears. That is why I implore you, brave
heroes, to hasten to Caergoth, and dis-
cover what truth there is in these fearful
reports."

Journal Entry 55: The Strange Dragon

"I am without hope. Sssuch a thing hasss
never been done assss they did to me.
Curssse them.

"In the Tower of Flame they made my
eg,g, by the Ssstone of Grathanich. They
wanted a body for Eressstem. A perfect
body for a god to enter the world. Ssso
the draconiansss made me . . . but I
wasss flawed, a missstake, a failure. Yet
the foolsss continue. They will make oth-

Ssshe will rule the world. Curssse them!"

Journal Entry 56: Fable Of The Stone

"The god Reorx taught the smart gnomoi
art of the forge and machine, pleased he
be. He taught them to some humans and
not pleased he be. Stupid they were with
their power so cursed they becamed into
the stupid minoi soon.

"But the god was good and gave a gift to
King Aldinanachru. A stone he filled with
the light and power of the big moon
l.uminari. The Grathanich they were
proud to own.

"Then, the bad god Hiteh tricked some lit-
tle minoi into letting the stone go. It drifted
and burned, wreaked havoc to the west.
So to punish these minoi, it was made so
they must follow the stone from here to
there. And there was the big island, far
away, where one day the minoi stopped
to live under a mountain. Nevemmind."

Journal Entry 57: The Rescue

The old woman's eyes light up. "You
aren't monsters! You're people! Oh, than
Paladine! I escaped from the monsters
yesterday and fled into these lower caves,
hoping to find a way out. But the draconi-
ans pale in comparison to the monsters
that fill these cavems, and I was afraid to
go further. I found this wand and neck-
lace on a body I stumbled upon. With
them I was able to send many of these
foul creatures back to the Abyss. If the
draconians are no longer a threat, I'm
sure I can find my way to the mouth of
the cave. There is a small village not far
from here, and I can take refuge there.
Farewell, my friends." She turns to leave,
but then adds, "Oh, here, why don't you
take this.'" She removes the necklace and
hands it to you. "You certainly look like
you can handle yourselves, but you may
be able to use this."

Journal Entry 58: Tas's Final Words
 
Tas grips your arm feebly. "This wasn't

qoes limp, and quickly qrows cold.

Journal Entry 59: Captain's Story

"Hundreds of draconians invaded, pillag-

"Once they took what they wanted, a
horde of blue dragons leveled the build-

"I can wait no longer! I must set sail and

Journal Entry 60:  Greeting From A Hith Temple Servant

The man with a shaved head and loosely

Journal Entry 61:  Tasselhoff Explains

"After you guys left, I had the best time
with the elves But once, when we were
playing hide-and-seek, I hid so well the
elves never could find me! Then I found
my new friend- You'll like him, he's look-
ing for the draconians, too. He says we
need the gnome armies and windships to
stop these draconians but King Teleman-
something-or-other says he's much too
busy to be worrying about dragons.

"You see, there are two different kinds of
gnomes: the smart Gnomoi, gnomes who
do all the inventing and designing, and
the fun Minoi gnomes, like the ones in
Ansalon, who get stuck doing all the
work. Well, the King says he doesn't want
his people to be separated into classes
anymore, so he had all the gnomes just
switch jobs. And, boy, are things crazy in
there! And dangerous, too!

"Come on, I'll show you where the lift is,

"The book is a worthless text written one

"It had lain undisturbed for scores of
years, when suddenly one of our most

end, three of our guards lay dead, and the

"That is not all. I just leamed that

Journal Entry 65: Rubble

Before you lies the smoldering ruins of
Caergoth. Everything is blasted and burned.
once sturdy buildings are sagging and
melted, their stone runs like candle wax,

The sickening odor of bumt can~ion floats
on the gentle breeze as vultures circle
through the smoke,

Then you notice the fuming pools of acid
in the streets- Draconians have been here.
The only consolation is that some of them
paid for this abomination with their lives.

Journal Entry 66: The Grathanich

You quickly retrieve the small oblong box
from behind the mirror. The box contains
an oddly-shaped piece of gray stone, plain
and unadorned, yet seeming to pulsate
with hidden power.

"The Grathanich!" gasps Tasslehoff,
reaching out to the stone, "With this arti-
fact we can end the threat of the Dark
Queen right here-we can unmake the
race of draconians forever," He grasps the
stone and holds it up to the light. "But
what fun would that be?",  he continues
with a crooked grin. Before you can react,
he drops the stone into a pocket and
scampers off into the darkness.

Journal Entry 67: FlameWalls

The walls of the Tower's inner core flare
brightly, but there is no heat. Whatever
mighty spell fommed these walls, holds
the living flame trapped inside. After a
moment, you see shapes among the

ceiling, and floor swamn with fire crea-
tures, and that they are watching you.

Journal Entry 68:  Othlorx

"Back during the War of the Lance,
Takhisis called all her dragon children to
fight the forces of good. But here on
Taladas, many evil dragons refused her
call. Furious, she cursed each kind of evil
dragon with a particular affliction.

"When the forces of Takhisis stole the eggs
from the good dragons, many traveled to
Taladas to search for them. When it was
discovered that the eggs were on Ansalon
being corrupted into draconians, many of
the good dragons retumed to Ansalon to
fight in the War of the Lance. But not all
thought it wise to join in a human's war.
Those who stayed are shunned, quite
unfairly, by the other good dragons. Over
time, we outcast dragons have leamed to
work together against common dangers.
We call ourselves 'othlorx."'
