GAMEPLAY
~~~~~~~~
PHOTO SESSIONS
Darkman has designed the advanced technology required to disguise himself as
anyone he chooses. All he needs is a collection of photographs to feed into
his computer.
As Darkman you must attempt to take pictures of your adversaries in order to
aid your quest with disguises. Your camera film may contain shots but your
time is limited.
When you have taken all of the required photographs the computer will
analyze the pictures to extract the necessary information. You need at least
70% of the required data to obtain a disguise. The more data you supply the
longer the disguise will last.

LEVEL 1 - CHINATOWN
You are Darkman, hideously disfigured in a explosion manufactured by the
notorious mobster - Robert G. Durant.
You seek revenge but you will need money to finace this.
Whilst spying on Durant you hear of an impending pickup of illicit drug
money in Chinatown.
After attempting to disguise yourself as Durant you set off for Chinatown.
You must get the briefcase of money from Durant and eliminate the other
gangsters whilst seizing any money they hold.
Afterwards, you must escape to your hideaway.
Many gangsters will stand in your way - show no mercy!

LEVEL 2 - THE FACTORY
Trapped! You are trapped within the factory by Durant and his henchmen.
Escape is paramount but the only way is up to the roof.
However, Durant has supplied power to the ageing factory equipment making
every move hazardous. You must fight your way up to the roof collecting your
revitalising energy pack on the way.

LEVEL 3 - THE ROOFTOPS
Finally, you escape onto the rooftops but Durant is waiting for you - and he
is packing a helicopter armed with a grenade launcher. You must leap across
the rooftops to your lab and destroy it.

LEVEL 4 - THE WAREHOUSE LABORATORY
Descending to your lab you prime a set of gas cylinders with a nodding
bird-timer - a potentially devastating bobm. However, your exit is
surroundind so you must fight your way back to the roof battling the
increasingly ferocious gangsters.

LEVEL 5 - THE FREEWAY
Just as the warehouse explodes, you manage to leap up and grab a rope
hanging from Durant's helicopter. Swooping down to the busy freeway below
Durant lowers you into the line of traffic. You must Stay alive long enough
and you will enter an automatic sequence where you scramble aboard an oil
tanker. Here, you will tie the rope, connected to the helcopter, onto the
tanker.

LEVEL 6 - THE SKYSCRAPER
Durant has been terminated. Now turn your attention to the mastermind - the
evil Strack. He is the man responsible for your disfigurment and the
kidnapper of your true love Julie. Strack has retreated into a skyscraper,
still under construction. The skyscraper is teeming with Strack's henchmen
and riddled with traps. Fight and climb your way to the top for a final
confrontation with Strack. If you defeat and throw him from the skyscraper -
you will be free at last.
