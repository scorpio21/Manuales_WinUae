    You have to reconstitute a puzzle, which represent a young girl's face.
If you succeed in assembling the 9 pieces wich compose the puzzle, this one
will become a more decontracted view of the young girl. And more difficult
are the level, less the girl is dressed...

What you have to do:
    There's 2 modes avalide in dal'X: 1 player and 2 players. With one
player option, you have to defeat traps and monsters in 15 levels of
increasing difficulty. Of course, you'll be able to subdue your erotic
friend at the end of every odd levels (1, 3, 5, ... 15). But you have
a limited time to finish your mission...
    In 2 players mode, both plays in the same ground. Each one have to
finish the puzzle before the other, in order to see his girl undressing
to congratulate him. To win a match,you have to win 2 rounds, it means that
the match is composed of 2 rounds (if the same player win the 2 rounds)
or of 3 rounds, and in this case, the winner is the player who have won 2
rounds...

Start the game:
    To start playing, press fire button or Enter key when the title screen
appear. A new picture will appear showing the 2 players. To choice the
number of player, just press F1 (one player) or F2 (two players).

Recovering puzzle's pieces:
    To win, you must find and bring back the 9 pieces composing the puzzle
and representing your erotic friend's face.
    To pick up a piece, just pass on it. Warning: a player can carry only
one piece in the same time. In two players game, each one can just pick up
his own piece of puzzle (see the color: blue or red).
    Put down your piece in your square (3 paving stones on 3) by moving on
the correct place for the currents piece you have (the piece is put down
automatically, as soon as you pass (and stay) in the correct place!), and
you can continue and search for other pieces.

The ground:
    Each level is composed of traps you have to avoid or to fight. The first
of those traps is the ground nature:
- Moving paving stone: as soon as the player have passed on it, it turn into
a deep crack. And the only sollution to pass it is having a "condom" bonus.
- Stairs, slides, walls: sometimes dangerous because they are one-way.
Senses is showed using arrows puted in closeness. When you start going here,
you can't stop the movement. However it is possible to stop temporarily your
progress on a stairs, by turning the joystick in the opposite of the
progression's sense (usefull when a monsters could disturb you!)
- Swamp: make you lose few time.
- Stake: make you lose more time.
- Switch: if you pass on a red OFF switch, it will turn green and will
make appear others paving stones... elsewhere, wich allow you to exit
a quite dangerous situation.
- Transporter: press Fire when you're on this kind of paving stone and you
will be imediatly transported in another place.

Bonnus/malus:
- Blue bubble: this pastilles make increase your time level. Be careful,
because if this level reach 0, you'll loose a life (In two player mode, you
won't loose a life but won't be able to act during a small time).
- Pink Bubble: add 1 live.
- Condom: allow you to pass on moving paving stones. Each time you pass a
crack with a condom, you'll loose one condom. At the end of each level,
all condom you have in rest will increase your score.
- Diamonds: different variety wich have all positive effects: time stop,
speed increasing, ...
- Double and triple shoot: by picking up this object (arrow form) you'll
see the power of your shoot increasing.
- Clock: put maximum time.
- Inflatable Vaudou Doll: in 1 player mode, it behave as the dead head, but
in 2 players mode it make drop the other player time.
- Dead Head: its effects are allways negatives and random: low speed, time
loosing, shoot reduction or suppression, ...

Monsters:
    Collisions with monsters make you loose time function of the monster's
power.
    You can stop them, even kill them, by shooting at their; it's the number
of well-done shoots ever made who say if you have just stop the monster or
killed him.
    Each shoot cost time, but can bring time too if you hit your target.
    A special monster, "time sower", help you in putting additing time
pastilles.

Two players game:
    Opponents move on the half screen. If a player loose all his energy,
he's not killed, but he must stay inactive during few seconds - until he
comes round.
    Shoots can't hurt the other player.
    The fight contains 5 parts. Each one is won by the player who have won
2 rounds on 3 or the first who won 2 rounds.
    The first player who win 2 round win the part and can show his promised.
After this first picture, players fight in an another duel which, as soon
as a player win 2 round, will be followed by another sexy picture. And this,
5 times followed...

Game control:
    Movements are easy: just use joysticks (number 1 for player 1 and 2 for
player 2) and to shoot (or shoot/jump in bonus phase) using the fire button.
    F10: select for sound effects or not.
    F9: game pause. You just have to press another key to continue.
    Esc: escape from the current part.

Choice of the start level:
    This game is composed of 15 variable difficulty levels, with less or
more monsters, bonus/malus and less or more andvataging geometrical
configuration. To select the start level, press SPACE when the tittle
screen appear. Then come a text asking you a password. If you have a
password, type it and press ENTER. The game will start at the level
associated to the password. If you don't type a correct password or if
you don't type it correctly, you'll start at the first level.
NB: those passwords are composed of 6 capital letters. To get passwords,
you must have finished the previous level.
For example, we give you the first password (level 2) wich is "BOMB X".
To use it, just press space in title screen, type it in capital letter
and press ENTER to validate...

High-scores board:
    When you play in "1 player" mode, you can save your scores in memory
(but, they'll be lose as soon as you quit the game (NfA: it's so hard to
save a fuckin lame short file on the disk!)). If you make a quite good
score, you'll be able to enter your name in Dal'X High Scores Board. Scores
are in function of the time needed to finish each level, the number of bonus
collected and the number of monsters killed.

Note from Achernar to all English: I'm very sorry for my lame English!
