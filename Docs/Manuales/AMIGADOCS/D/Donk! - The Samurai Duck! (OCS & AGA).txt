PLAYING THE GAME
================

You must guide Donk around the level to collect the gems. On each level
aliens will try to stop him. Donk must use his samurai skills to defeat them
but as not all aliens can be killed, he must be careful!

Donk has three chances before he loses a life. The top and bottom of the 
screen status bars by changing colour how many more wounds he can endure 
before losing a life - blue = 3, magenta = 2, red = 1.

In two player mode the bar at the top relates to Player One and the bar at the
bottom to Player Two.


EGGSTRA SPECIALS
================

Along the way Donk will find some Eggciting secrets, some friendly, some mean,
some duck-defying...

GEMS                - All the gems must be collected to open the normal exit
                      on every level.
RESTART POINT       - found within the level. Donk will return to this point
                      when he loses a life.
INVISIBLE PLATFORMS - when found, these will magically appear
SWITCH              - switsches are used to turn switchable blocks on and off
SWITCHABLE BLOCK    - Donk can pass these when these are turned off but not
                      when they are turned on.
PITS                - these are never friendly places, not the place for a 
                      refreshing swim!
MAP                 - Allows Donk to view the whole level (1 player mode only)
TELEPORT            - teleport stations can be used once to swap the two 
                      players positions. In two player mode only.
HIDDEN EXIT         - These open special paths on the adventure map. Not
                      every level has a hidden exit.
EXIT                - Normal exit that can only be opened by collecting all
                      the gems. Every level has a normal exit. Opens normal
                      paths on the Adventure Map.
DRILLABLE PLATFORMS - Donk can jump throught the weak points in platforms

When all the gems have been collected the gems total is replaced by a time
limit that stats at 90 seconds and counts down. The exit will be opened and
Donk must escape before the time runs out.

        M or 7  - return to adventure map, can only be used whilst paused.

At the end of the level, each player is given the following points:

        GEMS=   100 points
        ALIENS= 500 points
        TIME=   1000 points per second remaining when Donk escaped from the
                level
These are added onto the players score at the bottom of the screen.


CONTINUE
========

Donk starts with 7 lives but extra lives can be collected. Once all of his 
lives have been used up you will have the chance to continue. Push the 
joystick left to return to the adventure map. Donk will then be able to 
continue on the same level. Push the joystick right to return to the title
page.
