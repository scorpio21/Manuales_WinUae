                             DEVIOUS DESIGNS
                             ===============

    Dr.Devious, the world renowned abstract scientist, has gone insane!
   No one really minded when wild geometric cloud formations appeared
   over his laboratory, however, there were a few objections when the 
   Pentagon became a square and the Kremlin was cubed!

    Dr.Devious' obsession stems back to his acquisition of a cubist
   painting by Picasso which he hung in his Laboratory.  He was so
   inspired by this painting that his love for geometric forms became
   a obessive.  Then, one morning, a sinister idea leapt into his
   mind, he would invent a machine that could cube the Earth!
   
    But before he can implement his plan, he has to experiment, so he
   tests his machine on world famous structures and objects.  When he
   is satisfied with his machine he intends to proceed with his evil
   master plan.

    You play J.J. Maverick - the only person that can stop the Doctor
   cubing the World!

                            THE CONTROLS!
                           -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    Within the game there are three joystick modes, these are NORMAL,
   GRABBIN' and CARRYING.

    You start the game in NORMAL mode, from here you can push ....

                           /\/ormal /\/\ode
                           ----------------

    (When not near a block)

       LEFT/RIGHT   J.J. Will walk Left or Right.
               UP   J.J. Will Jump.
             FIRE   Shoot current weapon.

    (When next to a block!)
 
    TOWARDS BLOCK   Climb onto block.
             FIRE   Grab Block, takes you to GRABBIN' MODE.
                    Note:press fire again to release block.

                           Grabbin' /\/\ode
                           ----------------

  AWAY FROM BLOCK   Pull Block.
             FIRE   Release Block.
               Up   Lift Block; takes you to carrying mode.

                           Carrying /\/\ode
                           ----------------

       LEFT/RIGHT   Carry block Left or Right
             DOWN   Place block in front of J.J. at his feet
   FIRE+Direction   Throw block in that direction


                              /\  /
                             /  \/ O T E!
                            ()()()()()()()

    If there is a block that J.J. can stand on as well as touch with
   his hands, such as the L shape blocks like those found in Tetris,
   he will be able to grab hold of the block and pull it thru mid-air.

                            
                                  /\  /
                          B I G  /  \/ O T E!
                         ()()()()()()()()()()

    The joystick directions rotate with J.J. e.g if J.J. is standing on
   the floor down towards the bottom of the screen.  However if he is on
   a wall down towards the outside of the screen or towards his feet, 
   whichever way you want to look at it!

                                 THE END
                                 =======
