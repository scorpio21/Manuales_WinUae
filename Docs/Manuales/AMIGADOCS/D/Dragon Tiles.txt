General Info.
=============

I originally programmed this game using AMOS basic, but soon found it would
not run on an unexpanded computer.

This version is totally re-written in assembly language using the excellent
Devpac 3 package from Hisoft Software. It should run on any amiga with any
version of workbench or kickstart.

Instructions.
=============

In the following instructions the term 'Clicking the Mouse' means pressing
the left hand mouse button.

INTRO SCREEN.
When the game has finished loading a title screen will appear with some
music in the background. Clicking the mouse at this stage will take you to
the level selection screen. If you wish to leave this game and return to the
CLI or Workbench then you must click the mouse in the top left hand corner
of the screen.

LEVEL SELECTION SCREEN.
At the top of this screen you should see 15 boxs which contain the different
levels available. All you have to do is click the left mouse button in one
of these boxs, this will then take you to the actual game screen.

The difficulty of the levels ranges from very easy to very hard, there is
no order to which the levels have been setup, you will have to find out
which is which for yourself.

hint: probably the easiest level is the second box of the second row

THE GAME.
You should now see a pile of tiles on the screen, This pile contains 120
tiles. There will always be 4 of each tile in a pile. The pile can be up to
4 tiles high, the higher the tile is the lighter the shade of blue.

The object of the game is to remove all tiles from the screen. You can only
remove two tiles at a time and both must have the same picture. To make
things more difficult you can only select a tile if it has an empty place
on either its left or right hand 

If you get to a position in which you can remove no further tiles then all
you can do is click the mouse in the stop box, this will return you to the
intro screen.

I hope you enjoy this game, if you have any comments or suggestions about
this game then please send them to me at the following address.
