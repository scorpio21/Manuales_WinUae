                WEAPONS - HANDY OPPORTUNITIES TO FIGHT HARDER

Fighting through the hostile terrain, Billy and Jimmy will encounter thugs
and villians (see the Cast List for details). Some of them will be armed,
and it may be possible to force them to drop their weapons to the floor.
Every now and again you'll find that a careless hoodlum had left a useful
weapon lying on the ground. Whenever you get the chance, pick up a weapon
and put it to use.

Spades, daggers, powerballs, boxes, chains, grenades, logs and whips can
all be wielded to good effect against the marauding hordes. Be sure to take
advantage of every opportunity to even the odds. As skilled fighters, Billy
and Lee immediately become masters of any weaponry you can get into their
hands.

                             THE STORY CONTINUES
			     -------------------

Things disn't go too well after all. When the Black Warriors gang kidnapped
Marian and sparked off the previous expedition onto the city streets, her
sweetheart Billy Lee saved the day. With the help of his brother, Jimmy,
Billy managed to rescue Marian and dispose of the evil leader of the Black
Warriors - a gun-toting villian by the name of Willy.

At the end of DOUBLE DRAGON I, the city streets had been rendered a much
safer place with the Black Warriors put permanently out of action. Or so
everyone thought.

Billy and Jimmy didn't kill ALL the Warriors. The solitary surviving member
of the gang nursed herself back to health, and spent several years studying
ancient oriental arts of healing. At the far fringes of the ancient medical
science she studied - magic powerful enough to reincarnate the dead. Linda,
for it was she, perfected her powers of Undhai, or magic medicine, to the
point where she had the ability to raise the mortal remains of the dead.
She learnt how to breathe life back into the human remains left behind by
souls long departed from this planet.

No prizes for guessing what Linda's main aim was. But first, she practised
her powers on the remains of a few dead yobboes, lowly members of the Black
Warriors gang, to make sure she had full mastery of the magic before
concentrating on raising Willy himself. Before the Brothers Lee realised
what was happening, the Black Warriors were up to full strength once more
and back in action. And it seems Linda's early experiments produced one or
two mutated gand members...

Driven by a powerful urge for revenge (sharpened by five years of being
dead) Willy ordered his minions to kidnap Marian once more. Within days of
his command being issued, the hapless girl found herself transported to
Willy's secret base. Never a thug to make the same mistake twice, Willy
immediately murdered Marian and locked her remains in a magic field
conjured up by Linda. (Who achieved remarkably rapid promotion within the
hierarchy of the Black Warriors as a result of her success in getting Will
up and about.)

Once again, the twins set out on a quest to rescue Marian - but this time
their mission is likely to be even more complicated. Starting out in the
city's heliport, Billy and Jimmy have to battle their way down a life
shaft, into and through a warehouse and out into the open countryside.
Fighting their way up a cliff, they reach a hilltop where a door to Willy's
secret base is hidden. Marian's body lies entombed in the centre of his
hideout, and to stand any chance of rescuing her and returning her soul to
this world, the heroes have to kill Willy and then do battle with their own
tortured souls...

Only when the Warriors and Willy have been defeated can the magic field
that shields Marian's remains be penetrated. The Lees are twins, but they
are also the SEVENTH SONS OF A SEVENTH SONS (Bit of MAIDEN here, eh?), so
have magical powers bestowed on them as their Shinto birthright. When they
have defeated their own souls in combat, they will draw sufficient power
from the ether to enact a Shinto resurrection ceremony and restore Marian
to life.

With the Warriors finally eradicated and Marian restored to the peak of
health, Billy, Jimmy and Marian will pass through a portal into another
space-time continuum and - hopefully - live a long and peaceful life
together.

                              PLAYING THE GAME
			      ----------------

Fight, fight and fight some more is the only way to rescue Marian. Billy
can stage a one-brother rescue mission, but the chances of success are much
higher if he can enter the fray with Jimmy by his side. (If two players
embark on the quest to raise Marian, then they should work as a team and
remember to keep an eye on their respective partners.)

Each of the five game sections has to be completed before the timer above
the main screen reaches zero - or the heroes lose one of their precious
Shinto lives. Hits from members of the Black Warrior wrecking crew also
reduce the Lees' lifeforce, taking power from the brothers' two lifeforce
displays shown below the screen. The total number of lives Billy and Jimmy
have at their disposal is shown by a digital readout immediately above
their lifeforce meters.

The route to Marian's location takes the battling boys relentlessly to the
right of the screen. The only way to move from one section of the play area
to the next is to kill off all the Warriors lurking there - once the zone
is empty the Guiding Hand will appear in the skies, urging Billy and Jimmy
to move to the next point.

As Jimmy and Billy have led such clean, honest lives, the Shinto Powers
that rule the universe have granted them a limited level of immortality to
be going on with. (Should they succeed in the mission, full Shinto Deity
status is accorded to them before they move on to another space-time
continuum.) If one of the brothers Lee should meet an untimely end, it is
possible to activate one of the five immortality credits the Shinto Powers
have granted - the quest can continue with a freshly rejuvenated hero.
