"It was a hot night in da city. Even da pteradactyle were sleep'n
on der perches. Buttin much was storing. I sat back on my chair
and taught about life. It stinks. Business had been bad recently,
ever since my partner, Dirk Dino had met wid an `accident' when
investigating da big underworld boss `King' Rex. After dat little
incident da woik had dried up. A few missin' sabre tooth tigers,
one or two security jobs but nuffin else. Den suddenly, da door
burst open. At last, a real job - find out who's been stealing 
from the company. Somethin' to get ma teeth into. I stayed calm,
nonchalant even. But i took da job on. If this woiks out it could
be my chance to git back on top. Ta make somethin' of myself again.
ta get a life."

Sherloch Ness P.I August 19th 75,000,000 B.C.
This is your chance to help Sherloch Ness - Private Investigator, 
to get his life together again. If you can help him to solve this
first case then more will surely follow.
In fact there are four "cases" that Sherloch has to solve with the
use of his trusty camera. These cases involve collecting evidence,
tracing and finally photographing the guilty party red handed. 
however, all is not as straight forward as it may seem and you are 
going to have to solve some fiendish puzzles before success is yours.
The controls are as usual - left, right and jump. But being a 
dinosaur, Sherloch is naturally a good digger (well-they could have
been!). 

Certain points of the ground look a little different to
the rest. Pulling down at this point will set Sherloch digging madly.
Spread about the playing area are many flashbulb icons you can use
in your camera to "freeze" the bad guys for a few moments but use
them sparingly as the supply is limited. At the end of each level,
if you have collected all the evidence (you can see how much you need
to catch the perpertrator in the act. Use the camera sight to
photograph the face of the bad guy. It must be full face and you 
only have a limited number of shots (depending on how you did on the
previous level). On the second level you have to get both the tiger
and the bird in the same shot. The third level involves getting both
hunter and prey, and on the fourth level a whirling dino-monster has
to be caught full on.
