                      DEMON WARS


ABOUT THE GAME:
---------------

 I was glad to see this game come out. If any of you are famuliar with the
board-game "STRATEGO", then you will already be famuliar with this game 
also, because they are the same (just different characters!).
 
( The real legit "STRATEGO" never got released on the AMIGA for some
  reason... Too Bad.. That is why I was glad to see this game come out.. 
  It has a MODEM OPTION just like "STRATEGO" was gonna have! )



OBJECT OF GAME:
---------------
 
 The Object of the game is simple.. CAPTURE YOUR ENEMIES GEM!
 
(In "STRATEGO" it was "CAPTURE THE FLAG"!)



RULES OF PLAY #1
----------------
 
  The way this game is played is in turns. Before the game starts the 
players must "SETUP" thier pieces.. (see "SETUP")  Each Player the takes
a turn moving a piece either Horizontal or Vertically on the battlefield.
(Diagonal moves are not allowed).
 


SETUP:
------

 When you start a new game the board will load up with its default
positions. Taking a look at this map will undoubtfully bring to your
attention that this is not a very secure SETUP.. 
 
  To SETUP the pieces the way you want, you must "SWAP" pieces..
 
This is done by:
 
    #1 Click on piece #1 that you want to move with "LEFT-Mouse Button"
    #2 Click om piece #2 & press "RIGHT-Mouse Button" .. 
    #3 The 2 pieces are then SWAPED..
 
    Do this as many times (with as many pieces) as you want until you
  have a setup that you like.. 
 
TO EXIT SETUP & START GAME:
 
     #1 Click "LEFT-Mouse Button" on any piece...
     #2 Click "RIGHT-Mouse Button" on the same piece!
 
Game will then start, and you are now in the MOVEMENT PHASE of the game!




MOVEMENT:
---------
 
   Movement is done by:
 
    #1 Click "LEFT-Mouse Button" on any piece...
    #2 Click "RIGHT-Mouse Button" on the square to move to.

NOTE: The square you are moving to must:
 
       A) Be empty of any other of "YOUR PIECES"
       B) Be empty of any land disformaties. (must be flat!)
       C) Must be to the IMMEDIATE horizontal or vertical position of the
          piece you want to move!
  



ABOUT THE PIECES:
-----------------

  Every piece has a RANK.. (That is, much like our own army, some pieces
are more powerful than others...  
 
LISTING OF RANKS: (this may not be 100% correct!, i did not have a manual
                   & figured this game out on my own, SO BARE WITH ME! )

1> CAT WOMAN  (STRONGEST)
2> Wizard 
3> Dragon
4> Red Death
5> Witch
6> Zombi
7> Knight
8> Dwarf
9> Dog
10> SNAKE  ( WEAKEST >> But also Stongest?? )

11> CROSSBONES (Cant move.. Are death to any pice that attacks them).
12> GEM        (Cant move.. If your GEM is found, you loose the game!)

 NOTE ABOUT SNAKE:
------------------
 
  Yes.. The "SNAKE" is the weakest piece on the board.. An attack from
"ANY" piece will kill him..
 
     BUT:
 
He is the only piece on the board that can kill the "CAT WOMAN" without
dieing.. ( A "CAT WOMAN" can kill a "CAT WOMAN", but both pieces will
die & be removed from play).
 
If the "SNAKE" attacks "CAT WOMAN" - CAT WOMAN DIES!
If "CAT WOMAN" attacks "SNAKE"     - SNAKE DIES!


So basically the job of the "SNAKE" is to find the "CAT WOMAN" & try to get
close enough to her to strike the 1st blow. Once your opponents CAT WOMAN
is dead, the your "SNAKE" is useless.
 
(THE "SNAKE" IS THE EQUIVLENT TO THE "SPY" IN "STRATEGO")




NOTE ABOUT CROSSBONES:
----------------------

 The "CROSSBONES" are instant death to any piece that is unlucky enought to
attack them.. They can not move & are generally used to protect your "GEM".


NOTE:  This game is so much like STRATEGO, that it's uncanny. Now in
       "STRATEGO" you had ONE piece that was capable of destroying the
       "BOMBS" without dieing. (He was #8 - THE MINER)

       It only makes sense that since this game is so close in simularities
       that there must be ONE piece capable of destoying the CROSSBONES
       without dieing.. ( My guess is that its the "DOG" ... Although I
       have not had a chance to verify this! )



ATTACKING A PIECE:
------------------

  To ATTACK a piece, just move upon it!  (read "MOVEMENT")
 
 The Stronger of the 2 pieces will remain on the square (& the weaker will
naturally be removed from the game).
 
  If both pieces are of the same "RANK" (read "ABOUT THE PIECES"), then
both pieces will be removed from the game, & the square will remain empty 
until anoth piece moves upon it.
