           THE DOX FOR DRAGONFLIGHT..TYPED BY SCOOTER--GENESIS
           ---------------------------------------------------
                            THE NEW BEGINNING



BLADUS LOOKED IN THE MIRROR IN AWE AT HIS OWN PHYSIQUE.EVERY MORNING HE WOULD
DO THIS,AND EACH TIME HE WOULD BE GENUINELY STUNNED BY WHAT HE SAW: THE RATHER
SQUARE APPEARENCE OF AN OBVIUSOULY VERY POWERFUL TALL MAN WITH LONG BLONDE HAIR
AND SHINY BLUE EYE`S.

HE BULGED THE MUSCLES OF HIS UPPER ARM AND SIGHED DEEPLY. THE IMAGES OF HIS
WORST NIGHTMARES ONCE AGAIN TURNED OUT NOT TO HAVE BECOME A HORRID TRUTH.HIS
MIGHTY BICEPS WERE STILL THERE FOR EVERYBODY-AND HIMSELF-TO BE ADMIRED.

BLADUS HAFSTED-SON WAS BORN IN PORT PYLON,ON THE SOUTH EAST PENINSULA OF
ONTAFLARETH ON THE SOUTHERN SEA,HE HAD`NT LIVED THERE LONG, FOR HIS PARENTS
WERE KILLED BY PIRATES WHEN HE WAS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD. AFTER THAT HE WAS RAISED
BY A TUTOR AT PEGANA UNIVERSITY BY THE NAME OF DAMBRANO-A WISE DWARF THAT WAS
ALREADY OLD WHEN HE TOOK UPON HIMSELF THAT TASK.

HE OPENED THE WINDOW AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH OF MORNING AIR,WHICH SEMED TO FILL
HIS VERY LUNGS WITH A POWER YER COMMON INUNIQUE. THE SUN COULD BE SEEN ABOUT TO
RISE BEHIND SOME OF THE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS, AND DARK THREADS OF CLOUDS WERE
SCATTERED BY THE FRESH MORNING BREEZE AS IF HAUNTED BY ARMIES. TO BE REPLACED
BY A CLEAR BLUE SKY WITH HINTS OF PURPLE AND RED BLAZES AS IF ARMIES SEEMED TO
BESIEGE THE ROOF TOPS.

DOWN AT THE YARD HE COULD SEE A BENT FIGURE STANDING,CLAD IN AN OCHRE ROBE.
WITH A FLINCH HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED.


BE IN THE YARD AT DAWN, DUMBRANO HAD SAID THE EVENING BEFORE. DONT BE LATE AS
IT IS AN IMPORTANT THING THAT I WISH TO TELL YOU.`DAMNATION`..HE HURRIED TO
WASH HIMSELF, AFTER WHICH HE DASHED DOWN THE STAIRS TO MEET THE OLD DWARF.

LECKIE NEE THUNEB EY?...RINAKLES SAVORLIN-SON SHOOK AWOKE AS HE READ THIS LINE
AND WONDERED HOW IT COULD BE THAT IT WAS THE FIRST THING HE SAW THAT DAY, HE
FOUND THAT HE WAS LYING ON AN OLD BOOK,WRITTEN IN ONE OF THE OLDER ELVISH
TONGUES HE WAS BEING TAUGHT-OBVIOUSLY HE HAD DROPPED TO SLEEP ON IT LAST
NIGHT.PROBALY,THIS WAS ALSO THE REASON WHY HIS JAW ACHED.

EVER SINCE CHILDHOOD, OF WHICH HE ONLY REMEMBERED THE PART AFTER HE WAS TAKEN
IN BY DAMBRANO WHEN HIS PARENTS HAD DIED IN A TERRIBLE RAGE OF THE BUBONIC
PLAGUE THAT HAD RAVISHED HIS TOWNTOWN OF PORT PYLON,HE HAD BEEN TROUBLED BY
GUSTS OF SLEEP WASHING OVER HIM-SOMETHING HIS FELLOW STUDENTS REFERRED TO AS
NAP-ATTACKS IN JEST.HIS LIFE SEEMED LIKE A CONSTANT DREAM TO OTHERS,REALLY,
SINCE HE COULD MOST OF THE TIME BE FOUND WANDERING AROUND PEGANA UNIVERSITY IN
DEEP THOUGHT OF MAGIC AND POETRY RATHER THAN SOMETHING ELSE.

RINAKLES WAS SOME WHAT OF A SLENDER MAN, WITH LARGE EYES THAT SEEMED TO BE
CONSTANTLY RADIATING WITH INSPIRED JOY OF LIFE.IN SPITE OF HIS YOUNG AGE, HIS
HAIR WAS ALREADY VEERING TOWARDS GREY.AS HE SAT ERECT FUMBLING HIS GOATEE, HE
WAS IMMEDIATELY ABSORBED BY THE SUN THAT WAS NOW THROWING ITS FIRST RAYS OF
FEEBLE MORNING LIGHT OVER THE ROOF TOPS OF SOME OF THE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS.

AH...HOW SIMPLE YET BEAUTIFUL EACH SUNRISE APPEARED TO HIM,THIS MORNING IN
PARTICULAR. THE CLOUDS HAD THEIR OWN LITTLE WAYS OF SEEMING TO ORNAMENT THE
SUN,SEEMING TO ENCROWN IT IN A TENDER EMBRACE WITH LATTERS OF PINK, PURPLE AND
RED IN ALL DIFFERENT SHADES. THE SIGHT GLADDENED RINAKLES HEART AND MADE HIM
FEEL HE COULD HANDLE ANYTHING THAT FATE WOULD THROW AT HIM THAT DAY.THERE WAS
MAGIC IN THE AIR, AND THERE HAD ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING ABOUT MAGIC THAT HE HAD
LOVED-IN A WAY EVEN FAR SUPERIOR TO THE SHEER JOY OF BEHOLDING A BEAUTIFULL
DAWN LIKE THIS MORNING....`DAWN`?. BE IN THE YARD AT DAWN HIS OLD TUTOR HAD
TOLD HIM THE EVENING BEFORE...DONT BE LATE FOR ITS IMPORTANT WHAT I HAVE TO
TELL YOU.

OOOPS..THIS BEAUTIFUL MORNING HAD ITS FIRST TOUCH OF FAILURE ALREADY. HE
QUICKLY WENT TO WASH HIMSELF AND PUT ON A ROBE,AFTER WHICH HE QUICKLY RETRIEVED
HIS MAGIC WAND AND DASHED DOWN STAIRS TO THE YARD WHERE THE DWARFISH TUTOR
WOULD BE IMPATIENTLY WAITING.

WOE THEE, BLASTED GHOUL! GET THYSELF AWAY FROM ME OR I`LL CLEAVE THY SKULL WITH
MY BARE HANDS. THIS QUITE CRUDE STATEMENT ECHOED THROUGH THE RATHER BARE
QUARTERS OF DOBRANUR CYMLI-SON, WHO LAY ON HIS COT AND SEEMED TO BE BATTLING
WITH A RUGGED PIECE OF ANIMAL SKIN WHICH HE NORMALLY USED TO COVER HIMSELF
WITH.

WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE GROUND NEXT TO SOME OF THE TYPICAL STONE FURNITURE
PRESENT IN THE ROOM, HE OPENED HIS EYES AND SAT UP,IMMEDIATELY, HE WENT TO LIE
DOWN AGAIN AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK BY AN ATTACK OF VERTIGO,SHAKING HIS HEAD AS
IF TO WARD OFF INVISIBLE PUNCHES.

AS HE REGAINED FULL CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SEEMED TO BE FLOWING INTO HIM LIKE A
GOOD PINT OF BEER FLUSHING DOWN HIS GULLET, A DEEP SIGH PASSED HIS LIPS WHEN HE
REGONISED FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS-HIS OWN ROOM AT PENGANA UNIVERSITY.

DOBRANUR WAS A STURDY DWARF WITH A RUGGED BEARD THAT MADE HIM LOOK ANCIENT IN
SPITE OF HIS AGE, HE WAS ONLY JUST AN ADULT. HE WAS ABOUT 2/3RDS THE SIZE OF A
REGULAR MAN, BUT HAD A STATURE ALMOST AS BROAD,AND HE WAS NO DOUBT VERY
STRONG.HIS EYES ALWAYS SEEMED STRANGELY DIM- ONLY WHEN SOMEONE SPOKE OF HIS KIN
OR THINGS SPROUTING FROM THE EARTH WOULD HIS EYES ASSUME A KEEN SPARKLE THAT
SEEMED TO ARISE FROM SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN HIM.

DOBRANUR BORN IN A SMALL SETTLEMENT NEAR BRINDIL-BUN HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE
CARE OF HIS DISTANT UNCLE, A TUTOR AT PENGANE UNIVERSITY BY THE NAME OF
DAMBRANO, WHEN HIS PARENTS DECIDED THEY WANTED TO LIVE IN SECLUSION SOMEWHERE
NEAR LUTHAG AND WANTED THEIR LITTLE SON TO BE BROUGHT UP DECENTLY. HIS PARENTS
WERE NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN AND WERE FEARED TO BE SLAUGHTERED IN ONE OF THE MANY
RAIDS SCAVENGING THAT PART OF ONTAFLARETH IN RECENT DECADES.

HE CLOSED HIS EYES AGAIN TO THE SOUND OF SWORDS AND SHIELDS CLATTERING OUTSIDE
HIS WINDOW AS THE FIRST FIGHTING LESSONS IN THE UNIVERSITY YARD HAD OBVIOUSLY
STARTED. THEY ALWAYS STARTED JUST AFTER DAWN AND...

BY GALGONEZ THE EVIL ONE!! MAY THE STONE WRATH FOREVER TURN GOLD INTO GRANITE!
MAY DRAGONFIRE FOREVER BURN ALL DWARFS BEARDS!

BE IN THE YARD AT DAWN..HIS DISTANT UNCLE ANNEX TUTOR HAD SAID THE EVENING
BEFORE..DONT BE LATE AS ITS AN IMPORTANT THING I WISH TO TELL YOU. IT WAS
ALRADY BEYOND DAWN, AS THE SUN WAS GAINING POWER AND TURNING A BRIGHT YELLOW IN
THE UNADORNED BLUE SKY.

HE JUMPED QUICKLY OUT OF BED AND WASHED HIMSELF...PUTTING ON HIS LEATHER
FIGHTING GEAR AND DASHED DOWN THE STAIRS.

ANDARIEL WOKE TO THE SOUND OF THUNDER THAT SEEMED TO PENETRATE HER DREAMS THAT
WERE MAINLY CONCERNED WITH WIELDING WOODLORE AND LAVISHING HERSELF TO GROTESQUE
ELVISH FEASTS. WHEN SHE OPENED HER EYES SHE BEHELD THE CEILING AND REGRETTED
HAVING WOKEN UP FROM HER APPARENT DIVINE SLUMBERING. THE THUNDER TURNED OUT TO
HAVE BEEN HEAVY FOOTSTEPS IN THE HALL OUTSIDE HER ROOM. THAT NOW FADED AWAY ON
THE STAIRS, IN HER DREAMS, SHE HAD ALMOST FELT THE TASTE OF BERRIES ON HER
TONGUE, HAD ALMOST LEARNED HOW TO HEAL WOOD,WHICH SHE SO GREATLY DESIRED TO BE
TAUGHT.

ANDARIEL WAS A BEAUTIFUL ELVIN MAIDEN ON ALL ACCOUNTS:SHE WAS PLEASURABLY BUILT
AND HAD LONG BLONDE HAIR THAT COVERED PART OF HER SHOULDERS AS THOUGH THEY WERE
COVERED BY SILK,WITH A GOLDEN GLIMMER. HER SMILE HAD THE POWER TO CHANGE EVEN
THE WORST OF MOODS,AND THE PERMANENT LIGHT KINDLING IN HER SMALL EYES MADE HER
APPEAR TO BE THE INCARNATION OF JOY AND HAPPINESS.

HER THOUGHTS WOULD OFTEN LINGER BACK TO THE TIME SHE USED TO SPEND ROAMING
GANDOMIL FOREST WITH HER FATHER,`TRAVELIEL` HE HAD BEEN KILLED BY A WILD BOAR
WHEN SHE WAS BUT SIX,AFTER WHICH HER DYING MOTHER HAD DECIDED TO PUT HER IN THE
CARE OF HER FAMOUS UNCLE CALLED DAMBRANO.SHE STILL SEEMED TO RECALL NEARLY
EVERY DAY BEFORE THE SAD EVENT.OH, HOW SHE HAD LOVED THE WOODS-AND STILL
DID!.SHE HAD`NT HAD MUCH TIME TO GO THERE RECENTLY,MAINLY BECAUSE OF HER STUDY
OCCUPATION AT PEGANA UNIVERSITY. HOW SHE WOULD LOVE TO GO ONCE AGAIN SEE THE
SUN RISE TO A BEAUTIFUL DAWN ABOVE THE GREAT TREES OF GANDOMIL.

SUNRISE?......DAWN?, SHE CURSED HERSELF AS SHE LOOKED OUTSIDE TO SEE THE SUN
STANDING FREELY ABOVE THE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS,SHINING BRIGHT AND YELLOW..WITH
THE BIRDS SINGING THEIR EARLY MORNING SONGS.

`BE IN THE YARD AT DAWN`...DONT BE LATE FOR IT IS AN IMPORTANT THING I HAVE TO
TELL YOU...SHE HURRIED TO WASH HERSELF AND COMB HER HAIR.AFTER WHICH SHE
SLIPPED INTO COMFORTABLE CLOTHES AND RAN OUT OF HER ROOM TO JOIN DAMBRANO AND
THE OTHERS WHO WOULD PROBABLY BE WAITING EAGERLY IN THE YARD.

ABILITIES OF THE HERO`S
BLADUS:..
CAN FIGHT SUCCESSFULLY WITH ANY WEAPON THAT EVEN REMOTELY RESEMBLES A BLADE,HIS
POWER WITH REGARD TO MAGIC IS MAINLY CONCERNED WITH `AGGRESIVE SPELL`(FOR USE
DURING BATTLE)..HE LOVES FIGHTING,SHOWING OFF HIS STRENGTH-AND HIS OWN BODY.

RINAKLES:
HIS MAIN STRENGTH,MAGICALLY SPEAKING IS HIS PERFORMANCE OF SPECIAL
EFFECTS(FLASHES OF LIGHT ECT)WHICH HE HAS TO A DEGREE TAUGHT TO BLADUS. HE
LOVES MAGIC.POETRY(WELL READING IN GENERAL) AND HIS PET DOG..AHCSAP...HE SELDOM
WEILDS WEAPONS OF ANY KIND,ALTHOUGH HE IS TRAINED TO USE THEM SUFFICIENTLY IN
ANY CASE.

DOBRANUR:
HE IS OF SHORT BUILD,WEARS A BEARD AND IS SPECIALISED IN THE USE OF THE DOUBLE
BLADED AXE,(OR ANYTHING RESEMBLING AN AXE)..HE IS VERY YOUNG JUST REACHING
ADOLESCENCE(THIS IS EXPLAINED AS DWARFES CAN LIVE TO BE VERY-VERY OLD).WITH
REGARD TO MAGIC,DOBRANUR IS ONLY IN A POSITION TO HELP OTHERS:HE CAN DO VERY
LITTLE OF HIS OWN ACCORD. HE LOVES THE LAND,STONE,FIGHTING AND EVRYTHING
WROUGHT FROM THE EARTH IN GENERAL.

ANDARIEL:

BEING AN ELF,ANDARIEL IS SKILLED IN SHAPING WOOD AND USING THE BOW AND
ARROW,HER SKILLS IN MAGIC ARE FAIRLY MODEST BUT SHE HAS THE POWER TO HEAL
PEOPLEOR PUT THEM INTO A HEALING SLEEP....SHE LOVES THE WOOD,GLADOMIL FOREST
AND A HANDSOME ELF WARRIOR BY THE NAME OF ELSTRYND.

......................DRAGON FLIGHT--THE FINAL PURPOSE.......................

IT IS NOW ONLY POSSIBLE TO GUESS WHAT HAPPENED IT IS SURE,HOWEVER,THAT WHAT
HAPPENNED AT DRAGONS VALE AFFECTED THE DRAGONS IRREVERSABLY-FOR IT WAS THE ONLY
PLACE WHERE THESE CREATURES GAVE BIRTH TO THEIR YOUNG:MOST OF THEM ROAMED THERE
PERMANTLY.

AFTER THE WAR HAD ENDED,MANY FOLKS AND ANIMALS CAME TO DRAGONS VALE.SEEKING TO
RESCUE WHATEVER COULD BE RESCUED OF THE DRAGONS AND THEIR CULTURE.NOBODY HAD
BEEN ABLE TO ENTER THE VALE AGAIN,HOWEVER.IT TURNED OUT TO BE UNDER SOME KIND
OF SPELL, AND THOSE WHO CAME BACK ALIVE TOLD STRANGE TALES OF A UNICORN AND
SOME KIND OF SHADOW WARRIOR.THEREFORE IT IS NOW THOUGHT THAT THE DRAGONS
VANISHED OR-WHICH I DREAD EVEN TO THINK-THEY WERE ALL KILLED.

THE CONSEQUENCES OF NTHIS LOSS WERE EVIDENT ALL OVER THE WORLD.OLD FLAMES OF
CONFLICTS BETWEEN PEOPLE KINDLED INTO WILD FIRES OF ANGER,AND POWER HUNGRY
LEADERS SET THEIR KINDRED UP AGAINST THEIR NEIGHBOURS.

DAMBRANO SIGHED DEEPLY AGAIN,AND NOW LOOKED UP AT HIS PUPILS.THERE WAS RELIEF
CLEARLY TO BE SEEN IN HIS EYES.AS THE END OF HIS TALE WAS NEARING AND HE WAS
ABOUT TO EMBARK ON TELLING THEM WHY HE HAD CALLED THEM TOGETHER HERE,WHY HE HAD
TAKEN CARE OF THEM AND WHY HE HAD TAUGHT THEM EVERYTHING THEY KNEW TODAY.

THIS IS THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY,HE WAS SAD TO PROCEED,AND THIS IS THE WORLD
INTO WHICH YOU WILL UNDERTAKE A QUEST-THE QUEST FOR WHICH I HAVE TRAINED YOU
FOR YEARS,THE QUEST THAT WILL VERY LIKELY CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF HISTORY.

THE QUEST IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE USUALLY UNDERTAKEN,IN THE OLD
DAYS.QUESTS WERE USUALLY STARTED TO FIND UNMARRIED NOBLE LADIES OR HIDDEN
TREASURES,BUT THIS ONE`S ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.

NO- YUOR QUEST CONSISTS OF FINDING AND TEACHING MAGIC,LUCKY ENOUGH,EVEN THE
HIGHEST TUTORS AT PENGANA UNIVERSITY TODAY RECOGNISE THE CASTING OFF MAGIC WAS
A BAD THING TO DO,AND THEY ARE EVEN SEEKING TO SET UP A MAGIC FACULTY, SO
YOU`LL HAVE TO FIND AND ENTER THE OLD SCHOOLS THAT ARE MAINLY INHABITED BY
CREATURES,AND FIND ALL THE SCRIPTURES YOU CAN,IF THERE ARE ANY LEFT AT ALL,THE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE OLD WISE IS THOUGHT TO BE STILL HIDDEN SOMEWHERE,AND WE NEED
YOU TO BRING THE OLD SCRIPTURES YOU WILL NOT BE NEEDING YOURSELVES.

THE OLD DWARF LOOKED CONFIDENTLY AT HIS PUPILS,HE KNEW THAT, IF THIS QUEST WAS
AT ALL ACHIEVABLE THESE STUDENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO.BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER
TASK AS WELL,A TASK THAT NEED`NT EVEN BE SAID AS THEY ALL KNEW BY INSTINCT,BUT
DAMBRANO MENTIONED IT ANYWAY.

ALSO,HE SAID,AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT,YOU MUST TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE DRAGONS,FIND OUT WHERE THEY HAVE VANISHED TO,OR WETHER THEY HAVE INDEED
ALL BEEN KILLED, I SIMPLY REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT NTHESE GREAT AND POWERFUL
CREATURES OF MAGIC AND WISDOM HAVE VANISHED OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH FOR EVER.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY WERE ALL DESTROYED IN SUCH A SHORT TIME.

THE TARGET OF YOUR QUEST THUS, IS TO STOP THE RAPID DECLINE OF THE LAND.I KNOW
THIS SOUNDS VERY PESSIMISTIC,BUT I AM AFRAID I HAVE NO REASONS LEFT IN
JUSTIFYING ME TO SOUND OTHERWISE. YOU MUST SHED LIGHT AGAIN UPON THE KNOWLEDGE
AND WISDOM OF THE PAST,AND PREVENT THE WORLD GOING THROUGH THE SAME SENSELESS
FAULTS ONCE MORE.

BUT I SHOULDNT TALK ANY MORE NOW.I CAN ALREADY READ IMPATIENCE IN YOUR EYES,AND
I KNOW YOU WANT TO START ON YOUR QUEST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT
MEAN DEATH.I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO SO LONG A TALE FROM AN
OLD MAN.TO REWARD YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND ATTENTION I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER YOU
A GIFT.ITS THE LAST POWERFUL WARD THAT HAS BEEN LEFT OF OLD....

....................................DIRECTION................................

THE MOUSE IS GENERALLY USED TO CONTROL THE EVENTS OF THE GAME.THE KEYBOARD IS
ONLY USED IN RARE EXCEPTIONS.THE MENU HAS BEEN FORMED IN SUCH A WAY THAT AN
OPTIMUM SPEED OF OF OPERATION IS ASSURED.THE MOUSE INDICTOR BECOMES LOCKED IN
THE APPROPIATE FIELD DURING ALMOST EVERY ACTION IN ORDER TO MAKE SELECTION
EASIER.THE RIGHT HAND MOUSE KEY CAN USUALLY BE USED TO INTERRUPT ANY CURRENT
ACTION IN THE EVENT OF A SPECIAL FIELD ABLE TO STOP THE PROCEDURE NOT BEING
AVAILABLE.UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE FIELD OF OPERATION IS TO BE FOUND ON
THE BOTTOM QUARTER OF THE SCREEN AND THE GAME IS PLAYED IN THE TOPMOST
WINDOW.RELEVANT TEXTS ARE SHOWN IN THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD OF OPERATION AND THE
MOUSE INDICATOR SLIDES THROUGH UNDER THE WINDOW.PORTRAITS OF THE 4 HEROES OF
THE GAME ARE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE.THE STATUS INDICATOR OF ONE OF THE PLAYERS
APPEARS BY CLICKING THE RELEVANT PORTRAIT(SEE BELOW) A FIELD WITH A FEW ICONS
CAN BE SEEN ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE.WITH THE AID OF THESE SMALL SYMBOLS YOU CAN
MOVE THROUGH THE GAME AND GIVE COMMANDS.WITH THE RIGHT HAND MOUSE BUTTON YOU
CAN CHANGE THIS WINDOW FROM MODES OF COMMAND TO MODES OF MOVEMENT AND VICE
VERSA.A FEW ARROWS ARE VISIBLE DURING MODES OF MOVEMENT WHICH MOVE OUR GROUP OF
HEROES IN THE APPROPIATE DIRECTION. THE COMMAND ICONS ARE DESCRIBED
INDIVIDUALLY BELOW AND CHANGE ACCORDING TO THE LOCATION OF THE PARTY.THE TOP
PART OF THE SCREEN IS ALSO BROUGHT INTO USE ON PARTICULAR OCCASIONS(IN KIT
MODES AND SHOPPING MODES-SEE BELOW)

.................TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD,OVER LAND AND SEA.................

IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR TASK THE GROUP MUST TRAVEL THROUGHOUT ALMOST THE
WHOLE WORLD:THE STANDARD,AND ALSO THE CHEAPEST FORM OF TRAVEL BEING ON
FOOT.THERE ARE HOWEVER,MORE GRACEFUL WAYS OF ADVANCING. THE GROUP CAN BE MOVED
IN 8 DIFFERENT DIRECTION,SYMBOLISED ON THE MOVEMENTS MENU BY 8 DIRECTION
ARROWS, MANY DANGERS AND OBSTRUCTIONS LIE IN WAIT FOR THE PARTY ON EACH OF
THEIR JOURNEYS,HUMANSDWARFS AND ELVES ARE NOT ABLE TO ADVANCE UNHINDERED ON
EVERY UNDERGROUND LEVEL,LAKES.SEAS AND HIGH MOUNTAINS ARE INSURMOUNTABLE FOR
THE TRAVELLERS;IT IS NOT EVEN POSSIBLE TO SEE OVER THE MOUNTAINS.PROGRESS IS
MADE MORE DIFFICULT BY WOODS,JUNGLES AND ALSO ROLLING COUNTRY.SETTING FOOT ON
SWAMP AREAS CAN BE FATAL.IN THESE AREAS YOU CAN ONLY MOVE ON WITH EXTREME
DIFFICULTY AND THE EVIL FUMES ARISING FROM MIST-COVERED PLACES CAN EVEN
ENDANGER THE HEALTH OF THE GROUP MEMBERS. CAUTION IS ALSO CALLED FOR IN THE
DESERTS AND ICE COVERED LOCATIONS. YET IT IS NOT ONLY THE NATURE THAT ENDANGERS
THE LIVES OF THE TRAVELLERS:HORDES OF ROAMING ORCS, OR EVEN WORSE,CREATURES OF
THE MAGICIANS WAR,CAN POSE A DEADLY THREAT.NEVERTHELESS THESE BEING NEVER DARE
TO HANG AROUND IN TOWNS AND THEIR IMMEDIATE VICINITIES.

DANGERS OF THIS NATURE,HOWEVER,CAN BE REDUCED IF OTHER WAYS OF ADVANCING ARE
AVILABLE.ONE OF THESE IS A SHIP JOURNEY-MAGNIFICENT SAILING SHIPS CAN BRING THE
PARTY TO DISTANT SHORES.HOWEVER, CHARTERING A SHIP IS NOT A PARTICULARLY CHEAP
OPTION FOR THE PARTY. WHEN TRAVELLING BY SHIP,ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO A FEW
PARTICULARS.IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARTY TO PROVIDE THE CREW WITH
FOOD.YOU SHOULD THEREFORE BE SUFFICIENTLY EQUIPPED WITH PROVISIONS BEFORE THE
JOURNEY STARTS.OTHERWISE THE SAILORS COULD RESORT TO THE OLD SEA-FARING
TRADITION OF MUTINY!!!, COLLISIONS OF THE SHIP WITH THE MAINLAND SHOULD OF
COURSE BE AVOIDED UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES..THE SHIP CAN ONLY ENDURE 3
COLLISIONS BEFORE IT SINKS.

.................................TEMPLE......................................

MOVEMENT ACROSS GREATER DISTANCES CAN ALSO BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE HEROES
STRENGTH,IF THE CORRECT SPELLS ARE USED. THE OLD TEMPLES OF WHITE AND BLACK
MAGIC PLAY A GREAT ROLE IN THIS.ERECTED ON PLACES WHERE THE EARTHS ENERGY IS
CONCENTRATED, THEY WERE MEDITATION AND RITUAL CENTRES FOR THE BLACK AND WHITE
MAGICIANS AT THE TIME OF OUR STORY,TOO,THESE PLACES STRENGTHEN THE MAGIC
CAPACITY OF THE SPIRIT AND AN INCREASE IN THE ABILITY TO ACCUMALTE ENERGY IS
BROUGHT ABOUT. THE RINGS OF STASIS, DAMBRANOS GIFT, MAY ALSO BE PUT TO USE(SEE
REVIVIAL OF CHARACTERS)ANYONE ENTERING ONE OF THESE TEMPLES TO MEDITATE WILL
AUTOMATICALLY BECOME AWARE OF THE NAME OF THE PLACE,POSSESSING THE CORRECT
SPELL ALLOWS THE GROUP TO TELEPORT TO ANOTHER TEMPLE IF THEY ARE STANDING
DIRECTLY AT SUCH.AN ALTERNATIVE SPELL CAN DISPLACE THE GROUP FROM ANY GIVEN
PLACE ON THE SURFACE TO A TEMPLE-ONLY PROVIDED,HOWEVER,THAT THE NAME OF THE
TEMPLE IS ALREADY KNOWN.

THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS MAY BE CARRIED OUT ON THE WORLDS SURFACE:

FIGURE 1:   MAGIC; PERFORM A PREPARED SPELL.AFTER THIS COMMAND HAS BEEN
GIVEN,IT MUST BE DETERMINED WHICH GROUP MEMBER SHOULD ACTUALLY PERFORM THE
SPELL BY CLICKING APPROPIATELY.

FIGURE 2:   ATTACK; SHOULD AN AGGRESSOR BE FOUND IN DIRECT VICINITY OF THE
GROUP, HE CAN BE ATTACKED BEFORE HE IN TURN ATTACKS THE GROUP.IF THE COMMAND TO
ATTACK HAS BEEN GIVEN, THE PARTY HAS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK IN A
FIGHT-OTHERWISE THE OOPONETS CAN ATTACK FIRST.

FIGURE 3:   ENTERING A PLACE OR SHIP; APPLICABLE TO TOWNS-TEMPLES-DUNGEONS AND
SPECIAL PLACES.

FIGURE 4:   CAMPING DOWN FOR THE NIGHT; THE GROUP HAS A REST AND AS A RESULT
WINS HIT POINTS AND MAGIC POINTS. IF THE LAST CAMP DOWN IS TAKEN UP SHORTLY
BEFORE A NEW PLACE PHASE, THEN THE EFFECT ON THE GROUP IS ONLY LIMITED.

FIGURE 5:   LEAVING THE SHIP; THIS ICON CAN BE USED WHEN THE SHIP HAS PUT THE
PARTY ASHORE ON A COAST.

FIGURE 6:   DISC OPERATIONS-LOAD AND STORE STATE OF PLAY.

THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE WORLD AND THE ART OF PRODUCING MAPS
HAVE,AT THE TIME IN WHICH OUR STORY TAKES PLACE,ALMOST FALLEN INTO
OBLIVION.HOWEVER,THERE IS TALK OF FRAGMENTS BELONGING TO AN ANTIQUE MAP WHICH
WOULD,NO DOUBT,PROVE INVALUABLE ON ADVENTUROUS JOURNEYS.

..............................TOWNS AND VILLAGES.............................

NUMEROUS TOWNS,LARGE AND SMALL,ARE SCATTERED OVER THE CONTINENTS AND THE
ISLANDS OF THE WORLD. VARIOUS SHOPS OFFERING  OFFERING ALL SORTS OF USEFUL
EQUIPMENT CAN BE FOUND THERE. OF EVEN GREATER IMPORTANCE,HOWEVER,TO THE PARTY
AND THEIR QUEST,ARE THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWNS:SOMETIMES THEIR INFORMATION
AND ADVICE CAN BE OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE. TO START UP A CONVERSATION WITH A
PASSER BY IN THE STREET YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO GO NEAR HIM AND PRESS THE SPEAK
ICON.THE HOUSES IN THE TOWNS HAVE NUMBERS WHICH MAY BE ESTABLISHED BY PRESSING
`INVESTIGATE` SYMBOL,THE `KNOCK` ICON MAY BE ACTIVATED WHEN THE GROUP IS
STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF A HOUSE DOOR.

IF ANYONE LIVES IN THE HOUSE CONCERNED,HE/SHE WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO SPEAK TO
YOU.IF NO-ONE OPENS THE DOOR THEN TRY AGAIN LATER!

YOU HAVE SEVERAL OPTIONS WHEN CONVERSING WITH A PERSON.THE ARROW ICONS SCROLL
UP AND DOWN TEXTS WHICH ARE LONGER THAN ONE SCREEN PAGE. THE `SHOW` ICON
PRODUCES THE LIST OF OBJECTS WHICH MAY BE SHOWN TO THE OTHER PERSON AND HE MAY
THEN OFFER INFORMATION. IF THE PARTY WISHES TO OFFER THEIR NEW ACQUAINTANCE A
GIFT THEN THE `GIVE` BUTTON SHOULD BE PRESSED.CERTAIN OBJECTS MAY LOOSEN THE
TONGUES OF SOME FOLK..CONVERSATION IS ENDED BY PRESSING RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.

FIGURE 7:     MAGIC; PERFORM A PREPARED SPELL.AFTER THIS COMMAND HAS BEEN
GIVEN,IT MUST BE DETERMINED WHICH GROUP MEMBER SHOULD ACTUALLY PERFORM THE
SPELL BY CLICKING APPROPIATELY.

FIGURE 8 :  SPEAK           FIGURE 9:   KNOCK        FIGURE 10:  INVESTIGATE 
FIGURE 10A: SHOW            FIGURE 10B: GIVE

SHOPS CAN BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A RED SIGN AT THE ENTRANCE.THEY
OFFER(ALMOST)EVERYTHING AN ADVENTURERS HEART COULD WISH FOR-AT MORE OR LESS
FAVOURABLE PRICES.SHOULD THE GROUP ENTER A SGOP(KNOCK)THE PROCEDURE IS SHIFTED
TO THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. THE QUESTION MARK IN THE RIGHT HAND CORNER SHOWS THE
STATUS OF THE CHARACTER ONCE ONE OF THE SMALL PORTRAITS IN THE TOP RIGHT HAND
CORNER HAS BEEN CLICKED. BY PICKING ONE OF THESE PICTURES THE BUYER OF THE
OBJECT IS SELECTED. THE GROUP LEAVES THE BUILDING BY PRESSING THE
`DOWN-POINTING ARROW` SYMBOL.

GROCER:

RATIONS ESSENTIAL FOR THE JOURNEY CAN BE BOUGHT HERE THE AMOUNT OF FOOD
REQUIRED CAN BE DETERMINED BY THE RED--BLUE ARROW.

THE BLACKSMITH:

WEAPONS AND MUNITIONS ARE INDEED INDESPENSABLE FOR BATTLE,BUT THE CLEVER
TRAVELLER WILL COMPARE PRICES CAREFULLY.
THE RED--BLUE ARROW FLICKS THROUGH THE SELECTION OF GOODS AND TO BUY A WEAPON
OR MUNITION THE OBJECT MUST BE CLICKED AND DRAWN TO ONE OF THE 4 PORTRAITS. TO
SELL SOMETHING THE PORTRAIT MUST AGAIN BE CLICKED AND A LIST OF OBJECTS WHICH
MAY BE OF INTEREST TO THE SMITH APPEARS,CLICKING ONE OF THE OBJECTS IS THEN
ENOUGH TO SELL IT(AFTER PERHAPS A SMALL QUERY).

THE DRUG STORE:

IN FACT ALL SORTS OF USEFUL OBJECTS FOR TRAVELLERS ARE TO BE FOUND HERE.THE
PROCEDURE IS THE SAME AS THE BLACKSMITHS.

THE HEALER:

BADLY INJURED CHARACTERS CAN BE ATTENDED TO BY THE HEALER AND THEY(AND THEIR
HIT POINTS)WILL QUICKLY RECOVER.HEALERS ARE PARTICULARY RECOMMENDE WHEN THE
PARTY IS NOT YET EQUIPPED WITH HEALING SPELLS.HERE,TOO,THE PROCEDURE IS THE
SAME.

THE PUB:

A COOL DRINK DOES WONDERS FOR THE THIRSTY TRAVELLER,BUT THE CONVERSATIONS WHICH
CAN BE PICKED UP THERE MAY PROVE EVEN MORE VALUABLE.

THE SHIPPING COMPANY:

A SHIP IS PROVIDED COMPLETE WITH CREW.THE PROCEDURE HERE IS
UNCOMPLICATED;SIMPLY CHOOSE THE CHARACTER WHO HAS ENOUGH CAPITAL FOR A SHIP.

PALACES:

LARGER TOWNS ARE OFTEN USED AS RESIDENCES FOR THE LEADERS OF THE
POPULATIONS.THESE PALACES CAN BE VERY INTERESTING FOR AN ADVENTURER. MANY OF
THE LARGE TOWNS ARE REALLY WORTH A VISIT,EVEN WHEN AN IMPORTANT MISSION DOESNT
HAVE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED THERE AS IN THE CASE OF OUR 4 HERIES.THE MOST IMPORTANT
TOWNS ARE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:

PEGANA:

PEGANA IS A CENTRAL CITY ON THE MAIN CONTINENT ONTAFLARETH.AND IS BUILT DUE
NORTH OF THE ENORMOUS GLANDOMIL FOREST.THE STATE UNIVERSITY WAS BUILT IN THIS
CITY-THUS MUCH KNOWLEDGE IS TO BE FOUND HERE.
THE POPULATION OF THE CITY CONSISTS OF ALL REGULAR RACES OF THE LAND-MEN,DWARFS
AND ELVES WHO ALL LIVE TOGETHER IN RELATIVE HARMONY. THE CITY HAS AN ABUNDANCE
OF AFTER-DUSK LIFE,OCCURING MAINLY IN THE LARGE NUMBERS OF INNS WHERE MANY
UNIERSITY STUDENTS,FOR EXAMPLE,ROAM AROUND IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE EVENING.
PEGANA WAS BUILT AS A CITY WHERE ALL THE RACES OF THE LAND COULD MIX TOGETHER
AT  A TIME,SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS AGO,WHEN THE DIFFERENT RACES FIRST BECAME
AWARE OF EACH OTHER.

BRINDIL-BUN:

THE CITY OF DWARFS,BUILT ALONG THE RIVER EBAREN,WHICH IN TURN FLOWS INTO THE
ONTAFLARETH SEA.PART OF THE CITY IS BUILT ON THE SIDE OF BRINDIL HILL. THE
HOUSES ARE GENERALLY SMALLER THAN THOSE OF THE HUMANS AND ELVES,IN KEEPING WITH
THE DWARFS LIMITED SIZE.
BRINDIL-BUN IS THOUGHT TO BE THE OLDEST CITY IN THE LAND,ALTHOUGH THE ELVES
SOMETIMES MAINTAIN THAT THEIR CITY OF NIMRAVIEL IS OLDER.THIS IS A
TRADITIONAL,MOSTLY QUITE HARMLESS,QUARREL THAT TENDS TO EMERGE AT MANY MEETINGS
OR FESTIVITIES WHERE ELVES AND DWARFS COME TOGETHER.
ONE OF THE LARGEST BUILDINGS IS THE PALACE OF KING DRILBA KERILSON.HE DOES NOT
HAVE A QUEEN AS YET,AS HE HAS NOT YET REACHED THE AGE OF 250 YEARS-THE AGE WHEN
A DWARF IS FIRST ALLOWED TO MARRY.

NIMRAVIEL:

THE CITY OF ELVES,BUILT BETWEEN GLANDIFIL AND `THEIR` GLANDIFIL
FORESTS(GLANDIFIL FOREST HAS DISAPEARED AND HAS BEEN REPLACED BY WHAT IS KNOWN
AS THE EVIL DESERT)WHERAS BRINDIL-BUN REFLECTS THE NO-NONSENSE,FIXED ATTITUDE
OF THE DWARFS,NIMRAVIEL CAN BE SEEN TO REFLECT THE NATURE OF THE ELVES
DIRECTLY-GENTLE AND SLENDER.
THE CITY IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT EXPANDS OVER A CONSIDERABLY LARGE AREA TO
ENCOMPASS THE MANY TREES WHICH THE ELVES LOVE-AND EVEN BUILT THEIR HOUSES IN.
THROUGH BRINDIL-BUN IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE THE OLDEST CITY IN THE
LAND,THE ELVES KEEP CLAIMING THAT NIMRAVIEL IS IN FACT THE OLDESTCITY. THE
PALACE OF KING GAROLYS WIMROFEL-SON AND HIS QUEEN SILZAY IS TO BE FOUND IN THE
CENTRE OF THE CITY..BUILT ON AN ANCIENT OAK.

PORT PYLON:

THE CITY OF MEN,LIES ALONG THE EASTERN SHORES WHERE ONTAFLARETH DISAPPEARED
INTO THE SOUTHERN SEA.IN NO OTHER CITY DO THE STYLES OF BUILDINGS VARY AS MUCH
AS HERE,BECAUSE THE CREATIVE SPIRIT OF MANKIND HAS ROAMED HERE SINCE ITS VERY
BEGINNING(NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHEN THAT WAS).PORT PYLON IS HIGHLY FAMOUS FOR
ITS SAILORS AND CAPABLE SHIP BUILDERS AND SHIP DEALERS.
FOR AGES IT HAD SEEMED AS THOUGH PORT PYLON HAD,HAD A CURSE CAST UPON IT; IT
WAS RAIDED BY PIRATES,SCOURGED BY BUBONIC PLAGUE,`SPONTANEOUSLY` BURNED DOWN TO
A LARGE DEGREE,AND EVEN ONCE DISAPPEARED OFF THE EARTH FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS
DUE TO SOME EVIL SPELL,THE ORIGIN OF WHICH IS UNKNOWN.
A SOMEWHAT OBSCURE BUILDING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY-NOT EXACTLY WHAT COULD
BE CALLED POMPUS OR LUXURY-IS THE RESIDENCE AND PALACE OF KING DRAHNREB
SUALC-SON AND HIS QUEEN XIRTAEB.

SCATTERBONE:

CITY OF ROGUES,OUTCASTS AND OUTLAWS.THE LARGEST PIRATE COMMUNITY IN THE LAND
LIVES HERE AND THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE BLACK MARKET WHERE ANYTHING FROM YOUNG
DAMSELS TO TOOTH-PICKS AND TORCHES TO MAGIC TOOLS CAN BE BOUGHT.THE CITY IS
RULED BY KING HALFTON THE YOUNGER,SON OF KING QUARTERTON AND HIS MAGNIFICENT
QUEEN DOUBLETON THE NOT-SO GRACEFUL HALFTON IS SAID TO BE TORTURED BY SOME
BEING,AND WOULD PAY HANDSOMELY THE ONE WHO COULD RID HIM OF IT. SPECIAL FORGES
PRODUCE FEARSOME WEAPONS THAT CAN BE OBTAINED NOWHERE ELSE. YOU`D BETTER WATCH
YOUR BACK WHILE THERE!!!,

BAGNOL:

A CITY MUCH LIKE PEGANA AND ALSO INHABITED BY THE VARIOUS RACES LIVING ON THE
FACE OF THE LAND. THE CITY LIES ON THE ISLAND OF DORITHANNON,WHICH LIES IN THE
DORITHANNON SEA. IT IS SURROUNDED BY MARSHES AND SWAMPS AND IS ONE OF THE
SMALLER CITIES OF THE WORLD.

................................DUNGEONS.....................................

THE OLD SCHOOLS OF BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC HAVE BEEN DESERTED FOR MANY YEARS;AT
LEAST AS FAR AS HUMANS,DWARFS AND ELVES ARE CONCERNED. IN THE COURSE OF THE
YEARS THEY TRANSFORMED INTO DILAPITATED DUNGEONS IN WHICH GHOSTLY CREATURES OF
THE WAR ARE TO BE FOUND SPOOKING AROUND.IT IS SAID THAT EVEN THE LAYOUT OF THE
DUNGEONS ITSELF MAKES LIFE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE TRAVELLERS. ALTHOUGH THE
ORIGINAL INTENTION WAS TO PREVENT ACCESS TO UNINVITED GUESTS TO THE SECRET
KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAGICIANS, IN PRESENT TIMES THE TRAP DOORS,SECRET
PANELS(RECOGNISABLE BY THEIR SLIGHTLY WORN STRUCTURE) AND TELEPORTATION
MECHANISMS PRESENT A DEADLY THREAT TO ALL WHO HOPE TO RE-DISCOVER THE WISDOM OF
TIMES PAST.

ALL THE SAME,THE OLD SCHOOLS HOLD READY REWARDS FOR FOLK WITH AN ADVENTUROUS
SPIRIT;TREASURE CHESTS ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE PASSAGE WAYS AND CHAMBERS,AND OF
COURSE THE POWERFUL SPELLS OF THE OLD MAGICIANS CAN BE FOUND IN THE
DUNGEONS,TOO,THE TORCHES LEFT HANGING IN THE PASSAGE WAYS MAY BE TAKEN FOR
PRIVATE USE. A FUNGUS OF THE KIND SOUGHT BY HEALERS IS ALSO ABUNDANT IN THE
DAMP PASSAGE WAYS.
OCCASIONALLY A MAP CAN BE FOUND SHOWING THE RELEVANT STOREY OF THE OLD SCHOOL.
A MOST USEFUL RELIC-MOST LIKELY LEFT BEHIND BY THE PREVIOUS,UNFORTUNATE
ADVENTURER,WHOSE REMAINS CAN BE PROBABLY FOUND NEARBY.....

JUST HOW POWERFUL THE MAGIC OF THE SENIORS WAS,IS DEMONSTRATED NOT LEAST BY THE
SO CALLED `RIDDLE-TONGUES`.THEY CAN SPEAK,ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT REALLY
ALIVE-THEY ARE DOOMED TO SPEND THEIR EXISTANCES IN THE WALLS.SOMETIMES THEY CAN
TWITTER TOO MUCH,BUT OFTEN BEING ABLE TO SOLVE THEIR RIDDLES CAN MEAN THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.
AS THEY IN FACT REPRESENT A MINOR LIFE FORM IN THEIR OWN WAY,YOU SHOULD ONLY
EVER ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS WITH `ONE` WORD.IT IS SAID THAT SOME EVEN DISAPPEAR
WHEN THEY HEAR THE RIGHT THING SAID.
THE DUNGEONS ARE PORTRAYED IN 3D FORM,THE CHAMBERS OF THE LABYRINTH HOWEVER ARE
IN PROFILE ON THE BATTLE SCREEN.SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE CHAMBERS ARE
GIVEN BELOW-`BATTLE SCREENS AND DUNGEONS`.THE FOLLOWING CHOICES ARE AVAILABLE
IN THE DUNGEONS.

             DANGEROUS TRAPS CAN TAKE THE FUN OUT OF DISCOVERING TREASURE.

FIGURE 24:   (SHOWN AS AN EYE..AS FIGURE 10)...-INVESTIGATE- THIS ICON CAN BE
              PUT TO TWO GOOD USES HERE IN THE DUNGEONS;THE SYSMBOL CAN BE
              CLICKED WHEN STANDING IN FRONT OF THE WALL TO ALLOW A CLOSER LOOK
              WHICH COULD REVEAL A SECRET PANEL.ALSO,RIDDLE TONGUES BEGIN TO
              SPEAK AS SOON AS THEY ARE `INVESTIGATED`.

FIGURE 25:    (SHOWN AS A KEY AND KEYHOLE)..-UNLOCK- SOME OF THE DOORS ARE
              BOLTED,BUT WITH THE AID OF A MAGIC KEY EVERY DOOR CAN BE
              OPENED,SIMPLY BY CLICKING FIRST THE ICON AND THEN THE CHARACTER
              HOLDING THE KEY,UNFORTUNATELY THESE KEYS CAN ONLY BE USED ONCE!

..........................THE STATUS AND KIT INDICATOR.......................

CLICKING ON ONE OF THE CHARACTER PORTRAITS AT THE SIDE PROVIDES MANY
OPPORTUNITIES TO CHECK THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR EQUIPMENT.FIRST OF ALL
APPEARS.....A SCREEN WITH THE FOLLOWING

EVERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION ON EACH AND ANY CHARACTER CAN BE DONE BY
CLICKING THE MINI-SIZE PORTRAITS.THE INFORMATION THUS GIVEN IS DETAILED BELOW:

INDICATOR BEAM:   SHOWS THE POWER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC
                  AGAIN,SEE `THE ART OF SPELL-CASTING`,USE OF BLACK AND
                  WHITE MAGIC.

HITPOINTS:        SHOWS AGAIN THE HEALTH OF THE CHARACTER. THE CHARACTERS LOSE
                  HITPOINTS THROUGH EACH PHYSICAL ATTACK
                  (FIGHTING,TRAPS,TELEPORTING,ECT)IF THE HITPOINTS GO DOWN TO
                  ZERO,THE CHARACTER DIES!.HITPOINTS CAN BE BUILT UP AGAIN BY
                  CAMPING DOWN FOR A NIGHT OR THROUGH MAGIC POTIONS.

MAGIC:            MAGIC SPELLS REQUIRE ENORMOUS CONCENTRATION AND USE MUCH
                  SPIRITUAL ENERGY,`MAGIC` REVEALS HOW MUCH ENERGY RESERVE THE
                  CHARACTER STILL POSSESSES IN THIS RESPECT,IF MAGIC POINTS
                  FALL TO A TOO LOW LEVEL,THE MORE DEMANDING SPELLS CAN NO
                  LONGER BE PERFOREMED,INDEED ALL MAGICAL ABILITIES MAY BE
                  LOST.REST PERIODS(CAMPING DOWN FOR THE NIGHT)ALLOW
                  ACCUMALATION OF MAGIC POINTS,ALTHOUGH THE POINTS
                  WILL GRADUALLY ACCUMALATE EVEN WITHOUT SETTING UP CAMP.

EXPERIENCE:       THE CHARACTERS EXPERIENCE,PARTICULARY IN THE FEILD OF
                  FIGHTING INCREASES AS THE GAME CONTINUES.MANY THINGS DEPEND
                  ON THIS WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE,FOR EXAMPLE BEING A GOOD SHOT
                  AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE QUICKLY DURING FIGHTS,SUCCESSFUL 
                  SPELL-CASTING,SAFE OPENING OF TREASURE CHESTS,ECT. AMONG THE
                  OTHER THINGS, THE EXPERIENCE VALUE ALSO DETERMINES THE
                  MAXIMUM HITPOINTS AND MAGIC POINTS WHICH MAY BE ACHIEVED.

CHARACTER;        THE NUMBER HERE IS DETERMINED BY THE CHARACTERS DEEDS.`GOOD`
                  DEEDS SUCH AS GENEROSITY TOWARDS BEGGARS OR ACCOMPLISHMENT
                  OF SET TASKS,PUSH THIS FIGURE HIGHER. ON THE OTHER HAND
                  SLAYING A FLEEING ENEMY DURING BATTLE OR RUNNING AWAY FROM
                  MONSTERS LEADS TO LOSS OF CHARACTER POINTS. IN THE COURSE
                  OF THE GAME IT MAY BE THAT THE GROUP COMES ACROSS SOMEONE WHO
                  THINKS HIGHLY OF AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIGH MORAL VALUES.

ARMS:             THE UP-TO-DATE WEAPON SITUATION CAN BE SEEN AT A GLANCE.

ARMAMENTS:        SHOWS THE ARMAMENTS PRESENTLY BEING WORN.

WEAPON VALUE:     THE DEGREE OF DANGER POSED BY THE ARMS OF A CHARACTER IS
                  DETERMINED BY RACE,EXPERIENCE,WEAPONS AND MAGIC POTIONS,THIS
                  IS EXPRESSED AS `WEAPON VALUE`.

ARMAMENTS VALUE:  ACCOUNT IS ALSO TAKEN HERE OF FACTORS SUCH AS RACE,ARMAMENTS
                  POTIONS AND MAGICAL RINGS AND THE SO-CALLED `ARMAMENTS VALUE`
                  INDICATES HOW WELL PROTECTED A CHARACTER IS FROM ATTACKS.

FOOD:             INDICATES THE SUPPLY OF PROVISIONS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. A
                  CHARACTER WITH NO FOOD LOSES HITPOINTS WITH EVERY STEP HE
                  TAKES!.

GOLD:             NOT DIFFICULT TO WORK OUT-THE VALUE DETERMINES THE WEALTH OF
                  THE CHARACTER.

..........ONCE ON THIS STATUS PAGE,SEVERAL SUB-MENUS CAN BE CALLED UP........

FIGURE 26:         (SHOWN AS A BLUE SQUARE WITH AN ARROW POINTING DOWN)
                   THE DOWNWARD ARROW LEAVES THE STATUS PAGE AGAIN. THIS ICON
                   ALSO APPEARS IN THE SUB MENUS SO THAT THE STATUS PAGE CAN BE
                   RETURNED TO ONCE AGAIN.

FIGURE 27:         SUB MENU OBJECT DISPLAY. ALL OBJECTS IN THE POSSESSION OF
THE CHARACTER ARE SHOWN HERE WITH THE AID OF THE RED/BLUE ARROW CAN BE SCROLLED
UP OR DOWN.HERE TOO,INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS ARE ABLE TO SWAP THEIR POSSESSIONS BY
CLICKING ON THE MINI-SIZE PORTRAITS. EXCHANGING OBJECTS,PROVISIONS AND GOLD
BETWEEN CHARACTERS IS QUITE SIMPLE;CLICK ON THE RELEVANT OBJECT AND DRAG IT TO
THE PORTRAIT OF THE CHARACTER INTENDED TO RECIEVE THE KIT.THE MENU RIGHT OF THE
CENTRE OFFERS A FEW FURTHER POSSIBILITIES REGARDING THE KIT.

FIGURE 28:          (SHOWN AS A BLUE SQUARE..WITH 2 CURVES AROUND A DOT)
                    -INVESTIGATING ITEMS OF KIT-..A SMALL HAND APPEARS AND BY
                    CLICKING A CERTAIN OBJECT,A DESCRIPTION IS GIVEN.

FIGURE 29:          (SHOWN AS A BLUE SQUARE..WITH A HAND)
                    -MANIPULATING ITEMS OF KIT-..SOME ARTICLES THAT NHAVE BEEN
                    FOUND CAN BE TREATED IN ONE OF TWO WAYS-EITHER BY LOADING
                    THEM OR MODIFYING THEM.

FIGURE 30;          (SHOWN AS A BLUE SQUARE-WITH A HAND AND A SWORD)
                    -PREPARATION OF A WEAPON OR ARMAMENT- THE CHARACTERS MAY
                    EACH CARRY A VARIETY OF ARMAMENTS AND WEAPONS OR PIECES OF
                    ARMAMENTS WHICH MAY BE EMPLOYED,CARRIED OR WORN IN
                    BATTLE.THE WEAPON OR ARMAMENT INTENDED FOR USE IN BATTLE
                    SHOULD BE CLICKED ON THIS ICON.

FIGURE 31:          ---SUB MENU 2--: MAGIC SPELLS

BY CLICKING THIS SYMBOL,ALL THE SPELLS WHICH THE CHARACTER HAS ALREADY
LEARNED,APPEAR.

FIGURE 32:          (SHOWN AS A BLUE SQUARE..WITH A FIGURE. HEAD AND SHOULDERS
                     WHICH HAS A MASK TYPE SYMBOL NEXT TO IT)
                     PREPARATION OF A SPELL. THE SPELL CLICKED ON THIS ICON IS
                     USED IN CONJUCTION WITH THE MAGIC ICON(ON LOWER PART OF
                     SCREEN).IE, A CHARACTER CAN ONLY HOLD ONE SPELL AT A TIME
                     IN HIS MEMORY.

............................THE BATTLE SCREEN...............................

WHEN A CONFLICT DEVELOPS WITH A GROUP OF MONSTERS,THE BATTLE SCENE IS PORTRAYED
FROM A SIDE ANGLE.THE PARTY ALWAYS STARTS THE BATTLE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF
THE SCREEN AND THE ENEMY ATTACKS FROM THE LEFT.THE BATTLE BEGINS WITH THE FIRST
ATTACK-WETHER LAUNCHED BY THE PARTY OR BY THE MONSTERS.BEFORE EXPLAINING IN
MORE DETAIL THE PROCEDURE OF THE BATTLE MODE,LETS JUST BRIEFLY CONSIDER THE
PRINCIPLE OF THE BATTLE SCREEN. THE CONFLICT IS STAGED IN SO-CALLED ROUNDS. ONE
BATTLE ROUND INVOLVES ONE ACTION BY A CHARACTER AND CORRESPONDING REACTION OF
THE OPPONENT.AT THE START OF EACH BATTLE ROUND THE CHARACTERS ARE INFORMED
WHICH MOVES SHOULD BE MADE.
ALL CHARACTERS ARE PROVIDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS ONE AFTER THE OTHER.AFTERWARDS
THE COURSE OF BATTLE CAN BE OBSERVED ON THE SCREEN;OUR HEROES CARRY OUT THEIR
ACTIONS AND THEN THE MONSTERS MAKE THEIR MOVE.ONCE ALL MOVES HAVE BEEN CARRIED
OUT NEW COMMANDS ARE GIVEN TO THE CHARACTERS FOR THE FOLLOWING ROUND.AND NOW
THE DETAILS....

FIGURE 33:  
EACH CHARACTER HAS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MOVES PER BATTLE ROUND.THE AMOUNT
DEPENDS ON EXPERIENCE,RACE AND THE POSSIBLE SPELLS INVOLVED. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER
OF MOVES PER CHARACTER CAN ACHIEVE IS NINE,IN PRACTISE THIS MEANS,FOR
EXAMPLE,THAT A CHARACTER WITH THREE MOVES CAN RUN TWICE AND HIT ONCE.

THE COMMANDS ARE GIVEN TO EACH CHARACTER BY MEANS OF THE USUAL ICON SYSTEM,THE
RIGHT HAND MOUSE ALTERNATES BETWEEN MOVEMENT AND COMMAND SYMBOLS.EACH
CHARACTER,IN TURN,IS GIVEN HIS COMMANDS USING THE ICONS,ASSISTANCE IS GIVEN AT
THE SAME TIME BY TEXTS IN THE CENTRAL WINDOW AND BY THE SMALL OVERALL VIEW IN
THE TOP LEFT OF THE SCREEN.FROM HERE THE BATTLE CAN BE SEEN FROM A BIRDS EYE
VIEW AND PROGRAMMED MOVEMENTS IMMEDIATELY BECOME VISIBLE.

TWO NUMBERVALUES ARE TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE PORTRAITS OF THE HEROES.HP REPRESENTS
THE REMAING `HIT POINTS` OF THE CHARACTER AND THE MP THE REMAINING `MAGIC
POIINTS`.THE HELP SCREEN IS TURNED OFF DURING BATTLE. THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS ARE
POSSIBLE ON THE BATTLE SCREEN.

FIGURE 34:     (SHOWN AS AN ARROW POINTING RIGHT) CHARCTER WALKS FORWARD ONE
               STEP(TO THE RIGHT AS SEEN BY THE OBSERVER)

FIGURE 35:     (SHOWN AS AN ARROW POINTING LEFT)  CHARACTER WALKS BACK ONE
               STEP(TO THE LEFT AS SEEN BY THE OBSERVER)

FIGURE 36:     (SHOWN AS AN ARROW POINTING UP) CHARACTER WALKS ONE STEP TO THE
               LEFT(BACKWARDS AS SEEN BY THE OBSERVER)

FIGURE 37:     (SHOWN AS AN ARROW POINTING DOWN) CHARACTER WALKS ONE STEP TO
               THE RIGHT(FORWARDS AS SEEN BY THE OBSERVER)

FIGURE 38:     (SHOWN AS ARROW DOUBLING BACK ON ITSELF TO THE LEFT)CHARACTER
               TURNS AROUND.

FIGURE 39:     (SHOWN AS AN INVERTED STAR)-MAGIC-..THE CURRENTLY ACTIVATED
               SPELL IS CARRIED OUT.

FIGURE 40:     (SHOWN AS A SWORD POINTING RIGHT)-ATTACK-..A MONSTER IS
               ATTACKED,DEPENDING ON THE WEAPON IN HAND THIS CAN BE A LONG
               DISTANCE ATTACK(ARROW,DAGGER,MAGICAL WEAPON,ECT.)

FIGURE 41:     (SHOWN AS A SHIELD)-DEFENCE-..THE PLAYER IS FORCED INTO THE
               DEFENSIVE FOR THE REST OF ALL REMAINING MOVES.DEPENDING ON HIS
               EXPERIENCE,HE IS UNABLE TO AVOID ATTACKS OR DEFEND HIMSELF.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO TRY AND MEMORISE A NEW SPELL DURING THE HEAT OF
BATTLE,THIS SHOULD BE PREPARED BEFORE THE START OF CONFLICT.AT THE END OF A
BATTLE ROUND,THE LARGE TEXT WINDOW IS ACTIVATED AND THE EVENTS OF THE ROUND CAN
BE GLEANED.

................................ESCAPE.....................................

LESS HEROIC, BUT OFTEN FAR MORE SENSIBLE,IS TO ESCAPE FROM THE OVERWHELMING
OPPONENTS.ALL THAT THE PARTY HAS TO DO IS TO LEAVE THE BATTLE SCREEN THROUGH
ONE OF THE EXITS.HOWEVER,ALL CHARACTERS MUST USE THE SAME ESCAPE ROUTE AND THEY
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SPLIT UP FROM EACH OTHER! UNFORTUNATELY,FLEEING ENTAILS A
SLIGHT LOSS OF CHARACTER POINTS. HOWEVER,MANY OPPONENTS DONT FIGHT TO THE POINT
OF SURRENDER,BUT PREFER TO LEAVE BATTLE.SUCH A MONSTER WILL ATTEMPT TO EXIT THE
BATTLE SCENE BY THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE ROUTE.THE TEXT EVALUATION OF THE BATTLE
ROUND DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE FLEEING MONSTER.SLAYING OPPONENTS AS THEY FLEE IS
PUNISHED BY LOSS OF CHARACTER POINTS.

.............................THE REWARD OF THE BATTLE........................

EACH CHARACTER GAINS EXPERIENCE POINTS FOR EACH MONSTER HE MANAGES TO
DEFEAT.THE AMOUNT OF POINTS AWARDED IS DEPENDANT ON THE STRENGTH OF THE
OPPONENT.FURTHER MORE,MANY MONSTERS CARRY GOLD WITH THEM WHICH WILL
AUTOMATICALLY BE CLAIMED BY THE VICTOR.

.................THE BATTLE SCENARIO IN THE DUNGEONS..........................

IN THE OLD SCHOOLS OF MAGIC THE CHAMBERS ARE BASICALLY SHOWN FROM A SIDE VIEW
ON THE SCREEN. THIS MEANS,AMONGST OTHER THINGS,THAT A MONSTER ISNT NECESSARY IN
EVERY CHAMBER, THE STEERING OF THE GROUP REMAINS THE SAME,BUT THERE ARE ONE OR
TWO PARTICULAR THINGS WHICH MUST BE EXPLAINED IN MORE DETAIL.

TREASURE CHESTS AND GOLDEN CLOSETS ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE DUNGEON CHAMBERS,THE
CHESTS CONTAIN ALL SORTS OF VALUABLE OBJECTS.HOWEVER,THE CLOSETS CONTAIN
WRITTEN SCROLLS WHICH ARE ENDOWED WITH MAGIC SPELLS OF THE OLD MAGICIANS!.A
CHARACTER MUST BE STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF A CHEST OR A CLOSET IN ORDER TO
EMPTY THE CONTENTS AND HE DOES SO USING THE ICON ALREADY IN THE 3D PROCEDURE.
AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 43.

FIGURE 43:   (SHOWN AS AN OPEN CHEST)-OPENING THE CHEST-

UNLIKE THE BATTLE SCENARIO ON THE SURFACE THERE MAY BE UP TO FOUR EXITS IN THE
DUNGEONS,A DOOR AHEAD (AS SEEN BY THE OBSERVER) CAN BE REGONISED BY A NARROW
WOODEN BEAM ON THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE BATTLE SCREEN.THIS CAN BE DONE WITH
THE`LEAVING THE CHAMBER ICON` AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 44:(SHOWN AS A DOOR OPENED AND
A CURSOR POINTING IN).

THE WHOLE GROUP MAY LEAVE THE CHAMBER IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION WHICH MUST BE
DETERMINED BY CLICKING THE ICON WITH THE DIRECTION ARROWS,THIS IS,HOWEVER,ONLY
POSSIBLE WHEN THERE ARE NO MONSTERS LEFT IN THE CHAMBER.

PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO THE FACT THAT THE CHAMBERS ARE ALWAYS
SHOWN WITH THE PARTY ON THE LEFT.THEREFORE, LEAVING THE CHAMBER IS ONE OF THE
OTHER RESULTS IN A TWISTING OF THE SURROUNDINGS!.ESCAPE IS ONLY POSSIBLE BY
MEANS OF THE DOORS.

CHARACTER ARMS;

OUR FOUR HEROES HAVE VARYING ABILITIES AND MERITS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR
DIFFERENT RACES AND PROFESSIONS.NOT ALL OF THEM CAN HANDLE EVERY WEAPON OR
ARMAMENT.EACH CHARACTER`S PREFERENCES AND AVERSIONS WITH THE REGARD TO HANDLING
WEAPONS IS DETAILED BELOW.

BLADUS:      AS A TRAINED WARRIOR HE CAN MANAGE ALMOST ALL WEAPONARY. THE ONLY
EXCEPTIONS ARE WEAPONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY CREATED FOR OTHER RACES
THESE ARE: MAGICAL CASTING HATCHET
           CLUB
           ELVEN BOW.

RINAKLES:   IS MORE ACCUSTOMED TO SPIRITUAL RATHER THAN PHYSICAL
DISCIPLINE.MANY WEAPONS ARE TO HEAVY FOR HIM.THE WEAPONS HE CAN`T HANDLE ARE:
           SWORD......BATTLE AXE.....BATTLE HATCHET.....MAGICAL CASTING HATCHET
           CLUB....AND ALL BOWS.

DOBRANUR:   THE DWARF POPULATION IS KNOWN FOR ITS STRENGTH AND TENACITY SINCE
THE BEGINNING OF TIME.MOST DWARFS ARE THEREFORE EFFECTIVE WARRIORS. THEY
DO,HOWEVER,DESPISE A FEW WEAPONS ON PRINCIPLE,OR BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN LIMITED
SIZE.  THESE ARE:  PROTRACABLE SWORD....STILLETO....ALL ARROWS

 
ANDARIEL:  IN COMMON WITH ALL MEMBERS OF THE ELF POPULATION,ANDARIEL IS NOT
BLESSED WITH EXCESSIVE STRENGTH,FIGHTING ALSO GOES AGAINST HER GRAIN;AT BEST
SHE REAGARDS FIGHTING AS A NECESSARY EVIL,ACCORDINGLY,SHE IS NOT `AU FAIT` WITH
MANY WEAPONS,BUT BEING AN ELF SHE IS QUITE TALENTED IN ARCHERY.THE WEAPONS SHE
DOES NOT USE ARE:  SWORD...PROTRACTABLE SWORD...CRYSTAL BLADES...BATTLE
                   AXE..CLUB...MAGIC CASTING AXE....

...........................THE OPPONENTS....................................

OUR HEROES WILL HAVE TO FACE MANY DANGERS DURING THEIR JOURNEY,NOT ONLY DO THE
CREATURES OF THE MAGICIANS WAR POSE A THREAT,BUT SO DO WILD ANIMALS.HERE IS A
LIST OF THE MONSTERS `KNOWN` TO MAKE THE SURFACE AND DUNGEONS UNSAFE FOR
TRAVELLERS.

ORCS;          
SCANTILY CKAD CREATURES,MOSTLY ONLY WEARING A BIT OF ANIMAL SKIN TO COVER
THEMSELVES.THEY SMELL SOMEWHAT ROTTEN,AND HAVE LARGE EARS WITH WHICH THEY CAN
HEAR REMARKABLY WELL.THEIR SKIN IS BROWN AND HAIRY,AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES GROW
TO BE AS TALL AS A FULLY GROWN MAN. ORCS ARE NOT CREATURES OF THE MAGICIANS
WAR,BUT ARE A TRIBE OF PRIMATIVE HUNTERS FROM WEST OF DORITHANNON.THEY MAY BE
CARRYING WEAPONS.

ENERGY BOLTS;
NO-ONE IS SURE ABOUT WHERE THESE ABSTRACT FORMS COME FROM OR WHAT THEY ARE MADE
OF,BASICALLY THEY ARE ROUND AND GREEN WITH A HINT OF BLAZING FIRE INSIDE.THEY
LASH OUT BOLTS OF FIRE AT WHOEVER THEY WANT TO ATTACK.ENERGY BOLTS ARE ABOVE
ALL DANGEROUS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR SPEED!.

SERPENTS:
A LETHALLY DANGEROUS LIFE FORM.GREEN IN COLOUR.THERE ARE SPECIES WHICH STRANGLE
AND SPECIES WHICH ARE POISONOUS.BUT WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON,IS THAT THEY ARE
MEAN-AND DONT TRUST THEM EVEN WHEN ITS THEIR BACKS THAT ARE TURNED ON YOU!.

GHOSTS;
BLUE,SHIMMERING,SEMI TRANSPARENT FORMS THAT CANNOT BE TOUCHED OR HARMED BY ANY
COMMON PHYSICAL MEANS.THEY CAN DISOLVE INTO BROWN CLOUDS THAT SMELL LIKE
SULPHUR,AND USUALLY THEIR PRESENCE CAN BE DETECTED BEFORE THEY COME INTO VIEW
BY VIRTUE OF THEIR UNIQUE SCENT.THERE ARE GHOSTS WHO ARE UNAFFECTED WHEN
ATTACKED WITH NORMAL WEAPONS SUCH AS SWORDS,AXES AND BOWS.WHAT IS MORE,GHOULS
ARE PRETTY NIMBLE OOPONENTS.

GHOULS;
HOLLOW SHAPES CLAD IN BLUE ROBES,SMALLER THAN HUMANS.THEY LASH FORTH BALLS OF
FIRE FROM THEIR EYES WHICH SEEM TO FLOAT IN THE HOLLOWNESS OF THEIR FACES,WHICH
IN TURN ARE HIDDEN UNDER THEIR HOODS,WHEN THEY DIE,THEY DISOLVE INTO OBLIVION.
THE GHOULS USE A KIND OF MAGIC IN BATTLE WHICH AFFECTS THE WHOLE GROUP!.AS IN
THE CASE OF GHOUSTS THERE ARE ALSO GHOULS WHO ARE IMMUNE TO `PHYSICAL`WEAPONS.

BEARS;
NATURALLY PEACFUL ANIMALS THAT ARE GENERALLY HAIRY,BROWN,AND WALK ON ALL
FOURS.WHEN THEY STAND ON THEIR HIND LEGS THEY WELL EXCEED THE HEIGHT OF ADULT
HUMANS.AND AN ANGRY BEAR CAN BE LETHAL.IT IS SAID THAT SOME BEARS HAVE BEEN
AFFECTED BY THE MAGIC WARS AND BECOME PERMANTLY HOSTILE.

SKELETONS;
REMAINS OF STRANGE MEN WHO HAVE DIED THROUGH UNATURAL CAUSES,THEIR SKELETONS
HAVE BEEN DESTINED TO ROAM THE EARTH AND SEEK PREY UNTIL THEY ARE PUT TRULY TO
REST.THERE ARE ALSO SUPOSED TO BE SKELETONS ROAMING ABOUT WHICH BELONG TO THE
ELVES,DWARFS AND VARIOUS OTHER CREATURES AS WELL,ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NEVER BEEN
PROVEN. THE SKELETONS BECOME EVEN MORE DANGEROUS,OF COURSE,WHEN THEY ARE
CARRYING WEAPONS!!!.

BEASTS:
EMOTIONLESS CREATURES SPAWN FROM THE EARTH.THEY HIDE,MOTIONLESS,IN AREAS OF
PURPLE CLAY,FROM WHICH THEY MAY CREEP OUT UNEXPECTEDLY.THEY ARE HORNED,AND HAVE
AN EVIL GLAREWHICH HAS THE POWER TO STUN MANY UNSUSPECTING PASSER-BY`S.THEY
USUALLY EXPOSE HUGE FANGS,WHICH AGAIN ADDS TO THEIR TO STUN. WHEN THEY DIE THEY
DISAPPEAR INTO MUD.

BALRONS;
HUGE,STURDILY BUILT AND VERY STRONG CREATURES THAT ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO
DEFEAT IN NORMAL WARFARE.THEY HAVE WINGS TO FLY OVER OBSTACLES SUCH AS
MOUNTAINS AND OCEANS, AND ABNORMAL HOLLOW WHITE EYES.THEY CAN THROW FIRE,AND
DISSOLVE IN FLAMES WHEN THEY DISAPPEAR.BALRONS ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND ARE
EQUIPPED WITH MAGIC SPELLS THAT CAN HARM THE WHOLE GROUP.IN CLOSE
COMBAT,HOWEVER,THEIR BLOWS ARE EVEN MORE FEARFUL;ONLY THE EXTREMELY EXPERIENCED
ADVENTURER HAS ANY CHANCE OF SURVING AN ATTACKOF A BALRON.

TROLLS;
SLIMY GREEN CREATURES WHO CAN TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO SPHERES WHEN THEY
DIE.THEIR EYES ARE SAID TO HAVE GREAT ABILITY TO STUN THE UNEXPECTED
ONLOOKER,ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NEVER BEEN PROVEN.LEGEND SAYS THAT THESE CREATURES
ARE ONLY ACTIVE AT NIGHT-IF THE SUN MANAGES TO CAST ITS RAYS UPON THEM ..THEY
WILL TURN TO STONE.PERHAPS THAT EXPLAINS WHY TROLLS ARE FOUND IN UNDERGROUND
DUNGEONS.

GNOLLS;
CREATURES SMALLER THAN MAN,THEY RADIATE FILTH AND SMELL EVEN WORSE THAN
ORCS.NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT THESE CREATURES.BUT IT IS CERTAINLY CLAIMED THEY
CAN BE DEADLY IF THEY WANTED TO BE!.THEY ALSO RESIDE IN THE DUNGEONS.

STATUES;
STRONG BEINGS MADE OF SMOOTH GRANITE,THEY ARE VIRTUALLY INDESTRUCTABLE AS THE
MATERIAL THEY ARE WROUGHT FROM,THEY ARE MUCH TALLER THAN BEARS AND TOWER ABOVE
AN ADULT HUMAN,BY AT LEAST TWO HEADS,THEY THROW FIRE AND THEIR EYES RADIATE A
MALICIOUS KIND OF RED LIGHT.THEY ARE RELICS OF THE OLD MAGICIANS WHICH ARE
OBVIOUSLY INTENDED TO PROTECT THE MAGICIANS SECRETS.THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO
MOVE,BUT ONE IS WELL ADVISED TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR LINE OF FIRE!, IT IS SAID
THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE WEAPON WHICH WILL DESTROY THEM.

CRYSTAL GUARDS;
A LIVING GEM ALMOST THE SIZE OF A GROWN MAN,THEIR TRUE APPEARENCE CAN ONLY BE
IMAGINED,AS NOBODY WHO EVER CAME ACROSS ONE HAS MANAGED TO ESCAPE ITS
POWER.THEY ARE EXTREMELY LETHAL,AND THEY TOO,ARE VIRTUALLY INDESTRUCTABLE.

....................THE ART OF MAGIC........................................

LONG BEFORE THE TIME OF THIS STORY,MAGIC BELONGED TO THE EVERY DAY LIFE OF THE
ELVES,DWARFS AND HUMANS.HARDLY ANYONE KNOWS OF THIS LOST ART ANY MORE,HOWEVER,
IN THE OLD SCHOOLS OF MAGIC THERE ARE STILL SOME RECORDS OF SPELLS COMMONLY
USED IN THE OLD DAYS.IF SUCH A SCROLL IS DISCOVERED,THE PROCESS OF LEARNING A
SPELL IS SIMPLE,SIMPLY READ THE TEXT,AND THE SPELL WILL IMPRINT ITSELF ON THE
MEMORY. TO CARRY OUT THIS ACTION,CLICK,`INVESTIGATE`IN THE KIT INDICATOR AND
THEN ON THE SCROLL.
THE SCROLL WITH THE SPELL WILL DISAPPEAR IMMEDIATELY ITS BEEN READ.
AS IS WELL KNOWN,THERE WERE DOCTRINES OF BOTH WHITE AND BLACK MAGIC,WHICH
BOTH,UNDERSTANDABLY DEVOLPED IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND NOW TO THE SUMMARY OF
THE ANCIENT SPELLS WHICH HAVE BEEN RECORDED AND HIDDEN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE
DUNGEONS.

............................WHITE MAGIC SPELLS..............................
 
LIGHT;                 A BRILLIANT WHITE AURA IS FORMED AROUND THE PERSON
                       PERFORMING THE SPELL,VERY USEFUL IN DARK DUNGEONS.
                       NECESSARY MAGIC POINTS...;3

BANISHING THE UNDEAD;  SHOULD THE GROUP ENCOUNTER CREATURES OF THE UNDEAD SUCH
                       AS SKELETONS,GHOSTS AND GHOULS,THIS SPELL CAN BE USED TO
                       MASTER THE SITUATION.THE UNDEAD,OR AT LEAST SOME OF THEM
                       WILL DISBAND OR FLEE.THIS SPELL CAN BE USED ONLY ONCE
                       DURING CONFLICT. NECESSARY MAGIC POINTS: 5

MAGIC BOW;             A BATTLE MAGIC. A MAGIC MISSILE IS HURLED AT THE
                       OPPONENT.THE MAGIC ARROW,HOWEVER,DOES NOT CAUSE MUCH

.............................EVERY DAY SPELLS...............................

AS ALREADY MENTIONED,MAGIC,USED TO BE AN ORDINARY PART OF EVERY DAY LIFE.
THAT`S WHY YOU WILL ALSO FIND SPELLS IN THE OLD SCHOOLS THAT NHAVE NOTHING MUCH
TO DO WITH THE ADVENTUROUS TYPE OF QUEST YOU`R ON.FOR THE OLD
TUTOR,DAMBRANO,HOWEVER,THEY ARE INVALUABLE.ONE SHOULD SUPPLY HIM WITH THESE TO
ENABLE TO SET UP THE NEW FACULTY OF MAGIC,THE FOLLOWING `EVERYDAY` SPELLS CAN
BE FOUND;
...TREE HEALING...WOOD HARDENING...FERTLITY...SHAPING OF ROCK...GLOWING OF
STONE...ROCK HARDENING...FIND ORE...CONSERVE...GLOW MIST.

USE OF BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC;
BOTH BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC DEMAND A GREAT AMOUNT OF SPIRITUAL POWER,AND MUCH
CONCENTRATION IS NEEDED TO PERFORM THE SPELLS.HOWEVER,THE STATE OF
CONSCIOUSNESS ACCUSTOMS ITSELF TO ONE OR THE OTHER FORM OF MAGIC. SOMEONE WHO
HAS OFTEN EMPLOYED WHITE MAGIC WILL AT FIRST FIND IT DIFFICULT TO EMPLOY `BLACK
MAGIC`. A BEAM INDICATOR IN THE STATUS INDICATOR ILLUSTRATES THIS POINT. THE
BEAM INDICATOR HAS IN EACH DIRECTION -TO THE LEFT BALCK MAGIC AND TO THE RIGHT
WHITE MAGIC-A MAXIMUM OF FIVE STAGES.THIS MEANS IN PRACTISE THAT WHEN A
CHARACTER HAS USED THREE `WHITE`SPELLS,FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN WANTS TO MAKE USE
OF A `BLACK` SPELL, THE SPELL WILL FAIL THREE TIMES UNTIL THE BEAM HAS AT LAST
REACHED NEUTRAL POSITION.

................SPECIALISATION OF CHARACTERS.................................

NOT EVERY CHARACTER HAS THE TALENT TO LEARN ANY NUMBER OF SPELLS.THE MAGICAL
TALENT AMONG THE HEROES VARIES CONSIDERABLY;

BLADUS;      HAS A TENDENCY TO MAKE MORE USE OF HIS BODY THAN HIS SPIRIT,BUT HE
CAN MASTER SPELLS; HE LEARNS PARTICULARY THOSE SPELLS WHICH ARE USEFUL IN
BATTLE.

RINAKLES;    IS THE MOST TALENTED MAGICIAN OF THE PARTY,HE MASTERS ALL SPELLS
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE NATURAL TO THE ELF POPULATION. TO WHICH THIS RACE
HAS ECESS.

DOBRANUR;    MAGIC WHICH DOESNT SERVE TO FORGE OR FORM METAL HAS,SINCE THE
BEGINNING OF TIME,HAS BEEN SUSPECT MATTER FOR THE DWARF POPULATION. MANY OF THE
RANKS WERE NOT MADE FOR IT. DOBRANUR IS,HOWEVER,VERY TALENTED FOR A DWARF,EVEN
THOUGH NOT QUITE AS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT AS DAMBRANO.SOME SPELLS JUST DONT SEEM
TO SINK IN FOR HIM,BUT OTHERS HE CAN REMEMBER WITHOUT PROBLE.

ANDARIEL;    ONE FORM OF THE MAGICAL PROFESSION WAS ALWAYS DEAR TO THE HEART OF
THE ELF POPULATION, HEALING LIVING BEINGS AND PLANTS, NO OTHER RACE HAS THIS
PRONOUNCED TENDENCY TOWARDS ANY PARTICULAR FORM OF MAGIC.IN SPITE OF
THIS,ANDARIEL HAS A RATHER MODEST TALENT AND SHE CAN EASILY MASTER SOME OF THE
LESS DEMANDING SPELLS OF BATTLE,AND LIGHT MAGIC.

........................MAGICAL OBJECTS AND POTIONS..........................

EVEN THOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF MAGIC WAS LOST MANY YEARS AGO,THERE ARE STILL A
FEW RELICS OF MAGICAL POWER REMAINING FROM THIS TIME. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHICH
ARE THE RINGS OF STASIS-DAMBRANOS GIFT TO HIS PUPILS(SEE *REVIVAL)THERE ARE
HOWEVER SUPPOSED TO BE OTHER MAGICAL REMAINS IN THE DARK DUNGEONS WHICH HAVE
SURVIVED TO THE PRESENT TIME.

PROTECTION RINGS;

THESE INCONSPICOUS RINGS HAVE THE QUALITY OF REDUCING THE IMPACT OF ATTACKS ON
THE HOLDER. THERE ARE SMALL,MEDIUM AND LARGE SIZE PROTECTION RINGS,THEIR
PROTECTION VALUE PROPORTINAL TO THEIR SIZE. THE USE OF THE RINGS DOES NOT
REPLACE ARMAENTS,BUT IS TAKEN AS A FORM OF ADDITIONAL PROTECTION.ONLY ONE OF
THE RINGS MAY BE USED AT A TIME.

DRAGON RINGS;

DRAGON RINGS SIMILARLY OFFER A FORM OF PROTECTION.IT IS SAID THAT,IN TIMES OF
OLD,THE DRAGONS GAVE THESE HEAD BANDS TO PEOPLE TO WHOM THEY ENTRUSTED A
DANGEROUS MISSION. THE PROTECTION THEY OFFER IS EXCELLENT.NO-ONE
KNOWS,HOWEVER,WETHER THERE ARE ANY DRAGONRINGS LEFT AT ALL....

POTIONS;

MAGIC POTIONS CONSTITUE A SPECIAL KIND OF MAGIC WHICH IS CREDITED WITH ALL
SORTS OF EFFECTS,RANGING FROM INCREASING THE STRNGTH OF BOTH PHYSICAL AND
SPIRITUAL POWER. TO LETHAL POSIONS. THESE EFFECTS CAN BE STRENGTHED FURTHER OR
ALTERED BY COMBINING THE DIFFERENT FLUIDS. THE POTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
LONG LIFE,AND THERE ARE PROBABLY MANY OF THEM STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE OLD
SCHOOLS.HOWEVER,WHAT IS WRITTEN ON THEIR LABELS IN NO LONGER GENERALLY
UNDERSTOOD.

MAGIC WANDS;

OF DIFFERENT TYPES WERE USED TO STRENGTHEN MAGICAL POWERS,OR MADE IT POSSIBLE
FOR NON-MAGICIANS TO MAKE USE OF SUPER NATURAL ENERGIES. NO-ONE POSSESSES SUCH
AN ARTIFACT ANY MORE,BUT THE DISCOVERY OF ONE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY PROVE VERY
USEFUL TO OUR HEROES.IT IS SAID THAT MAGIC WANDS WERE INTENDED AS HORRIFIC
WEAPONS.

FATAL INJURY AND REVIVAL OF CHARACTERS;

AS WE ARE AWARE,MANY DANGERS LURK FOR THE PARTY DURING THEIR TRAVELS.SOME OF
THESE COULD IN FACT MEAN DEATH FOR ANY OF OUR HEROES..IN ORDER TO AVOID THE
WORST AND ALSO MAKE HIS PUPILS A LITTLE LESS AFRAID,DAMBRANO PASSED ON TO HIS
GROUP HIS LAST REMAINING RELIC;THE RING OF STASIS, A RING OF THIS TYPE IS ABLE
TO PERCEIVE WETHER OR NOT INJURY OF THE BEARER COULD THREATEN TO BECOME
FATAL.THEN IT OPENS UP ITS MAGIC POWER AND TAKES IN THE BODY OF THE PERSON
CONCERNED. THE INJURED PERSON WHO HAS ENTERED THE RING CAN FREE HIMSELF FROM IT
AGAIN INSIDE ONE OF THE TEMPLES,WHICH ARE SPREAD ACROSS THE LAND,AND ALTHOUGH
IN A WEAKENED STATE,HE WILL HAVE REGAINED FULL HEALTH.

THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE HOWEVER WHEN AT LEAST ONE OF THE OTHER CHRACTERS IS STILL
ALIVE AND HE CAN BRING HIS COMPANIONS RINGS TO A TEMPLE.IF ALL OTHER MEMBERS OF
THE GROUP HAVE BEEN KILLED,THEN THERE IS NO LONGER HOPE.AND DEATH WILL ONCE
AGAIN BE VICTORIUOS...............

THE END...........TYPED BY SCOOTER OF GENESIS...............................
