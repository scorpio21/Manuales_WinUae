				DARK CASTLE

	Can you survive the haunted house on the hill? From the moment the
creaking drawbridge closes behind you until you slay the Black Knight, Dark
Castle is a nonstop life-and-death adventure. Pitting you against the evil that
threatens you at every turn. Dark Castle requires that you think quick, act
fast, and have a real zest for life.

	You're now entering the decathlon of danger. Your assignment? Overthrow
the Black Knight. But first you must safely pass through fourteen danger zones
- each more treatherous than the last -- that are guarded by everything from
flying monkeys to dragons.
	You have a handful of rocks - for fending off anything that stands (or
crawls or flies) in your way - and four extra lives for those instances you're
caught with your guard down. Bottles of elixir are scattered along your trek to
ward off bat and rat bites. As your quest progresses you may also come upon a
mace, fireballs, and a magic shield to aid your cause.

	Where will your adventure take you? Through dungeons, laboratories and
caves. Up and down ladders and ropes. Over trap doors. Past whipcracking
henchmen and Merlin the Magician, all of whom fill first, then ask questions.
By creepy crawlers, kamakazee vultures and other mutants of mischief. And the
more elusive you are, the more difficult it gets.

	So real it's frightening. Taking complete advantage of your computer's
sound and visual capabilities, Dark Castle has you looking over your shoulder
as soon as your hunt for the Black Knight begins. Experience the thrill of Dark
Castle and find out yourself. Are you a hero? Or are you history?
