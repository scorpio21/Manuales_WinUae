The game of diplomacy is played in years consisting of three seasons: Spring,
Fall and Winter.  The Spring and Fall turns are when the players issue orders
for movement of their existing units (armies and fleets).  In the Winter turn,
supply center owners

HOW TO ISSUE ORDERS (Spring and Fall turns)

There are three possible orders for each unit on the board: hold, move or support.  In addition, fleets have a fourth option, "convoy" of an army from one coast to another.  In general, orders are issued by selecting the provinces involved.  This is done 
the province and clicking the left mouse button.  Each order requires 3 provinces: 
   the province containing the unit being ordered, 
   the province containing the unit that is moving, 
   and the destination province.
Clicking on these three provinces is usually enough to fully describe the order.  

   HOLD: click three times on the province containing the unit.
         (remember to click on the NAME of the province)

   MOVE: click twice on the province containing the unit to move;
         click the province where the unit is going.

SUPPORT: click the province containing the unit providing the support;
         click the province containing the unit receiving the support;
         if the supporting unit is a fleet in the water and the supported 
         unit is an army on the coast, then a requester will ask you to 
         select between "support" or "convoy"; select "support";
         click the province where the supported unit is going/staying.

 CONVOY: same as SUPPORT but select "convoy" at requester.  Note that a 
         convoy order is not valid unless the unit being convoyed is ordered
         to move to the same province.

A text representation of the order will be constructed in the upper right message area as each order is input.  The entire list of orders can be viewed on-screen or printed out at any time during order entry by selecting the proper item on the "orders" me

When all orders have been entered correctly, a click on the end gadget in the lower right corner will signal the computer to resolve the orders.  A requester will ask where to print the results of the orders.  Sending this list to the printer ("print") is

After the order results have been listed, the map is adjusted based on these 
results and all required retreats, if any, are announced.  The computer will 
then request the destinations for each retreating unit.  The "end" gadget can be used to order a unit to disband.  

ADJUSTING UNITS (Winter turn)

At the end of the Fall turn, the computer will automatically adjust supply ownership.  Then the numbers of supplies owned will be compared to the number of units deployed for each power.  Build or disband orders will be requested from each power as requir

             file)

      SAVE - saves current game configuration in file on disk for later 
             retrieval using OLD command

STATUS MENU
   These commands list the year and current supply ownership

     PRINT - output list to printer; includes list of units for each power;

   follow the rules accurately in resolving orders, gamemasters can chose to
   over-ride the decisions and adjust the map to what they believe is 
   correct.

             is replaced by the unit built

    SUPPLY - change/eliminate ownership of a supply province

KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the game is quit when the top edge of the map is displayed in the display window, computer memory will be corrupted.  The result of this is almost always a fatal software system error when a subsequent program is run.  The cause for this is unknown, bu

PLANNED REVISIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A computer opponent who will play any country or countries independently or as a team.  This will allow for a one-player game of World War I or variant thereof.  

More elaborate file requester for saving and retrieving files.  One that lists files in current directory and allows movement through directories.

Mapmaking utility to aid in the creation of other maps to use in game.  By the way, the map.data file was created with Deluxe Paint and is a standard IFF file (8 color, hires, 1000 x 400 pixels).  If anyone improves upon the artwork, please send me a copy
