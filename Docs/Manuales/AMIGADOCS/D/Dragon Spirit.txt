Dragon Spirit is an all action game where the player becomes a powerful
dragon bestowed with special powers. Your objective is to rescue the
princess Alicia who is held captive by the evil serpent demon Zawell.

Your dragon can bomb and fire simultaneously but sometimes even this
awesome power is not enough and you must locate and obtain extra powers
along the way by shooting the glowing creatures and catching the spells
they drop. Some eggs contain powerful spells such as extra heads or
increased firepower.

At the end of each of the eight levels you must face one of the nine
terrifying beasts instructed by the demon to stop you reaching your goal.
The more firepower you have collected the easier it will be to defeat the
beasts that guard the entrances to higher levels. Each beast has one
weakness and you must employ different strategies in order to destroy it.
