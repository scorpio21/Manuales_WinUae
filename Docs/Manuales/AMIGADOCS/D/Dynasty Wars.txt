Doc's for Dynasty Wars CRACKED 100% by SUPPLEX!!!
-----------------------------------------

GAME PLAY
---------
The game is played completely on horse back. Your objective is to
fight your way through eight legions of enemy infantry and cavalry
, to eventually defeat the evil warlord "Thung Choc". When starting
the game, you will be shown four characters along with particular 
particular weapons. Select the one you feel is best qualified to 
complete the task ahead.

Hint: A player with a high mental ability will be weak in the earlier
levels but becomes stronger later on.

Once your character has been selected, commence play. Use the weapon
and tactics you carry to defeat any adversary that may appear.

The damage your weapon can inflict is dependant on two factors:

1.The amount of aggression put into each strike. This is dependant on
the amount of time FIRE is depressed (a graphical display appears at
the bottom of the screen).

2.The number of weapon icons that are collected as you progress
through each level.

Special tactics are available to you when you find yourself in a 
perilous situation. Be aware however that the use of a tactic reduces
your physical power, thus affecting your waepon strength.

If you are hit by an adversary, your physical power will dwindle. When
all physical power is lost, you lose a life. You are allotted there
lives per game.
