			     GAMEPLAY
			    ##########

Following on in the tradition of great arcades,Irem,the creators of R-type
and Ninja Spirit,have come up with another,Dragon Breed.


			      The Story
			      ----------

Kayus the King of Agamen Empire when he was just fifteen years old.Those 
who were dissastified with his enthronement conspired to break the seal
confining the King of Darkness,Zambaquous,to seize the kingdom with the 
black power.


			      The Game
			      ---------

The main character (Kayus) sits astride a large dragon (Bahamoot) from this
position,he must fight dismounting the dragon at strategic place to aid 
progress.



				CONTROLS
			       ##########


The control of both the dragon and Kayus is controlled by joystick or keys
(depending on the version of the game).Like most trem games,Dragon Breed
has collectables.There are four types of collectqbles and three power levels
for each.See table below



RED            - Flames
SILVER         - Homing Dragons (like homing missiles but with baby Dragons)
BLUE           - Lightning Bolts
GOLD           - Scales

The dragon starts off green with no special weapons,and will change to the
relevant colour for the weapon picked up.The power levels work as follows;
if you pick up a red gem,the Dragon changest to the flames weapon.But on 
the lowest strenght.If you then pick up another red gem,you will move up to
the second power level.However,if you pick up a different coloured gem,the
Dragon will change to that weapon but will stay at the same power level as
before.So once on the top power level,unless you die you will stay here.
Apart from the pick up weapons,you have at your control two other weapons.
Karyus is firing a crossbow which increases in power with the power ups,
and the Dragons head fires a beam up (like R-Type).This operated by holdig
down the fire button and releasing.The power is determined by how long you
hold the fire button for.This is visually indicqted by a progressive glow
from the dragons mouth,getting brighter the longer you hold the fire
button depressed.


You haveone last weapon in your armory .If you have the Gold/Scales weapon
then you have the ability to coil the tail of the Dragon around Karyus,
completely protecting him (for a short period only).This is achieved by 
pushing up and pulling down quickly; pressing fire when coiled gives eight
way fire (depending on power up).You can also coil the blue/lighting bolt
Dragon.But it coils in the opposite direction,leaving Karyus on the outside
to achieve this push down and pull up quickly.

One last point,there is a time limit for each level! When not riding the 
Dragon the scroll stops and (only certain versions) will start as Karyus
walks to the right,so it is advantageous not to spend too much time off 
the Dragon !
