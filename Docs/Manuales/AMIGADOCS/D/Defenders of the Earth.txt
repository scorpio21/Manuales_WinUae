                -* Defenders Of The Earth Instruction Manual *-

                      -* As Always - Typed In By Mr.Z *-


DEFENDERS OF THE EARTH is based on the very popular t.v series of the
same name.  The defenders, four super heroes from the golden age of comics
are:

FLASH GORDON - The Team Leader
MANDRAKE THE MAGICIAN - A Master of illusion
LOTHAR - The strongest man in the world
THE PHANTOM - Has the strength of ten tigers at his command

They are aided and abetted by their pet mascot ZUFFY

A Team - invincible, ready, able and willing to defend the earth at all times.

The courage and skill of the defenders is put to the ultimate test by the
evil of their arch enemy MING THE MERCILESS.  He knows that only the defenders
stand in the way of his plans to be master of the world.  To stop them he
abducts their children and takes them to the dark dungeons of his fortress.
He issues a dire warning - interfere and your children die.

A daring plan is concieved and put into action. Detection by the highly
sophisticated intruder alarm would mean instant death of the children and
so flash will enter the dark and dangerous fortress alone in hope that he
will be able to pass undetected through the intruder systems. Flash agrees
to summon the other defenders to his aid should he need it.  Lothar and the
Phantom will use their incredible strength, Mandrake will use his occult
magical powers to confound the forces of evil under mings command and even
Zuffy offers his help in whatever way he can.

Flash, armed with a powerful handgun, transports into Ming's fortress with
the future of the world in the balance.


PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS

Flash starts the game with a number of power shields which will be worn down
by contact with enemy fire and direct contact with Ming's forces.  The shields
are shown in the bottom left of the screen.  Flash is invisible to the
detector system while he is on his own but watch out for the special
field generators.  Crossing the generators while they are still active will
set off the alarm and bring the full might of OCTON against him.

Flash can jump or duck to avoid the attacks by the vicious creatures
inhabitating the fortress and he must be careful of the secret weapons
concealed in the wall.  When flash needs special help of the other defenders,
he activates the `CALL HELP' key.  He will need them to help open some doors,
cross chasms, deactivate the intruder detection system etc.  The defender most
able to help will be sent by DYNAK-X.  If they are hit by the enemy forces
a loss of energy level will occur.  The defender will have to leave if his



energy level gets too low and will be unusable until his strength is built
up again.  If no one is available to help then flash will have to survive on
his own.

Flash can give his weapons extra charge if he can find power packs
scattered in the fortress.  He can also find and use more powerful guns
that will be useful in dealing with some of ming's special bodygaurds such
as Mongor the serpent.  He may also come across extra energy and extra
shields.  Ming's main throne room is the scene of the final battle where the
fate of the children and of the world will finally be decided.
