Playing

Andy has to tunnel his way into the orchards to steal fruit. The orchards are
well guarded. When he has eaten all the fruit in one orchard, he can move to
the next one to taste different fruit. He must take care while he is tunnelling
as there are many stones on the ground and if they fall on him, he will be
crushed to death. He must also plan his tunnelling in such a way that the
guards cannot trap him. If the worst comes to the worst, he can always shoot
them by pressing J/S Fire Button. Pressing the fire button at random you may
find the bullets ricochet back to kill him.
