                  -------------------------------------------


..........................TYME AND REALITY...................................

THE MENU SYSTEM;
THE TYME AND REALITY MENU OPERATING SYSTEM WORKS UNDER THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS
GEM ON THE ATARI,ITS JUST A LITTLE SURREAL.YOU USE THE MOUSE TO POINT AND CLICK
THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON IN ORDER TO CHOOSE AN ICON.

ON LOADING YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH THE MENU BAR OF `FIG 1`
THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE ARE;

JOYSTICK;
THIS ALLOWS YOU TO INTERACT WITH PLANET AND ITS ATMOSPHERE,TO PREVENT AND
RECTIFY DESTRUCTION,AND TO VIEW THE LANDSCAPES.

TRADE;
MONEY IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR,AND IN ORDER TO FINANCE YOUR METHODS OF `PLANET
REVIVIAL` YOU WILL NEED TO SELL PRECIOUS MATERIALS FOUND IN THE CITY.YOU MAY
ALSO NEED TO BUY USEFUL CHEMICALS AND FERTILISERS.

FUSION;
USING YOUR PERSONAL REACTOR,YOU MAY BHREAK CHEMICALS DOWN INTO THEIR COMPONENT
PARTS,OR COMBINE CHEMICALS TO MAKE NEW SUBSTANCES.YOU MAY NEED TO MAKE SUCH
THINGS AS PLANT FOOD,TO HELP BRING BACK DYING FORESTS.

THC;
TYME HOUNDED CONSCIENCE,THIS IS `THE CITY` SECTION OF THE GAME,AND WILL ALLOW
YOU TO GO INTO ONE OF THE MANY CITIES OF THE PLANET AND EXPLORE THEM IN YOUR
TRUSTY ARMOURED SUIT CODE NAMED `PELVTHRUST`

STATUS;
THIS WILL GIVE INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE PLANET,AND HOW YOU ARE
GETTING ON BASICALLY YOUR SCORE;

MISC;
WHERE ALL THE ICONS THAT GOT MISSED OUT OR THE `WOULDNT IT BE GOOD`IF..STUFF
GOES,BASICALLY ALLOWS YOU TO SAVE/LOAD PREVIOUSLY SAVED GAMES,ECT...

INFO;
(THE SIDEWAYS QUESTION MARK)
CHOOSING THOIS YOU`LL BE PRESENTED WITH VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT
VERSION NUMBER AND OTHER BITS OF EXTREME INTEREST CONCERNING `DEBUT`(LIKE THE
NAMES WARPED MINDS WHO WROTE IT).

..................................JOYSTICK..................................

THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEM IS TO INTERFASE THE USER WITH THE SIMULATED PLANET
AND THE CONSTRUCTION/DESTRUCTION OF IT.

FIG 2 SHOWS THE AVAILABLE JOYSTICK ICONS;

BRIEF DESCRIPTION;

1.    POLLUTION MAPPING MENUS, THIS BRINGS UP ANOTHER SET OF MENUS ALLOWING
      MAPPING SEPERATE TYPES OF POLLUTION(OZONE,NUCLEAR,EARTH)
2.    WIND MAPPING MENU
3.    CLOUD MAPPING MENU
4.    TEMPERATURE MAPPING SYSTEM
5.    JOYSTICK PROGRAMMING SYSTEM
6.    JOYSTICK OUTPUT CONTROLLER
7.    PROGRAM FILE SAVE AND LOAD
8.    CHOOSING COLOURS
9.    VIEWING MODE SELECTOR
10.   `THE GOOD JOB` SYSTEM
11.   RAIN MAPPING MENU
12.   ANIMAL LIVE MAPPING
13.   PLANT LIVE MAPPING
14.   WATER MAPPING
15. ZOOM TO INDIVIDUAL SQUARE

EACH ICON IS EXPLAINED IN GREATER DETAIL BELOW;
ALTHOUGH NOT IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OF ICON NUMBER WITHIN THE SYSTEM,THEY HAVE
BENN DSCRIBED IN VARYING STAGES OF DIFFICULTY OF USE,STARTING FROM THE BEGINNER
AND PROGRESSING TO EXPERT.

.............................VIEWING MODE SELECTOR...........................

THE DEBUT PLANET CAN BE MOVED FROM TWO FUNAMENTLY DIFFERENT POSITIONS,THESE ARE
KNOWN AS THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL VIEWS.

FROM THE LOCAL VIEW(SET DEFAULT WHEN YOU START) YOU CAN ONLY SEE A SMALL PART
OF THE PLANET(ROUGHLY 1/8) THIS IS SIMILAR TO AN ORBIT OF THE PLANETS
SURFACE(IE,IF YOU WENT ROUND THE WORLD ONCE THEN THE LOCAL VIEW WOULD BE ALL
THE GROUND YOU HAVE PASSED OVER. THE LOCAL VIEW TENDS TO BE MORE USEFUL,AS IT
IS EASIER TO PICK OUT INDIVIDUAL SQUARES (SEE FIG 3) THE GOLBAL VIEW IS MORE
LIKE LOOKING DOWN BOTH ENDS OF THE PLANETS POLES,TO THE LEFT IS THE TOP OF THE
PLANET AND THE RIGHT GLOBE IS THE BOTTOM POLE.(EG NORTH,AND SOUTH)..(SEE FIG 4)
THE GLOBAL VIEW IS MORE USEFUL FOR PICKING OUT PATTERNS AND TRENDS.

..................RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL AND GLOBAL VIEWS................

THE LOCAL VIEW IS 32 INDIVIDUAL SQUARES WIDE BY 30 DOWN,AND WHEN YOU FIRST
START PLAYING,YOUR ORBIT WOULD COVER ROUGHLY 1/4 OF THE TOP POLE.(1 ON FIG 5)

THE VIEWING MODE SELECTOR IS ONLY CONCERNED WITH HOW YOU WILL SEE PLANETS LOCAL
VIEW AND DOES NOT AFFECT THE GLOBAL ONE.
THE MENU IS SHOWN IN (FIG 6)
1.     DIRECTION SELECTORS, THESE ALLOW YOU TO HAVE THE VIEW FROM EITHER
       NORTH,SOUTH,EAST OR WEST.WHICH IS USEFUL FOR SEEING BEHIND HILLS.ECT

2.     DIMENSION SELECTOR, YOU MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE
       LANDSCAPE(IE HILLS OR VIEW IT JUST FLAT,IF IT HIGHLIGHTED THEN IT WILL
       BE THE 3 DIMENSIONAL REPRESENTATION)

3.     IT IS USEFUL TO NOTE THAT DEBUT IS PRIMARILY AN ATMOSSPERIC OF A
       PLANET,THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH WILL AFFECT THE CO-SYSTEM AND AS SUCH,
       ALL LIFE ON THE PLANET.

IT DOES NOT TAKE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY INTO CONSIDERATION TO ANY GREAT DEGREE,TO
PROCESS ALL THIS WOULD TAKE YOUR COMPUTER A RATHER LONG TIME,AND THIS POOR
PROGRAMMER EVEN LONGER!!

.........................CHOOSING COLOURS...................................

RED ROCKS,RED LIFE,RED TEMPERATURE AND RED RAIN..RIGHT BORED WITH ALL THOSES
REDS YET?...I AM, OK SELECT THIS ICON AND YOUR PRESENTED WITH A SMALL MENU
WHICH LISTS SEVERAL FAIRLY SELF EXPLANATORY COLOUR.TAKE YOUR CHOICE AND HAVE
FUN,FROM CONVENTIONAL TO PSYCHEDELLIC PLANETS!
THE LAST COLOUR TO CHOOSE,YOU MAY NOTICE IS,`SELF`.THIS CAN BE USED TO SELECT
YOUR OWN CHOICE OF COLOURS WHEN YOU BECOME MORE COMPENTENT AT USING DEBUT(SEE
LATER SECTIONS ON JOYSTICK PROGRAMMING AND MAPPING).

........................JOYSTICK OUTPUT SELECTOR..............................

THIS IS BASICALLY THE CONTROL PANEL OF JOYSTICK,FROM HERE YOU WILL RUN PROGRAMS
AND SET GLOBAL PARMETERS (SEE FIG 7)

1.   ORBIT OR SCAN SELECTOR;-ONCE CHOSEN YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH, THE LEFT
     AND RIGHT CURSORS WILL MOVE POINTERS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE <RETURN> WILL
     SELECT THE ORBIT.
     IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A PICTURE OF THE GLOBAL MAP DISPLAYED AT THE
     TIME,AS THE POSITION OF THE ARROWS COINCIDES WITH WHERE THE ORBIT IS ON
     THE PLANET.(DISPLAYED ABOVE) THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED SIMPLY BY SETTING
     PROGRAM PARAMETERS  FOR GLOBAL VIEW (SEE LATER) AND RUNNING PROGRAM(IT
     DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU HAVE`NT WRITTEN A PROGRAM YET,OR IF THERE IS NOT A
     PROGRAM IN MEMORY)
2.   PARAMETER MAINTENANCE;- SEE LATER FOR ADVANCED PROGRAMMING
3.   PROGRAM EXECUTE;- THIS MUST BE PRESSED IN ORDER TO RUN PROGRAMS,SEE ALSO
     JOYSTICK PROGRAMMING.
4.   THREE MORE DAYS;- IT MIGHT SOMETIMES BE NECESSARY TO STAY WITHIN TYME AND
     REALITY RATHER THAN GO BACK INTO THE CITIES,IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT WHAT
     EFFECTS YOUR LAST EFFORTS HAD,AND TO DEPLOY MORE RESOURCES.HOWEVER,YOU
     WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO GO INTO THE CITY,THE GAME CANNOT BE PLAYED FULLY
     BY JUST USING THE MENU SYSTEM.

..............................ZOOMING ON A SQUARE...........................

WHEN CHOSEN,JOYSTICK WILL EXECUTE THE PROGRAM THAT IS CURRENTLY IN
MEMORY,GIVING ITS OUTPUT AS A LOCAL MAP IN YOUR CURRENT ORBIT(SEE FIG 32) ONCE
DRAWN YOU MAY MOVE THE HIGHLIGHTED SQUARE AROUND THIS AREA AND SELECT A
SPECIFIC SQUARE TO GET EXTENSIVE INFORMATION ON IT (SEE FIG 8)

NOTE;  IF YOU NOW GO TO THE `GOD JOB` SYSTEM,THIS IS THE SQUARE THAT YOU WILL
BE WORKING ON.
THE CONTROLS FOR MOVING ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE ARE AS FOLLOWS;
LEFT CURSOR;- MOVES YOU LEFT...RIGHT CURSOR;- MOVES YOU RIGHT...UP CURSOR;-
MOVES YOU UP...<RETURN> WILL SELECT THAT SQUARE(AND GIVE YOU INFO ON IT)

............................JOYSTICK TUTORIAL................................

JOYSTICK PROGRAMMING FOR BEGINNERS;
DEBUT HAS ITS OWN ICON BASED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE,WHICH WE HOPE IS EASY ENOGH
FOR ANYBODY TO USE,BUT OFFERS ENOUGH TO SCOPE TO ANYBODY WHOSE WILLING TO
EXPERIMENT AND LEARN(EVEN WE HAD HEADACHES WANDERING WHAT ICONS WE PROGRAMMED
WERE SUPPOSED TO DO!)
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT YOUR PROGRAMS ARE EXECUTED IN A SIMILAR WAY TO
ANY OTHER LANGUAGE,SO MORE OFTEN THAN NOT,IF NOTHING SEEMS TO HAPPEN IT IS
PROBABLY LIKELY ITS DUE TO YOUR PROGRAMMING AND NOT TYME AND REALITY.

JOYSTICK PROGRAMMING SYSTEM;
THIS ICON(V) ON MAIN JOYSTICK PANEL AND IS USED AS A DATABASE TYPE PROGRAMMING
LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE USER TO INTERROGATE THE PLANETS CURRENT
TRENDS,WEATHER,ECOLOGY AND STATE IN GENERAL,(SEE FIG 19) BELOW IS THE
DESCRIPTION.

1.   UP/DOWN ARROWS;- THESE ARE USED TO SELECT WHICH SUBJECT YOU WISH TO
PROGRAM,IF UP IS CONTINUOSLY SELECTED IT WILL EVENTUALLY COME BACK TO START.

2.   TITLE;- HERE IS THE TITLE OF WHAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY PROGRAMMING IS SHOWN.

3.   SELECTOR;- THIS ALLOWS YOU TO SELECTIVELY ENABLE/DISABLE THE CURRENT
OPTION FROM THE MAIN PROGRAM,WHEN YOU COME TO EXECUTE IT.

4.   AND/OR/NOT;- THESE DETERMINE THE LOGICAL OPERATION TO BE PERFORMED ON THE
CURRENT PARAMETER.PROGRAMMING IN GREATER DETAIL IS DESCRIBED BELOW.

5.   UNIVERSAL VIEW;- THIS ICON,ONCE PRESSED HAS AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF DRAWING
THE PLANET AND SHOWING THE ALL DIFFERENT DENSITIES OF YOUR CURRENTLY SELECTED
OPTION.

6.   DENSITY SELECTORS;- THIS IS THE MAIN `PROGRAMMING BLOBK` OF THE JOYSTICK
SYSTEM AND ALLOWS YOU TO CHOOSE WHICH STATES YOU WISH TO BE HIGHLIGHTED ON THE
PLANET MAPS.

LEVEL/DENSITY PROGRAMMING;
AT SOME POINT DURING THE GAME YOU WILL NEED TO SEE HOW THE PLANET IS COPING,THE
WORST HIT AREAS,SAFE AREAS,ECT THE BETTER YOU GET AT THE GAME,THE MORE SPECIFIC
THE AREAS YOU WISH TO SEE WILLBE,AS YOU WILL NEED TO JUGGLE RESOURCES AND MAKE
DECISONS ON THE EFFECT OF LEAVING AN AREA FOR `JUST 3 MORE DAYS`.
HERE YOU HAVE 11 BOXES(A-K ON DIAGRAM);THESE REPRESENT DENSITY/LEVELS OF
CERTAIN THINGS... EXAMPLE;- IF IT IS WIND THEN THEY REPRESENT WIND STRENGTH.
                            IF IT IS LIFE THEN THEY REPRESENT DENSITY OF LIFE
                            TEMPERATURE IS FROM COLD TO HOT.
                            WATER IS FROM NONE TO LOADS.(SEE FIG 10)

HOW THE DENSITY SYSTEM OPERATES;
THE BOXES PROGRESSIVELY GET DARKER IN SHADES OF GREY(ALTHOUGH WHEN VIEWED ON
THE MAPS THE DENSITIES WILL BE IN REDS,BUT CAN BE CHANGED WITH YOUR OWN
SELECTION).STARTING FROM BLACK(WHERE NOTHING OF THAT TYPE EXISTS),THEN
WHITE(VERY LOW DENSITY)RIGHT UP TO DARK GREY(HIGH DENSITY).
THE BLACK BOX(IF SELECTED)SHOWS LEVEL 0(BOX ON FIG 9)IF THIS WAS SELECTED FOR
WATER,YOU WOULD BE SHOWN ALL AREAS THAT HAVE NO WATER.
YOU MAY WANT TO SEE AN AREA THAT HAS ABOUT NORMAL QUANTITY OF WATER,THIS WOULD
BE DONE BY SELECTING THE MIDDLE BOX.
HOWEVER,THIS WOULD ONLY HIGHLIGHT AREAS WITH THIS AMOUNT OF WATER AND NO
OTHERS,ONE,SOME OR ALL BOXES MAY BE SELECTED FOR PROGRAMMING,EG;IF YOU WANTED
TO SEE ALL AREAS WITH `ABOUT NORMAL` WATER THEN SELECTING THE MIDDLE 3 BOXES
WOULD GIVE A WIDER RANGE OF AREAS,AREAS CONTAINING ANY OF THESE 3 DENSITIES
WOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED ON THE PLANET`S MAPS.
WHEN RUNNING PROGRAMS TO HIGHLIGHT DENSITIES,THE PLANET WILL BE DISPLAYED IN
VARYING SHADES OF RED FOR `PRETTYNESS`,THESE SHADES DO NOT REPRESENT
DENSITIES-ONLY AREAS THAT APPEAR WHITE WILL BE REGARDED AS `TRUE`.IE IF BOX A
WAS SELECTED THEN THE PROGRAM RUN,THEN ALL AREAS WITH NO WATER WOULD BE
HIGHLIGHTED IN WHITE.

THE UNIVERSALVIEW-ICON V
IT IS ONLY WHEN THE UNIVERSAL OPTION IS SELECTED THAT THE COLOURS OF THE MAP
REPRESENT THE DIFFERENT DENSITIES OF THE AREA(SEE ALSO MAPPING).
THE PURPOSE OF THIS ICON IS TO SEE`AT A GLANCE`THE STATE OF THE PLANET,AND IT
IS POSSIBLE TO PICK OUT CLUSTERS OF HIGH AND LOW DENSITIES,WHICH FROM THERE
COULD BE INDIVIDUALLY EXTRACTED BY CAREFUL PROGRAMMING.

FOR EXAMPLE;IF A UNIVERSAL VIEW WERE SELECTED FOR TEMPERATURE THEN THE
RESULTING PICTURE WOULD IN EFFECT,BE THERMAL IMAGE OF THE PLANET,WHERE THE
DARKER COLOURS ARE HOTTER THAN THE LIGHTER COLOURS,AND EXTREMELY COLD
TEMPERATURES WOULD BE BLACK(IE,NON-EXISTANT TEMPERATURE).
THE UNIVERSALVIEW SHOWS ONLY THE DENSITIES OF THE SUBJECT YOU ARE CURRENTLY
PROGRAMMING,NOTHING ELSE.

NOW YOU MAY WISH TO SEE AREAS THAT HAVE WATER BELOW A NORMAL,OR SAFE LEVEL,THIS
COULD  EASILY BE DONE BY SELECTING THE FIRST 5 ICONS,WHAT YOU ARE LITERALLY
SAYING IS SHOW ME 0 WATER AS WELL AS LEVEL 1 AS WELL AS LEVEL 2...ECT.

LOCAL COMPARRISONS;
ICONS 2-3 AND 4 ALLOW YOU TO RELATE THE CURRENT SUBJECT YOU ARE EDITING WITH
OTHER SUBJECTS,EG;WATER WITH TEMPERATURES..CT
ALSO;
IF THIS SELECTED IT WILL SHOW YOU THE CURRENT SUBJECTS DENSITIESTHAT WERE
SELECTED AND ALSO SUBJECTS DENSITIES THAT HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED.
EXAMPLE;- IF YOU WISH TO SEE ALL THE PLACES WHERE LOW WATER EXISTS AS WELL AS
SEEING ALL THE PLACES.
          HIGH TEMPERATURE EXIST THEN YOU WOULD SELECT THE APPROPIATE DENSITY
LEVEL FOR EACH...EG FIRST 3 BOXES FOR WATER AND LAST 3 BOXES FOR
TEMEPERATURE,AND THEN SELECT `ALSO` FOR EACH ONE.

NOT;
TO SEE WHERE CHOSEN LEVELS EXIST

TAKING OUR LAST EXAMPLE,BUT SAY WE WANT TO SEE WHERE LOW WATER EXISTS,AS WELL
AS SEEING WHERE HIGH TEMPERATURE DOES NOT EXIST,CLICK WATER TO `ALSO` AND CLICK
TEMPERATURE TO `NOT`(LEAVE THE PRE-PROGRAMMED DENSITY LEVELS AS THEY WERE IN
THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE)

AND;
TO SEE WHERE CHOSEN LEVELS EXIST,ONLY WITHIN OTHER SUBJECTS DENSITY LEVELS.

USE OUR EXAMPLE ONCE AGAIN,THIS TIME WE WANT TO SEE THE PLACES WHERE HIGH
TEMPERATURE AND LOW WATER EXIST IN THE SAME AREA,NOT IN PLACES WHERE ONE EXISTS
WITHOUT THE OTHER;SO CLICK WATER THEN TEMPERATURE TO `AND` AND BINGO.

IT WILL NOT HIGHLIGHT THE AREA IF ONLY HIGH TEMERATURE EXISTS(BUT `ALSO` ICON
WOULD).
AND/ASLO AND NOT CAN BE USED TOGETHER TO REALLY NARROW DOWN AREAS.FOE
EXAMPLE(USING OUR PREVIOUS EXAMPLE AGAIN,BUT THIS TIME ADDING HIGH WINDS).

WE WANT TO SEE PLACES WITH LOW WATER AND `ALSO` HIGH TEMPERATURE BUT ONLY WANT
TO SEE THESE AREAS IF THE HIGH WIND EXISTS IN THEM,OTHERWISE NOT INTERESTED.SO
CLICK THE LEVELS WE NEED AND THEN YOU WOULD SELECT `ALSO` FOR BOTH TEMPERATURE
AND WATER,THEN `AND` FOR WIND.
SIMILARLY IF WE WANTED TO SEE HIGH WIND BUT ONLY LOW WATER AND HIGH TEMPERATURE
EXISTED THEN `AND` WOULD BE SELECTED FOR WATER AND TEMPERATURE`ALSO` FOR WIND.
(SEE FIGURES 11.12.13.14.15)

MAPPING;
FIGURE 16 SHOWS THE MAPPING MENU;

1.   THIS IS THE TITLE OF THE THING YOU ARE ABOUT TO MAP.
2.   THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU CAN MAP IT AGAINST.
3.   THESE ARE THE LOGICAL OPERATIONS YOU WISH TO PERFORM,SIMILAR TO THOSE IN
     THE DENSITY PROGRAM.
4.   HERE YOU MAY CHOOSE WHICH COLOUR YOUR MAPPING WILL APPEAR IN,TO SEE THIS
     SET OF COLOURS`SELF`MUST BE SELECTED ON THE COLOUR OPTION MENU,OTHERWISE
     YOU WILL BE SADDLED WITH ONE OF THE PRESETS(FLOYD ECT)

MAPPING DOES NOT REALLY ALLOW YOU TO DO ANYTHING MORE THAN A SIMPLE DENSITY
PROGRAMMING DOES,HOWEVER IT DOES LET YOU SEE THINGS `ALL AT ONCE`WITHOUT OTHER
WISEHAVING TO RUN TOO MANY JOYSTICK PROGRAMS.IT IS THEREFORE TIME SAVING,ITS
ALSO VERY USEFUL.
IT HAS FOUR POSSIBLE `LOCAL`LOGICAL OPERATIONS BETWEEN TWO SPECIFIC THINGS
EG;OZONE AND CLOUD,SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE OZONE(TO A CERTAIN LEVEL)AND CLOUD(TO A
CERTAIN LEVEL)EXIST.MAPPING IS HIGHLIGHTED IN VARYING COLOURS(DEPENDING ON
THOSE CHOSEN)ON THE PLANET MAP.BUT DONT WORRY A `KEY` ON THE SIDE OF THE
SCREENIS GIVEN TO WHICH MAPPING IS WHAT COLOUR TO HELP YOU DISTIINGUISH WHICH
COLOURS REFER TO WHICH MAPPING.
WHEN MAPPING IS CHOSEN,ONLY MAPPING AND JOYSTICK `TRUES` WILL BE DISPLAYED,THE
PLANET(IN ALL ITS SHADED RED GLORY)WILL NOT BE SHOWN,BLUE WILL BE DISPLAYED IN
AREAS WHICH EVALUATE AS `FALSE`.
HERE IS A RE-RUN OF THE OPERATIONS AVAILABL WITH DESCRIPTION.

BOTH;
THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE `AND `ICON ON JOYSTICK LEVEL PROGRAMMING LEVEL AND WILL
SHOW YOU WHERE THE TWO ITEMS YOU ARE MAPPING BOTH EXIST IN THE SAME PLACE
TOGETHER.

EITHER;
AGAIN SIMILAR TO `ALSO` THIS WILL DISPLAY WHERE YOUR TWO ITEMS EXIST,WETHER
THEY ARE IN THE SAME AREA OR NOT.

ONLY;
THIS IS UNIQUE TO MAPPING,THE RESULT DISPLAYED WILL BE WHERE THE TWO ITEMS
EXIST SEPERATELY-THAT IS,IT WILL NOT DISPLAY AREA WHERE THE TWO ITEM,S EXIST IN
THE SAME PLACE,BUT ONLY WHERE ONE OR THE OTHER IS PRESENT EXCLUSIVELY.

MORE;
AGAIN A UNIQUE TO MAPPING,BUT ABSOULTELY NO DENSITY PROGRAMMING IS NECESSARY,IT
IS SIMPLY SHOWS AREAS WHERE MORE OF ONE THING ESXISTS THAN ANOTHER(EG;WHERE
ANIMAL LIFE IS OF A GREATER DENSITY THAN PLANT LIFE.)
(SEE FIGURES 17.18.19.AND 20)

COLOUR CHOOSING;
COLOURS MAY BE CHOSEN SIMPLY BY SELECTING THE RGB(RED,GREEN,BLUE)VALUES FOR A
PARTICULAR COLOUR,THIS MAY SEEM LIKE AN INSIGNIFICANT COMMAND BUT IT HAS THE
`CHAOTIC BUTTERFLY`EFFECT ON THE ENTIRE GAME,THE PLANT BECOMES AS WE WOULD SEE
OUR EARTH JUST BY CAREFUL SELECTION OF THE RIGHT MAPPING
COLOURS(CLOUDS-WHITE..GRASS-GREEN...OCEANS-BLUE..SKY-PINK!)

HOW DENSITY PROGRAMS EFFECTS MAPPING;
ALL BUT ONETHE MAPPING OPERATIONS NEED BE PROGRAMMED WITH DENSITIES,`MORE` IS
THE EXCEPTION,SIMPLY BECAUSE IT JUST LOOKS FOR PLACES WITH MORE OF ONE THING
THAN ANOTHER.

EXAMPLE;- IF YOU WISH TO SEE WHERE PLANTS GROW AND ANIMALS EXIST YOU MUST ALSO
TELL THE PROGRAM,WHICH DENSITIES TO LOOK FOR(EG;LOW ANIMALS AND HIGH
PLANTS)THIS IS DONE BY CLICKING THE DENSITY BOXES AS DESCRIBED IN LEVEL DENSITY
PROGRAMMING.
IF THE DENSITY BOXES ARE ONLY TO BE USED FOR MAPPING-YOU DONT WANT THEN
HIGH-LIGHTED BY THE DENSITY PROGRAM-THEN THE SELECTOR SHOULD BE SET TO THE
CROSS(IE..DONT INCLUDE THIS IN THE DENSITY PROCESSING)THE SAME GOES FOR THE
DENSITY LOGICAL OPERATIONS,SINCE MAPPING TAKES CARE OF WANT OPERATIONS SHOULD
BE PERFORMED,THESE SHOULD BE IGNORED.

POLLUTION MAPPING EXAMPLES;
HERE YOU ARE ABLE TO `MAP` DIFFERENT TYPES OF POLLUTION TO OTHER FACTORS THAT
EXIST WITHIN OUR WORLD.

EXAMPLE;- YOU MAY WISH TO KNOW THE PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE THERE IS A
DROUGHT(PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY)TO A DECREASE IN OZONE(SUCH A PROBLEM WOULD BE NEAR
IMPOSSIBLE TO RECTIFY,SO IT WOULD BE ADVISEABLE TO KEEP PEOPLE AWAY FROM THESE
AREAS)

IN ORDER TO SEE SUCH AN AREA THE OZONE MAPPING ICON THEM TEMPERATURE,THEN THE
`BOTH` ICONS.WHAT YOU HAVE EFFECTIVELY PROGRAMMED IS`PLEASE SHOW ME WHERE CLOUD
AND TEMPERATURE EXIST`HOWEVER THIS AN EXTREMELY AMBIGUOUS STATEMENT,AND WE WANT
TO SEE SPECIFIC VALUES OF TEMPERATURE AND OZONE.

SO RETURN TO THE MAIN JOYSTICK MENU AND SELECT `LEVEL PROGRAMMING`(ICON V)NOW
SELECT TEMPERATURE AND CLICK,SAY 3 HOTTEST VALUES,NOW SELECT OZONE AND CLICK 3
LOWEST DENSITIES.
NB; NEITHER THE EXCLUDE OPTION NOR THE LOGICAL RELATION HAVE AN EFFECT ON
MAPPING,WHATEVER THEIR VALUES ARE,THEY ARE IGNORED(SEE JOYSTICK-EXPERT USE FOR
MORE INFORMATION)SO YOU NEED NOT PRESS THEM.

NOW YOU HAVE PROGRAMMED... SHOW ME WHERE OZONE AND TEMPERATURE EXIST ACCORDING
TO THE LEVELS I HAVE SELECTED WHICH ARE;THE THREE HOTTEST TEMPERATURES AND THE
THREE DENSITIES OF OZONE-WOW!..WHAT A PROGRAMMER!!!
YOUR DENSITY PROGRAM SHOULD LOOK LIKE(FIGURE 21)YOUR MAPPING PROGRAM SHOULD
LOOK LIKE (FIGURE 22)

JOYSTICK PROGRAMMING---EXPERT USE;

PARAMETER MANAGEMENT;

1.   GLOBAL/LOCAL VIEW SELECTOR
     IF HIGHLIGHTED,THEN THE GLOBAL VIEW IS DISPLAYED OTHERWISE THE LOCAL VIEW
     IS SHOWN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE OPTIONS CHOSEN IN THE VIEWING MODE
     SELECTOR.

2.   DISABLE/ENABLE DENSITY PROGRAMMING;
     IF HIGHLIGHTED,NONE OF THE DENSITY PROGRAMMING WILL BE EXECUTED,REGARDLESS
     OF THE WETHER THE LEVEL DENSITY ENABLE/DISABLE SELECTOR IS ACTIVE,MAPPING
     WILL BE COMPLETELY UNAFFECTED BY THIS.

3.   DISABLE/ENABLE MAPPING EXECUTION;
     IF SELECTED THEN NO MAPPING EXECUTION WILL TAKE PLACE.SIMILAR TO ABOVE.
     INDIVIDUAL MAPS MAY BE DISABLED BY JUST CLICKING THE MAPPING HEADER SO
     THAT IT IS NOT HIGHLIGHTED.(EG;ON OZONE MAPPING MENU,CLICK `OZONE`SO IT
     IS NOT HIGHLIGHTED)

4.   ORDER OF EXECUTION;
     THIS ALLOWS YOU TO CHOOSE WHICH ORDER YOU WISH THE PROGRAM TO RUN,IF
     HIGHLIGHTED NORMAL DENSITIES WILL BE EXECUTED AFTER MAPPING,AND NOT BEFORE
     AS DEFAULT.ONE OF THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS ICON IS SO THAT SOMETHING
     EVALUATED TRUE BY DENSITY PROGRAMMING WILL NOT BE `OVERWRITTEN` BY
     SOMETHING EVALUATED TRUE BY MAPPING(AS COULD NORMALLY HAPPEN).

5.   DENSITY PROTECTION;
     IF HIGHLIGHTED BEFORE EXECUTION OF YOUR PROGRAM SOMETHING WAS EVALUATED
     TRUE BY DENSITY PROGRAMMING,IT WILL NOT THEN BE OVERWRITTEN BY ANYTHING
     ELSE EVALUATED AS BEING TRUE.(EG; MAPPING)

6.   MAPPING PROTECTION;
     IF A FORM OF MAPPING WAS EVALUATED TRUE BEFOREHAND,IT WILL NOT BE OVER-
     WRITTEN DURING EXECUTION BY OTHER MAPPING TRUTHS,OR DENSITY PROGRAMMING
     IF THE ORDER OF EXECUTION HAS BEEN REVERSED.

NB; OVER-WRITING WILL OCCUR UNLESS THIS IS SET,THIS IS DUE TO THE WAY MAPPING
EXECUTED.

THE ORDER OF MAPPING EXECUTION IS;

1.   OZONE MAPPING
2.   VAPOUR POLLUTION MAPPING
3.   LIQUID POLLUTION MAPPING
4.   NUCLEAR POLLUTION MAPPING
5.   EARTH POLLUTION MAPPING
6.   WIND MAPPING
7.   CLOUD MAPPING
8.   TEMPERATURE MAPPING
9.   RAIN MAPPING
10.  ANIMAL LIFE MAPPING
11.  PLANT LIFE MAPPING
12.  HUMAN LIFE MAPPING
13.  WATER MAPPING

SO IF SAY,LIQUID POLLUTION IS EVALUATED TRUE FOR A PARTICULAR SQUARE,THEN LATER
ON IN EXECUTION,RAIN MAPPING IS EVALUATED TRUE FOR THE SAME SQUARE,THE NORMALLY
A `RAIN` TRUTH WILL OVER-WRITE THE PREVIOUS LIQUID POLLUTION TRUTH.

PREVIOUS VALUE CO-ORDINATORS;
IT IS POSSIBLE TO ALLOW SEQUENCES TO BE EVALUATED IN ORDER TO CREATE HIGHLY
COMPLEX OPERATIONS ON SINGLE AREAS.

FIRST LETS LOOK AT THE DENSITY-CO-ORDINATOR SET;

TRUE;
IF SELECTED THEN ANYTHING THAT IS EVALUATED AS TRUE FOR A PARTICULAR SQUARE
WILL `ONLY` BE TRUE IF THE DENSITY PROGRAMMING FOR THIS SQUARE WAS ALSO TRUE.

UNTRUE;
SIMILAR,BUT FOR ANY MAPPING TO EVALUATE TRUE,DENSITY PROGRAMMING FOR THAT
SQUARE MUST HAVE BEEN EVALUATED AS FALSE.

IGNORE;
NO MATTER WHAT TRUTH PROGRAMMING IS EVALUATED THIS SQUARE,IF THE MAPPING
EVALUATES AS TRUE,THEN IT WILL BE.

NOW FOR MAPPING CO-ORDINATION;
THIS WORKS IN SYNC WITH EXECUTION ORDER,IF THE EXECUTION IS TO BE DENSITY THEN
MAPPING,THEN THIS TABLE WILL APPLY TO ONLY MAPPING EVALUATIONS.HOWEVER,IF THE
ORDER IS MAPPING THEN DENSITY,IT WILL ALSO APPLY TO DENSITY PROGRAMMING,LETS
EXPLAIN THIS INDIVIDUALLY.

TRUE;
A MAPPING EVALUATION WILL ONLY BE TRUE IF A PREVIOUS MAPPING EVALUATION FOR
THAT SQUARE WAS ALSO TRUE. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO DENSITY EVALUATIONS IF THE RUN
ORDER IS MAPPING THEN DENSITY. (IE;THIS SQUARE IS ONLY TRUE IF A PREVIOUS
MAPPING WAS TRUE)

UNTRU/IGNORE;
THESE FLOOW THE SAME RULES AS ABOVE,AND ARE SIMILAR IN OPERATION TO THE DENSITY
CO-ORDINATOR.
SEE FIGURES...25.1/-/25.2/-/25.3/-/25.4/-/25.5/-/25.6/-/26.1/-/26.2/-/26.3/-/

COMBINING TECHNIQUES;
SO WHY DO WE REALLY NEED MAPPING?
THIS IS REALLY EXPLAINED WHEN WE USE IT TOGETHER WITH THE JOYSTICK PROGRAMMING
SET.(FIG 9)

YOU MAY REMEMBER WE HAD ICON III.THE SELECTOR ON THE PROGRAMMING PANEL OF
JOYSTICK.LETS EXPLAIN THE USES;

IF YOU WANT TO SET UP DENSITY LEVELS FOR ALL JOYSTICK SELECTIONS BEFORE HAND
AND RUN PROGRAMS THAT USE SOME(BUT NOT ALL) OF THE SUBJECTS,THEN PRESSING THIS
ICON WILL ALLOW IT TO BE EXCLUDED FROM EXECUTION.

EXAMPLE;
SAY YOU WANT TO FIRST SEE ALL HIGH TEMPERATURES,THEN ALL HIGH TEMPERATURE AND
LOW WATER,THEN THE APPROPIATE DENSITY BOXES CAN BE CLICKED,THE FIRST TIME
THROUGH WITH WATER DESELECTED THEN WITH WATER SELECTED(THIS SAVES HAVING TO
ZERO OUT ALL WATER DENSITIES THE FIRST TIME ROUND).

HOWEVER,THE DE-SELECTOR DOES NOT DISABLE MAPPING,SO IF YOU HAD SOME FORM OF
MAPPING SELECTED THE FIRST TIME(WHEN WATER WAS NOT SELECTED)THEN DISPLAYED IN
EITHER A CHOSEN COLOUR OR A SHADE OF ONE OF THE DEFAULT COLOURS;WILL BE THE
MAPPING.THIS NEGATES THE NEED TO USE `AND` FOR DENSITY PROGRAMMING AS MAPPING
WILL DO THIS AND THUS ALLOW FULLER USE OF THE OTHER LOGICAL OPERATORS.

AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE MAPPING AND DENSITIES COULD BE USED TOGETHER IN (SEE
FIGURES 27.1 AND 27.2)

...............................END OF TUTORIAL..............................

PLAYING GOD;
YOU ARE `NO GOD`IN THIS SIMULATION,ON THE CONTRARY,EVERTHYTNING THAT CAN BE
ACHIEVED USING THIS SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE TO US IN THE REAL WORLD TODAY,IT IS
JUST REGARDED AS GODS JOB NOT OURS,YOU CAN`T CREATE FLOODS,WHIRLWINDS OR
INSTANTLY CREATE LIFE IN A DESERT,THAT IS FANTAY,THIS IS REALITY(IN TYME).THE
WORLD IS RELYING ON ONE INDIVIDUALS EFFORTS TO PREVENT THE PLANET FROM BECOMING
A CHEMICAL KNIGHTMARE,AND HIS IS AN ACHIEVABLE OBJECTIVE...ITS ALL UP TO YOU!

PLAYING GOD AND PROGRAMMING;
NOW WE GET TO THE PURPOSE OF ALL THAT PROGRAMMING.TO WHAT EXTENT YOU WISH TO
DEVOLP YOUR PROGRAMMING SKILLS IS ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.HOWEVER THE MORE COMPETENT
YOU BECOME THE QUICKER YOU WILL BE ABLE TO `ZERO` IN ON NEEDY AREAS.

THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE HAS BEEN DESIGNED SO,EVEN WITH THE SIMPLEST OF
PROGRAMS,YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXTRACT USEFUL INFO FROM THE PLANETS CURRENT
STATE. PLAYING GOD IS USED IN ORDER TO WORK TOWARDS GAME COMPLETION.

HOW TO USE THE GOD JOB SYSTEM;
THE SYSTEM ITSELF COULD BE REGARDED AS A SORT OF `WAR GAME` WHERE YOU ARE
LOOKING AT THE BATTLE FIELD,DECIDE WHICH ARE THE BEST PLACES TO ATTACK AND
DEFEND,AND JUGGLE YOUR MEN AND RESOURCES IN ORDER TO GET MAXIMUM EFFECIENCY
FROM THEM.

WELL,IF WE MAKE A FEW ANALOGIES;
 
THE BATTLEFIELD IS OUR WORLD

YOUR ARMY IS LIFE ITSELF (EG;MAN,PLANTS AND ANIMALS)

YOUR RESOURCES ARE YOUR PROGRAMMING SKILLS AND TYME & REALITY

YOUR WEAPONS ARE CHEMICALS TO FIGHT OFF FAMINE,DROUGHT OR TO MAKE FERTILISERS

YOUR ENEMY IS REALITY

THIS SHOULD MAKE IT SIMPLER WHEN YOU ACTUALLY START TO PLAN STRATEGIES,AND
GOALS TO ACHIEVE.

WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DO;

(FIGURE 30 SHOWS THE `PLAY GOD` MAIN MENU SYSTEM)

1. PLACING CHEMICALS ABOUT THE PLANET OR TAKING THEM OUT.
2. DISTRIBUTING ANIMALS ABOUT THE PLANET
3. TAKING AND PLACING PLANTS
4. DISTRIBUTING PEOPLE.

(SEE FIGURES 31.1...31.2...31.3...FOR OTHER SUB MENU`S

WHERE ARE WE PLAYING GOD?;

YOU MAY BE WANDERING WHAT SORT OF AREA PLAYING GOD COVERS,AND WHERE THE
CHEMICALS/PLANTS YOU ARE PLACING ARE ACTUALLY GOING IN THE PLANET.

PLAYING GOD WILL TAKE PLACE IN YOUR CURRENTLY SELECTED SQUARE.(IE;THE SQUARE
YOU HAVE SELECTED WITH THE `ZOOM` OPTION),TO CHOOSE ANOTHER SQUARE,JUST USE
`ZOOM`OPTION AGAIN.(SEE FIGIURE 32)

PLAYING GOD;

SIMPLYPLACE CHEMICALS,PLANTS,ECT..WHERE YOU THINK THEY ARE BEST NEEDED(YOU FIND
THAT OUT BY PROGRAMMING).IF YOU THINK A CERTAIN AREA HAS TOO MANY PLANTS THAN
IS REALLY NECESSARY,THEN SIMPLY TAKE SOME OUT FOR REPLANTING SOMEWHERE IN
GREATER NEED(FOR EXAMPLE AT THE EDGE OF THE DESERT).

THERE ARE A COUPLE OF RULES;

THE CHEMICALS YOU PLACE IN A PLANET WILL PROBABLY HAVE `GONE` AFTER A THREE DAY
SCAN,IE;THEY HAVE STARTED A CHAIN REACTION,OR A `KNOCK-ON-EFFECT` AND HAVE THUS
NOW BEEN USED UP,HOWEVER,NOT ALL CHEMICALS MAY BE USED IN JUST ONE SCAN,AS
CIRCUMSTANCES MAY VARY.

CHEMICALS;(SEE FIGURE 31.2)

1. YOUR CHEMICAL INVENTORY,WHAT CHEMICALS YOU CURRENTLY HAVE,ALTHOUGH SOME OF
THESE MAY ALREADY HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE PLANET.

2. UP/DOWN SELECTORS,FOR SEEING OTHER CHEMICALS IN YOUR INVENTORY(A FURTHER
   DESCRIPTION OF THIS IS GIVEN IN FUSION).
3. PLACE A CHOSEN CHEMICAL IN THE PLANET.
4. TAKE IT OUT OF THE PLANET
5. INFORMATION WINDOW.
6. CURRENT CHEMICAL IS SELECTED.

PLACING A CHEMICAL IN THE PLANET;

FIRST OF ALL YOU MUST SELECT WHICH OF YOUR CHEMICALS YOU WISH TO PLACE IN THE
PLANET.THIS IS DONE BY CLICKING THE APPROPRIATE CHEMICAL IN THE INVENTORY
WINDOW WITH THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.(ONCE SELECTED IT SHOULD APPEAR IN THE
WINDOW(6) ON THE MENU. YOU SHOULD THEN BE GIVEN INFO ON WHERE IT CURRENTLY IS
(IE;IN YOUR INVENTORY,IN THE PLANET(AT THIS CO-ORDINATE)OR IN THE PLANET AT
ANOTHER CO-ORDINATE.

NOW,IF THE CHEMICAL IS IN YOUR INVENTORY THEN IT CAN BE PLACED IN THE PLANET
IMMEDIATELY.IF HOWEVER,IT IS IN ANOTHER PLACE YOU MUST GO THERE AND TAKE IT
OUT(SO YOU CAN USE IT HERE).

SO ONCE YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR INVENTORY,JUST CLICK ON ICON (3)ONCE YOU HAVE
PLACED IT IN,YOU COULD NOW TAKE IT OUT AGAIN BY PRESSING ICON (4).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TAKING A CHEMICAL OUT OF A PLANET;

THIS ACHIEVED IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY AS PLACING CHEMICALS,EXCEPT TO TAKE OUT
CHEMICALS,THEY MUST BE IN THE SAME SQUARE YOU ARE CURRENTLY PLAYING `GOD`WITH.

JUST SELECT WHICH CHEMICAL(FROM THE INVENTORY WINDOW)YOU WISH TO TAKE OUT,AND
IF IT THIS SQUARE PRESS ICON (4)(TAKE IT OUT OF PLANET ICON)

MAN:
MAN WORKS IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY TO CHEMICAL,AND IS MORE LIKE ANIMALS AND
PLANTS(BUT NOT EXACTLY)
AS WITH ALL LIFE(OR INDEED ANYTHING) WITHIN OUR PLANET,MAN HAS GROWTH
DENSITIES,AND DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HAVE TAKEN OUT OF THE CITY WILL
AFFECT TO WHAT DENSITY YOU MAY PUT IN THE PLANET.

MAN IS NOT PLACED IN THE PLANET AS A PARTICULAR NUMBER(EG;PUT 23 MEN HERE
PLEASE) BUT AS A DENSITY GROWTH THERE: EG PLACE MAN UP TO LEVEL DENSITY 5(ABOUT
THE SIZE OF A SMALLISH COMMUNITY)

REMEMBER,PEOPLE GROW(LIKE ANT FORMS OF LIFE)SO THERE IS NO NEED TO PLACE TOO
MUCH OF ANYTHING IN AN AREA(IN FACT DOING SO COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT).

1. YOUR CURRENT QUANTITY OF MEN IN LEVEL DENSITIES IS GIVEN HERE,IT MAY BE
   HIGHER THAN 10,BUT 10 IS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT ANY SQUARE IS ALLOWED TO CONTAIN

2. PLACE IN PLANET ICON.

3. TAKE OUT PF PLANET ICON.

4. WHAT DENSITY OF MAN IS CURRENTLY IN PLANET AT YOUR CO-ORDINATES.

PLACING MAN INTO THE PLANET: (SEE FIGURE 31.1)

QUITE SIMPLE,TO PLACE A MAN AT A DENSITY OF 1 IN YOUR CURRENT SQUARE,PRESS ICON
(2)(PLACE IN PLANET ICON)ONCE,TO PLACE A DENSITY OF THREE PRESS IT 3 TIMES AND
SO ON....

TAKING A MAN OUT OF THE PLANET;

AGAIN UNDER THE SAME PRINCIPLES: PRESS ICON (3) FOR THE NUMBER OF DENSITIES YOU
WISH TO TAKE OUT OF THE PLANET.REMEMBER YOU CAN`T TAKE OUT MAN,WHERE HE DOES
NOT EXIST.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLANTS AND ANIMALS; (SEE FIGURE 31.3)

AS THESE TWO OPTIONS ARE BASICALLY THE SAME BUT WITH DIFFERENT ICONS,A
DESCRIPTION OF ONLY`GOD AND ANIMALS` IS GIVEN,BUT THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLY TO
PLANTS.

1. SUB GROUP OF ANIMALS (A-D).
2. PLACE IN PLANET.
3. TAKE OUT OF PLANET.
4. NUMBER OF DENSITY LEVELS FOR THE CURRENT SUB TYPE YOU HAVE.
5. NUMBER OF DENSITY LEVELS FOR CURRENT TYPE,THAT IS IN THE PLANET AT THE
   MOMENT(AT THIS CO-ORDINATE)

ANIMAL SUB-GROUPS;
THIS IS NEWS TO YOU,I BET.BUT ON DENSITY PROGRAMMING THERE WAS ONLY ONE GROUP?


WELL ANIMALS ON DENSITY PROGRAMS ARE TAKEN AS A WHOLE,BECAUSE A TRUE STABLE
AREA WOULD HAVE ALL GROUPS OF ANIMALS,NOT JUST ONE(BECAUSE OF THE FOOD
CHAINS),SO REALLY ANIMAL DENSITY IS AN AVERAGE OF FOUR SUB-TYPES FOR A
PARTICULAR SQUARE.

THE TYPES ARE FAIRLY UN-SPECIFIC,AND ONLY RELATE TO SIZE.GROUP ONE WOULD BE
SMALLISH ANIMALS(RODENTS ECT..)AND GROUP 4 ARE FAIRLY LARGISH(RHINO`S,EFFERSING
ELEPHANTS AND MR SNUFFLEEUFAGUS)[SNUFFLEEUFAGI?]

PLACING ANIMALS INTO THE PLANET;

FIRSTLY AN ANIMAL SUB TYPE MUST BE SELECTED,IE;WHAT SORT OF ANIMAL YOU WANT
PLACED ON THE PLANET?
TO SELECT A FAIRLY LARGE LARGE TYPE OF ANIMAL,CLICK ICON(C)--IN THE ICON(1)
SET;AND YOU WILL THEN BE SHOWN WHAT LEVEL THAT ANIMAL CURRENTLY EXISTS IN YOUR
SQUARE.THIS WILL RANGE FROM 0 TO A MAXIMUM OF 10(IF IT IS 10 THEN NO MORE
ANIMALS MAY BE PLACED HERE).YOU WILL ALSO BE GIVEN INFO ON HOW MANY DENSITY
LEVELS OF THIS SUB-TYPE YOU HAVE.IF YOU ARE HAPPY ABOUT PLACING THIS CREATURE
HERE,THEN PLACE THE `IN PLANET ICON(2) AS MANY TIMES A DENSITY REQUIRED(IE;AS
BEFORE TWICE FOR DENSITY LEVEL 2..ECT)

TAKING ANIMALS OUT OF THE PLANET;

SAME AGAIN,FIRST SELECT YOUR SUB GROUP,THUS,GIVING YOU INFO ON HOW MUCH IS
CURRENTLY THERE;THEN PRESS `TAKE OUT OF PLANET` ICON(3) FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES
CORRESPONDING TO THE NUMBER OF DENSITIES.

EXTRA NOTES FOR PLANTS;

THE ONLY REAL CHANGE FOR PLANTS IS THERE ARE SUB-GROUPS.THIS,LIKE THAT FOR
ANIMALS,DESCRIBES THE SIZE OF PLANT IN VARYING DEGREES,SUB TYPE 1 WOULD BE
SMALLISH,PROBABLY RANGING UP TO THE ODD SHRUB,AND TYPE 4 WOULD BE THINGS LIKE
TREES.
THESE APPEAR IN DENSITY PROGRAMMING,THE SAME WAY ANIMALS DO,IE;PLANT LIFE
INDENSITY PROGRAMMING IS THE AVERAGE OF THESE 4 GROUPS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES ON PLAYING GOD;

REMEMBER THAT THE SEQUENCES OF WHAT WE DO COULD HAVE NEAR GLOBAL EFFECTS,ITS
BEST TO COVER A WIDER RANGE `DISPERSED` OVER THE PLANET RATHER THAN
CONCENTRATING ON ONE PARTICULAR AREA.

FOR INSTANCE,IF WE PLACE FERTILISER IN ONE SQUARE,PLANTS THERE COULD BLOOM,THUS
THE LIFE-CHAIN TAKES OVER;PLANTS MAY GROW TO ADJACENT SQUARES,FEEDING ANIMALS
THERE,WHICH IN TURN GO TO FEED A SMALL COMMUNITY THAT HAS JUST SET UP IN
ANOTHER ADJACENT AREA (AND SO ON...).

THIS MIMICS REAL LIFE BUT AT THE SAME TIME DOES NOT `TIE` YOU TO USING ALL YOUR
RESOURCES IN A VERY BADLY HIT AREA.

PURELY USING AS MANY CHEMICALS AS POSSIBLE TO RECTIFY A SITUATION COULD HAVE
UNFORSEEN EFFECTS,PERHAPS DISASTROUS,DEPENDING ON THE CHEMICALS USED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE TRADING MENU SYSTEM;

AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO INTERGRATE WITH THE PLANETS ATMOSPHERE AND
ACO-SYSTEM,YOU MAY ALSO INTERACT WITH THE ECONOMICS OF THE PEOPLE ON THE
PLANET,ENABLING YOU TO BUY AND SELL GOODS,RAW MATERIALS AND WEAPONS. TO START
OFF YOU ARE GIVEN A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF MONEY(SEE TYME HOUNDED CONSCIENCE) FOR
NOTES ON OBTAINING MORE.

A DESCRIBTION OF THE MENU IS GIVEN BELOW OF FIGURE 40;

1. ITEM WINDOW
2. UP/DOWN SELECTORS
3. SELECTED ITEM
4. YOUR CURRENT BALANCE
5. THE INVENTORY ICON
6. THE `BUYING` ICON
7. THE `SELLING` ICON
8. THE `LETS MAKE A DEAL` ICON

THE ITEM WINDOW (ICON 1)
THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE FILE MENU`S PROGRAM SELECTOR AND WILL BE DISPLAYINGTHE
ITEMS OF YOUR CURRENT OPTION(EG;IF YOU PRESS THE INVENTORY
ICON,THEN(SURPRISE-SURPRISE).YOUR INVENTORY WILL BE SHOWN HERE). YOU MAY SELCT
AN ITEM BY JUST POINTING THE MOUSE AND CLICKING,THE SELECTION ITEM WILL THEN
APPEAR IN ICON (3)-(SELECTED ITEM)

UP/DOWN SELECTORS (ICON 2)
AGAIN,SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE FILE MENUS UP/DOWN SELECTORS;IF MORE ITEMS EXIST
THAN CAN BE DISPLAYED AT ONCE,USE THESE SELECTORS TO GO UP AND DOWN THE LIST.

CURRENT BALANCE (ICON 4);
THIS WILL BE UPDATED EACH TIME YOU MAKE A DEAL.NO YOU CAN`T HAVE AN
OVERDRAFT,THIS GAME HAS A RESPONSIBLE MONETRAY POLICY.

LETS MAKE A DEAL (ICON 8)
RIGHT,NOW YOU CAN MAKE A DEAL,LETS GO THROUGH THE PROCESS.

IF YOU ARE BUYING;
CLICK ON THE BUYING ICON(6)THEN SELECT THE ITEM YOU WISH TO BUY(ASSUMING YOU
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY),NOW THIS ITEM SHOULD APPEAR IN ICON(3),NOW GO AND PRESS THE
`LETS MAKE A DEAL`(8)ICON AND VOILA,THE ITEM IS NOW IN YOUR INVENTORY,AND YOU
HAVE LESS MONEY(BOO!).

IF YOU ARE SELLING
FIRST CLICK TO THE INVENTORY ICON(5) TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE,NOW GO AND PRESS THE
SELLING(7) ICON (TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THE THINGS TO OFFER)..YOU HAVE? THEN
CLICK THE ITEM SELLING LIST,THEN PRESS `LETS MAKE A DEAL` ICON(8) AND ITS
BTAKEN FROM YOUR INVENTORY AND YOU ARE GIVEN MORE MONEY(HOOORAY!!!). IF YOU
HAVE`NT GOT ANY ITEMS IN THE LIST THEN ITS TOUGH,IS`NT IT?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUSION:
YOU HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH YOUR OWN NUCLEAR PROCESSING PLANT,WHICH IS A VERY
HANDY LITTLE DEVICE.

BASICALLY IT CONSISTS OF A LABORATORY,A FISSION CHAMBER AND A FUSION REACTOR.
THE FUSION MENU IS SHOW IN FIGURE 41 WITH A DESCRIPTION BELOW;

1. LABORATORY.
2. FUSION CHAMBER.
3. FISSION CHAMBER.
4. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS/DESCRIPTION.

BEFORE WE GO INTO EXPLANATIONS ON HOW TO USE FUSION,WE MUST FIRST TAKE A LOOK
AT THE CHEMICAL WORLD OF `DEBUT`.

THE WORLD ACCORDING TO TYME AND REALITY:
PHYSICS IS A PRETTY COMPLEX SUBJECT,SO LETS IGNORE IT,INSTEAD,WE HAVE DECIDED
TO CREATE OUR OWN MUCH SIMPLER LAWS THAT ARE HOPEFULLY A LOT MORE
UNDERSTANDABLE.

FUSION IN `DEBUT` IS PURELY A COSMETIC EXERCISE,BUT THIS IS UNIMPORTANT IN THAT
AS LONG AS IT FOLLOWS A PARTUCLAR SET OF RULES(NO MATTER HOW SIMPLE OR
COMPLEX)IT IS ABLE TO SIMULATE SOME KIND OF REALITY,IN THIS CASE;THE `DEBUT`
PLANET REALITY.

THE FIRST BASIS OF OUR CHEMISTRY IS A PERIODIC TABLE,ADJUSTED FROM THE ONE WE
KNOW,TO ALLOW FOR OUR WORLDS REALITY.

THE FIRST BASIS OF CHEMISTRY IS A PERIODIC TABLE,ADJUSTED FROM THE ONE WE
KNOW,TO ALLOW OUR WORLDS REALITY.

THE PERIODIC TABLE IS JUST A LIS OF ELEMENTS(EG;IRON,HYDROGEN,ECT) EACH IN
THEIR OWN GROUPS.

THE PLANET CHEMICALS;
AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER,THIS ISNT PLANET EARTH,ITS THE `DEBUT`
PLANET,HOWEVER,THERE ARE PARALLELS BETWEEN THE TWO. THE CHEMICAL PEIODIC TABLE
IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS.SOME OF THE CHEMICALS THAT EXIST HERE ON EARTH CAN ALSO
BE FOUND IN THE `DEBUT` PLANET.

THESE INCLUDE FAMILIAR CHEMICALS LIKE CARBON,BORON,HELIUM AND SUCH LIKE.AS WELL
AS THESE CHEMICALS THERE ARE ALSO ONES YOU DEFINATELY WOULDNT FIND AVAILABLE ON
EARTH.SOME OF THESE HAVE BEEN FOUND UNSUITABLE DUE TO THE DANGEROUS AFFECTS
THEY MAY HAVE ON YOU.

BECAUSE OF THIS CLASSIFICATION OF THE PERIODIC TABLE INTO 3 SETS WE HAVE THE
`A` CLASS PERIODIC TABLE WHICH IS INACCESSIBLE TO YOU.AND THE B-CLASS PERIODIC
TABLE WHICH REPRESENTS 50 ELEMENTS YOU ARE PERMITTED TO USE. THERE IS ALSO A
C-TABLE THAT CONTAINS A FEW OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE ABUNDANT ON THE PLANET AND
ARE SO INERT THAT THEY PROVE TO BE OF NO APPRECIABLE USE.

..............THE B-CLASS PERIODIC TABLE.....................................

THIS IS THE PERIODIC TABLE OF ELEMENTS YOU ARE ENTITLED TO USE.EACH GROUP
AFFECTS ONE ASPECT OF THE PLANET IN A PARTICULAR WAY.

GROUP 1 EFFECTS CLOUD LEVELS.
THE CHEMICALS WITHIN THIS GROUP CAN HAVE VARYING GOOD OR BAD EFFECTS ON THE
TRAIT THEY CONCERN.BECAUSE MOST OF THESE CHEMICALS ARE UNIQUE TO THE `DEBUT`
PLANET IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY DO;BY CAREFUL
EXPERIMENTATION.

GROUP (1) - CLOUD                       GROUP (5)- NUCLEAR POLLUTION

6. EARNIUM             ER            6. BABYBIONIUM       BB

HOW DO GROUPS WORK?
AS WE MENTIONED ABOVE,IT IS YOUR JOB TO FIND OUT WHAT EACH OF THE CHEMICALS
ACTUALLY DOES.THE GROUP 1 TO 8 ARE THE PLANET CLASSIFICATIONS FOR B-CLASS
CHEMICALS AND THE 6 CHEMICALS WITHIN EACH OF THESE WILL PROVIDE SOME KIND OF
EFFECT CONNECTED WITH THAT GROUP NAME. LOOK AT (FIG 42) YOU CAN SEE THE GROUPS
ACROSS AND THE ELEMENT NUMBERS GOING DOWN.BY MIXING GROUPS YOU CAN MIX EFFECTS.
TO DO THIS YOU CAN LINK CHEMICALS TOGETHER TO FORM COMPOUNDS. THESE COMPOUNDS
CAN REPRESENT SOMETHING THAT HAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AFFECT THAN USING THE
INDIVIDUAL ELEMENT SEPERATELY.[EG; YOU COULD SOMEHOW COMBINE CHEMICALS FROM
GROUPS 1 AND 2 TO MAKE A COMPOUND THAT COULD EFFECT CLOUDS AND THE OZONE.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMBINING CHANGING AND SPLITTING.
BUT WHY NOT USE THE ELEMENTS SEPERATELY?.WELL YOU WOULD`NT GO AND PICK A
HANDFULL OF COFFEE BEANS AND GET A JUG OF WATER AND THEN EAT THE BEANS AND
DRINK THE WATER,YOU WOULD COMBINE THE 2 IN A SPECIAL WAY TO MAKE AN INTERESTING
DRINK.WITH THE COFFEE THIS WOULD BE DONE USING A GRINDER TO CHANGE THE BEANS TO
POWDER,TO PERCULATE TO INFUSE THE GROUND COFFEE WITH WATER,WHILST ADDING A BIT
OF HEAT TO COMBINE THEM IN A FLAVOUR WAY.IN YOUR LABORATORY THE GRINDER IS THE
RADIATION CHAMBER AND THE PERCOLATER IS THE FUSION CHAMBER.

TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY-RADIATION CHANGES SOMETHING(OR A GROUP OF THINGS)AND
FUSION MAKES GROUP THINGS(COMPOUNDS) FROM SMALLER THINGS(ELEMENTS).ANOTHER
THING YOU MIGHT TO DO IS SPLIT COMPUNDS INTO ELEMENTS(WITH RELATION TO COFFEE
THIS WOULD PROBABL;Y BE A RATHER SILLY THING TO DO).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RADIATION AND ITS TYPES.
YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW THAT RADIATION CHANGES ONE CHEMICAL(OR COMPUND) INTO
ANOTHER.IT DOES THIS BY SHIFTING IT TO A NEW POSITION ON THE PERIODIC
TABLE.LOOKING AT (FIG 42) YOU CAN SEE THE CHEMICAL `ORBION)(OT) IN THE GROUP
6.BY USING THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF RADIATION AVAILABLE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO
ALTER THE NUMBER OF PROTONS AND NEUTRONS IN A CHEMICAL TO CHANGE ITS
CHARACTERISTICS;BY DOING THIS WE ARE EFFECTIVELY CREATING A NEW CHEMICAL!.ON
EARTH THIS TYPE OF PROCESS IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND IS VERY INEFFICIENT
AND THE REURNS FRON SUCH OPERATIONS ARE VERY POOR,IN YOUR LAB,HOWEVER,IT IS
POSSIBLE TO MAKE EFFECTIVE RADIATIONS TO ONE CHEMICAL AND THUS CHANGE IT INTO
ANOTHER WITHOUT LOSING GREAT QUANTITIES OF IT. THERE ARE THREE MAIN TYPES OF
RADIATION,`ALPHA`..`BETA`..`GAMMA`. THESE ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.

ALPHA RADIATION;
ALPHA RADIATION.OR ALPHA RAYS ARE ACTUALLY HELIUM ATOMS THAT HAVE LOST THEIR 2
ORBITAL ELECTRONS,NORMALLY ALPHA RAYS ONLY TRAVEL A FEW CENTIMETRES AND ARE NOT
VERY POWERFUL ,BUT IN OUR LAB A FORM OF RADIATION AMPLIFICATION HAS BEEN
DEVOLPED WHICH `BOOSTS` THE ALPHA RADIATION ENOUGH FOR IT TO PENETRATE THE
CHEMICAL PLACED IN THE RADIATION CHAMBER.RADIATING A CHEMICAL WITH `ALPHA RAYS`
WILL CAUSE IT TO MOVE DOWN ONE IN GROUP 6 TO CHANGE IT INTO CALCIUM WHICH
MAY,OR MAY NOT BE A MORE USEFUL CHEMICAL TO US,DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR AIM
IS.WITH A COMPUND THIS WILL EFFECT ALL ELEMENTS IN THE COMPOUND THUS CHANGING
IT INTO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COMPOUND ALTOGETHER.

BETA RADIATION;
THE PICTURE ON YOUR TELEVISION SET IS CREATED BY CATHODE RAYS THAT MAKE THE
PHOSPHOR GLOW ENOUGH FOR YOU TO VISUALISE PICTURES;BETA RADIATION IS SIMILAR TO
CATHODE RAYS-IT CONSISTS OF STREAMS OF HIGH-ENERGY ELECTRONS,THE SPEEDS OF
WHICH APPROACH THE SPEED OF LIGHT.BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN ALPHA
RADIATION THEY DONT NEED TO GO THROUGH THE RADIATION AMPLIFICATION PROCESS.THIS
IS ONLY AN INTERNAL OPERATION AND SHOULD NOT REALLY BE OF ANY CONCERN TO YOU.

APPLYING BETA RAYS TO `ORBITON` ELEMENT THE SAME WAY WE DID WITH ALPHA RAYS WE
WOULD DISCOVER IT WOULD CHANGE INTO CRAZLIUM(CZ) WHICH IS ELEMENT 6 IN GROUP 6.

GAMMA RADIATION;
ANYONE WHO HAS WATCHED THE `INCREDIBLE HULK` WILL REMEMBER GAMMA RADIATION
BEING THE DEVIL RESPONSIBLE FOR CHANGING POOR DAVID ,IN TO A RAGING GREEN BLOB.
GAMMA RADIATION IS ESSENTIALLY ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION AND IS A FORM OF
X-RAY. THEY ARE VERY HIGH ENERGY AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE MANY
ELEMENTS.IN THE CASE OF OUR `ORBITON` CHEMICAL,GAMMA RADIATION WOULD MOVE IT
LEFT OR RIGHT ACROSS THE PERIODIC TABLE CHANGING IT TO EITHER IMAGINIUM(IA) OR
NASTIZINUM(NZ).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERDOING THE RADIATION.
BUT WHAT STOPS US FROM BEING SILLY AND CREATING ALL SORTS OF WEIRD AND
WONDEFUL CHEMICALS BY GOING INTO THE NEVER-NEVER-LAND THAT RESIDES OFF THE
PERIODIC TABLE?.IN SUBREALITY,NOTHING WOULD STOP US FROM DOING THIS,BUT REALITY
PLAYS A RATHER NASTY HERE AND FORCES US TO REMAIN WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF
THEW TABLE. TRY GOING BOFF THE TABLE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS, ALTHOUGH IT ISANT
REALLY RECOMAENDED.

BY REPETITIVLEY APPLYING MORE AND MORE RADIATION AND THUS MOVING OUR CHEMICALS
ALL OVER THE PERIODIC TABLE WE ARE ALSO GOING TO OBSERVE A LOSS OF QUANTITY OF
CHEMICAL NEVER MIND,NOTHING COME FOR FREE.LEAST OF ALL OUR LUXURIES.LIKE
POWERFUL RADIATION LABS!.

CAN IT BE SERIOUS?.

HERE ON EARTH TO ATTEMPT TO DO THE ABOVE WOULD BE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.COST A
LOT OF MONEY.AND USE MASSES OF ENERGY.IN FACT,MORE ENERGY THAN A FOOD BLENDER
WOULD IF LEFT ON FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.SERIOUSLY THOUGH,GIVEMN THE CHEMICALS
ON THE B-CLASS PERIODIC TABLE YOU MUST TRY TO USE THEM AS BEST AS YOU CAN,TRY
EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERING DEGREES OR RADIATION AND CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS TO
PRODUCE EFFECTIVE FERTILIZERS AND ENVIROMENT CONTROOLERS. NOW THAT YOU HAVE
READ THROUGH THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF RADIATION READ-ON TO FIND OUT HOW TO CONTROL
THEM.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USING FUSION.

PRESSING ICON 1 ON THE MAIN FUSION MENU WILL TAKE YOU INTO YOUR LABORATORY,(FIG
43) THE DESCRIPTION IS SUPPLIED BELOW.

1. CHEMICAL INVENTORY
2. UP/DOWN DIRECTORY SELECTOR
3. CHEMICAL CHOSEN
4. ALPHA/BETA AND GAMMA RADIATION KEYS.

NOW YOU MAY ALTER THE COMPOSITIONS OF CHEMICALS BY BOMBARDING THEM WITH
ALPHA,BETA OR GAMMA RADIATION WAVES.
PLEASE REFER TO THE `WORLD ACCORDING TO` FOR THE DIFFERENT EFFECTS OF
ALPHA,BETA AND GAMMA RAYS.

UP/DOWN SELECTORS;
THESE ARE STANDARD THROUGH OUT FUSION(AND SIMILAR TO THE OTHERS IN `DEBUT`)

THEY ARE USED FOR LOOKING THROUGH YOUR CHEMICALS,IF YOU HAVE SO MANY THAT THEY
CAN`T BE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN AT ONCE.
FOR INSTANCE,ONLY ABOUT 8 CHEMICALS ARE DISPLAYED AT ONCE.SO IF YOU WANT TO SEE
THE OTHERS YOU HAVE,PRESS THE DOWN ARROW FOR GOING DOWN THE LIST AND THE UP
ARROW FOR GOING BACK UP.

RADIATING ELEMENTS OR COMPOUNDS.
FIRST YOU MUST SELECT WHICH OF THE CHEMICALS IN YOUR INVENTORY YOU WISH TO
ALTER,TO DO THIS,CLICK THE MOUSE POINTER OVER ONE OF THEM AND PRESS THE LEFT
MOUSE BUTTON,ITS NAME SHOULD THEN APPEAR IN THE `CHEMICAL SELECTED`BOX(ICON 3
ON THE LAB MENU).

HAVING SELECTED THE CHEMICAL,NOW CHOOSE ANY OF THE RADIATIONS(4 ON THE
MENU)ONCE YOU HAVE PRESSED THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY UP DATE THE NAME OF YOUR
CHEMICAL AND STORE IT BACK INTO YOUR INVENTORY.TO DO IT TO THE SAME CHEMICAL
AGAIN,THEN JUST CLICK ONE OF THE RADIATION KEYS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FUSION REACTOR.
ICON 2 IN THE MAIN MENU TAKES YOU INTO THE FUSION CHAMBER(FIG 44)

1. CHEMICAL INVENTORY LIST
2. INVENTORY UP/DOWN SELECTOR
3. CURRENT CHEMICAL CHOSEN
4. CHAMBER UP/DOWN SELECTOR
5. CURRENT CONTENETS OF THE FUSION CHAMBER.

FUSION IN`DEBUT` IS SIMILAR TO FUSION AS WE KNOW IT.WITH IT YOU ARE ABLE TO
COMBINE MANY CHEMICALS TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE ONE LARGE COMPOUND.

THE `DEBUT` SCIENTISTS HOPWEVER,HAVE PERFECTED FUSION,IT IS POSSIBLE TO MIX ANY
CHEMICALS TOGETHER(EVEN CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS) AND BE LEFT WITH A STABLE
COMPOUND,ALL WITH NO MESSY 10 MILE LOW PARTICLE ACCELERATORS(OR HARD
WATER)HOWEVER,THEY DECLINED TO COMMENT ON HOW EXACTLY THEY ACHIEVED THIS.

FUSING CHEMICALS TOGETHER.
AGAIN YOU NEED TO SELECT WHICH CHEMICALS YOU WISH TO FUSE.THIS IS DONE IN A
SIMILAR WAY AS IN THE LAB;
CLICK ON THE FIRST CHEMICALS YOU WISH TO USE(IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SELECTED
WINDOW)
NOW CLICK ONTO THE SELECTED CHEMICAL WINDOW(ICON 3) AND YOUR CHEMICAL WILL
APPEAR IN THE REACTOR.
YOU MAY KEEP DOING THIS UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO ACTUALLY FUSE THEM TOGETHER,AT
WHICH POINT PRESS ICON(4)-(THE CHAMBER WINDOW) AND THEY WILL BE FUSED.
IF MORE THAN 10 ELEMENTS(NOT COMPOUNDS) ARE IN THE REACTOR THE SOME ARE IN
DANGER OF BEING LOST AS CHEMICALS WITH MORE THAN 10 ELEMENTS TEND TO BE RATHER
UNSTABLE.SO ITS BEST NOT TO MIX TOO MANY BIG CPMPOUNDS TOGETHER AT ONE TIME.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE FISSION CHAMBER.
HERE WE FIND THE OPPOSITE OF FUSION.INSTEAD OF MAKING MANY ELEMENTS BECOME ONE
BIGGER COMPOUND,IT TAKES A COMPOUND AND BREAKS IT DOWN INTO ELEMENTS THAT MAKE
IT UP;SO THAT THEY IN TURN COULD BE USED INDIVIDUALLY TO MAKE OTHER COMPOUNDS.
YOUR FISSION CHAMBER IS SHOWN IN DIAGRAM (FIG 45)

1. CHEMICAL WINDOW
2. UP/DOWN SELECTOR
3. SELECTED CHEMICAL WINDOW

PERFORMING FISSION.
AS WITH PREVIOUS OPTIONS IN FUSION,IT IS FIRST NECESSARY TO CHOOSE WHICH
COMPOUND YOU WISH TO BREAK DOWN,AS BEFORE YOU DOTHIS BY SELECTING IT FROM THE
CHEMICAL INVENTORY WINDOW;IT SHOULD THEN APPEAR IN THE `CHEMICAL`SELECTED
WINDOW.

ONCE YOU HAVE SELECTED A COMPOUND,CLICK ON THE SELECTED WINDOW(ICON 3) WITH THE
LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.

YOUR CHEMICAL IS NOW BROCKEN DOWN INTO ELEMENTS THAT USED TI MAKE IT UP, AND
THESE HAVE NOW BEEN PLACED IN YOUR INVENTORY.

NOTES ABOUT THE FUSION OF THE TYME AND REALITY'.

ALTHOUGH NOT TO REALISTIC,THE RULES THAT IT OBEYS ARE ROUGHLY(OK-VERY ROUGHLY)
IN LINE WITH THE ACTUAL THING,AND SIMULATES REALITY WITHOUT BEING BOGGED DOWN
AND CONSTRAINED.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYME HOUNDED CONSCIENCE.

TYME HOUNDED CONSCIENCE IS THE GATEWAY TO ANOTHER WORLD WQITHIN TYME AND
REALITY.THE CITIES OF THE `DEBUT` WORLD ARE HERE.ON CHOOSING THIS OPTION YOU
WILL LEAVE TYME AND REALITY AND ARE ABLE TO EXPLORE THE `DEBUT` CITIES.

THE STATUS SCREEN.

DEBUT DOES NOT HAVE A SCORE IN THE ACCPTED SENSE,INSTEAD IT RELIES ON THE
PLAYER TO USE ALL THE PARTS OF THE GAME TO ACHIEVE THEIR FINAL GOAL. THE
CURRENT STATE OF THE PLANET(POLLUTION AND LIFE)IS YOUR CURRENT SCORE;IT IS
THEREFORE POSSIBLE FOR THE SCORE TO FLUCTUATE AND CHANGE QUITE RAPIDLY OVER A
SHORT SPACE OF TIME.

THE STATUS SCREEN THEREFORE SUPPLIES YOU WITH INFO ON HOW WELL THE PLANET IS
COPING UP THIS POINT.IT DISPLAYS PERCENTAGE POLLUTION FOR OZONE,NUKE,ECT THEN A
PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL PLANET POLLUTION.

BESIDE THIS THE PERCENTAGES FOR LIFE IS GIVEN(SO THE STATUS WONT BE ALL
DEPRESSING,,THOUGH THAT WILL DEPEND IF ANYTHING IS ALIVE!)

MISC OPTIONS.

MISC ON THE MAIN MENU BRINGS UP A SET OF ICONS THAT REALLY COULD NOT BE PLACED
IN ANY OF THE OTHER OPTIONS.

IF YOU DONT INTEND ON SITTING UP ALL NIGHT TO FINISH DEBUT YOU ARE GOING TO
WANT TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT GAME,AND LOAD IT BACK IN ANOTHER TYME.

ALSO IF YOU MANAGE TO FINISH IT,OR JUST GET BORED WITH THE INITIAL PLANET,YOU
MAY WISH TO TRY YOUR HAND AT ANOTHER PLANET.INDEED,YOU CAN SAVE THE PLANET YOU
ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON,SO YOU MAY USE IT AS A STARTING POSITION FOR A NEW
GAME.

FIGURE 46 IS THE MISC MENU;

1. SAVE A PLANET(NOT IN ECOLOGICAL SENSE)
2. LOAD A PLANET
3. SAVE A GAME (NOT IN COMMERCIAL SENSE)

LOADING AND SAVING PLANETS
ON SELECTING THIS YOUR PRESENTED WITH THE DEFAULT FILE MENU SELECTOR;USE THIS
AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED.LOADING AND SAVING PLANETS JUST GIVES YOU A NEW PLANET
TO WORK WITH,IT DOES NOT EFFECT ANY OTHER BITS OF THE GAME,(ALTHOUGH PLANET
STATUS WILL OBVIOUSLY BE DIFFERENT) OTHER PLANETS ARE INCLUDED ON THE DEBUT
DISK.EACH WITH ITS OWN UNIQUE TRAITS,SOME ARE MORE DIFFICULT THAN OTHERS TO
BALANCE ECOLOGICALLY.SO YOU CAN TRY YOUR HAND AT EARTH LIKES,MARS LIKE EVEN
ZZYAXIAN TYEPS(WELL COOL FOR A ZARJAZ COLOUR FLOW) THE INFO OPTION WILL GIVE
YOU BETTER DESCRIPTIONS.

SIMILARLY YOU CAN SAVE YOUR CURRENT PLANET(SO YOU COULD START WITH A PLANET
HALFWAY THROUGH ITS LIFE-CYCLE ALREADY!)LIKE WISE WHEN YOU SAVE A PLANET,IT
DOES NOT SAVE ANY OTHER PARTS OF THE GAME(IE;INVENTORY ECT)ONLY WHAT THE OTHER
PLANET IS LIKE.

SAVING AND LOADING GAMES;
DEBUT TAKES QUITE A LONG TIME TO PLAY-AND MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE IN ONE SITTING,YOU
MAY SAVE THE GAME `AS IT IS` AND COME BACK TO IT LATER,AS IF YOU NEVER LEFT IT.

SO CHOOSE YOUR OPTION(SAVE OR LOAD) AND YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH THE FILE
SELECTOR(EXPLAINED PREVIOUSLY)SO AS YOU CAN SEE,MANY GAMES CAN BE SAVED(EACH
TAKES ABOUT 80K) REMEMBER THAT IF YOU LOAD A GAME,YOUR CURRENT GAME WILL BE
OVER WRITTEN. IF YOU WISH TO COME BACK TO IT...SAVE BEFOREHAND!

HOW PROGRAMS RELATE TO SAVE GAMES.

PROGRAMS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH LOADING AND SAVING GAMES,THEY EXIST ON THEIR
OWN. THIS IS TO ENABLE YOU TO USE THE SAME PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT TIME OF PLAYING
DEBUT,IRRESPECTIVE OF WHICH PLANET YOU USE,OR HOW MANY GAMES YOU HAVE PLAYED
PREVIOUSLY.
SO REMEMBER TO SAVE ALL YOUR PROGRAMS IF YOU WISH TO KEEP THEM(EG;IF THERE IS A
PROGRAM IN MEMORY WHEN YOU SAVE A GAME,THEN TURN THE COMPUTER OFF,THAT PROGRAM
WILL THEN BE LOST IF IT HAD`NT ALREADY BEEN SAVED.)(SCOOTER NOTE..SOUNDS LIKE A
LOAD OF FUCKING CARBAGE TO ME..BUT I ONLY TYPE IT IN)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TYME HOUNDED CONSCIENCE

PURPOSE. THE DEBUT PLANET HAS FOUR LARGE UNDERGROUND CITIES THAT HOUSE THE
POPULATION,WHILE PUMPING OUT A FAIR BIT OF POPULATION IN THE PROCESS-IN THE
FORM OF NUCLEAR REACTORS.

THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS SECTION IS TO TAKE THE PEOPLE OUT AND PLACE THEM ON
THE EARTHS SURFACE.YOU MUST ALSO SHUT DOWN EACH OF THE CITIES REACTORS.

FLOORS OF EACH CITY.
EACH CITY HAS 5 LEVELS WHICH ARE.

LEVEL 1. THE CITIES BARRICADE AGAINST ENEMY ATTACK
LEVEL 2. THE REACTOR LEVEL
LEVEL 3. TRADING/URBAN AREAS. THIS IS THE FLOOR WHERE THE PEOPLE LIVE AND
         WORK.IT IS ALSO WHERE YOU OBTAIN MONEY FOR UDSE IN TYME AND REALITY
LEVEL 4. THE CRYPT,A STRANGE PART OF THE CITY THIS,IT WAS DISCOVERED BY THE
SCIENTISTS DURING THEIR ORIGOINAL EXCAVATION WORK.NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHO
CREATED IT. ITS BECOME A WIDELY  HELD BELIEF THAT SOME KIND OF GOD WAS
RESPNSIBLE FOR ITS CREATION,OTHERS BELIEVE A SECT OF THE POPULATION REVOLTED
DURING THE ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THE PLANET AND BUILT IT THEMSELVES. IN RECENT
TIMES MANY PEOPLE HAVE GONE THERE TO MEET WITH THEIR MAKER.....
LEVEL 5. SEWER LEVEL.WHERE ALL THE UCK OF THE CITY COMES TO REST.AS WITH EARTH
THIS KIND OF PLACE THAT IS TYPICAL OF THE ATTITUDE `OUT OF SIGHT,OUT OF
MID`...IT IS ALSO WHERE YOU ARE MOST LIKELY TO FIND `CHEMICALS` WHICH MAY OR
MAY NOT BE USEFUL TO YOU,ONLY TYME WILL TELL....

YOU CAN SEE THE CITIES AND FLOORS ALTOGETHER(FIG  47) SO THE SEWER LEVEL IS THE
DEEPEST IN THE PLANET.

LEVEL POPULATION DISTRUBUTION.

DEFENSE .... 0% (REACTOR 1)
REACTOR .... 0% (REACTOR 2)
TRADING ....60% (WHERE MOST POPULATION RESIDE)
CRYPT   ....30% 
SEWER   ....10%

OIT IS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THAT NONE OF THE POPULATION VENTURE INTO THE DEFENSE
AND REACTOR PARTS OF THE CITIES(THEY`LL GET THIER LIMBS RAPIDLY MELTED IN THE
REACTOR AREAS OR BLOWN OFF IN THE DEFENSE LEVEL-IF THEY GET THAT FAR!)

YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO REMOVE PEOPLE FROM THE CITY UNTIL YOU HAVE MANAGED TO
GUIDE PELVTHRUST SKILFULLY THROUGH THE DEFENCE AND REACTOR PARTS OF THE CITIES
THUS CLOSING DOWN THE REACTORS FOR THE CITY. FOR EVERY TRADING RUBBISH OR CRYPT
LEVEL YOU COMPLETE,YOU WILL BE GIVEN A NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO `EVACUATE` TO THE
PLANETS SURFACE..EACH CITY ON THE PLANET IS ALSO OF A DIFFERENT SIZE AND HAS A
DIFFERENT POPULATION. THE PLANET POPULATIONS WILL BE DISTRUBUTED ROUGHLY AS 
FOLLOWS.

PLANET DISTRUBUTION;

CITY A ... 15%
CITY B ... 15%
CITY C ... 20%
CITY D ... 50%

THESE FIGURES MAY CHANGE AS CITY POPULATIONS INCREASE OR DECREASE. AFTER
COMPLETING A CITY YOU WILL BE AWARDED A FINANCIAL BONUS.

JOYSTICK CONTROL.
USING A JOYSTICK(IN PORT 1) YOU CONTROL PELVTHRUST,WHOSE COMPUTER-AIDED
GUIDANCE SYSTEM MAKES HIM BOTH NIMBLE AND STEADY(EVEN WHEN ON JUST ONE LEG!)

A LEFT MOVEMENT ON THE JOYSTICK WILL WALK HIM ON THE LEFT,RIGHT WILL TURN HIM
AROUND TO WANDERING  THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

THE COUNTRYSIDE.
ON ENTERING TYME HOUNDED CONSCIENCE YOU ARE PLACED INTO THE `COUNTRYSIDE`.THIS
IS IN FACT ONLY SIMULATED,BUT IS THE ONLY CONTACT THE PEOPLE HAVE WITH REAL
GROWING THINGS.

WALKING THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE,SCATTERED AT VARIOUS INTERVALSARE `LIFTS` WHICH
LEAD TO VARIES CITIES. THE CITY TO WHICH THEY LEAD CORRESPONDS TO THE LETTER AT
THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE LIFT.SIMILAR TO THE LABELING YOU SEE IN THE
FLOORS OF CAR-PARKS.

TO ENTER A LIFT MOVE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE IT AND PUSH FORWARD.YOU WILL BE TAKEN
INSIDE AND PRESENTED WITH A VIEW OF THE LIFT.

FEATURES OF THE CITIES;

FOOTLIFTS.
ONE THING THAT ALL CITIES HAVE IN COMMON IS FOOTLIFTS.THESE LOOK LIKE SMALL
`PLATES` THAT YOU CAN WALK INTO,ALTHOUGH THE STYLE OF THE FOOTLIFT CHANGES
DEPENDING ON WHAT PART OF THE CITY YOU ARE IN,THEY ALL DO THE SAME THING.

TO USE A LIFT,MOVE PELVTHRUST DIRECTLY OVER IT AND MOVE THE JOYSTICK
FORWARD(FOR UP)OR BACK (FOR DOWN)

IF THE LIFT FAILS TO MOVE,IT IS BECAUSE IT IS EITHER AT THE TOP OR BOTTOM OF
ITS SHAFT IF YOU TRY THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IT SHOULD MOVE OFF. TRY EXPLORING
AROUND CITIES USING THE FOOTLIFTS,YOU`LL SOON GET THE HANG OF THEM. PELTHRUST
DOES NOT MOVE WHILE ON A FOOTLIFT CAUSE HE IS SCARED STIFF OF HEIGHTS.

INSIDE THE MAIN LIFTS.
THE INSIDE OF THE MAIN LIFTS WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME FOR EACH LEVEL. SEE FIG
48. THEY WERE DESIGNED BY THE ORIGINAL PLANET SCIENTISTS TO BE FUNCTIONAL.ON
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE LIFT(ONCE INSIDE ONE)YOU CAN SEE;

1. PLASMA SCREEN LIFT DISPLAY.

THIS DISPLAY IS CONTROLLED BY THE ON BOARD LIFT COMPUTER AND IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR DISPLAYING YOUR CURRENT LOCATION WITHIN THAT LEVEL FOR THE CITY AND WITHIN
`DEBUT` PLANET.

2. LIFT FLOOR LEVEL INDICATOR.

A CITY MAY HAVE A NUMBER OF INTERCONNECTING FLOORS WHICH MAY NEED THE USE OF A
LIFT TO PASS BETWEEN THEM.THE LIFTS FOR WHICH YOU HAVE KEYS GIVE YOU PERMISSION
BY THE COMPUTER TO GO TO AND FROM LEVELS.BY MOVING THE JOYSTICK LEFT AND RIGHT
THIS NUMBER WILL GO UP AND DOWN RESPECTIVELY ACCORDING TO WHICH LEVELS YOU HAVE
ACCESS TO.
THIS IS THE SAME NUMBER THAT APPEARS ON THE TOP RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE LIFT
ENTRANCES.

3. CITY LEVEL INDICATOR.

AS YOU ALREADY KNOW,EACH CITY CONSISTS OF 5 LEVELS WHICH REPRESENT THE
DIFFERENT MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF A LARGE POPULATION ON THIS PLANET. YOU ARE FREE TO
MOVE BETWEEN THE ACCESSIBLE LEVELS BY PUSHING THE JOYSTICK UP AND DOWN FOR
HIGHER AND LOWER.

4. CITY IDENTIFIER.

THERE ARE 4 CITIESON THE PLANET,DEPENDING ON WHICH ONE YOU ENTER AT COUNTRYSIDE
LEVEL,YOU ARE TO DESCEND THROUGH THAT ONE AS YOU PROGRESS. THE IDENTIFIER
RANGERS FROM A-D WHICH REPRESENTS THE CITY YOU ARE IN.YOU CAN`T ALTER THIS FROM
WITHIN THE LIFT,IT IS ONLY AN INDICATOR.

ONCE YOU HAVE OBSERVERED OR CHANGED THE SETTING FOR THE LIFT,PRESS FIRE ON THE
JOYSTICK AND YOU WILL BE TRANSPORTED THROUGH THE VAST NETWORK TO YOUR
DESTINATION IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. THE COMPUTER INTERFACE SHIELD WILL COME UP
AS YOU DEPART THEN REOPEN OUTSIDE THE LIFT.PELVTHRUST WILL BE STANDING OUTSIDE
THE LIFT.MAKE SURE YOU ARE READY FOR ANY ACTION-SHOULD IT BE NECESSARY.

REMEMBER LEVEL IN A CITY HAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STYLE AND EACH CITY HAS A
DIFFERENT COMPLEXITY.TO NAVIGATE AROUND THE CITY -A- MIGHT BE RELATIVELY EASY
WHEN COMPARED TO CITY -D- WHICH HAS A MORE COMPLEX ARRANGEMENT OF LIFTS AND
FOOTLIFTS TO COPE WITH.

THE FUNCTION KEYS(F1-F10)

F1  - MAPPING A CITY.
      IT IS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A WIDER VIEW OF THE CITY YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN BY
      PRESSING F1 ON THE KEYBOARD,THIS WILL GIVE YOU 1/4 SCALE VIEW OF YOUR
      SURROUNDING AREA,WITH PELVTHRUST BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN.

F2  - PICKING UP OBJECTS.
      THE FOLLOWING OBJECTS ARE AMONGST THOSE YOU MAY FIND SCATTERED AROUND THE
      CITY. 

      1. KEYS; THESE ARE NUMBERED SQUARES AND ONCE PICKED UP ALLOW YOU TO USE
         THE LIFT WITH THAT NUMBER.ON THAT LEVEL.

      2. UNLICENSED WEAPONS; THIS LOOKS LIKE A BANNED SYMBOL AND GIVES YOU A
         NUMBER OF DIFFERENT UNLICENSED WEAPONS PROVIDING FORMIDABLE FIREPOWER
         AND PROTECTION.

      3. PROTECTION AIDS; THESE ARE GENERAL PURPOSE PROTECTION AIDS SUCH AS
         SHIELDS,A SHIELD ICON IS USED TO REPRESENT THESE.

      4. EXPLOSIVE DEVICES; EXPLOSIVE DEVICES CAN BE INSTANTANEOUS,OR TIMED(YOU
         CAN TELL WHICH SORT IT IS BY THE INVENTORY DESCRIPTION)LOOK FOR AN
         EXPLODING BOMB ICON FOR THESE DEVICES.

      5. OTHER OBJECTS; THESE COULD BE ANYTHING,UNFORTUNATELY THE TECHNOLIGIES
         IN THE CITIES HAVE PROGRESSED SO MUCH THAT THE SCIENTISTS ARE UNABLE
         TO RECOGNISE. YOU WILL HAVE TO RESEARCH THESES OBJECTS YOURSELF,USING
         PELVTHRUST.

EACH OF THESE HAVE THEIR OWN INVENTORY.PELVTHRUST MAY CARRY UP TO 5 OF ANY TYPE
OF WEAPON AND UP TO 8 TYPES OF OBJECT AT ANY ONE TIME. TO PICK UP AN OBJECT
STAND JUST IN FRONT,OR JUST BEHIND IT,THEN PRESS F2,IF IT DOES DISAPPEAR FROM
THE SCREEN,MOVE A LITTLE LEFT OR RIGHT WHERE APPROPRIATE. THERE ARE MANY
VARIATIONS OF WEAPON TO BE FOUND.TO SEE PRECISELY WHAT YOU HAVE PICKED UP YOU
MUST GO INTO ONE OF THE INVENTORY SCREENS.

F3--F7 INVENTORY.

EACH OF THESE FUNCTION KEYS WILL TAKE YOU TO A SEPERATE INVENTORY,LISTED BELOW.

A TYPICAL INVENTORY SCREEN DESCRIBES THE CURRENT OBJECT YOU ARE CARRYING IN
NTHAT CATEGORY. USE THE FOOLLOWING KEYS TO BRING UP THE INVENTORIES.

F3 - KEYS AND OTHER OBJECTS
F4 - UNLICENSED WEAPONS
F5 - PROTECTION AIDS (SUCH AS SHIELDS)
F6 - EXPLOSIVE DEVICES (BOMBS ECT)

PRESS esc WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED LOOKING;

THE OBJECT INVENTORY.
THE OBJECT INVENTORY GIVES YOU A BRIEF,BUT MORE SPECIFIC,DESCRIPTION OF THE
OBJECTS YOU ARE CARRYING.IF YOU HAVE PICKED UP A CHEMICAL YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL
YOU RETURN TO TYME AND REALITY SO THAT IT MAY BE ANALYSED BEFORE YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.
TO DROP AN ITEM FROM YOUR OBJECT INVENTORY,PRESS `F3`,TO SEE WHICH OBJECTS YOU
PROCESS THEN PRESS THE FUNCTION KEY(LABALLED BESIDE THE OBJECT)IT WILL THEN
DISAPPEAR FROM THE LIS AND APPEAR ON THE CITY FLOOR.

NOTE; YOU CANNOT DROP ITEMS ON A FOOTLIFT,OR IN FRONT OF A MAIN FLOOR LIFT.

WEAPON INVENTORY.
THIS WORKS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS THE OBJECT INVENTORY,HOWEVER,YOU CAN ALSO
ARM PELVTHRUST WITH WEAPONS BY PRESSING KEYS F1-F10 CORRESPONDING TO AN
APPROPRIATE WEAPON.TO FIRE THE WEAPON,PRESS FIRE ON JOYSTICK. NOTE;THAT IF YOU
DROP A WEAPON(KEYS F1-F5 YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ARMED WITH IT.

COMPUTER CONSOLES.
YOU MAY USE THE COMPUTER CONSOLES IN THE CITY TO RETURN TO `TYME AND
REALITY`,OR FOR SOME MISCELLANOUS INFO,USE THEM IN THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD A
MAIN LIFT.

SPECIAL OBJECTS IN THE CITIES.
YOU MAY FIND SOME PARTICULARLY USEFUL OBJECTS WHILE WALKING ABOUT THE CITY. I
WILL TELL YOU ABOUT ONE.

CASHPOINT CARD,THIS CAN BE USED FOR WITHDRAWING MONEY FROM THE CREDIT POINTS ON
THE TRADING LEVEL. THIS MONEY CAN LATER BE USED IN `TYME AND REALITY` FOR
BUYING CHEMICALS

THE OTHER OBJECTS IN THE CITY REQUIRE EXPERIMENTATION BEFORE YOU FIND OUT WHAT
THEY CAN BE USED FOR.

NOTE; USING A CREDIT MACHINE IS DONE IN THE SAME WAY AS USING A MAIN LIFT OR A
COMPUTER.

NOTE; ANY SCORE YOU INCURE DURING `TYME HOUNDED CONSCIENCE` WILL BE CONVERTED
TO MONEY WHEN YOU RETURN TO `TYME AND REALITY`-BUT NOT IF PELVTHRUST IS KILLED.

EACH TIME YOU PRESS `3 DAY SCAN` IN TYME AND REALITY,YOU WILL BE GIVEN A NEW
PELVTHRUST,TO EXPLORE CITIES. IF HE DIES IN THE CITY,YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL YOU
AGAIN DO A `3 DAY SCAN` BEFORE YOU CAN RETURN TO THE CITY-ON TOP OF YOUR
INVENTORY-SCORE WILL BE LOST.
