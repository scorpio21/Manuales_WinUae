                                 PANIC DIZZY

 Dizzy in his FANTASIC TOY FACTORY! Fit MAGIC SHAPES into GRAND DIZZY's
 INVENTION to make NEW and EXITING TOYS! Panic Stations, Conveyor Belts,
 Bacuum Tubes and more! AMAZINGLY ADDICTIVE! Keep a kewl head...
 DONT PANIC DIZZY!

 One day, Grand Dizzy was putting his finishing touches to his brand new
 TOY MAKING INVENTION.

 "Just got to tighten this last nut and we're ready... oooOOOh... eekk!"
 shouted GRAND DIZZY as the spanner slipped and he fell to the floor.

 "UURGH!!", moaned GRAND DIZZY, "I've got a CRACKING EGGACHE, now I'll never
  finish testing me new TOY MAKING MACHINE. What shall I do??"

 "Don't worry!", replied DIZZY, "We'll help you!"

 So DIZZY, DAISY, DENZIL, DYLAN, DOZY and DORA helped GRAND DIZZY to the
 machine and manned their STATIONS.

 Whilst DIZZY grabbed the CONVEYOR BELT CONTROLLER, the others went
 upstairs and threw MAGIC SHAPES down the tubes.

 Click, Crunch... Cough, Splatt!/FLT (hahaha) ,the machine kicked into
 ACTION!

 "ooooOOh, SLOW down...! Hang on...! Too fast...!", cried DIZZY, but the
 others couldn't HEAR HIM. The TOY MAKING INVENTION just kept getting
 FASTER...

 THE GAME

 Like all of Grand Dizzy's inventins, the magic toy making machine doesn't
 quite work as well as it should. All of it's cogs and wheels constantly
 need fueling with the special magic shapes. The Chutes from which the
 shapes emerge continually descend, when they reach the shape guard at the
 bottom of the screen the toy machine will seize up. The only way to keep
 the chutes from reaching the bottom is to fit lots of shapes through the
 guard and into the machine.

 THE AIMS OF THE GAME

 Line up the SHAPES GUARD with as MANY MAGIC SHAPES as possible.

 Press FIRE to release all MATCHING SHAPES.

 With 4 OR MORE matching shapes at once, a TOY is created, SO WAIT OR THE
 MAXIMUM TOYS!!

 If the WRONG SHAPE reaches the bottom the CHUTES will decend.

 The chutes will slowly decend and the only way to get them back up is to
 drop several shapes together. The more shapes you get the higher they'll
 go. If the CHUTE reaches the bottom the machine will STOP!

 Keep the machine going as long as possible to make lots of toys.

 Good luck and the best tip of all... DON'T PANIC DIZZY!
