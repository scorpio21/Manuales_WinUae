Yogi's Great Escape
Typed by Belgarath


Another winter has past, it's time for Yogi to wake and begin his
annual hobby of relieving innocent campers of their picnic baskets.

A few days into the season, Ranger Smith receives a disturbing
telephone call informing him that Jellystone Park must close and all
the animals are to be moved to the zoo.

Yogi hears the news and he secretly decides that the only way to
avoid being sent to the zoo is to escape from Jellystone Park.

When Yogi goes missing, a tracker and his faithful old dog are
brought in to help with the search.

Playing the part of Yogi Bear, you must progress through various
scenarios, avoiding obstacles and hidden dangers. If for any reason
Yogi slows down, Ranger Smith and the tracker are sure to capture
him and take him to the zoo.
