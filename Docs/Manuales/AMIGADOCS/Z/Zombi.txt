The aim of the game: find some petrol.

Be careful!  Another team is playing simultaneously, they have no problem
with petrol, but suffer from hunger.  They are called THE HELLS ANGELS.

--- The left on validates any action.

--- Two move, use the cursor and place it on one of the arrow keys
    around the main window.  Validate your choice.

    move on to this elements with the cursor and then validate.

A few tips:

1 - Some tools can be used as swords.

2 - Sylvie cannot use the gun nor some of the swords.

3 - Every action bears consequences on the game playing, even if you
    don't notice them.

4 - If you find it too difficult to use the computer, then have a last go
    at "BYE".

5 - The game itself takes care of some situations.

Ex.  If your character is in the same place as corpses, it may loose points
on its health chart.

End.
