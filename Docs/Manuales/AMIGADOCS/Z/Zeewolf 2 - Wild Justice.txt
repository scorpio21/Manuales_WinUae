                                 Gameplay
                               - -------- -

Zeewolf 2/Wild Justice is the second episode in the Zeewolf series. This
version has significantly improved upon the original release a year ago.
The first thing you notice when you first boot the game is the detailed
polygon graphics, which have vastly improved upon Zeewolf 1. The speed has
also vastly improved upon the original, despite the extra polygon graphics,
though of course the game speed depends upon which Amiga you are running it
from, but if you have an A1200 with fast memory it runs smooth enough. On
a A500/600 forget it, the game slows down to an un-playable speed when you
fire, although again not as much as in the original Zeewolf. The mission
briefing before each level is invaluable, with each target being described
and displayed on-screen, and although this can be ignored during the first
couple of missions, on the later levels it is vital.


                                  Playing
                                - ------- -

The basic task in each mission is to complete a series of objectives, and
therfore progress onto the next mission. An example mission would be to
destroy the enemies defence system, rescue a set number of POWs, and
destroy a set number of enemy aircraft.

The on-screen interface while you are playing comprises of a local area map
in the top-left hand corner, which displays the local terrain, with the
opposition forces shown as red-dots, POWs highlighted in blue, and friendly
aircraft shown in yellow. The top-right hand corner has the gun camera. The
fuel, armour, lives remaining, ammunition display, cash left and POWs
on-board are all displayed in the top-centre of the screen.

During the mission money is awarded when you perform certain tasks such as
destroy an ememy boat, or other defence installation. This money can then
be spent in the re-fueling on extra ammunition.

Re-Fuelling Camels are valuable, and provide fuel, and ammuntion. Basic
ammunition is free of charge, but for the more advanced weaponary you must
pay a fee. There is a limit to mow much ammunition/fuel you can carry in
one go. The different ammunition has a varying degree of effect upon the
recieving target. Targets also take a different amount of hits until they
are destroyed, depending on which weapon you use, and how much you use it.

If you manage to rescue POWs and return them to the mothership/mother-base,
for each person rescued you are awarded an Armour boost, which I can assure
you is very handy especially in the later levels. Be careful not to mistake
the opposition men as your own, and attempt to rescue them, they will
grenade the Zeewolf! Only pick-up the friendly blue-shirted men.

                           NAME: Zeewolf 2 - Wild Justice
                       VERSIONS: ECS

Despite that the demo version of Zeewolf 2 released on Amiga Format refused
to work on *ANY* A4000, the problem seems to have been fixed for the final
sales version, and no other incompatability problems have been reported on
any other configuration. As yet no HD Installer has been released, and I
doubt the game would really benefit that much from being HD-Installable, as
little loading is required.
