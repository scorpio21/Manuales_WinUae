[ZARATHRUSTA]...LOADING

A500,A1000 AND A 2000, YOU ARE ADVISED TO DISCONNECT ALL HARDWARE FROM YOUR
COMPUTER.INSERT KICKSTART IF REQUIRED.INSERT THE GAME DISK.THE GAME TAKES A FEW
SECONDS TO LOAD.

                             THE MISSION
                             -----------
THE RESISTANCE IS ABOUT TO LAUNCH A MAJOR OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE EMPIRE,IN
PREPARATION FOR THIS,THEY HAVE CAPTURED SEVERAL STARSHIPS, BUT THEY LACK THE
ESSENTIAL POWER SOURCES FOR THESE FORMIDABLE CRAFT,KLYSTRON PODS.

YOU HAVE  BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE RESISTANCE TI STEAL THESE PODS FROM THE
EMPIRES STORAGE PLANETS. TO DO THIS,YOU MUST LOCATE THE POD,HOVER JUST ABOVE
IT,ACIVATE YOUR SHIPS TRACTOR BEAM UNTIL THE POD HOOKS UP WITH YOUR SHIP AND
THEN THRUST AWAY WITH THE POD.YOU MUST THEN CARRY THE POD AWAY FROM THE
PLANET.YOU RECEIVE A BONUS AT THE END OF EACH SUCCESSFUL MISSION.

THE PLANETS HAVE DIFFERENT GRAVITY RATES AND, AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE
GAME,SOME WILL HAVE `REVERSE` GRAVITY.

                             GAMEPLAY
                             --------
YOUR SHIP MATERIALISES ABOVE THE PLANET YOU ARE ABOUT TO EXPLORE,YOU MUST THEN
NEGOTIATE THE DIFFERENT CAVES TRYING TO FIND THE KLYSTRON POD SOMEWHERE ON OR
WITHIN THE PLANET.

YOU HAVE 3 THINGS TO CONTROL WHILE FLYING YOUR SHIP.

1...ENGINE THRUSTERS
2...LEFT/RIGHT STEERING
3...TRACTOR BEAM

[ENGINE THRUSTERS...] THESE PROPEL YOU SHIP IN THE DIRECTION THAT IT IS
CURRENTLY FACING,THEY ARE YOUR MAIN DEFENCE AGAINST THE PLANETS GRAVITY HAT
PULLS YOU TOWARDS ITS SURFACE.

[LEFT/RIGHT STEERING] THIS ROTATES THE SHIP EITHER CLOCKWISE OR
ANTI-CLOCKWISE,DETERMINING IN WHICH DIRECTION YOUR ENGINE THRUSTERS WILL THRUST
YOU.

[TRACTOR BEAM.......] THIS IS USED FOR COLLECTING THE KLYSTRON POD AND ALSO FOR
COLLECTING EXTRA FUEL FOR YOUR ENGINE THRUSTERS. THE TRACTOR BEAM CAN ONLY BE
ACTIVATED BY HOVERING JUST ABOVE THE OBJECT YOU WISH TO BEAM.
ONCE THE KLYSTRON POD HAS BEEN LOCATED YOU MUST BEAM IT UP TO YOUR
SHIP(EXPLAINED LATER)AND THEN TOW IT AWAY FROM THE PLANET WHERE YOUR MOTHER
SHIP IS AWAITING TO COLLECT YOU AND THE POD AND TRANSPORT YOU TO THE NEXT
PLANET IN YOUR CONQUEST.

                             WEAPONS SYSTEMS
                             ---------------



[PLASMA BOLTS.........] THESE ARE YOUR MAIN FORM OF ATTACK,USED FOR MOST OF 
THE ACTIVITY IN THE GAME.

[LASER SCANNING DEVICE] YOUR SHIP ALSO POSSESSES A POWERFUL LASER WHICH CANS
THE CAVERN WALLS AND DESTROYS ALL ENEMIES. IT IS NORMALLY USED TO DESTROY A
GROUP OF ABSTACLE TOGETHER BY ROTATING THE SHIP WHILST FIRING THE LASER.HOWEVER
THIS WEAPON USES A LOT OF FUEL SO USE WITH CARE.

                             THE KLYSTRON PODS
                             -----------------

THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF KLYSTRON PODS,ALL FOUND ATOP A TALL PLINTH
SOMEWHERE ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET.THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS...

[STANDARD......] THESE ARE PICKED UP BY THE SHIP WITH THE TRACTOR BEAM. IF THE
BEAM IS ACTIVATED OVER THE POD IT RISES TOWARDS YOUR SHIP. THE POD IS COLLECTED
WHEN IT COLLIDES WITH YOUR SHIP. THE POD IS THEN LOWERED ON A TOW ROPE FOR
TOWING AWAY FROM THE PLANET. THE POD CAN ALSO BE COLLECTED BY SHOOTING AT IT
AND CATCHING IT IN MID-AIR.

[HYDROGEN PODS.] THESE ARE LIGHTER THAN AIR AND THEY FLOAT AGAINST THE FORCE OF
GRAVITY TOARDS THE CEILING. ONCE CONNECTED TO THE SHIP,THE HYDROGEN FORCE WILL
NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT BOTH THE SHIP AND THE POD. BOTH WILL FALL DOWN,BUT
THE POD WILL FALL SLOWER THAN THE SHIP.

[BASKET PODS...] SOME OF THE PODS ARE FOUND INSIDE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC
`BASKETS`.THEY ARE PICKED UP IN THE NORMAL WAY BUT IF THE BASKET IS MOVED
SUDDENLY OR JOLTED,THE POD MAY FALL OUT OF THE BASKET,DOWN TO THE PLANET
SURFACE.YOU WILL THEN HAVE TO GO DOWN AND RE-COLLECT THE POD BY SHOOTING AT IT
AND CATCHING IT IN MID-AIR INSIE THE BASKET.

                             THE OBSTACLES
                             -------------

THE EMPIRE HAVE SET UP SEVERAL DEFENCES WITHIN THE PLANET TO PROTECT THE
KLYSTRON PODS THAT LIE WITHIN.THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS...

[AUTOMATIC LIMPET GUNS] THESE ARE THE PLANETS MAIN DEFENCE SYSTEM.WHEN THE
LIGHT FLASHES ON THEM AVOID THEM AS THEY ARE ABOUT TO FIRE IN THE DIRECTION
THEY ARE CURRENTLY POINTING.THEY CAN BE DESTROYED BY PASMA
BOLTS,LASER,SHIELD,POD BASKET OR BY SUICIDALLY CRASHING THE SHIP INTO THEM.

[AUTOMATIC DOORS.......] THESE SHUT OFF CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CAVERNS AND CAN BE
OPENED BY SHOOTING THE SWITCHES NEXT TO THEM,BUT BEWARE AS SOME DOORS CAN ONLY
BE OPENED FROM ONE DIRECTION. AFTER BEING OPENED THEY WILL ALWAYS CLOSE AGAIN
AFTER A SHORT PERIOD,SOME QUICKER THAN OTHERS.

[JET THRUSTERS.........] RANDOMLY SHOOT A JET FLAME OUT FROM THE WALL KILLING
ALL THAT IS CAUGHT IN IT. A LIGHT IS LIT UP JUST BEFORE THE FLAME IS FIRED SO
YOU GET A SHORT WARNING.THEY CANNOT BE DESTROYED.

[AIR VENTS.............] THESE ARE CONTINUALLY BLOWING OUT HOT AIR AND IF YOUR
SHIP FLIES IN FRONT OF THEM IT WILL BE BLOWN OFF COURSE,POSSIBLY INTO A
WALL.THEY CANNOT BE DESTROYED.

[ELECTRO-MAGNETIC CORES] PULL YOUR SHIP TOWARDS THEM IF YOU GET TO CLOSE TO
THEM, THEIR FORCE IS STRONGER THAN THAT OF GRAVITY.THEY CAN BE TURNED OFF IF
YOU CAN LOCATE THE GENERATOR THAT POWERS THEM AND DESTROY IT.

[PNEUMATIC-BARRIERS....] THESE BLOCK CORRIDORS AND ARE OPENED BY SHOOTING THE
TOP OF THE VERTICAL COLUMN SO THAT IT IS PUSHED DOWN.WHEN SHOT DOWN,THEY WILL
STAY DOWN FOR A FEW SECONDS BEFORE BEING PNEUMATICALLY PUMPED UP AGAIN.

[RAMRODS...............] THESE ARE SCREW THREADED RODS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY
SCREWED AND UNSCREWED FROM THE WALL,CAUSING A MOVING OBSTRUCTION IN THE
CAVERNS. THEY CANNOT BE DESTROYED OR DISABLED.

[LASER-PULSERS.........] THESE ARE FIRED AT RANDOM ACROSS THE CAVERNS,CREATING
A WALL FOR A SECOND. TIMING HAS TO BE USED TO ENSURE THAT YOU DONT COLLIDE WITH
THESE DEADLY LASERS.

[LIMPET DROIDS.........] THESE ARE SPHERICAL ANDROIDS THAT BOUNCE AROUND THE
SURFACE OF THE CAVERNS. IF YOU GET TO CLOSE TO THEM,THEY JUMP UP CLAMPING ON
EITHER YOU SHIP OR THE KLYSTRON POD(IF YOU ARE CARRYING ONE AT THE TIME)THIS
CAUSES THE SHIP TO EITHER BECOME A LOT HEAVIER WHICH IN TURN AFFECTS THE
CONTROLS,MAKING YOUR JOB HARDER. IF CARRYING A BASKET POD THE DROID WILL CAUSE
THE POD TO FALL FROM THE BASKET.

LIMPET DROIDS CAN BE SHAKEN OFF BY ROTATING THE SHIP QUICKLY AND THRUSTING IN A
CIRCLE CAUSING A CENTRIFUGAL FORCE THROWING OFF THE DROID. WHEN THEY ATTACH TO
THE POD,IT MUST BE ROTATED AROUND THE SHIP TO SHAKE IT OFF.

LIMPET DROIDS CAN BE HEARD BOUNCING WHEN THEY ARE NEARBY.

[CONTROL DE-ACTIVATING-
 SWITCHES..............] THESE TAKE THE FORM OF A PAIR OF SWITCHES THAT CREATE
AN INVISIBLE FIELD WHEN YOU PASS BETWEEN THEM.THIS FEILD DEACTIVATES YOUR
CONTROLS FOR A SECOND SO YOU HAVE TO AIM YOUR SHIP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
BEFORE FLYING BETWEN THESE SWITCHES.

[ELEVATORS.............] ELEVATORS CONSTANTLY GO UP AND DOWN SHAFTS WITHIN THE
CAVERNS. AT THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT THEY SLOW DOWN TO ALLOW YOUR
SHIP TO ENTER,HOWEVER,BEWARE SOME ELEVATORS TRAVEL FASTER THAN YOUR SHIP CAN
FLY.

[POD-SPLITTERS.........] THESE ARE CONNECTED TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF SOME OF
THE VERTICAL TUNNELS. WHEN YOU FLY BETWEEN THEM CRRYING A POD,ONE PULLS THE POD
AND THE OTHER PULLS YOUR SHIP.THIS RESULTS IN THE TOW ROPE BEING
STRETCHED.AFTERWARDS THE ROPE WILL SLOWLY SHRINK BACK TO NORMAL.HOWEVER,WHLE
YOU HAVE A LONGER ROPE IT BECOMES HARDER TO TOW THE SHIP THROUGH SMALLER GAPS.

THE FASTER YOU FLY BETWEEN THE POD SPLITTERS THE LESS YOUR ROPE WILL BE
STRETCHED.

[GRAVITY IMPULSES......] WHEN ACTIVATED THESE PULL YOUR SHIPS TOWARDS THEM.YOU
WILL HARDLY NOTICE THE EFFECT WHEN THEY ARE ON THEIR OWN,BUT WHEN IN A GROUP
THEY CAN MAKE YOUR SHIP VERY HARD TO CONTROL.BEFORE BEING ACTIVATED AN
INDICATOR LIGHT WILL ILLUMINATE AS A WARNING.

GRAVITY IMPULSES CAN BE TEMPORARILY DEACTIVATED BY SHOOTING AT THEM.

                             OTHER FEATURES
                             --------------

[THE PLANETS REACTOR..] EACH PLANET HAS A REACTOR ROVIDING POWER FOR THE LIMPET
GUNS AND OTHER DEFENCES,SHOOTING THE REACTOR WILL DAMAGE IT,AND EVERYTHING WILL
BE FROZEN UNTIL THE DAMAGE CAN BE REPAIRED.THE MORE DAMAGE DONE THE LONGER THIS
WILL TAKE. WHEN THE REACTOR IS SHOT THE WHOLE PLANET WILL FLASH RED.THE HARDER
THE HIT THE FASTER THE PLANET WILL FLASH.

IF REPEATEDLY SHOT THE REACTOR WILL BCOME CRITICALLY DAMAGED,YOU THEN HAVE A
LIMITED TIME TO ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET WITH THE POD.IF YOU MANAGE TO DO THIS
YOU WILL RECEIVE 10,000 POINTS, IF YOU MANAGE TO SCAPE WITHOUT THE POD A LIFE
WILL BE LOST AND YOU RECEIVE NO BONUS BUT STILL ESCAPE TO THE NEXT PLANET. IF
YOU ARE CAUGHT IN THE PLANET THE WALLS WILL START EXPLODING FOLLOWED BY TOTAL
MELTDOWN.

[FUEL TANKS............] TO COLLECT FUEL,HOVER JUS ABOVE A FUEL TANK AND
ACTIVATE THE TRACTOR BEAM.

[REVERSE GRAVITY.......] ON LATER LEVELS OF THE GAME THE GRAVITY IS REVERSED
PULLING YOUR SHIP UPARDS RATHER THANDOWN,CAUSING A WHOLE NEW SET OF PROBLEMS.

[CAVERN DWELLER........] THERE ARE CREATURES THAT CRAWL OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE
SURFACE,APPEAR FOR A FEW SECONDS,THEN CRAWL BACK BENEATH THE SURFACE.WHEN SHOT
THEY ARE PARALYSED FOR A SHORT WHILE. DUE TO THE CREATURES SUBSTANTIAL LIFE
FORCE YOU ARE THEN ABLE TO FLY DOWN CLOSE TO THE CREATURE AND ACTIVATE THE
TRACTOR BEAM ON IT,WHEN BEAMED YOU GAIN AN EXTRA LIFE. AFTER SUCKING THE
LIFE-FORCE FROM THE CREATURE IT DIES,BECOMING ANOTHER OBSTACLE ON THE
LANDSCAPE(SO MAKE SURE YOU DONT KILL ONE OF THEM IN A TIGHT SPACE).
