       Are You Quick & Agile Enough To Meet The Incredible Challenges?

  A colorful and fun-filled fast-paced arcade style game that challenges the
           player's reflexes and strategic thinking abilities!

                            Welcome to ZOOM!
                            """"""""""""""""
   Imagine yourself a clever and enchanting little character named ZOOMER!
You are fast - but are you quick and agile enough to meet the incredible
challenges of ZOOMLAND?
   Can you evade the hungry Jaggernaut and avoid the roaming enemies out to
disrupt your mission?
   The only way to find out is to put yourself to the test. You can play by
yourself (Hit F1) or take turns with a friend (Hit F2). If you have two
joysticks both of you can play at once (Hit F3) and keep score.
   Your mission is to frantically zig-zag and dart though ZOOMLAND lighting
up the grid lines. Outline the squares to light them up and score! Zip along
the lines to capture more than one square at a time and
yell, "Hey! Hey! WOW!" Seize two or more squares at once and the left gauge
gives you extra scoring time!

   Complete all of the squares and ZOOMLAND thrusts you though space to the
next zone. ZOOMLAND has 50 challenging levels and if you survive them all,
you win!

                         The Bad Guys
                         """"""""""""
   Watch out for those roving bad guys. They'll do anything to stop you! Some
will devour you (eegad!), others chase you wiping out your work.

Jaggernaut - Beware of the deadly flapping lips!

Wormletts -- These mischievous guys chase you through ZOOMLAND erasing all
             the lines.

                       """"""""""""""""""""
   You can zing the enemies with bombs! They'll stop anyone in their tracks
so you can keep on ZOOMIN! But watch out, they can stop you too. Just push
the button on your joystick to drop a bomb.

spring into ZOOMLAND!
