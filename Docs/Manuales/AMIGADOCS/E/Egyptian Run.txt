It seems the pyramids have come alive and are out to take over the world !
You are the world's only hope !  Can you get past the pyramid missiles with
the bumps to contend with and get in range to fire your guided missile at
the control pyramid ?  But even then your missile is damaged and hard to
control.

Joystick in Port #2.

Thanks to Sacha (not Sachs) for some of the graphics and sound.
