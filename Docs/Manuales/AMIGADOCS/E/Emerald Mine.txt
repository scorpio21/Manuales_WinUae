                          Emerald Mine

              Instructions For The Commodore Amiga

LOADING

Switch on your Amiga and insert the KICKSTART disk (Version V1.2) into the
built-in disk drive (Amiga 1000 only).  When the computer asks for the
WORKBENCH V1.2 disk, insert the EMERALD MINE disk.  The program will load
and start automatically.  IMPORTANT!  Don't write protect the disk and
leave the disk in the drive until you reset the computer!

DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME

It is the aim of the game to collect a specific number of diamonds and
emeralds on a specific filed within a limited time.  In principle you can
master your task alone or in teamwork.  Within the main menu, joystick
UP/DOWN - BUTTON allows the following options:

1. SINGLE PLAYER/TEAMWORK - choice of number of players (SINGLE PLAYER =
   alone, TEAMWORK = two players).

2. NAME - choice of name.  Choose either with joystick UP/DOWN one of the
   10 available names or a new name, which you insert as follows: first
   select CHOOSE PLAYER; ENTER NEW PLAYER appears on the screen.  Then you
   select one of the ten names (NOTICE! This player is automatically
   erased!) and answer the question ARE YOU SURE by pressing Y if you
   really want to erase this player.  The name can now be entered via
   keyboard (correction by BACKSPACE).  That new player, of course,
   receives handicap 0, i.e. he must start from the beginning.

3. HIGH SCORES - with joystick UP/DOWN you can see into the overall
   highscore list (30 spaces) of the present level.  In this list the
   place, name, the remainder of time shown in seconds, and the score you
   reached can be seen in succession.  In case you reached the highscore
   list, an arrow signifies the profit you made at that moment.

4. LEVEL - insertion of start level (0-80) by pressing joystick RIGHT/LEFT.
   You can choose only a start-level that does not exceed your handicap
   (see below).

5. START - beginning of the game (only possible when name is selected).

SCORE - display of total scores achieved in all games.

GAMES PLAYED - number of games which have been played until then by the
player or team.

GAMES WON - number of all games won until then.

HANDICAP - display, showing which level you did not yet master.  As a start
level you can choose this number (or a smaller one).  Should the handicap
of a player increase i.e. if he succeeds the highest level allowed, the
disk will automatically store it. You have to choose the option SAVE
PLAYERS in the NAME menu before a reset if you want SCORE, GAMES PLAYED,
and GAMES WON continuously correct.

Before you enter your name you have to inform the computer about the number
of players in the menu: single or teamwork.  Next you choose your start
level and then start the game.

During the game several keys are given specific functions:

F1 - view on player 1

F2 - view on player 2 (only in teamwork)

F3 - view on middle between player 1 - 2 (only in teamwork)

F6 - all sounds are on

F7, F8, F9 - sounds are partially on

F10 - sounds are off

ESC - breaking off a game and return to main menu

During the game you visualize a display border below.  TIME displays the
time left (in seconds); SCORE displays the actual score and EMERALDS the
number of smaragds that are still to be collected.

You can make scores in four different ways: 1. destroying opponent with a
stone, 2. collecting things (smaragds, diamonds, dynamite or a key), 3.
cracking a nut, and 4. achieving a bonus by having time left when reaching
the exit.

Apart from the usual joystick functions (walking, sand digging, pushing
stones/bombs/nuts), you can plant dynamite.  It is not easy to leave the
affected dynamite area once you have put the dynamite down.  Logically, you
have to take up the dynamite steal something from it (for example diamonds
or dynamite).

The elements of the game are numerous; we will introduce them one by one:

SAND (brown) - can only be walked on and removed by the player and the
amoebe (see below).

WALLS (grey) - 4 types of walls: 1. indestructible walls made of big,
rectangular blocks, 2. normal walls made of round stones, which are
destroyable, 3. unsteady walls that sometimes lose a stone from the top
(look like walls No. 2, but have rounded edges above), and 4. invisible
walls (naturally these are especially tricky).

STONES (grey) - can destroy all four types of opponents; the destruction is
rewarded with scores.

SMARAGDS (green) - must be collected by the player in order to reach the
exit.

DIAMONDS (blue) - are worth three smaragds; they can be squashed by falling
stones.

BOMBS (red) - explode when hitting the ground or when hit by a falling
stone.

NUTS (brown) - can be cracked when throwing a stone on them, which induces
them to release a smaragd.

Superficially stones, smargds, diamonds, bombs and nuts display the same
behavior.  They fall, they can be pushed or taken up, roll away to the side
when the underground is loose, and they kill a player when falling upon
him.

ROBOTS (green) - pursue the player, which is die to their intelligent
steering, but can be deflected with the means of a turning-wheel.

FLYER (grey) - always try to walk alongside the wall that is on their left.

BUGS (blue) - also move along the wall, but on the right.  Should they
explode because of a stone, a mine or a bomb they change into 8 smaragds
and 1 diamond.

EATERS (orange) - eat a player's diamonds.  Their attraction is their
uncertain new existence once they have been struck by a stone.

DRIFTING SAND (brown) - looks like normal sand.  Stones slowly slip through
the drifting sand or stick in it, if the further way is blocked. 
Disadvantageously, they are no longer visible.  Contrary to the amoebe, the
player cannot walk through the drifting sand.

KEYS - are necessary to pass the doors they belong to.  They possess the
colors red, yellow, green and blue.  Grey doors have the characteristic of
leaving the player uncertain about the key he needs.  If you play in
teamwork, every player requires his own key!  They can pass doors only when
the field behind the door is unoccupied.

DYNAMITE (red) - can be taken up by the player and put down at another
place (see above).  It serves the purpose of eliminating hindering walls or
opponents and can push back the amoebe.

AMOEBE (green) - spread themselves from a few starting fields; in time they
close in player and opponent.  Additionally, the amoebe is dangerous
because of the drops falling off from her.  There are some specific amoebes
that do not spread.  Flyer and bug explode when touching an amoebe.

RATTLE (blue) - a wall, which can be activated only once by an object
falling upon her. In that case it changes this object (stones into
smaragds, smaragds into diamonds and diamonds into stones), if only for a
short time.  To make this happen, the room under the rattle has to be
unoccupied.

TURNING WHEEL (orange) - is activated when getting into contact with a
player.  In consequence, robots are attracted by the wheel and not by the
player any longer.  Although this means has only a short effect it can be
activated several times.

POT OF ACID (green/orange) - everything falling into this pot will be
devoured, amoebes as well as stones, opponents or one's own figure.

EXIT (blue) - the exit door flashes as soon as the player has collected
enough smaragds to leave the level.  If you play in teamwork, each player
has to use a different exit.  With the joystick BUTTON you can return to
the main menu to start another level.
