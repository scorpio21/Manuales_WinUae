The Board 
~~~~~~~~~ 
The board consists of 32 colored squares formed by two spirals within a circle. 
There are 8 different colors each having 4 squares in view at any time. 
By rotating the spirals it is possible to change the visual position of the 
squares of each colors. 
 
The position of the squares of each color is called a pattern.  By  
rotating the spirals you will notice there are 4 patterns: the long spiral, 
the short spiral, the straight line, and the circle.  Also shown on the 
board is the player's status box.  This is used initially to indicate the 
number of counters to be placed by a player during setup and afterwards to 
indicate controlled colors that the player may capture during the course 
of the game.  The objective of the game is to get the required number of 
your counters onto the corresponding colored squares on the gameboard. 
 
The 2 Player Game 
================= 
 
The winner of the 2 player game is the person who manages to get 4 of his 
counters onto his color pattern on the board.  Each player starts with 6 
counters and takes his turn to place 1 piece at a time onto an unoccupied 
square on the board.  The player who is playing red makes the first move. 
The number of moves a player may make is determined by the highest number 
of their counters on any one color.  For example, if a player has 3 counters 
on gray, 2 counters on green, and one counter on orange, then they have 
3 moves available to them.  A move is made either by moving a players own 
counter to an adjacent square or by moving one of the spiral wheels  
clockwise or anticlockwise.  A player on their turn may move their counters  
and/or turn the wheel in any combination or direction up to the total number 
of moves allowed.  A player is not allowed to place a counter on an already 
occupied square, nor to jump over occupied squares.  The wheels can be moved 
in the clockwise or anticlockwise direction in steps.  It takes 16 steps to 
complete a revolution of the wheel and each step counts as one move.  If a 
player at any time during a move has 4 of his counters on any color other 
than their own, they are deemed to have control of that color and this will 
be indicated by the placing of a "control color" counter in the player's 
status box.  If before a player makes a move there are any of their opponent's 
counters lying on a player's "controlled color" they may, if they wish, move 
any or all of the offending counters to any unoccupied square on the board. 
 
The Game Variations 
 
The computer verison of the game "Eye" has various features and rule 
variations that are not included in the board game.   Selection of these 
is made by various screen prompts at the beginning of the game.  First you 
will be asked to enter a number relating to the number of moves made before 
a color change on the board occurs.  The color pairs that are swapped over 
are: pink with gray, and orange with mauve.  This input can be any number 
between 1 and 255, but by pressing ENTER a static board is selected.  During 
normal play a player will only be allowed to win the game or capture a color 
during their turn.  The next option allows you to do both at any time during 
the game.  Simply press the on-screen prompt key to select or reject this  
option.  Finally, there is an option that allows players to "steal" a 
captured color during the course of the game by placing the required number 
of counters on an already controlled color.  Again, simply press the on- 
screen prompt to accept or reject.
