   GAMEPLAY

   Elf is a clever mixture of Arcade and Arcade Adventure
   The object of the game is to search for two halves of a giant Golden
Pumpkin within 24 hours.
   The game is split between two games, the main game and a dice game
similar to a snakes and ladders concept.
   The Elf, having beeen banished toi the King`s Castle for his sins, has
been left unarmed, apart from an arrowless bow/arrow and without food/water.
   His quest is to be able to sustain life whilst searching for the pumpkin.
   To guard him against the hordes of bad tempered monsters, Elf must
collect his weapons and use them wisely.
   The King has given Elf temporary magical powers which amongst other
things will allow him to teleport to the Dice game. The King has placed
these Dice throughout his Castle and by accumulating these Dice points will
allow the Elf to start the game at a higher level. You can enter the Dice
game at any time (G) using an accumulated Dice. He can progress up the
screen for bonus points.
   A Password Scheme allows you to start the main game at a later sections
of the game at any time.
