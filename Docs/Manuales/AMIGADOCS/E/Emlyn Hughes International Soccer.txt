 This is one of the best soccergames that came out on the amiga so far
 The first thing you gotta do when you start the game is to select a team
 The following 8 teams are available : England, Scotland, Italy, Holland,
 Ireland, West-Germany, Brazil and France
 Go to the pulldown menu that sayz 'Edit Team',click at the top where it
 sayz 'Played by Computer' , and then type over the word computer your own
 name
 Edit as much teams as the number of players you want
 Exit by going to the top of the screen and click the right mouse button
 Click the X sign for cancel,the V sign for o.k. and the ? to cancel exit
 Now select Play match to play a match or if the match is not with your team 
 but computer to computer you can also press Play match to see the computer
 playing against itself or select 'Postpone match' to only display the 
 results of the computer to computer match
 Or if you dont want to see the computer playing click on 'View C. vs. C.'
 so an X sign appears and you wont see the computer playing against itself
 Or arrange a friendly match by clicking 'Arrange Friendly' and click the two
 teams that will play
