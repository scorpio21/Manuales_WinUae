SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE TEAMS TACTICS.

FOR EACH OF THE SET PIECE SITUATIONS YOU CAN CHANGE INDIVIDUAL PLAYER
POSITIONS DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU ARE ATTACKING (IE GOT THE BALL) OR
DEFENDING (YOU DONT HAVE THE BALL). THESE SITUATIONS INCLUDE KICK OFF, GOAL
KICK, LEFT CORNER AND RIGHT CORNER. TO MOVE A PLAYER CLICK ON THE NUMBER
REPRESENTING HIM AND THEN CLICK IN THE NEW POSITION. THAT PLAYER WILL NOW

IN ADDITION YOU CAN ALSO SELECT THE PLAYERS POSITION USING THE ZONAL
METHOD. WHEN THE EDITOR IS IN THIS MODE, YOU CAN CLICK ON ONE OF THE
COLOURED ZONE TO SELECT IT. THIS ZONE WILL PULSE AND THE PLAYERS POSITIONS
WILL CHANGE. THE POSITIONS THEY NOW OCCUPY ARE THE PREFERRED POSITIONS WHEN
THE BALL IS IN THE PULSATING ZONE. THESE POSITIONS CAN THEN BE ADJUSTED.

THERE ARE THREE WHITE NUMBERS IN CIRCLES DISPLAYED IN THE ZONES. THESE
NUMBERS REPRESENT THE PING PASS TARGETS, WITH THE NUMBER 1 BEING THE
PREFERRED POSITION. WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING THE GAME AND YOU USE PING PASS
THEN THE POSITION THE BALL WILL GO TO WILL DEPEND ON THE CURRENT ZONE.

WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE DURING PLAY
--------------------------------------

RADAR
AN OVERVIEW OF THE PITCH SHOWIN THE POSITION OF THE BALL AND THE PLAYERS
FROM BOTH TEAMS.PASSERS AND RECEVERS ARE ALSO SHOWN. THE SHADED ZONE
REPRESENTS THE PITCH IN VIEW ON THE SCREEN.

INFORMATION
A RUNNING COMMENTARY IS PROVIDED. HERE YOU ARE INFORMED WHICH PLAYER IS IN
POSSESSION OF THE BALL, WHICH PLAYERS ARE AVAILABLE TO RECEIVE AND THEIR
APPROXIMATE POSSITION ON THE PITCH, WHICH PLAYER HAS SCORED,PLUS FURTHER
DETAILS RELEVANT TO THE STATE OF PLAY.


CONTROLLING THE PLAYERS
-----------------------

YOU CAN CONTROL ANY PLAYER ON YOUR SIDE EXCEPT THE GOAL KEEPER ( THE
COMPUTER DOSE ITS BEST TO MAKE SAVES FOR YOU DEPENDING ON HIS ABILITY). IT
TAKES A LITTLE TIME TO GET USED TO THE CONTROL BUT ITS WORTH IT. THE
EASIEST WAY TO LEARNIS BY SELECTIN THE RACTICE MATCH OPTION. GO ON..TRY IT
THE PLAYER UNDER YOUR CONTROL IS DENOTED BY HIS SHIRT NUMBER APPERING ABOVE
HIS HEAD - WHEN HES NOT IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL. WHEN HES IN POSETION OF
THE BALL HE IS A PASSER AND AN ARROW IS SHOWN ABOVE HIS HEAD (AND THE DOT
REPRESENTING HIM ON THE RADAR). THE NUMBER OR ARROW IS EITHER WHITE OR
BLACK- WHITE FOR THE PLAYER WHOSE JOYSTICK IS PLUGGED INTO THE CONNECTOR
MARKED 2 JOYSTICK (AMIGA)


THE PLAYER DIRECTLY UNDER YOUR CONTROL IS NOT IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL AND
SO HIS SHIRT NUMBER IS SHOWN ABOVE HIS HEAD.
*PRESS THE FIRE BUTTION TO PERFORM A SLIDING TACKLE IF THE PLAYER UNDER
YOUR CONTROL IS NOT IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL.


THE PLAYER DIRECTLY UNDER YOUR CONTROL IS  IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL AND
SO  AN ARROW IS SHOWN ABOVE HIS HEAD.
*PUSH THE JOYSTICK SHAFT IN ANY DIRECTION TO MOVE THE PLAYER CURRENTLY
UNDER YOUR CONTROL.
*PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON TO PASS OR KICK THE BALL IF THE PLAYER UNDER YOUR
CONTROL IS IN POSSESSION OOF THE BALL. NOTE:THAT THE PASS OR KICK ONLY
HAPPENS WHEN THE FIRE BUTTON IS RELEASED.

ACTUALLY, THERE'S A LITTLE MORE TO IT THAN THAT..THERE ARE TWO MODES OF
PASSING: PING PASS AND POINT TO PASS.

PING PASS
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO TO PASS TO? THE PLAYER WITH A HALO ABOVE HIS HEAD IS
READY TO RECEIVE THE PASS. HE'S A -NO!-RECEIVER. THE ARROW ABOVE THE PASSER
SHOWS THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE RECEIVER. YOU WILL ALSO HEAR A PING!
SOUND ( HENCE PING PASS). THIS TELLS YOU THAT A RECEIVER HAS BEEN SELECTED.
TEXT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN INFORMS YOU OF THE NAME AMD GENERAL
POSITION OF THE CURRENT RECEIVER. AND! ON THE RADAR YOU CAN SEE THE DOT
REPRESENTING THE RECEIVER HAS A CIRCLE AROUND IT.

A PLAYER WITH A HALO ABOVE HIS HEAD IS A RECEIVER.

A QUICK TAP OF THE FIRE BUTTON WILL PASS THE BALL TO THE CURRENT RECEIVER
(REMEMBER: THE ARROW ABOVE THE PASSER'S HEAD SHOWS HIS GENERAL DIRECTION)
OR - IF NO RECEIVER HAS BEEN PING!ED- THE DIRECTION THE PASSER WAS FACING.

A LONGER PRESS OF THE FIRE BUTTON HAS A DIFFERENT EFFECT..

POINT TO PASS
WHEN YOU STOP PUSHING THE JOYSTICK IN A DIRECTION -I.E.,IT'S CENTRAL THE
PLAYER DIRECTLY UNDER YOUR CONTROL CONTINUES TO RUN.

*PRESS AND HOLD THE FIRE BUTTON.

*PUSH THE JOYSTICK SHAFT IN THE DIRECTION YOU WISH TO PASS THE BALL.

THE ARROW ABOVE THE PASSERS HEAD WILL POINT ACCORDINGLY.
 
THE PASS WILL THEN BE MADE TO THE PLAYER YOU HAVE SELECTED.

SHOOT
WHEN THE JOYSTICK SHAFT IS NOT CENTRAL AND THE FIRE BUTTON IS PRESSED AND
HELD A SMALL CROSSHAIR WILL APPEAR ON THE PITCH (AND ON THE RADAR) AND
THEPLAYER UNDER YOUR CONTROL IS READY TO KICK THE BALL. THE CROSSHAIR
DOESNT HANG AROUND. IT ZOOMS OFF AWAY FROM THE PLAYER AND IN THE DIRECTION
YOU PUSH THE JOYSTICK SHAFT.

WHEN THE FIRE BUTTON IS RELEASED THE BALL WILL BE KICKED IN THE DIRECTION
OF THE CROSSHAIR (AS SHOWN BY THE ARROW ABOVE THE PLAYER). THE LONGER THE
FIRE BUTTON IS HELD, THE STRONGER THE KICK. THE POSITON OF THE JOYSTICK
SHAFT WHEN THE SHOT IS TAKEN DETERMINES WHETHER THE BALL IS KICKED HIGH OR
LOW OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.

*PUSH THE JOYSTICKSHAFT IN A FORWARD DIRECTION THEN RELEASE THE FIRE BUTTON
TO KICK THE BALL ALONG THE GROUND.
 
*PUSH THE JOYSTICKSHAFT IN A BACKWARD DIRECTION THEN RELEASE THE FIRE BUTTON
TO KICK THE BALL HIGH.

*PUSH THE JOYSTICK LEFT OR RIGHT OR SIMPLY LEAVE IT IN A CENTRAL POSITION
TO KICK THE BALL WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LIFT.

YOU CAN ALSO USE THE SHOOT MODE TO DIRECT THE PASS TO ANOTHER PLAYER. IF
YOU HAVE THE JOYSTICK SHAFT PUSHED IN A FORWARD DIRECTION. AND HOLD THE
FIRE BUTTON DOWN THE CURSOR WILL APPEAR AS IN THE ABOVE MODE. YOU CAM MOVE
THIS CURSORS AND WHEN YOU RELEASE THE BUTTON THE BALL WILL BE KICKED
TOWARDS THE CURSORS CURRENT POSITION.

THERE IS A BUILT IN AUTOSHOT FEATURE. IF YOU PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON WHEN THE
BALL IS TRAVELLING FRON ONE PLAYERTO ANOTHER, AS SOON AS THE RECEIVER
RECEIVES THE BALL HE WILL SHOOT FOR GOAL IF HE IS IN A SUITABLE POSITION.
YOU CAN USE THIS TO SET UP SOME STUNNING GOALS AND REALLY GIVE THE
OPPOSITION A TOUGH TIME.

NOW THIS MAY ALL SOUND A LITTLE OVER-COMPLICATED, BUT WITH A LITTLE
PRACTICE IT SOON BECOMES SECOND-NATURE AND THE BENEFITS ARE CLEAR.

THROW IN! CORNER!
YOU DONT ACTUALLY GET TO TAKE THROW-INS AND CORNER DIRECTLY. A COMPUTER-
CONTROLLED PLAYER WILL ALWAYS AIM TO THROW OR KICK THE BALL TO THE PLAYER
UNDER YOUR CONTROL. THERE WILL BE A SHORT DELAY BEFORE THE THROW OR KICK
UNLESS YOU PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON TO MAKE THE PLAYER THROW THE BALL.

FREE KICK!
AFTER A FOUL,IF THE JOYSTICK SHAFT IS NOT CENTRED WHEN THE FIRE BUTTON IS
PRESSED THEN A COMPUTER CONTROLLED PLAYER WILL TAKE THE FREE KICK. IF THE
PLAYER YOU CONTROL REMAINS STILL, THE COMPUTER CONTROLLED PLAYER WILL SHOOT
IF THERES A CHANCE TO SCORE OTHERWISE HE WILL PERFORM A PASS. IF THE
JOYSTICK SHAFT IS CENTRED WHEN THE BUTTON IS PRESSES, YOU TAKE THE FREE
KICK. A CROSSHAIR WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN (AND THE RADAR). SIMPLY MOVE
THE JOYSTICK SHAFT IN THE DIRECTION YOU WISH TO KICK THE BALL THEN PRESS
THE FIRE BUTTON. THE LONGER THE BUTTON IS HELD , THE STRONGER THE KICK.
NOTE THAT IF THE FREE KICK IS DIRECT, THE OPPOSING TEAMS PLAYERS WILL
AUTOMATICALLY FORM A WALL. THIS IS SIMILAR TO USING THE CURSORMODE TO MAKE
A PASS.

PENALTY!
THE PENALTY KICK IS DIRECTED WITH A CROSSHAIR LIKE THE ONE USED TO SHOOT
DURING PLAY. ONLY THIS ONE MOVES A LITTLE SLOWER. NOTE THAT YOU DO NOT GET
TO CONTROL THE KEEPER EVEN AT THIS STAGE.

THE PHRASES CROSSHAIR AND CURSOR MODE BOTH REFER TO THE SAME THING.
THE LENGTH OF THE REPLAY FILE IS DEPENDENT ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE
ACTUAL SEGMENT THAT IS BEING RAPLAYED, AND NOT THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY IN YOUR
COMPUTER. ON AVERAGE YOU SHOULD GET 4O SECONDS WORTH OF REPLAY.
PRESSING `R' DURING A SHOW HAS NO EFFECT. PRESS THE ESC KEY.
