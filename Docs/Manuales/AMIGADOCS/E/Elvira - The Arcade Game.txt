OVERVIEW.
---------
ELVIRA THE BUXOM BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT,LIVES IN A TYPICAL AMERICAN 1900 COLONIAL
HOUSE ALL DECKED OUT IN THE MOST TASTEFUL DECOR YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE. THE
WALLS ARE A NICE SHADE OF BLACK,THE CEILINGS DRIP WITH SILKY COBWEBS AND THE
OCCUPANTS ARE STRANGE TO SAY THE LEAST.

THE ROOMS SMELL MUSTY WITH A HINT OF BURNT SOCKS,OR IS IT INCENSE?.THE
FURNITURE LOOKS AS THOUGH IT HAS COME FROM ANOTHER WORLD,RED LEATHER SUITE,A
SILVER METALLIC TABLE,WITH MATCHING ELEPHANT TUSK CHAIRS,IF ITS COMFORT YOU
WANT YOU`VE HAVE`NT COME THE RIGHT PLACE. THE CHOICE OF MUSIC IS WEIRD,EVEN BY
HEAVY METAL STANDARDS(NOT THE TYPE OF MUSIC TO IMPRESS FUTURE MOTHER IN LAWS!)
NOT THAT ELVIRA HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OR THE NEED TO IMPRESS ANYBODY. IT IS
JUST AS WELL THAT THE LADY HAS `LARGE` ASSETS(WE MEAN HER HOUSE OF COURSE!` AND
ANY OTHER VALUABLE BELONGINGS,IF YOU GET THE DRIFT.

ELVIRA ALWAYS HAD A BURNING AMBITION TO GO BACK IN TIME AND CHECK OUT HER
ANCESTORS. ONE EVENING AFTER A FEW DRINKS SHE FELL ASLEEP IN HER THREE POSTER
BED,THE FOURTH HAVING BEEN `BREAKFAST,LUCH AND TEA FOR A LARGE AND HUNGRY
FAMILY OF TERMITES` THAT NIGHT THERE WAS AN ALMIGHTY STORM,THE WIND BLEW,THE
RAIN LASHED DOWN AND THE LIGHTNING STREAKED ACROSS THE SKY LIGHTING UP THE
WHOLE HOUSE.IT WAS ENOUGH TO AWAKEN THE DEAD AND THATS EXACTLY WHAT IT DID.

ELVIRA WOKE WITH A START,NOT SURE WETHER IT WAS THE DRINK FROM EARLIER ON OR
WHAT. AT THE BOTTOM OF HER BED STOOD A GHOSTLY FIGURE DRESSED IN A HIGHLY REGAL
AND COLOURFUL ROBE. THE CHARACTER BECKONED TO ELVIRA TO JOIN HIM DOWNSTAIRS IN
THE STUDY. ELVIRA WAS GLAD TO DO SO,ALTHOUGH IN HER OWN WORDS SHE SAID `ITS NOT
VERY OFTEWN I GET OUT OF A BED FOR A MAN`.

IN THE STUDY THE OLD MAN TOLD ELVIRA THAT HE WAS AN ANCESTOR SHE HAD BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IN HER DREAMS AND THAT HE WANTED HER TO HAVE WHAT WAS RIGHTLY
HERS. `FIRSTLY THOUGH I WANT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF,MY NAME IS KING GUSTAV OF
TRANSLVANIA`. THE KING WENT ON TO TELL THE RATHER BEMUSED ELVIRA THAT HE OWNED
A BEAUTIFUL CASTLE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE,WHICH HAD NOT BEEN PASSED DOWN THROUGH
THE FAMILY AS HIS ONE AND ONLY HEIRESS `LADY PLAIN JANE` HAD NEVER MARRIED.
THIS WAS DUE TO HER RATHER DOWDY LOOKS,AND SO WHEN SHE DIED THE CASTLE BECAME
VACANT.APART FROM A FEW INTERESTING INHABITANTS THAT IS. THE KING WENT ON TO
SAY THAT IF SHE HAD THE STAMINA AND COULD SHOW HIM WHAT SHE WAS MADE OF,HE
WOULD HAND THE CASTLE DOWN TO HER AND HER GENERATIONS(IF SHE COULD FIND A
SUITABLE HUSBAND OF COURSE WHO WAS WILLING TO SHARE HER ASSETS)

KING GUSTAV SHOWED HER 2 GLOBES WHICH STOOD THROBBING IN THE GLOOMY LIGHT. THIS
WAS WHERE HER CHALLENGE WAS TO START, THE CHOICE WAS HERS. THE GLOBES
REPRESENTED 2 WORLDS THAT THE KING HAD INHABITED IN PAST LIVES.
ONE WAS THE FROZEN `ARTIC EARTH` WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE,AN
UNDERWORLD OF FIRE. BOTH OF THESE HOSTILE ENVIROMENTS HAVE TO BE
CONQUERED,BEFORE ELVIRA CAN ENTER THE CASTLE,FIND THE KING AND CLAIM HER THRONE
AND YOU`VE GUESSED IT,BE CROWNED `QUEEN ELVIRA OF TRANSLYVANIA` NOT A BAD TITLE
EH?..HUH

SO WITHOUT ANY MORE DELAY LET`S HELP ELVIRA GAT WHATS RIGHTLY HERS.

SPELLS AND EFFECTS.
-------------------
A SPELL MUST BE COLLECTED FROM VARIOUS LOCATIONS AROUND EACH WORLD.ONCE
COLLECTED,A SPELL CAN BE PUT INTO ACTION(SEE CONTROLS) SOME OF THE SPELLS HAVE
A LIMITED TIME IN WHICH THEY CAN BE USED,SO THE CASTING OF THE SPELL MUST BE
WISELY DONE.A COLLECTED SPELL CAN ONLY BE USED ONCE,HENCE IT IS IMPORTANT TO
USE IT CORRECTLY TO OVERCOME A PARTICULAR SITUATION.

A SPELL CAN BE EXCHANGED IN THE GAME WHEN THE TRADER IS ENCOUNTERED.IT IS YOUR
DECISION AS TO WETHER OR NOT YOU TRADE THE SPELL YOU HOLD,WITH ONE THE TRADER
HAS IN HIS COLLECTION,BEFORE CONTINUING YOUR QUEST.

THE SPELLS.

AGAINST HITS FROM MONSTERS.

USED.THUS THIS SPELL IS NEVER ACTUALLY `CAST` AND REMAINS WITH YOU UNTIL THE
END OF THE PARTICULAR WORLD IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN COLLECTED.

NOT A TIMED SPELL BUT WILL BE LOST WHEN A NEW WEAPON IS COLLECTED.
