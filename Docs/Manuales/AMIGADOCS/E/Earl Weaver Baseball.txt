Pitching --->
-------------
Pitch wildly but fast - hit the button like crazy
Pitch a slider - when pitching hold the joystick down while holding down
                 the joystick button (or mouse)
Pitch a high one - when pitching hold the joystick up while holding down
                   the joystick/mouse button
Pitch a curve right - when pitching do the normal junk, but just before
                      you let go push right
Pitch a curve left - same as above but push the joystick left just
                     before you let go
Pitch a knuckle ball (i am pretty sure) - when pitching do the normal
                                          shit, but just before you
                                          let go hit the joystick/mouse
                                          button fast.
Hitting the ball
----------------
It is pretty self-explantory, but if you want to hit (ie: a inside curve)
you must push the button and move the joystick in the direction of the
ball.
