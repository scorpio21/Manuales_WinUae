You, the brave Cornelius, must rescue your girlfriend Elisa who has 
been abducted by `Necrilous the Not Very Nice'. To do this you must
travel trough eight levels of Forest, Ruins, Lake, Swamp, Caves, 
Mountains, and two halves of Castle. You must finally locate and
destroy the winching mechanism that are lowering your loved one 
into a large bubbling vat and then do battle with Necrilous himself.                                                         
    On your journey you will find many useful objects scattered about
the landscape. Use these to the best of your abilities. Herbs and 
Pets, when collected, will allow you to purchase pieces of equipment
from the numerous shops.                                            
    Slaying an end of level guardian will give you a green crystal 
- use these to gain Necrilous' chamber. 
Good luck Cornelius - you''re gonna need it!
