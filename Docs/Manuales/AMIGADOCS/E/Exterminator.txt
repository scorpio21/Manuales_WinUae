EXTERMINATOR

  It was a summers day in a quiet street in a leafy Chicago suburb. Suddenly
  the tranquility was disturbed by a piercing scream: "Help me! " The houses 
  were infested with mutant insects and crazy cans - even the toy tanks 
  had come to life! This wasn`t a job for just any pest controll man - it was
  a job for the EXTERMINATOR!!

HOW TO PLAY

  You must travel from room to room, and house to house, ridding the 
  neighburhood of a plague of perculiar pests. At the top of the screen is a 
  display which shows your juice meter, your score and which house you are 
  currently working in.

  To complete a room and move on to the next you must change all of the tiles
  in one lane to your colour. If you complete all the houses you will face 
  the Ultimate Challenge, with a 500,000 point bonus prize. The game ends when
  you`re out of juice and all your credits are used up.

CONTROLS

  The game is played using a joystick. Fire button to begin new game. For two 
  players both should press their fire buttons.

MOVING

  Use the joystick to move the hand around the screen in any direction.

GRABBING

  Grab enemies IN FRONT of your hand by pressing the fire button. Don`t grab
  the wasp! Gain extra juice by grabbing the glowing dodecahedron or bombs
  before they explode.

POUNDING

  Pound enemies on the ground by moving the joystick down, and pressing the
  firebutton simultaneosly. You can`t pound if you are too close to  the floor.

SHOOTING

  Shoot enemies in the distance by moving your hand all the way over to your
  side of the screen and pressing the fire button. While shooting aim the
  bullets by moving the joystick. To move away from the side of the screen
  release the fire button, then move the joystick.

SHAKING

  Move the joystick rapidly in a circular direction to shake your hand and
  frighten away the wasp.

HINTS & TIPS

  - get the juice bottle before it gets you!
