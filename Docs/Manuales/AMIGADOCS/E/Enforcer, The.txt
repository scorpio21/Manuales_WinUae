                            ** THE ENFORCER ** 

 
In the silent hours of the night, the Knights in Blue patrol the streets.  The
city can be evil.  Yours is the task to be prepared, to be ready for anything
misfortune can throw your way.  Splitsecond decisions are forced upon you.  Can
YOU handle it?  Yes, cause you're the KNIGHT in BLUE, the ENFORCER.
 
Object of the game:  shoot the bad guys as quickly and as many as possible.  You
can recognize a bad guy because he is holding a weapon.  If you hit an innocent
man your status will be gone.  Cars will pass at the bottom side of your screen;
try to hit them and you will get bonus points, but do not shoot police cars.
Sometimes a target will pass at the top of your screen; shoot at it to collect
extra ammunition.  Watch your time (T), energy (E), and status (S) closely.
 
Composing a Weapon:  one of the lessons you get.  The weapons in the green areas
are examples; in the white area you can make your own weapon.  You will get less
bullets for the next screen when your weapon is badly composed.
Firebutton/spacebar = place this part of the weapon in the white area.
 
Catching bullets:  move your pistol left/right to catch as many bullets as
possible, usable at the next screen.  Watch it:  purple bullets end the lesson.
 
The street:  learn at the academy, put it into practice!  But beware, some
"innocents" may turn out to be criminals!
