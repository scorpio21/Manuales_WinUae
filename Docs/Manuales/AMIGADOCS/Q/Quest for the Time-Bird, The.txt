HOW TO SUCCEED IN THE QUEST.

IT IS NOT AN UNCOMMON SIGHT TO FIND AN ADVENTURE-GAME PLAYER SAT IN
FRONT OF THEIR SCREEN HOPELESSLY STUCK!.BUT WHY?.SEVERAL FACTORS 
CONTRIBUTE TO THIS UNHAPPY STATE OF AFFAIRS.SOMETIMES THE SITUATION
REQUIRES A WEIRD IF NOT DOWNRIGHT ILLOGICAL SOLUTION,OTHERS MUST BE
PLAYED BY TYPING IN ORDERS,AND MOST OF THEM FEATURE A BEWILDERING
ARRAY OF ICONS.THE END RESULT IS THAT MANY PLAYERS GIVE UP AND GRAB
THEIR JOYSTICKS FOR A QUICK "BLAST EM UP" ACTION GAME,JUST TO WORK
OFF SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION!.
INFROGRAMES HAS DESIGNED THIS QUEST FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO
"PLAY".WHETHER YOU ARE NEW TO ADVENTURE-GAMING,OR A HARDENED VETERAN
THIS GAME WAS MADE SPECIALLY FOR YOU.YOU WILL FIND THAT IT ADAPTS
PERFECTLY TO YOUR STYLE OF PLAY.IF YOU LIKE A "FREINDLY" LEVEL OF
DIFFICULTY THEN NO PROBLEM.LOOKING FOR A TOUGH CHALLENGE THEN YOU GOT
IT!.YOU CHOOSE AND ENJOY.

THE BEGINNER:

YOU CAN WANDER FROM ONE MODULE TO ANOTHER,ADMIRING THE BEAUTIFUL 
SCENERY,SOAKING UP THE ATMOSPHERE AND GETTING TO KNOW THE VARIOUS
CHARACTERS.TAKE TIME TO TRY OUT THE VARIOUS OPTIONS.YOU WILL SOON
NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARCHES (LANDS) OF THE WORLD OF
AKBAR.GRADUALLY AS TIME PASSES (AND WE WISH YOU MANY HOURS OF
ENCHANTMENT IN THE QUEST) YOU WILL GATHER THE ELEMENTS "MARA" NEEDS 
FOR HER INCANTATION.OUR ADVICE TO BEGINNERS IS TO AVOID GOING DIRECTLY
TO THE GAPING LANDS OR THE SAND LIPS.THE THOUSAND GREENS IS A GOOD
PLACE TO START.

THE EXPERIENCED PLAYER:

ANYWHERE IS A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN.YOU WILL SOON DISCOVER THAT WHILE
THE GAMES HEROES CAN DO THE SAME THINGS,ITS ADVISABLE TO CHOOSE THE
MOST APPROPRIATE CHARACTER FOR A GIVEN SITUATION.
FOR EXAMPLE: THE UNKNOWN KNIGHT IS NOT THE BEST CHOICE WHEN IT COMES
TO BATTLING THE MIGHTY ENEMIES AND FEARSOME MONSTERS!.BRAGON SHOULD 
BE EXPECTED TO TAKE CARE OF EVERY DANGER,LOSING HIM RECKLESSLY COULD
COMPLICATE MATTERS CONSIDERABLY!.ROXANNA SHOULD BE KEPT CLEAR OF
UTTERLY DESPERATE SITUATIONS,OTHERWISE HER MOTHER "MARA" WILL REACT
STRONGLY.
HAVING MASTERED THE MOST JUDICIOUS USE OF YOUR HEROES,YOU WILL BEGIN
TO GATHER THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS REQUIRED BY MARA.HOWEVER THERE IS ONE 
MORE OBSTACLE FACING YOU!.TIME!.REMEMBER 9 DAYS IS ALL YOU HAVE TO
SUCCEED IN YOUR QUEST.

THE EXPERT:

DONT FORGET THAT TIME IS LIMITED.HOW FAST CAN YOU FINISH THE QUEST?.
WHY NOT TRY PLAYING WITH JUST 3 HEROES,THEN 2?.AND FINALLY CAN YOU
MANAGE THE QUEST ON YOUR OWN?.

EACH PLAYER WILL DISCOVER THAT MANY SOLUTIONS ARE POSSIBLE.REMEMBER
THAT PLAYING A SECOND TIME WITH EXACTLY THE SAME SET OF ACTIONS,WILL
NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO SUCCESS!.AKBAR IS A LIVING WORLD WHERE THE
SAME ACTIONS DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME RESULTS!.YOU WILL FIND OUT!.

  FOR THE FIRST EVER IN THE HISTORY OF COMPUTER GAMES INFOGRAMES 
  GIVES YOU,THE LESS EXPERIENCED PLAYERS,THE SOLUTION TO ONE OF THE
  MARCHES.SOME CLUES ARE ALSO GIVEN FOR A SECOND MARCH.YOU ARE FREE
  TO READ THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE OR SKIP IT,AS YOU LIKE.PERHAPS YOU
  WOULD LIKE TO TRY BY YOURSELF FIRST?.

SOLUTION FOR THE MARCH OF A THOUSAND GREENS:

THIS IS THE DOMAIN OF THE WIZARD-PRINCE BODIAS.AS YOU WILL SOON 
DISCOVER IT IS THE "PARADISE" OF THE WORLD OF AKBAR.IT IS FAMED FOR
THE BEAUTY OF ITS COUNTRYSIDE.THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THIS MARCH LIVE IN
HARMONY WITH NATURE,ESPECIALLY THE MAGNIFICENT FOREST.THEIR WAYS ARE
PEACEFUL AND THEY WILL NEVER ATTACK OUR HEROES UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

A GUIDE FOR THE PLAYER:

DO NOT ATTACK THE GENTLE FOLK OF THE GREEN MARCH,OTHERWISE THEY WILL
HIDE FROM YOU FOR AS LONG AS YOU REMAIN IN THEIR DOMAIN.YOU WILL,IN
THAT CASE ,ONLY BE ABLE TO MEET THE OLD ONES OF THE WOODS.DO NOT 
ATTACK THEM EITHER.TALK TO THEM TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE VARIOUS 
INHABITANTS OF AKBAR.
SHOULD THE UNKNOWN KNIGHT OR ROXANNA CHARM ANYONE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX
THEY WILL QUIT THE QUEST.THE LURE OF BLISSFUL LOVE IN THIS GREEN
PARADISE IS IRRESISTIBLE.THESE 2 HEROES CAN ALL TOO EASILY FALL UNDER
THE AMOROUS SPELL AND BECOME UNAVAILABLE FOR THE REST OF THE QUEST.
BRAGON WILL ALSO LEAVE THE GROUP FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD,IF HE CHARMS
ANY "ONDINES".IN THAT EVENT ,THE OTHERS WILL HAVE TO STAY WHERE THEY 
ARE AND AWAIT HIS RETURN.IF YOU LEAVE WITHOUT HIM,THEN BRAGON WILL BE
ABANDONED IN THE THOUSAND GREENS AND WILL BE LOST TO THE GROUP FOR 
THE REST OF THE QUEST.
IF YOU SPEAK WITH THE INHABITANTS,THEY WILL OFFER YOU REST OR REFRESH
MENT.IF YOU CHOOSE TO REST,THEN YOUR HEROES WILL BE ABSENT THEMSELVES 
FOR A SHORT WHILE.DO NOT FORGET,THOUGH,THAT TIME MOVES ON EVEN WHEN
YOUR HEROES TAKE A BREAK!.
WHEN YOU MEET BODIAS,AVOID ATTACKING HIM.IF YOU ATTACK HIM HE WILL 
DIE.AND THE FOREST,IN PERFECT SYMBIOSIS WITH THE WIZARD-PRINCE WILL
ALSO PERISH.THE MARCH OF A THOUSAND GREENS WILL BURN AND YOU WILL
MEET NOBODY AT ALL!.
ROXANNA MUST NOT CHARM BODIAS,MORE THAN ONCE OR HE WILL BELIEVE SHE IS
HIS DAUGHTER AND ESCAPE WITH HER,LEAVING THE GROUP WITHOUT HER
PRECIOUS PRESENCE.

THE REALM OF A THOUSAND DREAMS.
