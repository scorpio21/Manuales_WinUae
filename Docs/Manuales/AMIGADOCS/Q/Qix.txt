HOW TO PLAY
   The QIX is an evil and terrifying computer virus. Nobody knows where
   it comes from. Your mission: immunize the system against this insidious
   infection! But the QIX is intelligent: it learns from its mistakes. It
   also breeds lethal subviruses that can quickly spread and infect your system.
QIX Characters
These infections are running rampant in your computer:

   Each player starts with four lives. Fill in sections of computer
   memory without becoming infected. A level is completed when the required
   section of memory is immunized against the QIX. For example, you must
   immunize 65 percent of level one in advance to level two. The percentage
   increases as you progress.
  A life is lost if the QIX touches an incomplete line, or if the
   marker is attacked by a FUSE, SPARX, or SPRITZ.
STATUS AND SCORING
   The status panel on the right side of the screen shows the current
   number of lives, required claim, completed claim, and current level. The
   SPARX timer is a red line located above the game screen. It begins to
   shrink during play. Two SPARX are created each time the line disappears.
  Player scores are located at the top of the screen. Points are
   awarded for each filled section of memory. A SLOW draw earns twice as
   many points as a FAST draw. A player earns 1,000 bonus points for each
   percent over the required goal.
  Trapping a SPRITZ virus inside a filled section is worth 500 points.
   All FAST fills will now generate SLOW points until you die. Splitting
   two QIX from each other multiplies the point value for each new FAST
   and SLOW fill. An extra life is awarded every 50,000 points.
High Score Screen
  The computer will ask for your initials when the current game is
   over. Move the joystick up or down to select a letter. Press the FIRE
   button to confirm your choice.
HINTS AND TIPS
   - QIX has no time limit; don't try and rush through a level.
   - Build walls to guide the QIX into a position where you can trap it.
   - Try and split a pair of QIX as often as you can; your score will multiply.
   - Keep moving; the SPARX are always looking for you.
   - Second guessing the QIX isn't recommended.
Sometimes you have to say... What the fuck!!!
