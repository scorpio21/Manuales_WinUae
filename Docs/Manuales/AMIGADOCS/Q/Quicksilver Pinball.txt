                      Quiksilver Pinball Simulator

                         Amiga Manual Addendum

                  And     Instruction Manual!      

1) Starting The Game    

   For Amiga users, when your computer asks for Workbench, insert your
   Pinball diskette.  The program will automatically boot up for you.

2) Top Ten Pinball Wizards

   The display is for the top ten all-time scores for that game.
   (there are 4 sets of top ten scores).

3) Controlling Game Play

   Ball English, for this game is the effect of bumping or shaking
   the pinball machine left, right, or bumping the machine up and down.
   This will cause the pinball board to move under the ball.  This
   effect has been simulated for you in this game, and called: Ball
   English.

   When using a joystick for the Amiga, the proper way to achieve Ball
   English is to hold down the fire button and (at the same time) move
   the stick in the direction of the shake (left, right, or UP).

    Shaking UP with the keyboard is accomplished by using either
    Amiga key (or as described above for joystick).

4) Mars Mission

   (third from the last circuit)

   Mars will remain active for a short period of time (not until the
   ball is lost).

SPECIAL NOTICE TO AMIGA OWNERS

   There will be additional Pinball boards available soon.  So be sure
   to send in your registration cards so that we can make you aware of
   them as they become available!

the joystick left and right to scroll the options that correspond to
each item.  The option that is displayed in the window is the currently
selected option.

the left and right arrow keys to scroll the options that correspond
to each item.  The option that is displayd in the window is the
currently selected option.

CONTROLLING GAME PLAY

With the Joystick

Move the joystick down to control the plunger.  Move the joystick left
and right to control the flippers.  Use the fire button in conjunction
with moving the joystick left or right for ball English.

With the Keyboard

Use the down arrow to control the plunger.  Use the shift keys to
control the flippers.  The right shift key is located just to the
right of the "?" key; the left shift key is located just to the left of
"Z" key.  Use the ALT keys for ball English.

BALL ENGLISH and TILT

Quiksilver Pinball Simulator is so real that it even lets you simulate
tilting, shaking, and bumping the game board to control ball
movement, just like a real arcade pinball machine.  If the player
applies too much ball English he tilts the machine and loses the ball.

With the Joystick

To tilt the machine with the joystick, move the joystick either left
or right and then press the fire button.  Holding down the fire button
will increase the amount of ball English.  Letting go of the button
releases the stored energy.  Holding down the fire button too long
will tilt the game and lose the ball.

With the Keyboard

To tilt the machine with the keyboard, use the ALT keys.  The right
ALT key tilts the game board to the right; the left ALT keys tilts the
game board to the left.  Holding down an ALT key will increase the
amount of ball English.  Letting go of the key will release the
stored energy.  Holding down the ALT key too long will tilt the game
and lose the ball.

SCORING

POINTS

Points are accumulated by doing just about anything.  Hitting a
bumper, activating a drop target, or rolling over a rollover will
add to the regular score.

BONUS POINTS

Bonus points are accumulated by accomplishing more difficult tricks.
Completing a circuit or hitting a special target can gather bonus
points.  These bonus points are kept track of under the Bonus counter.

The advantage of bonus points is that they are worth more than their face
value because they are multiplied by the multiplier factor before its
added to your regular points.

Bonus Points x Multiplier = Total Bonus Score for that ball.

SPINNER BONUS

Activating a spinner, or another target with a spinner bonus, will
cause the regular points to spin upwards for several seconds.

ROLLOVERS

Rollovers are the flat, circular targets on the game board, labeled
by either letters or numbers.  Rolling the ball over these targets
will activate them for bonus points.
