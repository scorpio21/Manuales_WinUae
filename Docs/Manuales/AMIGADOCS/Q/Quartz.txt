GAME CONTROLS
 QUARTZ is played with a joystick plugged into the joystick port.
A number of keys are also used:

 P................................................................Pause
 F1-F6.......................................................Select pod
 Delete.......................................................Trash pod
 L...........................................Score for next extra lives
 Return..................................................Use smart bomb
 O (on title screen).................................Adjust level types

 If you prefer, the <Spacebar> can be used with the joystick to select
the pod required, rather than using the function keys.

PLAYING THE GAME
 The action takes place in the lattice layers of a crystal, flying your
ship through a cloud of sub-atomic particles. Eventually life forms
detect your presence and drag your ship away. Blast through the
scrolling section and then destroy the end-alien to escape back to the
lattice.
 Each level consists of a lattice level followed by a scrolling level.
Use the LATTICE LEVEL to build POWER UPS for the scrolling section.
 Any time you die on a scrolling level you may escape back to the
Lattice to try and re-equip your ship. When you die, no power ups are
lost EXCEPT any multiples.
 These will be used as SHIELDS allowing you to live a little longer.
YOUR LAST LIFE.....
 On your last ship, any available Pods will be trashed in exchange for
energy diverted to the shields, giving you one last chance to survive.
(You can deliberately trash an item during play by pressing the DELETE
key).
 Lives are given for scoring points (and in some other ways...?)


AVAILABLE POWER UPS

Speed.............Speed up (up to 2 are effective. Has no effect in the
........................................................ Lattice level)
Extra.........Multiples (On Lattice Level this acts as an extra shield)
Armor.....................................This acts as protective armor
Flame...................................................A flame thrower
Grenade........................A grenade launcher (launches 6 grenades)
Octogun....................................................8 way firing
Bomb..................3 smart bombs (they destroy everything on screen)
Pod........................Adds a new weapon pod (up to 6 pods allowed)
Repair...................Adds shield energy (up to 1/2 energy replaced)
Amplify..........Improves efficiency of matter synthesiser (leaves some
.....................neutrinos in the tubes after a power up is chosen)
Record.............Records the current level number and power ups. (You
..............................can restart at this level on later games)


YOUR SHIP

Your ship comes with following equipment:

1:REGENERATING SHIELD.
2:MATTER SYNTHESISER.
 This creates Power Ups from raw neutrinos. These are released from
destroyed quarks or particles in the lattice levels or from destroyed
aliens. Neutrinos come in 3 colours. Collect them in the neutrino
tubes. When critical density is reached (when the 3 tubes are full of
neutrinos), the synthesiser will convert them into a power up. You have
a limited time to choose a power up (push the joystick up or down to go
through the available power ups).

3:EQUIPMENT PODS.
 Pods hold the power ups. Each pod has a small energy store. The
contents of each pod disappear when the energy is exhausted. Each pod
is numbered and can be switched on or off via the function keys or
joystick (not all power ups can be switched). In addition slots can be
'trashed'. This transfers their energy to the shield.


THE SCREEN

The Big Middle Screen:
This screen is where the action occurs!

The Little Screens in The Left Side called: PODS
You start the game with three pods. Next to each pod is an energy
indicator. When this runs out, the power up in that pod will be
exhausted.

Shield Energy:
This shows how many lives you have left (including the life you are
currently using).

Neutrino Tubes:
The collected neutrinos will appear in these tubes. When all three
tubes are full, you will be able to select a new power up.

Your Score:
This shows your current score!
