                            4 X 4 OFF-ROAD RACING

READY TO ROLL

Gear up and get ready, cause this is rough and tumble, off-road racing at
its grittiest.

You'll start by choosing from four torturous courses. Brave the rugged
Baja. Belt through the sweltering Death Valley. Go "bogging" in the
mudflats of  Georgia. Or take on the treachery of Michigan in the winter.

Once you've settled on a course, you pick your rig. Choose between a big
American beast, a classic pick-up, a Japanese import or a British military
vehicle. Your choice MIGHT be determined by the terrain you're going to be
traveling through. But then again, it might not.

Once you get your new 4 X 4 out of the showroom, bring it over to AUTOPARTS
row. It;s here that you'll make it ALL YOURS. Give it bigger and better
tires. Build in more power. And equip it with all the extras you'll need to
get past the finish line.

Finally - when you're sure that it's all just perfect - you're ready to put
your 4 X 4 to the true test: The Race. But it won't be all that easy.
There'll be armies of obstacles along the way. Dodge'em. Or use'em to make
your rig airborne. There'll be rivers to cross. Ice patches to maneuver.
And quick-sinking mud to worm your way out of. Plus there's the
competition: the other racers. And some of them are downright impolite -
and that's putting it politely.

So get it in gear, bud. And get your 4 X 4 on the off-road. To victory.

Pick your own Torture Test

Once the loading sequence is complete, press the FIRE BUTTON to view the
SELECT TERRAIN and SELECT LEVEL screen. It is here that you determine just
WHERE it is you plan to punish your customized super rig.

Select Terrain

Choose between four types of treacherous terrain. Each has its own breed of
excitement and challenge. To select one of the four areas, move the
joystick FORWARD or BACK to highlight the TERRAIN of your choice. Then move
the joystick RIGHT or LEFT to select your LEVEL.

 1) BAJA - 1,000 miles of the roughest, toughest, survival tests on earth.
    From dry dusty desert and caked, crusty lake beds to boulder-stewn 
    mountain plateaus. Take it head on - if you can.

 2) DEATH VALLEY - They don't call it what they call it for nothing. This
    treacherous desert terrain will rip your spirit as harshly as it rips
    into your truck. So try and keep your cool. No matter how hot things
    get.

 3) GEORGIA - If you like mudbogging, you're going to go for this trip in a
    big way. Mile after mile of some of the slimiest stuff the Eastern
    Seaboard has to offer. So get out there and get in it.

 4) MICHIGAN - Snow. Ice. Mud. And winter madness. When it comes to finding
    nature at her worst, this place has got it. Make sure you've got the
    right tires. (And make sure your heater works.) Then punch it!

Select Level

You can adjust your races for different levels of off-road prowess. Choose
your LEVEL by pressing the joystick UP and DOWN to highlight your choice.
When both your TERRAIN and your LEVEL have been selected, press the FIRE
BUTTON.

These are the LEVELS you can choose from:

 1) BEGINNER - This is a good place to start. At this level, you don't
    customize your truck. You go directly to the race. And your truck
    automatically has very high endurance.

 2) AMATEUR - As you build initial confidence, move up to this gear.

 3) SEMI-PRO -  For a true 4 X 4 torture test.

 4) PROFESSIONAL - You've gotta be crazy to try this one!

Choosing your Four Wheeler

There are four different types of basic trucks to choose from. They are:

THE STORMTROOPER, FROM COX MOTORS - This big American workhorse comes with
  build-on "cap". So you can save your money for some of those big American
  tires.

TARANTULA, MADE BY VENERABLE MOTORS - A heavy metal American pick-up that's
  built for action. ANY kind of action.

THE HIGHLANDER, BY TARTAN LORRIE - From Great Britain, this
  military-styled, jeep-like vehicle was designed for the bleaker reaches
  of Her Majesty's empire.

THE KATANA, FROM OYAMA MOTORS CORP - Don't be fooled by the sleek styling
  of this peppy Japanese import. It's as tough as it is fun to drive.

Each truck is rated for these seven factors:

POWER - This is a combination of the truck's horsepower (how much it can
handle) and gear output (how fast it accelerates).

WEIGHT - The lighter your rig, the better your speed, MPG, and
maneuverability. A heavier truck burns more fuel - but it also takes more
punishment.

GAS MILEAGE - This is your truck's estimated miles to the gallon (MPG). But
remember: if your truck is weighted down with too much equipment, you'll
burn gas at a faster rate.

ENDURANCE - How much your truck can take before you have to take it in for
repairs.

E.R.F. (Ease of Repair) - How long it takes to repair it.

PAYLOAD (VOLUME) WITHOUT CAP - How much your rig can carry without a camper
back.

PAYLOAD (VOLUME) WITH CAP - How much your rig can carry with a camper back.

FUEL CAPACITY - How big your fuel tank is. Or, more importantly, how far
you can go before you run out of gas.

TO CHOOSE YOUR TRUCK - To view your options, cycle through them by pressing
the joystick FORWARD or BACK. When you've reached a decision, press the
FIRE BUTTON.

Outfitting your Rig

Once you buy your basic truck, you're ready to equip and customize it.
After your press the FIRE BUTTON to purchase your selection, you'll be
whisked downtown to auto-parts row. It's here that you'll put those
finishing touches on your 4 X 4 rig. And it's here that you choose exactly
what you want your truck's specialty to be.

This is where careful strategy and planning play a part. The parts you
choose have something to do with WHERE you're going to be racing. (You're
not as likely to overheat in a cooler climate. And be sure to keep an eye
on your weight and volume!) And a whole heck of a lot to do with WHAT you
like.

There are two different stores you'll want to check out. To do this, move
your man up to the door or window of the store and press the FIRE BUTTON.

Here's what you'll find in each store:

The Custom Shop

This is where you buy the stuff that makes your truck totally unique. And
totally yours. You'll find:

A WINCH - It goes on the front of your rig. And when you have to pull
yourself out of a sticky situation - like a mud bog - it could save you
valuable time.

EXTRA CAPACITY FUEL TANK - A handy item. Because when your first tank runs
out of gas, you can just switch to this second tank. It'll save you
valuable time in a race. And can be a life-saver if you're not near
civilization when your first tank runs dry.

A CAP - A camper that lets you increase your carrying capacity.

TIRES - Choose from standards, mudder and all-terrain tires. Try to pick
the right tires for the right course. And remember to make sure your spares
match up.

TO PURCHASE ANY OF THE ABOVE CUSTOM ITEMS - Use your joystick to move the
"hand" on to the item and press the FIRE BUTTON.

TO RETURN ANY OF THE ABOVE CUSTOM ITEMS - Use the same procedure as you
used for purchasing them. NOTE: EXCEPT FOR TIRES. To return or change
tires, simply point to the tire of your choice and press the FIRE BUTTON.

TO LEAVE THE CUSTOM SHOP - Use your joystick to place "the hand" over the
"EXIT" sign and press the FIRE BUTTON.

The Auto Mart

Here's where you gear up on essential items you'll need for your trip. Plan
carefully, and keep an eye on your volume, weight, and cash.

TO BUY THESE ITEMS - Use your joystick to place the "hand" over the item
you wish to purchase, then press the FIRE BUTTON to buy it. NOTE: The text
at the bottom of the screen will tell you what the item is, how much it
will cost, and how much weight and volume it will add to your rig.

Here are some of the items you'll be able to purchase:

WATER - Some places need it more than others.

OIL - If you get a leak, you're gonna need this.

COOLANT - Consider the weather and terrain you'll be racing on. You may
need coolant if your radiator gets smashed.

TRANSMISSION FLUID - You never know....

EXTRA BATTERY - Is it worth the added weight?

SPARE PARTS - Always handy.

SPARE TIRES - At least take ONE.

A MECHANIC - Heavy? Sure. But a real time saver when it comes to repairs.

A SIX-PACK - It's up to you.

A CAN OF GAS - It can't hurt to be prepared!

A MAP - It comes in handy when you want to see where you are in the race.

A FLASHLIGHT - Saves time with under-hood repairs.

TOOLS - Just about a necessity.

TO SEE WHAT YOU'VE BOUGHT - Use the joystick to place "the hand" over the
"MENU" box and press the FIRE BUTTON. Move the joystick UP or DOWN to cycle
through all the items. When you're done, press the FIRE BUTTON again.

TO RETURN AN ITEM - Use your joystick to place "the hand" over the "REFUND"
box and press the FIRE BUTTON. Move the joystick UP or DOWN to cycle
through all the items. When the item you wish to return is highlighted in
red, move the joystick RIGHT or LEFT to return the highlighted item. Then
press the FIRE BUTTON to reactivate the hand.

TO LEAVE THE AUTO MART - Use your joystick to place the "hand" over the
"EXIT" sign and press the FIRE BUTTON. This will take you back outside the
shop.

The Race is On

Once you've customized your rig and purchased your equipment, you're ready
for the big race.

TO START THE RACE - move your "man" (using the joystick) over to the far
right section of the screen. Then press the FIRE BUTTON. You will now be
instructed to flip the disk over. Do so and press the FIRE BUTTON when
prompted.

Go For It

The day you've been working and waiting for is finally here: the day of the
race. It's the day you test your truck, your talents and your instincts
against nature herself - and against the other 4 X 4s in your class. When
the man at the start of the race waves the green flag, put the pedal to the
medal!

TO START YOUR ENGINE - press the FIRE BUTTON

TO STEER RIGHT OR LEFT - move the joystick RIGHT or LEFT

TO ACCELERATE - press the FIRE BUTTON

TO SLAM ON BRAKES - push joystick FORWARD

Warning: Crashing early in the race makes it difficult to catch up to the
other racers.

The Dashboard

As soon as you start logging on the miles across the countryside, keep an
eye on the dashboard. It can give you lots of valuable information.

Here's what you'll find:

!---------------------------------------------------------------------!

Reading the condition of your engine parts

Damage done to an engine part varies. It all depends on WHAT exactly you
did to it. And, of course, WHAT SHAPE the part was already in when the
damage was done.

Your dashboard controls give you clues to the degree of damage a part has
suffered by color. Here's how it works:

GREEN - low damage
BLUE - medium damage
YELLOW - severe damage

Damages

On trips like this, it's almost impossible to avoid some kind of damage or
mishap. When the damage is major, a special DAMAGE SCREEN will show you
where the damage is and what's needed to repair it.

The DAMAGE SCREEN will also give you clues as to how bad the damage really
is. Because if time is starting to get tight, (near the end of a race) you
may only want to repair whatever is absolutely necessary. Here's how to
tell how bad the damage is:

QUESTION MARK - a general breakdown
LIGHTENING BOLT - an electrical problem
THE PART SHOWN - some damage
THE PART IS FLASHING SLOWLY - medium damage
THE PART IS FLASHING RAPIDLY - severe damage

To make a repair WITH the right parts - Using the joystick, point to the
damaged area and press the FIRE BUTTON. The parts you need will appear in
the LOWER row of boxes. The parts you HAVE will appear in the UPPER row of
boxes. To complete the repair, point to the necessary parts you have and
press the FIRE BUTTON. If the gas can icon appears, move "the hand" over it
and press the FIRE BUTTON to top off your tank.

To make a repair WITHOUT the right parts - Point to the sledgehammer and
press the FIRE BUTTON. NOTE: This type of "make-do" repair will get you
back on the road. But with reduced endurance.

To make a repair at CHECKPOINT - Throughout the course you'll encounter
several CHECKPOINTS. The CHECKPOINTS are marked with orange pylons. When
you get to a CHECKPOINT, you will automatically pull in for repairs. All
parts and labor are FREE! You just have to decide if you can spare the time
for repairs! To fill your gas tank before you head out again, place "the
hand" over the gas can icon and press the FIRE BUTTON.

To get back on the road - After your truck has been repaired, point to the
crossed flags and press the FIRE BUTTON.

During the repair procedure, you'll be told how many other vehicles have
passed you. And before you get back on the road, you'll be told how long
your repairs took. NOTE: Certain items you may have purchased - like hiring
the mechanic or carrying a flashlight - will help reduce repair time.

To get back on the road without repairs - If you decide you can continue
the race without repairs, press the FIRE BUTTON.

Vehicular Recovery

If you overestimate the prowess of your 4 X 4 - or underestimate the dangers
of the terrain - you may find yourself immobilized. Or, in other words:
STUCK. Here are two ways to get yourself out of such messes:

1)  Use your winch. To do so, hold down the FIRE BUTTON. This will pull you
    out at about 5 miles an hour.

2) "Rock" your way out. If your rig isn't rigged with a winch, you're
    going to have to "rock" yourself out. It's not as fast as using a winch
    - but it DOES work. To "rock", press the gas pedal (FIRE BUTTON)
    repeatedly, over and over until you dislodge your rig. How long should
    it take? It all depends... On how thick the bog is. And on how fast you
    were going when you hit it. NOTE: "Rocking" may cause damage to your
    4 X 4 - but it may be your only option.

The Other Guys

Along the way, you may notice other trucks passing you. If you want to win,
you've got to catch up and pass them as soon as you can. (There are up to
16 opponents on each course.)

The Doombuggy

This is the most deadly obstacle in the whole race. He's not just another
contender. No way. This guy is out for blood. You'll recognize his menacing
looking black rig right away. And when he tries to ram and bump your truck
off the road, you'll know for sure that it's him. But try not to let him
have a chance. Stay as far away from this dude as possible - no matter what
it takes to do it.

Right Place at the Right Time

In a race as long as this one, it's often difficult to gauge how well
you're doing. Your goal is to finish the race FIRST. So, you'll want to
pass all your opponents and leave them in the dust!

To get an idea of WHEN to be WHERE for a shot at the victor's trophy, keep
an eye on the dashboard clock. The race starts at 8:00 in the morning. In
general, if you reach the first CHECKPOINT by 11:30 a.m. you are making
good time. If you haven't reached it by 1:00 p.m. you should INCREASE your
speed.

If you reach the second CHECKPOINT by 2:30 p.m., you are making good time.
However, your main goal should be reaching the CHECKPOINTS ahead of your
opponents. If your opponents are having trouble on the track you may be
able to afford more time for repairs!

The Party's Over

You begin the game with "3 lives" per race. Which means you can total
yourself twice and still bounce back from where you were last seen. But the
race is over when:

1)  You lose your third rig - You'll be given a choice between starting the
    race over with the same rid, or, you can go back to the beginning and
    build up a different one from scratch.

2)  You cross the finish line - Your position in the race will be
    calculated based on the number of trucks you passed. A score screen
    will appear, showing your placement and race time. Excellent race times
    will allow you to enter your name on the Hall of Fame screen (available
    on Amateur, Semi-Pro, and Professional levels only.) To qualify for
    King of the Road, you must race on all four terrains in a level, and
    finish with the best times.

Hot Tips for Beating 'em Cold

 * Remember to pace yourself. The faster you go, the more fuel you'll burn.
   And it's a long, long way to the finish line.

 * You know those irksome obstacles you're always trying to avoid? Well,
   they DO come in handy sometimes. Use them to jump over rivers and mud
   bogs.

 * CHECKPOINTS are great - IF you can afford the time. So don't make
   repairs unless it's absolutely necessary.

                     4 X 4 OFF-ROAD RACING
 
             Command Card for the Commodore Amiga

Loading and Start Up

 1. Set up your system and plug in your mouse. If you're going to use a
    joystick to play the game, plug one into port 2. (It's strongly 
    recommended that you use a joystick to play the game.)

 2. Insert the 4 x 4 Off-Road Racing disk into floppy drive 0, label side
    up, and turn on the system.

Note: The Amiga 1000 must be booted with Kickstart before you insert the
game disk. Turn on the system with Kickstart version 1.2 in the drive.
(Kickstart version 1.1 may cause graphics flickers during the game play.)
When prompted to insert the Workbench disk, insert the 4 x 4 Off-Road
Racing disk instead.

 3. After the program loads, press the fire button, left mouse button, or
    Spacebar to continue.

Making a Backup Copy

You can copy 4 x 4 Off-Road Racing to a floppy disk for backup purposes.
See the documentation provided with your Commodore-Amiga for instructions
on copying or duplicating disks. If you use the Diskcopy command, you must
give the backup disk a name other than 4 x 4 (the name of the original game
disk).

To play 4 x 4 Off-Road Racing with the backup copy, follow the instructions
in the Loading and Start up section of this command card using the backup
disk. When instructed by the on-screen prompt, insert your original game
disk into a floppy drive for the copy-protection check. (If your system
uses a single disk drive, remove the backup disk and insert the original
disk at this time). When instructed by the on-screen prompt, remove your
original disk. (If your system uses a single disk drive, reinsert your
backup disk into the drive.)

Keyboard and Mouse Commands

After the title screen appears, press SPACEBAR or the left mouse button to
see the Select Terrain and Ability screen. For selection screens and game
play, press the following ARROW keys or number keys on the numeric keypad

Damages and Repairs

When an engine part is damaged, its corresponding icon on your dashboard
changes color. When the damage is major, you are forced to stop and the
Repair screen appears. If the damage is not major, you can press SPACEBAR
to see the Repair screen.

To make a repair, move the hand icon over the broken part and press the
left mouse button, fire button, or 0 on the numeric keypad.

Evaluate your vehicle's condition, then choose one of several options
indicated by the following icons: dwell/tachometer (quality repair), hammer
(make-do repair), gas can (add gas), map (view your current position and
the position of the checkpoints), or checkered flag (return to the race).

To make your selection, move the hand icon over the appropriate icon and
press the left mouse button, fire button, or 0 on the numeric keypad. To
select the checkered flag icon, press the button or key twice.

Depending on your supplies, some icons may not appear on the Repair screen.
For example, if you did not purchase a map, there will not be a map icon on
the Repair screen. Certain items you may have purchased, such as tools, a
flashlight, or hiring a mechanic, will help reduce your repair time.

The Party's Over

If you wreck your truck three times or cross the finish line, the race is
over. The race is also over if you run out of gas when your gas can is
empty. Select the gas cap and follow the prompts to exit to the Game
options menu.

After you cross the finish line, your position appears on the bottom of the
screen. Your elapsed race time appears on the following scoring screen. To
qualify for King of the Road, you must qualify on all four terrains in your
level, and finish with the best combined time.

Tips

Practice as a Beginner because you'll have an unlimited number of lives.
Avoid going off course. It will slow you down and may cause damage.
