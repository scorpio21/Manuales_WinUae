GAME PLAY
~~~~~~~~~
Bob's aim is to rescue his girlfreind from the mad Scientist. Before he can
do this he must first rescue his buddies. There are six caged cats in each
section of the trail and they must all be released before Bob can gain
access to the next section. On his travels  Bob will meet many mutated
animals who will sap his strength whenever he touches them. Bob can stun
these creatures by hitting them with his ball of wool. Scattered along the
way  Bob will find various items which may aid him in his quest. There is
food which will help to restore his energy, presents which  he can collect
for his girlfriend, keys which he will need to open doors and to release his
pals and other special items which affect Bob and his environment.

Picking up a pair of wings puts Bob into Heli-Bod mode, allowing him to fly.
Picking up a cat's head awards Bob with an extra life, collecting a white
cat's head wearing sunglasses switches on invisi-Bob mode, making Bob
invisible to his foes and collecting a sheild bearing the letter B turns on
Super-Bob, which temporarily protects Bob from attack from mutant animals.

HINTS AND TIPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If Bob is near the top of the screen hopping up will scroll in the area
above.

When Bob is jumping from the bottom of the screen the height of the Jump
Meter will be level with the top of his jump.

Use the pawmarks next to the jump meter to gauge the height of your jumps.

Don't rush into new areas, give hidden hazards time to expose themselves.
