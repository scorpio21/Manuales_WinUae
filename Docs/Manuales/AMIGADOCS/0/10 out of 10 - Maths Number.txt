10 out of 10 Mathematics (Number)

INTRODUCTION
The Mathematics National Curriculum is split into five Attainment Targets.
This 10 out of 10 suite of programs is aimed to cover some essential parts
of the Levels set out in Attainment Target 2 - Number.

You can see the exact areas covered by loading the program and selecting
Player Information from the Main Menu and moving the cursor around the
screen. Further details of of the Achievement chart and the National
Curriculum are in the Parent/Teacher Guide supplied with the full version.

10 out of 10 Mathematics (Number) is a suite of six educational games
designed to help children get to grips with 36 specific topics from the
Mathematics National Curriculum Attainment Target 2. While covering these -
and automatically recording the child's progress - it also covers many more
areas essential both in real life and for academic success.

The games are both educational and fun with many elements built in to keep
children coming back for more. There are, for example, two ways that a child
can see progress:

* THE ACHIEVEMENT CHART. The child must aim to turn this completely green by
gaining full marks at the various grades.
* THE HIGH SCORE TABLES: In addition to the mark, these take into account
many other game elements like speed and bonus.

The ACHIEVEMENT CHART shows you at a glance how your child is progressing
and you can see which topics need further practice. Also, as a further form
of encouragement, children can print or display a certificate showing the
Attainment Target Levels reached. The achievements can also be printed for
your own information.

Details of how to play the games follow. Following the playing instructions
are some of the main points from the Parent/Teacher Guide so you will be
able to customise the games to suit your child's needs. The manual supplied
with the full version gives extra information and hints about how to get the
most from the programs.

GETTING STARTED
When you first load 10 out of 10 you're presented with the Main Menu. At the
bottom is the name of the current player - it's set to TEST to begin with.
The first thing you should do is enter your own name. Here's how to do it:

Move the mouse pointer to the red box on the right of New Player to
highlight it in blue. Click the left hand mouse button and then just enter
your name.

Press Return and you'll go back to the Main Menu with your name at the
bottom. The top six options on the Main Menu are the games themselves.
Before looking at these, let's look at the other options:

PLAYER INFORMATION
When you select this you're presented with - table with the player's name at
the top. This is called your Achievement Record and has on it numbers
showing various parts of the National Curriculum covered by the games.

To start with these numbers are all on a black background. They each change
colour individually depending on what percentage of questions you get right
(not the score - that depends how well you play the games too!). They go red
if you play the game and achieve less than 50%, yellow if you score over 50%
and green if you achieve 100% - that's your aim! If you can do that ten
times it will turn blue - you prove you're a genius!

CHANGE PLAYER
This lets you alter the current player to someone else who has previously
entered their name.

If you ever want to leave the list of players without making a change, press
Escape.

REMOVE PLAYER
Using this lets you remove names from the list.

PRINT CERTIFICATE
On the full version this lets you print a certificate (or save it to disk)
when at least one of the boxes in the Achievement Record has been turned
green. Screen is so that you can view the certificate while Disk is so that
you can save it to disk and then load it into a paint program to print it
from there.

QUIT
Use this option to exit from the program.

THE GAMES
When you select a game from the Main Menu you are presented with a Game
Menu. All the games have similar options as follows:

PLAY GAME
Select this to play the game once you have set all the other features. While
you are playing you can PAUSE the action at any time by pressing P.

HIGH SCORE TABLE
This lets you view the high score table - the current player's entries will
be shown in red and a new high score will be yellow. Higher scores are
obtained by playing the games at higher speeds, with timers on, at higher
grades and so on.

NUMBER OF PLAYERS
Click on the number with the mouse pointer to cycle through 1, 2, 3 or 4. If
one is selected the current player's name is used. If more than one play,
you are asked for their names the first time the game starts. If you want to
change the names, change the number of players - return it to the same
number if necessary.

TIMER
Click on this to cycle through various times and off. Lower times mean
harder games and higher scores.

GRADE
When you first start this is fixed on Grade 1. Once you've reached yellow on
the Achievement chart you can progress to Grade 2 and so on. Eventually you
can cycle through six grades.

On Cheers you can also select USER. This allows you to use a set of
questions written by a parent or teacher.

VOLUME
Providing the sound has not been turned off, this lets you choose the volume
of the sound effects (7 is loudest).

INFORMATION
This displays a small version of the Attainment record, just giving details
for the particular game.

EXIT TO MAIN MENU
This takes you back to the Main Menu. Now that we've looked at the features
common to all the games, let's look at the games themselves:

CARNIVAL
Here's a great shoot-'em-up to check your number skills along with your fire
power. The question appears at the top of the screen with the numbers you
must work out at the centre of the display. You must shoot the correct
answer as it passes along the conveyor belt.

Apart from the variety of options that all the games have this time you can
also choose the speed of the belt and the maximum number of shots that you
have. If the timer is on, you must take all your shots within the time or
the game ends. Choose a fast belt to go for a bigger bonus and higher score!

COVER UP
This is a game of matching: match the items on the bottom half of the screen
to those at the top. Click on any of the ones at the bottom and then click
on the one that you think matches at the top. If you're right they both
disappear and you move on to the next one but if you're wrong they remain.
When you select more than one player, the first player keeps going until he
or she makes a mistake.

The timer counts down to the start of the question answering time: during
that time you should work out as many answers as possible ready (with timer
off the game starts straight away).

You can also select doors open or closed. When they're open the numbers show
all the time for you to answer the questions. If closed is chosen they close
after the timer expires and it's a game of memory too. Whether the timer is
on or off, the bonus ticks away between correct matches so be quick for the
high scores. Finally you can select the number of rows - with four doors on
each - that you want to match up. If you have more doors you can achieve
higher scores!

THE BIG BANG
The temperature on the thermometer is moving fast - how fast depends on what
you set on the menu. The only way to control it is by answering questions
right. Every time you answer one correctly the temperature returns near to
the ideal.

Keep giving correct answers for as long as you can and you're well on your
way to the high score table. But it gets harder as the game progresses - the
temperature moves faster. How long can you delay the Big Bang? Eventually
the temperature moves too fast even for the experts so you have to be really
quick with the answers.

The idea of this game is to keep going as long as you can and score as much
as you can. For that reason it is best played with the timer off and
questions set to loads. If you want a quick game you can limit its length by
setting the timer or number of questions.

Note: The mark remains at 0% until at least 10 questions have been answered.

GRAB IT
How fast can you grab? The answer to the question that is displayed is
somewhere on the screen and once you spot it move the hand there and grab.
Be quick though, the answers move around so it won't be in the same place
for long.

You can choose how fast the numbers move around and the faster you choose
the higher you can score. This is a fast action game and, with larger
numbers, it's best to try to estimate and grab!

SILICON BRAIN
This is a mathematics program where you don't have to work anything out:
there's a big calculator provided for you to use. You need to use it quick
and get the answers right if you want to reach the high score table.

As you play, your button presses are recorded across the bottom of the
screen. If you get an answer wrong and can't see why yourself, show the
question and the order of the buttons to your parent or teacher so that you
can find out where you went wrong. You'll soon be a calculator expert and on
the way up the high scores.

If you want to use the Silicon Brain calculator to help you with your
homework, select Use Silicon Brain from the menu. You can then use it just
like an ordinary calculator.

CHEERS
Here's a fast-action quiz game to keep you on your toes. You just answer the
questions correctly for cheers and move up the board by the number shown on
the dice (choose how many dice you want to play with from the main menu). On
Grade 1, if you hit a ladder you move up while hit a tube and you go down -
other grades have the same rules but different graphics.

If the dice show a total that you don't want to accept (if you would land on
a tube for example) you can re-throw them once for each question. To do this
just click the mouse pointer on the dice.

The bonus ticks away from the start of the game and you get points for
correct answers. So answer correctly and reach the top as quickly as you can
to get a high score. When you start Loads of questions is shown on the menu.
This ensures you will have enough to finish the game. If you want to limit
the number of questions it can be set in the same way as on the other games.
The bonus ticks away all the time so answer as quickly as you can for high
scores.

THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS FROM THE
PARENT/TEACHER GUIDE. NOTE THAT IT GIVES DETAILS OF "HIDDEN" KEY
COMBINATIONS FOR PARENT/TEACHER CUSTOMISATION USE ONLY.

THE ACHIEVEMENT RECORD - How to interpret it
When you view an achievement record for a new player - by selecting Player
Information from the Main Menu or Information from a Game Menu - all the
numbers are on black backgrounds. As the child plays games, these change
colour as follows:

* Red: The child has played the game but achieved under 50%. Take the red as
a warning: He or she needs help at that Attainment Target Level.
* Yellow: The child has scored 50% or more so probably knows the facts but
needs to practise them more. They can now go on to the next grade - but
should return to the yellow one and try to turn it green.
* Green: The child knows the facts and has proved it with 100% - the 10 out
of 10 goal.
* Blue: For the real experts, score 100% ten times or more on each grade of
each game and turn the table blue.

The child should be encouraged to first turn the whole table green and then
go for blue.

You have several options to let you obtain a printout. Firstly, you can
press Control+P and simply print a text list of the achievements. This will
work on any printer and factors like the number of lines on a page is set
from the configuration screen - see later. Alternatively, you can press
Control+S. This saves the colour screen to disk for you to print out using
an art package.

On the full version you print the achievements of more than one child by
pressing Control+M while any achievement chart is displayed. A list of names
will be displayed and you should highlight the ones you're interested in
using the Right Hand mouse button. Start printing with the Left Hand one.

Note that the Achievement Record shows the progress of individual children
and is only modified if the number of players is set to one.

THE GRADES
All the games have six built-in grades - each one aiming at a higher
National Curriculum Attainment Target. When a player first loads a game it
will be set on Grade 1. Progress to Grade 2 cannot be made until at least
50% has been achieved on Grade 1 (yellow on the achievement record).
Progress up to higher grades also needs a percentage of 50 or more on the
previous one. Parents or teachers can select any starting grade without
going through the previous ones by using the Customisation Screen or
function keys 1 to 6.

THE SCORING SYSTEM
All 10 out of 10 Educational Systems programs have two scoring methods - the
achievement record and the high scores. Children should be encouraged to
progress in both these areas.

The former is the percentage of questions the child answers correctly.
Factors like how fast the questions are answered are not taken into account
on the achievement record.

While taking into account the mark, the scores also take into account other
facts like the grade it was achieved on, the speed of answering, bonuses and
so on. To rise up the high score tables children have to become very
proficient with their number skills - both accuracy and speed. The fun and
game element of 10 out of 10 makes them want to keep practising until this
proficiency is reached.

Note that when two or more children play a game, they each aim for their own
high score (which can qualify for the high score table) but the total
percentage will be joint. No change is therefore made to the achievement
record. On the high score table, to show that a percentage has been achieved
by teamwork a small dot is displayed after the % sign.

PARENT/TEACHER CUSTOMISATION
Many features of 10 out of 10 are selected automatically by the software but
the choice can be altered by a parent or teacher - either from function key
combinations or from the Customisation Screen. If you press Shift+Control+C
while the Main Menu is displayed you can set the following by highlighting
the appropriate boxes on the display:

* At the end of a game the child is awarded a rating and during the games
some messages may be displayed. These have been chosen in consultation with
many children as words that amuse/encourage them and keep their interest. If
you prefer these messages not to be displayed they can be turned off from
the Customisation Screen. 

* The achievement chart can display either National Curriculum Attainment
Levels or numbers from 1 to 6 representing difficulty. You can choose which
is displayed from the Customisation Screen.

* Sound can be turned on or off from the Customisation Screen. Pressing
CTRL+F10 on the Game Menus turns the sound off for that game and it can be
restored by pressing the keys again.

* The 10 out of 10 series uses six graded levels in each game. From the
Customisation Screen you can choose whether the word Level or Grade is used
to describe these. Note that, to prevent confusion, if the display of
National Curriculum Levels is chosen, 10 out of 10 always uses the word
Grade for the difficulty of the challenge.

* To encourage children to work their way through and benefit from all the
grades of 10 out of 10  they cannot progress to a higher grade until they
have achieved yellow on the record for the current one. The starting grade
is currently set to Grade1 but you can select any from the Customisation
Screen.

Also, pressing CTRL+F1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 while a Game Menu is displayed
alters the starting grade for that game. Note that this sets the entry grade
to the game and if a lower one is then selected within the game the child
will not be able to move back up unless yellow has been achieved on lower
grades.

* The class number (1 to 64) is to allow over 4000 pupils to save their
results.

* When the achievements are printed out as text (on the full version only),
the software has to be told the length of the paper and how much gap to
leave at the top and bottom. Set these from the Customisation Screen (the
three numbers should add up to your total paper length).

* All the programs in the 10 out of 10 suite have three sets of graphics.
These are automatically selected depending which grade is selected - lower
grades use graphics that appeal to younger children. However, parents or
teachers can select the graphics that will be always used from the
Customisation Screen. (1=youngest, A=Auto-select)

This can also be done for a single game by pressing one of the three keys
CTRL+F7, 8 or 9 while the Game Menu is displayed. Once the parent/teacher
has selected the graphics for a single program by this method they are used
whichever grade is selected until another program is loaded.

* Use the final option on the Customisation Screen - Default - to put all
the other options back to their starting values. The choices you set on the
Customisation Screen - and the code - are saved to disk and will be used
every time a child uses the package. If options are set from Game Menus they
are only used during that game.

* To prevent children from altering any of the stored information, access to
Change Player, New Player and Remove Player can be restricted by the use of
an access code which is set to 0000 when you first load 10 out of 10. With
it set to this, free access is allowed to all features and the code is not
asked for. However, if you press CTRL+F10 and enter a new four-digit code,
you will in future have to enter the code before altering players. On the
full version it is saved to disk.

* While a game is being played, pressing R will pause it and reveal the aim
of the current challenge (including the National Curriculum Level if
selected). Press Space to continue.

* On Cover Up and Cheers you may wish to use the same screen layout as
previously - you may, for example, want several children to play the game
using exactly the same starting point. A game number is displayed as these
programs are being played. To repeat a game at any time enter that number by
pressing CTRL while the introductory graphic is displayed between selecting
Play game and the action starting.

CUSTOMISING THE CHEERS GAME
You can use your own set of questions in the Cheers game. All your own
question files should go in the Qfile directory and should not normally be
called Q1 to Q6. When children use them the result will not be entered on
the achievement chart but high scores will still be obtained.

When you enter your own questions you MUST ensure that EVERY question and
answer is followed by # and every question has ONE right answer preceded by
!.

Full instructions, including a list of several SPECIAL CHARACTERS you can
use in your own Cheers files for powers and fractions, are supplied with the
full version of 10 out of 10 Mathematics (Number).
