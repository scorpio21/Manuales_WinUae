     Ceiling: 64000'
     Maximum Speed in level flight at 0': 530 kts (Mach 0.8)
     Maximum Speed in level flight at 36000': 640 kts (Mach 1.1)
     Armament: one M61A1 6-barrel 20 mm cannon, four internal weapon bays
          with maximum combined load od 6000 lbs
     Air-to-Air Radar Quality: No radar; medium range FLIR/TV optical fire
          control system
     Maneuverability: Fair to good

     Created at the Lockheed 'Skunk Works' in Burbank, California, this
     novel aircraft sacrifices almost everything to a nearly invisible
     redar signature. The shape minimizes radar reflections. A large quantity
     of RAM (Radar Absorbent Material) panels, wedges and coatings are
     located on the ventral and dorsal surfaces, including the wings. All
     leading edges are cased in heat-resistant ceramics for minimum infrared
     signature, while engine exhausts are directed through low-signature
     slats.
     The aircraft is designed for all-weather reconnaissance and strike
     missions, but can use its internal 20 mm cannon, AIM-9 Sidewinder, or
     AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles for air-to-air interception and combat. The
     latest version uses a sophisticated zoom FLIR/TV/laser target tracking
     system that allows the pilot to see a close-up picture (either TV or
     thermal) of the target at all times, regardless of angle.
     The aircraft is air-transportable in C-5A Galaxy transports, and can
     be launched and recovered from US Navy aircraft carriers.
                                                                       - 4 -

                                 Introduction:
                                 -------------

     On a moonless night a huge C-5A Galaxy transport plane touches down in
     Saudi Arabia and taxis to a distant hanger guarded by DIA (Defense
     Intelligence Agency) operatives. A large black object is rolled from the
     Galaxy into the hangar. Under red night-lights the hydraulic whine of
     unfolding wings is counterpointed by the hum of fuel tanker trucks
     pumping aviation gas, while sweating ground crewmen hoist bombs and
     missiles into weapons bays. As the Galaxy rools away, an Air Force pilot
     climbs into the black plane, puts on his helmet, and begins preflight
     checkout. Minutes later the distinctive whine of F404 turbofans fills
     the hanger. A strange, rounded shape noses out of the dark hangar
     doorway and onto a runway. A hand pushes the throttle to full forward.
     With a roar the two big turbojets hurtle the craft airborne. Another
     Stealth Fighter mission has begun.
        Tomorrow the U.S. Navy is performing retaliatory strikes against
     Iranian-sponsored terrorism. The Iranian planes at the Shiraz airfield
     must be rendered harmless tonight!
        The dark waves of the Persian Gulf roll 200 feet below the wings. Off
     to the left are the twinkling lights of dueling Iraqi and Iranian
     artillery. Blue light bathes the cockpit: enemy radar is awake tonight,
     but the American fighter is returning a signal too weak for the enemy
     radar to perceive.
        Two hundred miles away, 30000 feet over the Saudi Arabian desert, an
     American crewman sits at one of the 22 consoles on a E-3C "Sentry" AWACS
     plane. The powerful AWACS radars and signals processors are monitoring
     the entire Persian Gulf and southern Iran areas. The crewman's fingers
     dance over the keyboard as he describes aircraft takeoffs, movements,
     and landings, as well as enemy radar and radio activity. Deep inside its
     massive computers, the AWACS encodes the message and transmits it in a
     fast, tight burst.
        Dancing lights play across a HUD 200 feet above the water. As his
     computer decode the radio burst the lone Air Force pilot reads the
     incoming information. His cockpit CRTs automatically update also. He
     makes minute adjustments and examines his consoles once more. Yes, very
     good. He's timed the adjusted flight path so he'll pass behind the enemy
     fighter patrol, their nose radars looking away from him.
        Minutes later, he accomplishes just that, then plunges into the
     desolate mountain valleys of southern Iran. Mountain goats and sheep
     scamper across the descolate highlands as a black roar passes overhead,
     twisting and turning to follow the valley floor.
        At last he passes out of the last mountain range. Then a yellow light
     blinks: they got a good radar return there! Will they alert their SAMs
     and interceptors? It's all academic as the fighter's nose rolls downward,
     aiming at the military airfield on the outskirts of Shiraz.
        The throttle goes to the wall and a rolling sonic boom follows behind
     the
                                                                       - 5 -

     dark avenger. Warnings blin as Iranian radars suddenly see an intruder
     directly overhead. Sirens erupt, sleppy SAM crews leap to their radar
     consoles while fighter pilots tumble out of bed. Above, the pilot flips
     arming switches. Targeting symbology flashes up on his HUD while
     underneath bay doors whine open. A weapon pylon extends into the night
     sky, a stubby Maverick missile's FLIR sensor scanning until the pilot
     sees the distinctive heat signature of a HAWK battery controller. The
     missile's brain locks onto the image and its engine flares bright in the
     sky. Simultaneously below the battery commander launches his first HAWK
     surface-to-air missile at the intruder.
        The HAWK's control-guidance beams cause new warnings in the cockpit
     followed moments later by a strident klaxon. The missile is just seconds
     away. A cloud of aluminum chaff erupts behind the intruder. The HAWK
     attacks the cloud and explodes far behind the stealth fighter. Seconds
     later the slower-travelling Maverick hits the SAM controller's bunker,
     wrecking its radar and communications gear, disabling the entire battery.
        The black fighter rools steeply, airbrakes out. The sonic boom roars
     ahead of it, crashing over the airfield like the thunder of the gods.
     Five hundred feet above the tarmac two Durandals drop from a weapons
     pylon, chutes springing free at the tail of each. The bombs nose
     downward, floating in air over the runway. Then rocket motors explode
     and the bombs leap toward the ground, armored heads cutting through the
     thick concrete. Three feet down the warheads explode, hurling slabs of
     concrete in all directions.
        The American pilot loops around and dives over the runway again. Two
     huge craters sit squarely in the middle, while nearby a number of
     carelessly parked jets are crumpled under pieces of concrete. A major
     unit of the Iranian air force is now grounded, unable to fly until
     lengthy repairs are made. In a single blow over forty enemy aircraft
     have been rendered harmless.
        The black plane roars away into the mountains at 200', closing his bay
     and switching off jammers. To the military search radars all around,
     watching in helpless fury, the intruder seems to disappear. Interceptors
     vectoring in from other bases block the airwaves with confused chatter.
     The American pilot smiles and throttles back for the slow cruise home,
     another F-19 Stealth Fighter mission accomplished.
                                                                       - 6 -
                                  Quickstart:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     You have three options when learning to fly your F-19 Stealth Fighter.
        Try & See Method: You can juust dive and try things out, referring to
     this manual and the Technical Insert as necessary. In this case we
     strongly suggest that you (a) use the keyboard overlay, and (b) glance
     over "Aircraft Controls" in Part II (pages 34-48) to familiarize yourself
     with the HUD and cockpit. As you fly, you'll find Part II in general to
     be an excellent reference aid. Be warned, the F-19 is a complex aircraft.
     Sooner or lter you'll have to look at the manual.
        Tutorial Method: You can use the "Quickstart" method described below
     for your first flight, or you can work through the more detailed tutorial
     on pages 11 through 23. If you like to be guided through a situation, we
     suggest the full tutorial. Note that the tutorial urges that you atleast
     skim through Part II (pages 34-38)
        Study Method: You can study the actual controls and operating
     instructions for the craft, then attempt to fly it. This is what real
     pilots do (or should do). In this case, read all of Part II (pages 34-38)
     before flying, and refer back on the section as necessary. You can use
     the tutorial on your first flight, or skip it, as you prefer. However,
     we suggest a practice mission as your first flight.

     ========================================================================
     Abbreviated Tutorial
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        1. Install the game as suggested onto floppy disk or hard disk (if you
     have one). See "Installation" in the Technical Supplement for details.
     You can skip installation, but if you do none of your records can be
     saved.
        2. Load the Simulation: see "Loading Instructions" in the Technical
     Supplement for details and specific commands.
        3. Answer the Aircraft Identification Quiz: Check the back part of
     this manual ("Warplanes", pages 157-169) to see what aircraft is
     illustrated. If you give a wrong answer, you are automatically sent for
     training. If you give the correct answer, you are given a complete
     selection of all options.
        4. Log onto the Pilot Roster: Following the instructions on the screen
     erase one of the pilots on the roster and type your name. Enter the name
     by tapping the "Return" or "Enter" key.
        5. Accept the Current Mission: As a new pilot, your first assignment
     is a standard training mission. We suggest you accept this challenge. The
     default options are:

          * Libya region
          * Conventional War situation
          * Strike Training as your mission
          * Green Opponents
          * No Crash flight realism
                                                                       - 7 -

        6. Intelligence Briefing: Be sure to highlight and read both of the
     following options:

          * Mission Targets
          * Flight Plan

     These describe your objectives, takeoff and landing points, and the Rules
     of Engagement (what you should and shouldn't destroy). See page 29 for a
     more detailed description of the Intelligence Briefing screen, its
     options, and information.
        7. Arming Complete: Use the default armament, so select the "Arming
     Complete" option on this screen.
        8. Begin Mission: Select this option to start your training mission.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flying the Mission:

     If you selected the starting options described above, you're flying a
     training mission. This is just right for your first flight, since in
     training enemy weapons do no damage. On the first mission we recommend
     you concentrate mainly on flying, with a bit of simple weapons use, and
     ignore all those enemy planes and missiles buzzing around.
        A Quick Checkout: Place and examine the keyboard overlay. This device
     is an invaluable aid in flying your F-19.
        Find the Pause key command on the overlay. This command is always
     useful while learning.
        Skim through "Aircraft Controls", pages 34-48 of this manual. They
     describe the cockpit and HUD (head-up-display). You'll need some
     familiarity with these before you fly.
        This first mission is exactly the mission described in the "Tutorial"
     (pages 11-23). You're invited to follow the step-by-step instructions of
     the tutorial.
        You are also invited to look at the Simulation Controls, especially
     the Out of Plane Views (see pages 31-33). Experiment with these on your
     first few flights. You'll find the views quite interesting, and often
     quite useful.
        1. Takeoff: Power up the engines (tap the Max Pwr key) and release the
     Brake (tap the Brake key) to fire the aircraft carrier catapult. Once
     your aircraft passes stall speed (stall speed bar drops below the center
     tickmark on the left-hand HUD gauge) you can pull up the nose. You must
     do this as you clear the carrier's deck, or else you'll fall into the
     sea. Tap the Gear key to retract your landing gear.
        See "How to Fly" (page 49) for a more detailed description of takeoff
     procedures.
        2. Fly to Your Target: Turn on the autopilot (tap the Autopilot key)
     to get on course to your target. Every time you touch the control stick,
     the autopilot automatically turns off. Therefore, you can experiment a
     bit with flight on the way to the target, then turn the autopilot on
     once more to get you back on course.
        You'll be using your AGM-65D Maverick missiles to attack the target,
     so you might want to read "How to Fight", especially page 57, which
     describes how to operate this weapon.
                                                                       - 8 -

     Tap the Ordnance key to see which weapons are aboard your plane. Next
     find the select Ordnance key and tap that, rotating through the various
     weapons until AGM-65D "Maverick" is highlighted. You'll notice its name
     also appears in the lower left corner of the HUD.
        3. Attack the Target: When you get close to the Libyan coast, switch
     the HUD to air-ground mode (tap the HUD Modes key until the bottom-center
     label of the HUD is "AIR-GROUND") and turn on your tracking camera (tap
     the Cam Ahead key). If your primary target, the Tripoli Depot, does not
     appear in the lower right cockpit CRT, tap the Select Target key until
     it does.
        Up on your HUD, you'll notice a box appears around an area of ground
     when the tracking camera finds the target. As you get closer, the box
     changes to a circle on the CRT screen shows the words "Missile Lock".
     Your Maverick missile is now locked on and ready to fire.
        To fire, first open the weapons bay (tap the Bay Doors key), then tap
     the Fire Ordnance key to release your Maverick missile. It will find its
     own path to target. If you want insurance, wait a second or two, then tap
     the key again to fire the second missile at the same target.
        4. Finishing the Mission: You can either continue the mission
     according to the tutorial instructions, or you can return home
     immediately.
        To return home immediately, tap the Select Way Pt key to display the
     waypoints list on your right-side cockpit CRT. Then tap the Next Point
     key until the last of the four waypoints is highlighted. This point is
     your final destination, your landing strip. Now that the proper waypoint
     is set, you can tap the Autopilot key. The autopilot will turn the plane
     onto course for home.
        As you approach the island of Sicily, switch the HUD to navigation
     mode (tap the HUD Modes key until the "NAV" label appears in its bottom
     center) and return to using the tracking camera (tap the Cam Ahead key
     once more). This will show the local airfield on the right-side cockpit
     CRT.
        Landing this hot jet is tricky, if you follow the instructions on
     pages 54-55 you've got a good chance. Fortunately, the simulation is set
     in "No Crash" mode, so you'll survice a poor landing too. To end the
     mission, make sure the plane is stopped by putting the brakes on (tap
     the Brakes key) and then turn off the engines (tap the No Pwr key).

                                                                       - 9 -
                               <<< EMPTY >>>                          - 10 -

                                  1: TUTORIAL
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Your First Mission:

     This tutorial is designed to be your first mission. Flying this tutorial
     is not required. It's purely a convenience. For a faster entry into your
     first game, turn to "Quickstart" on page 7. If you prefer to study the
     aircraft before you fly it, go directly to Part II on page 25. 
        In either case, before you start the simulation you may wish to
     install it on either floppy disks or a hard disk (see "Installation" in
     the Technical Supplement for details). You can run the simulation
     without installation, but no information is saved.
        Now load the installed game (or the original disks, if yoy didn't
     install it) into your computer. See "Loading" in the Technical Supplement
     for details.
        Your first mission is a practice strike against a SAM radar
     installation guarding the city of Tripoli, in Libya.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Terminology:

     Keys: Each key control has a name in UPPERCASE LETTERS, which appears on
     the keyboard overlay. A master list appears in the Technical Supplement.
        CONTROLLER refers to the pointing device used by your computer. This
     may be a mouse, joystick, or cursor keys, depending on your hardware.
        SELECTOR refers to the mouse button, joystick trigger, return key, or
     enter key, depending on your hardware setup. See the Technical Supplement
     for details.
        During flight, the function of joystick and mouse buttons are defined
     in the Technical Supplement. For example, on a typical two-button
     joystick, the first button acts as the FIRE CANNON key, the second as
     the FIRE ORDNANCE key.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Preflight Briefing Options:

        Answer the Aircraft Identification Quiz: Check pages 157-169 of this
     manual to see which aircraft is illustrated. Although a correct answer
     is not necessary for training missions, it's wise to acquire good habits.
        Log onto the Pilot Roster: Following the instructions on the screen,
     use the CONTROLLER to select a name to erase, press the proper key to
     erase it, and type your name. Finish entering your name by tapping the
     "Return" or "Enter" key.
                                                                      - 11 -

        Accept the Current Mission: As a new pilot your first assignment is
     always this training mission. Use the CONTROLLER to highlight Accept
     Mission and then press the SELECTOR. The tutorial training mission uses
     the following selections: LIBYA region, CONVENTIONAL WAR situation,
     STRIKE TRAINING as the mission category, GREEN opponents, and NO CRASH
     flight realism.
        Inteligence Briefing: The briefing map shows the general topography
     of the area, your takeoff point (T), your primary (P) and secondary (S)
     targets, and your landing point (L).
       Be sure to highlight, select and read each of the following options:

          * Mission Targets
          * Flight Plan

     These describe your objectives, takeoff and landing points, and the Rules
     of Engage,ment (what you should and shouldn't destroy).
       A wise pilot also investigates the other options. If you wish to, see
     "Intelligence Briefing" on page 29 for details.
        Arming Complete: You'll use the default armament, so highlight and
     select the ARMING COMPLETE option on this screen.
        Bgin Mission: Highlight and select the BEGIN MISSION option to start
     your training mission.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Helpful Hints:

        No Danger: In practise missions, enemy weapons do no damage. You can
     safely ignore enemy aircraft and missiles. In addition, the "No Crash"
     selection means you cannot crash into the ground and will "bounce" over
     any hills you hit.
        Furthermore, you have an automatic radar altimeter that tries to keep
     you above 200'. However, it onlu makes mild corrections, and is
     therefore helpless if you make truly wild maneuvers.
        "Pause": To use this tutorial best, pause the simulation and read just
     the next few paragraphs, then "un-pause" and resume action for a short
     period. Whenever you're confused, just pause. Note that tapping any key
     (except pause) will "un-pause" and resume the action.
        Resupply: In training scenarios (only) you can get an infinite supply
     of fuel and ammunition. Each time you tap the RESUPPLY key, your fuel
     tank is filled to maximum and your ammunition is increased to the maximum
     possible level. This option is especially useful in target practise.
        A Light Touch: Usa a light touch on the CONTROL STICK. The most common
     pilot error is a "ham-fist" on the stick, throwing the plane around the
     sky in uncontrolled abandon. Only emergencies should cause you to "peg"
     your stick (push it up against the stoppers, beyond which it cannot
     move).
        Chasing the Gauges: When you roll an aircraft left or right, pitch it
     up or down, change the throttle, the flaps, or the brakes, it takes
     awhile for the plane to "settle out". Good pilots fly by making a change,
     then wait a couple of seconds to see the results. If you don't, you'll
     just "chase gauges" that are themselves still changing.
                                                                      - 12 -

     Airspeed settles out much more slowly than other settings. It takes time
     for your plane to build up velocity or lose momentum in level flight.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Familiarization: the Cockpit and the HUD:

        The Controls: Place the appropriate keyboard overlay on your computer
     keyboard. It shows all the controls for your F-19.
        The HUD: The upper half of your screen represents the transparent HUD
     (head-up display), through which you can see the world beyond. The
     various symbols and numbers are described on pages 35-37.
        The HUD has three operating modes: NAV for navigation, AIR-AIR for
     aerial combat, and AIR-GROUND for ground attacks. Tap the HUD MODES key
     to toggle through the three settings. Also note that in the AIR-AIR and
     AIR-GROUND modes the exact symbols depend on the current ordnance. Tap
     SELECT ORDNANCE to toggle through your weapons. If you're unsure of what
     weapons you have on board, tap the ORDNANCE key to see a graphic display
     in your cockpit.
        The Cockpit: The lower half of your screen represents the cockpit of
     your aircraft. The various elements are described on pages 38-39. We
     suggest you toggle through the various CRT displays to get familiar with
     them.
        The left-side CRT has two different map displays. Tap the CRT MAPS
     key to toggle between them.
        The right-side CRT either shows a camera view or a data screen, as
     you prefer. The data displays include:

        DATA key: data on target you're tracking
        ORDNANCE key: the weapons currently in your weapons bays.
        SYSTEM DAMAGE key: which systems (if any) are damaged.
        SELECT WAR PT key: list of the current INS waypoints, including the
     one you're currently being steered toward.
        CHANGE WAY PT key: list of the four INS waypoints, which you can
     change on the satellite/radar map (on the other CRT).
        RESET WAY PT key: resets waypoints to the initial defaults.
        ILS key: toggles instrument landing system graphics on and off the HUD.
        MISSION key: brief summary of your mission order.
        The CRT camera views are a zoom TV (day) or FLIR (night) image of your
     target, with its name, range and bearing superimposed. The camera is
     limited to 80-100 km range (less at night). You have these viewing
     options:

        CAM AHEAD key: aims cameras at nearest standard target ahead.
        CAM REAR key: aims cameras at nearest standard target behind.
        CAM LEFT key: aims cameras at nearest standard target to left.
        CAM RIGHT key:  aims cameras at nearest standard target to right.
        SELECT TARGET key: toggles through all standard targets in current
                           direction.
        DESIGNATE NEW TARG key: aims forward camera at nearest target (any
     type) ahead. For more information on the tracking camera system, see
     pages 43-44.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Takeoff:

     Your mission starts aboard the aircraft carrier America sailing on a
     southerly course in the central Mediterranean. The preflight checklist
     for your F-19
                                                                      - 13 -
     Stealth Fighter is:
        Check your INS system. Tap the CRT MAPS key to display the
     satellite/radar map on your left-side cockpit CRT. Next tap the SELECT
     WAY PT key to display the INS waypoints on the right-side CRT. Look up on
     the HUD and note on the heading indicator the location of the INS
     Direction Indicator, You must fly in this direction to reach the first
     waypoint.
        Check Armament: Check your ordnance (tap the ORDNANCE key) on the
     right-side CRT. As you use the SELECT ORDNANCE key to toggle through the
     weapons, note the active weapon in the lower left corner of the HUD.
        Extend the Flaps by tapping the FLAPS key. Note the "FLAPS" indicator
     in the lower right corner of the HUD, Flaps give you more lift during
     takeoff.
        Check the Catapult System: When launching from an aircraft carrier, as
     you are now, the brakes must be set. This represents attaching the
     aircraft to the deck's steam catapult. If the HUD does not show "BRAKE"
     in the lower right corner, tap the BRAKE key to set the brakes and engage
     the catapult.
        Start the Engines: Turn on your engines by tapping the MAX PWR key.
     Notice the throttle power indicator rising on the far left side of the
     cockpit.
        Activate Catapult: When the throttle indicator shows maximum power,
     tap the BRAKE key. This release the brakes and catapult, hurtling you off
     the deck.
        Accelerate Past Stall Speed: As you zoom down the deck, watch the
     speed scale (left side of the HUD) very carefully. A colored bar on that
     scale will gradually drop down. This is the stall speed indicator. When
     the stall speed bar drops below the center tick on the scale your plane
     is past stall speed. You are travelling fast enough to get into the air.
        Climb: Once you're more than 10 kts faster than the stall speed, pull
     back on the stick a bit to point your nose upward. Be firm, but don't
     pull all the way. Once the nose is skyward, release the stick. Watch the
     altitude scale on the right side of the HUD: you'll start climbing. Don't
     climb so steeply you lose sight of the horizon. That can cause a stall.
        You must start climbing by the time you reach the end of the carrier
     deck. Otherwise you'll plunge into the sea.
        Retract Landing Gear: Once you're airborne, immediately tap the GEAR
     key to retract your landing gear. Don't leave the gear down - high speeds
     can rip off your landing gear.
        Retract Flaps: Tap the FLAPS key to retract your flaps. You no longer
     need the extra lift. Again, high speeds can rip off the flaps, causing
     serious damage to your wings.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flying to the Target:

        Level Flight: Once airborne your first step is to echieve level
     flight. Push the control stick forward or back until the horizon is level
     across the middle of the HUD. Then make fine adjustments until the round
     flight path indicator (on the HUD) cuts through the middle of the horizon
     and you're neither gaining nor losing altitude.
                                                                      - 14 -

        Don't confuse the nose indicator with the flight path indicator (see
     illustration on page 34). Always use the flight path to aim your plane
     (even though the indicator bounces around some). Do not use the nose
     indicator, since a plane's nose and its flight path rarely point in
     exactly the same direction! 
        Since this is a stealth mission, you want level flight at 500' to
     1000'. Look at the altimeter (strip gauge on the right side of the HUD).
     If you're above the lk mark (1000') you're to high. Push the nose down
     into a gentle dive until you reach the desired altitude. Then level out
     and again place the flight path indicator on the horizon.
        Flying on Course: Now it's time to get onto the right course. Look at
     the heading indicator across the top of your HUD, and the INS Sirection
     Indicator (the small, bright triangle somewhere on the top of the scale).
     Turn toward the indicator. As you turn the triangle moves toward the
     center; when the triangle is in the center of the scale you're "on
     course" to the first waypoint.
        To turn, gently pull the stick left or right. The plane will bank.
     Release (center) the stick when the bank angle is about 45o. To increase
     the rate of turn you can pull back on the stick somewhat. As you do this,
     watch your speed (on the left on the HUD) and altitude (on the right). A
     turn with backpressure can slow your plane and rob you of lift, causing
     altitude loss.
        MINIMUM SAFE speed varies with the current situation of your aircraft.
     A "stall indicator" bar will rise from the bottom of the scale when you
     travel too slowly. If this bar reaches the tick-mark in the center of the
     scale, your plane is stalling. In a stall the plane is no longer
     airworthy, and begins to fall out of control, do not stall the plane.
        If you do stall the plane, lower your nose to regain airspeed, then
     pull out into level flight.
        MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDE is about 200'. However, in this training mission
     stay at 500' above the ground.
        Autopilot: If you're hopelessly confused about which direction to fly,
     and how to do it, just tap the AUTOPILOT key. It will take over
     immediately, turning you onto the current course. If you're below 500'
     the autopilot will climb to that altitude. If you touch the control stick
     the autopilot automatically turns off.
        Enjoying the Flight: Once on course, enjoy yourself by trying out all
     the nifty viewpoints available. You can return to the cockpit at any
     time: just tap the COCKPIT key.
        You can see out the front, rear and sides of the cockpit canopy using
     the VIEW AHEAD, VIEW REAR, VIEW LEFT, and VIEW RIGHT keys. These keys
     assume you are looking past the cockpit area. They give a nearly
     unobstructed view of the outside landscape. In mountain valleys and over
     urban areas the scene can be quite thrilling.
       You can also step "outside" your aircraft and watch it using the CHASE
     PLANE, SLOT VIEW, and SIDE VIEW keys. Bank the plane left and right to
     observe the difference between the chase plane (where you appear to be
     in a plane following in the "footsteps" of the F-19) and the slot (where
     you remain behind
                                                                      - 15 -

     the F-19 and always remain level). Although the chase plane is more
     visually exciting, the slot view is handy when learning aerobatics.
        The TACTI VIEW, INVRS TACTI and MISSILE VIEWS are used in combat
     situations. See pages 31-33 for more detailed description of these
     options.
        Passing the First Waypoint: When you reach the first waypoint you'll
     see a message in your HUD. Your INS system immediately switches to the
     next waypoint, which is your primary target. If it isn't (because you've
     accidentally changed the waypoints) just tap RESET WAY PT. This resets
     the waypoints to the starting default, with waypoint #2 at your primary
     target and waypoint #3 at the secondary target.
        Extra Fuel: You'll notice that one of the four items in your weapons
     bay is an extra fuel tank. This is because the mission from the CV
     America, to Tripoli, and then to Sigonella in Sicily, is a very lon trip.
        To see your fuel status, tap the SELECT WAY PT key. The bar gauge
     across the bottom shows the fuel on hand. The dark area at the right end
     of the bar is fuel consumed already. The four bands in the middle
     represent the amount of fuel needed to reach each of the four waypoints.
     Fuel calculation is based on your current altitude and speed. The final
     band to the left represents the amount of spare (reserve) fuel available.
        Your jets engines cannot draw fuel directly from the extra tank. They
     can only draw fuel from the regular, main tanks. Therefore, to use the
     extra fuel you must pump it from the extra tank into the main tank.
        To accomplish this task, first tap the SELECT ORDNANCE key until the
     extra fuel is the current weapon. You can tell this by the text in the
     lower left corner of the HUD. You can also change the right-side CRT to
     display the weapons and highlight the current one by tapping the
     ORDNANCE key.
        Now that fuel is selected, tap the FIRE ORDNANCE key to "fire" the
     fuel from the spare into the main tank. If you tap the SELECT WAY PT
     key once more, you'll see the fuel status has changed.
        Accelerate Time: If you find the journey somewhat dull, you can speed
     the passing of time by tapping the ACCEL TIME key. This doubles the rate
     at which time passes. To return to normal time, simply tap the NORM TIME
     key. Combat activity or landing automatically returns you to normal time.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Attacking the Target:

        Once you are well past the first waypoint and the coast of Libya is
     on the horizon, it's time to start thinking about the target.
        Check the Tactical Situation: Switch your left-side cockpit CRT to the
     gridded tactical map (tap the CRT MAPS key). Your target is a radar
     station, so look for a radar symbol on this map.
        Acquire the Target: Switch your HUD to AIR-GROUND mode (tap the HUD
     MODES key until it comes up), then tap the CAM AHEAD key. If your target
     doesn't appear in the right-side CRT, tap the SELECT TARGET key until it
     does. If you cycle through every targets and still don't see the primary,
     you're either too far away to see it or you're somehow flying in the
     wrong direction.
                                                                      - 16 -

        Select your Weapon: Tap the SELECT ORDNANCE key until the weapon in
     the lower left corner of the HUD reads "2 AGM-65D" and/or "2 Maverick".
        Wait for Range, Altitude and Missile Lock: You'll notice that a box
     appears in the HUD. This is the "target box"; the target seen on the
     zoom TV CRT is in the middle of this box.
        When you get within launch range for a missile this box changes to an
     oval shape. In addition, "Missile Lock" flashes on the right-side CRT.
        The oval shape means your missile can hit if you attack at maximum
     speed. If you wait longer, eventually the oval changes color. This means
     the missile can hit regardless of your speed. Of course, if you fire the
     missile at an inappropriate target, it might hit but not cause damage -
     the ability of weapons to destroy targets is summarized on page 131.
        It's important that you not launch a weapon too low. You may be caught
     in your own bomb blast, or a missile may hit the ground before its motor
     can power it up and away. A simple rule to get you started is that
     missiles and retarded bombs require at least 500' altitude, free-fall and
     laser bombs 3000'.
        Launch: When you have "Missile Lock", open the weapons bay (tap the
     BAY DOORS key), then launch the missile by tapping the FIRE ORDNANCE key.
     After launching, turn away slightly, since flying through and exploding
     target could damage your aircraft.
        Shortly thereafter the missile should hit the target. A successful hit
     causes a fire and sends a cloud of smoke up into the sky.
        The Secondary Target: You can now fly to the secondary target and
     attack it as well, using the same procedure. Or, if you wish, you can
     call it quitz and immediately start for home.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Return Trip:

        Setting the INS to the Landing Point: Tap the RESET WAY PT key and
     then the SELECT WAY PT key. The reset way point insures that the default
     waypoints are now loaded in your INS (inertial navigation system).
        Now examine the list of waypoints on the right-side cockpit CRT. There
     are four waypoints listed. If the bottom (forth) point is not
     highlighted, tap the NEXT POINT key until it is highlighted. This
     switches the INS and waypoints system to that point. The last point on
     the default list is always your return base.
        Flying Home:  You can either use the autopilot or manually fly the
     plane home. As before, guide yourself using the heading scale (horizontal
     scale at the top of the HUD). When the INS Direction Indicator triangle
     is lined up on the center of this scale, you're on course toward your
     home base.
        If you look at the map, you'll notice there's a small island (Malta)
     just south of Sicily. You should steer just east (to the right) of Malta.
     As you near Malta, change your HUD to NAV mode (tap the HUD MODES key),
     then tap the CAM AHEAD key. If the Sigonella airbase comes up on the
     right-side CRT, fine, this is your destination! However, it's likely that
     Halfar airfield on Malta will appear instead (since it's closer).
     Therefore, tap SELECT TARGET until Sigonella appears.
        The Satellite/Radar map on the left side CRT may help you see this
     better. Tap the CRT MAPS key if the tactical display (the gridded map)
     is still on the left-
                                                                      - 17 -

     side CRT. You can enlarge and reduce either map by tapping the ZOOM and
     UNZOOM keys.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Landing at Sigonella Airbase:

     About 50 km from Sigonella start lining up your approach for landing.
        Level Flight: First achieve level flight at 500' to 100' altitude.
        ILS: Next, turn on the ILS (instrument landing system) by tapping the
     ILS key. A horizontal and vertical bar appear on your HUD. These ILS
     symbols represent your position in relationship to the "glide slope". The
     glide slope is an invisible "beam" that angles out and up from the end of
     the runway. First you'll line up beneath this glide slope, and then
     follow it into the airbase, eventually intercepting the descending slope
     line and following it down to the end of the airstrip. For more
     information on ILS systems, see "Using the ILS" on page 42 and
     especially page 52.
        Line Up Your Approach: If the vertical bar is left or right of your
     HUD nose indicator, turn about 90o in that direction and fly until the
     bar start moving toward the center. Then turn toward Sigonella. You want
     to get back onto a course od 000o just as the bar centers on the HUD.
     However, don't worry if the bar is a off center. As long as Sigonella is
     dead ahead the vertical bar will gradually creep toward the center.
     However, if the bar is moving away from the center, it's a sign you're
     travelling away from the glide slope - in that case turn the other way
     to correct the problem.
        Reduce Speed: Now cut your throttle back to about 50% power (tap the
     DECR key a few times). Your speed will graduallu decrease. To maintain
     level flight you'll have to pitch up your nose a bit (watch the altimeter
     on the right side of the HUD).
        Extend Flaps: When your speed reaches about 300 kts, tap the FLAPS
     key. This extends the flaps (notice that "FLAPS" appears on the HUD).
     This slows you further and gives you more lift. You'll have to readjust
     the nose a little to maintain level flight.
        Lower Gear & Reduce Speed Again:  Tap the GEAR key to lower your
     landing gear. You can visually check that the gear is down by tapping
     the SIDE VIEW key. Return to the cockpit view by tapping the COCKPIT key.
     You can also check this by the color of the "GEAR" light on the left
     side of the cockpit (see the Technical Supplement for the color key).
        Now cut the throttle back to about 40% power. As your speed gradually
     decreases you'll have to raise the nose to maintain level flight. By
     this time you should be close to the glide slope, and travelling about
     200 to 250 kts with your speed still decreasing.
        If you're moving too fast, tap the BRAKES key (to open your air
     brakes), then a few seconds later tap it again to close the airbrakes.
     Do not leave the airbrake open, it may cause you to stall and crash
     later.
        Intercept the Glide Slope: As you get near the airfield, the
     horizontal ILS bar begins to move downward on the HUD. When the bar
     approaches the HUD nose indicator center (the middle of the HUD), pitch
     your nose down a little.
                                                                      - 18 -

     Your objective is to go into a gradual descent that keeps the bar
     centered in the middle of your HUD (crossing the center of the HUD nose
     indicator). To avoid gaining speed in the descent, reduce your power
     (DECR key) a tap or two.
        As the airstrip comes up, first check youe speed. You should be
     travelling 150-200 kts, or decreasing from 250 kts towards 200 kts.
        If your speed is above 250 kts, you're coming in too "hot" (too fast).
     Go to maximum throttle (tap MAX PWR), retract your landing gear and
     flaps, and try again: fly to Malta, turn around there, and start over.
        If your speed is too low, look at the stall bar (the colored bar
     rising from the bottom of the airspeed gauge). If the stall bar is close
     to the middle of the scale, you're getting into trouble. Tap the INCR
     power key once or twice.
        Touch Down: If your speed is correct (150-200 kts), start watching
     the altimeter. It should be at 300' to 100' and decreasing. Make small
     adjustments with the control stick to keep the descent rate steadily, but
     not too fast. The runway is at 0' altitude. When you hear the squel of
     your wheels on the pavement, tap the BRAKES key instantly, then shut off
     the engines by tapping the NO PWR key. You've just made a safe landing.

                              The Second Mission:
     ========================================================================
        On your second practise mission it's time to learn about enemy radars,
     aircraft and missiles. Select exactly the same options as the first
     mission - you'll fly the same strike against a Tripoli radar station, but
     now you must worry about the enemy too.
        Mission Planning: Before takeoff, check out the intelligence briefing
     in more detail. Highlight the RADAR SITES option and select it. An
     overlay of concentric circles appears on the map. Each solid circle is a
     doppler radar, each dotted circle a pulse radar. Moving the CONTROLLER
     left and right cycles through each radar station, giving you additional
     data.
        This screen helps you plan a route to Tripoli and back. Remember, the
     waypoints in your airplane are the default route shown on the map. You
     may wish to fly a different route, to evade enemy detection as much as
     possible.
        Basically, you avoid detection by doppler radars if you arc around
     them, keeping a constant range to the radar. You avoid detection by
     pulse radars if you fly directly toward or away from them. For more
     information about this see "Radar & Stealth, Stealth Tactics" starting
     on page 76.
        When you're done, you should hav a mental "map" in your head of
     where enemy radars are, how you'll fly through them to avoid detection,
     and what weapons you'll use where to achieve your objectives.
        Adjusting Waypoints: After you select BEGIN MISSION, but before you
     takeoff, you may wish to adjust the waypoints to fit your new mission
     plan. The first waypoint, by default, is half way between your takeoff
     point and the primary target. Most pilots adjust this point.
        To make adjustments, first tap the CRT MODES key until the colored
     satellite map appears on the left-side cockpit CRT. Then tap the CHANGE
     WAY PT key to
                                                                      - 19 -

     display the waypoints list on the right-side CRT (and, incidentally, the
     waypoints course plan on the left-side CRT). Use the ADJUST WAYPOINTS
     keys to move the waypoint around the map. Notice that the course lines
     automatically "snap" to the new waypoint as you move it. If you don't
     like your adjustments, just tap RESET WAY PT. This resets all the
     waypoints to the initial default.

        Default waypoint settings always are:
        Waypoint #1: halfway between takeoff point and primary objective.
        Waypoint #2: the primary objective.
        Waypoint #3: the secondary objective.
        Waypoint #4: the landing point.

        Flying to the Target: After takeoff, as you fly to the target, watch
     the radar patterns on the satellite/radar map (on the left-side CRT).
     Enemy radar signals are displayed graphically. Dotted arcs are pulse
     radars, solid arcs are doppler radars. Ground search radars are entire
     360o circles, while ground fire-control tracking radars are short arcs.
     Aircraft radars, search or fire-control, are short arcs (except for
     AWACS aircraft that have entire 360o circle).
        Missiles and aircraft also appear on this map as color-coded dots.
     See the Technical Supplement for details.
        You'll notice that enemy aircraft with their forward-facing radars
     may complicate your original plan for penetrating enemy air defenses.
     You'll have to sneak behind or underneath the enemy.
        Flying Stealthy: Now that you understand the situation, it's time to
     watch the EMV (electro-magnetic visibility) scale.
        The "visibility" of your plane to enemy radar appears as a bar rising
     from the bottom of this gauge. Your visibility increases as you climb to
     higher altitudes, increase speed, open bay doors, lower gear, or use
     jammers.
        The bars coming down from the top of the scale are incoming enemy
     radar signals. Ground-based radars appear on the left, aircraft radars on
     the right. The bar color represents whether the radar sees you or not
     (see the Technical Supplement for a color key). Bar colors match the
     radar arc colors that appear on the Satgellite/Radar map (on the
     left-side CRT).
        You want to fly low (about 200') to keep your EMV small. You want to
     fly toward or away from pulse radars (especially the strongest!), and fly
     at a constant distance (arcing around) doppler radars. This keeps the
     enemy signal weak (i.e, reduces the size of their "bars" coming down the
     gauge).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Warnings:

        Eventually, though, you may make a mistake, or a previously silent
     enemy radar may suddenly turn on. Even if enemy radars don's see you, a
     successful attack always alerts them.
        Search Warning: Enemy search radar detects your plane when the enemy
     radar strength bar overlaps your EMV bar.
        Search detection means that enemy fighters are vectored toward your
     location, and that any surface-to-missile (SAM) batteries in the area
     start
                                                                      - 20 -

     tracking you as a target.
        Tracking Warning: Long-range and medium-range SAMs must track a target
     with radar before firing. Tracking radar appears as a short, norrow arc
     on the Satellite/Radar map.
        When the enemy tracks you, the "TRAK" warning is lighted in the
     cockpit.
        Some short range enemy missiles do not use a radar tracking system.
     Therefore, "TRAK" is not a foolproof warning of impending attack.
        Missile Warning Light: If a radar-homing missile is launched toward
     you, the "R" missile warning light flashes in the cockpit. If an IR
     (infrared) homing missile is launched toward you, the "I" missile
     warning light flashes.
        The appropriate light continues to flash as long as the missile is
     homing on your plane. If jammers or some other device confuse the
     missile, the light goes off. If the missile later finds you again and
     starts homing once more, the light begins flashing again.
        If two or more missiles of the same type are homing on you, that
     light continues to flash as long as any missile is homing.
        Missile warning lights are very important, since they're the only way
     to tell what kind of missile is attacking. The type of attacking missile
     (radar or infrared) determines what sort of defenses you should use.
        Missile Proximity Klaxon: When a missile approaches within a few
     seconds flight time of your plane, the proximity klaxon goes off. This
     very loud signal means you must do something, immediately, or you'll be
     hit. Typically you'll drop a chaff or flare cartridge, depending on the
     type of threat (chaff for radar missiles, flares for IR missiles).
     However, you can also attempt some last-second maneuvering.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Missile Defenses:

        When the TRAK or missile warning lights go off, it's time to warm up
     your missile defense, since an attack is incoming.
        Understand the Attack: The first step is to check out the attack.
     Switch the left-side cockpit CRT to the tactical display (tap the CRT
     MAPS key). Use the ZOOM and UNZOOM keys until the you find a useful
     scale. Missiles are small color-coded lines (see the Technical
     Supplement for a color key).
        Disppearing: If you're attacked by radar-guided missiles (either the
     "TRAK" light is on, or the "R" missile warning is lighted), you can
     evade the attack by reducing your EMV or lowering the enemy radar's
     effectiveness (or both). If the enemy radar loses sight of you, the
     missile loses guidance and flies on blindly.
        Decoys: Your F-19 carries only three decoys. To launch a decoy, tap
     the DECOY key. The "DCY" light in the cockpit turns on, and remains
     lighted while the decoy is running.
        Each decoy is a computer-controlled "imitation" of your aircraft that
     is easier for the enemy to detect and lock onto. Enemy missiles, aircraft
     and radars will follow the decoy, thinking it's you. Meanwhile you can
     pour on the speed and escape. Eventually the enemy will discover the
     ploy and start
                                                                      - 21 -

     looking for you again. The amount of time varies with the skill of the
     enemy. The"DCY" light in the cockpit remains lighted while the decoy is
     functional.
        Jammers: Use the ECM jammer against radar-guided missiles (missiles
     that light the "R" warning). Tap the ECM key to toggle the ECM jammer on
     and off.
        Use the IR jammer against IR guided missiles (those which lightthe
     "I" warning). Tap the IR JAMMER key to toggle the IR jammer on and off.
        After you turn on the jammer, change to a different course and get
     away from the missile. If you don't, when you turn off the jammer (or
     when an advanced missile gets close close enough to "burn through" your
     jammer), the missile starts homing on you again! Advanced missiles that
     "burn through" jamming include semi-active radar missiles, command
     guidance radar missiles, and second generation IR missiles.
        Don't leaveyour jammers running. The ECM jammer increases your EMV,
     while the IR jammer reduces your speed. In addition, the IR jammer can
     overheat, causing it to automatically shut down until it cools off.
        Chaff and Flares: A chaff or flare cartridge decoys a missile for two
     or more seconds. During that time the missile flies toward the chaff (if
     a radar homing missile) or the flare (if an IR homing missile).
        Fire a chaff cartridge (tap the CHAFF key) when a radar-guided
     missile sets your missile warning klaxon and "R" warning light.
        Fire a flare cartridge (tap the FLARE key) when an infrared or
     visually guided missile sets causes off your missile warning klaxon and
     "I" warning light.
        Maneuvering: Missiles only have a 45o forward "view". If you're
     outside of this arc, the missile cannot track you. Therefore, if you
     "blind" the missile with a decoy, jammer, chaff, or flare, then fly
     outside its arc, the missile may lose you and fly away. Some missiles,
     unfortunately, can circle around for another pass.
        Missiles also have very wide turning circles. You can "turn inside" a
     missile, causing it zoom past you. See "outmaneuvering a Missile" on
     pages 87-88 for more details.

     Advanced Combat: Weapons & Techniques:

        You'll want to try various waepons against land and air targets on
     this mission.
        To learn the more about weapons, read the "Weaponry" section on pages
     43-45. Then turn to "How to Fight" on pages 56-63 for more details and
     specific instructions. Additional background and sophisticated tactics
     are explained in "Air-to-Ground Tactics" (pages 78-88) and "Air-to-Air

     Duty Roster

        On the "Duty Roster" you can start a new career or continue an
     existing one. Instructions appear on the screen. Note that if you erase
     a pilot's name here, the results are permanent.
        You cannot save pilot records unless you follow the installation
     instruction. See the Technical Supplement. Here you see your current

                                                                      - 25 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Mission Assignment

     mission assignment. You can either accept these, or request a change. If
     you accept the assignment you go directly to the intelligence briefing
     for the current mission.
        If you request a change, you'll see a variety of options, starting
     with which region of the world you prefer. Requests for a changed
     assignment are not held against you (scoring and promotion are not
     affected).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Region of the World

        Here you select one of four regions for your new assignment.
        LIBYA is a modernately challenging client state of the Sovie Union.
     In the recent past the Libyan government has been one of the main
     supporters international terrorism, and on the receiving end of Amercan
     air and naval air attacks
        Training missions in Libya are fixed. Strike training is always a
     mission from the USS America to Triopoli; Air-Air training is always an
     interception of fighters patrolling over Benghazi.
        PERSIAN GULF: This region is a slightly more complex and challenging
     situation. Iran is a radical, revolutionary state involved in a long war
     with Iraq, as well as numerous shooting incidents with the US Navy.
        NORTH CAPE & CENTRAL EUROPE: These regions are the most challenging.
     Here the full strength and power of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact
     are opposed by numerically inferior but qualitatively superior NATO
     forces (including your F-19). Should superpower skirmishing or a
     full-blown World War III occur, victory and defeat would hinge on events
     in these two regions.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Level of Conflict

        The level of conflict in the region has a dramatic effect on how you
     must fly your missions. Each type of conflict has its own challanges. No
     choice is easier than another. In general, the hotter the war situation,
     the more violent and frenetic the situation, while cold war demands
     careful planning and good judgement - different skills, but no less
     important ones!
        COLD WAR means clandestine missions. Flying without being detected is
     paramount. If you are detected, you must destroy the plane or radar
     which saw you. However, the more you use weapons, especially against any
     other targets, the greater the scandal, and the less successful your
     mission. In fact, many missions in the cold war involve photo
     reconnaissance, flying secret materials in or out, or surgicially
     "removing" a single, specific target.
        In the COLD WAR stealthy flying is crucial. Foryunately, enemy radars
     and SAMs aren't expecting trouble. They often confirm a contact many
     times before attacking.
        LIMITED WAR missions are also clandestine. It is still important to
     fly without being seen, but since warfare is ongoing, military targets
     are fair game now. However, be careful to avoid hitting civiliance and
     clandestine spy missions. In limited war enemy radar operators expect
     some trouble. Their reactions are slightly faster.
                                                                      - 26 -
     CONVENTIONAL WAR is all-out conflict. Inflicting the maximum destruction
     upon the enemy is the main objective here. Avoiding detection has no
     political importance, but is useful if you want to survive the mission!
     Any target in enemy territory is fair game, military or civilian.
     However, enemy air defense operators rarely confirm their targets - in
     wartime everybody shoots first and asks questions afterward!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Type of Mission

        You may select from two types of "real" missions and two types of
     "training" missions. Training missions represent flying a flight
     simulator instead of flying a real aircraft.
        AIR-TO-AIR MISSIONS have an enemy aircraft as your primary objective.
     If you're a hotshot with AAMs (air-to-air missile) and dogfighting, this
     is your cup of tea. However, the secondary objective is often a ground
     target.
        STRIKE MISSIONS have a ground target as the primary objective, and
     usually as your secondary objective too.
        TRAINING MISSIONS generate normal air-to-air or strike missions, as
     appropriate, with three exceptions:
        (1) NO DAMAGE: You cannot be hurt be enemy enemy fire. Hits inflict
     no damage on your aircraft.
        (2) NO SCORE: You are not scored for the mission. You receive no
     rating points, no decorations, no promotions. After all, the mission
     wasn't real! On the other hand, a poor showing doesn't bring down your
     average (as it might after a real mission).
        (3) LIBYA: If you selected Libya, your specific mission orders are
     always against a ground target in Tripoli, Air-to-Air missions are
     always against fighters over Benghazi. If you're just learning to fly
     and fight the F-19, this feature allows you to try the same mission over
     and over, until you understand fully what's happening.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Opponent Quality

        The quality of your opponents controls the difficulty of the simulation.
     The better your opponents, the more difficult your job, but the greater
     your rewards.
     Your score is significantly affected by this option.
        Selecting regular or green opponents reduces your score, making
     promotions slower and putting the highest medals out of your reach.
     Selecting elite opponents increases your score, speeding up promotions
     and making medals easier.
        Green Opponents: Here the enemy has older aircraft and SAMs. His
     radar sets are poorly maintained and frequently out of order. Radar
     operators only understand the rudiments, and therefore are very bad at
     understanding the sometimes strange signals given off by your plane
     (allowing you to fly closer to them without being spotted). Enemy pilots
     have virtually no skill in aerobatics and dogfighting (just flying the
     plane is a big challange for them).
        Regular Opponents: Here the enemy has missile and SAMs appropriate to
     the region: older equipment for third world and client states, more
     modern equipment when you face a uperpower directly. Radar operators are
     trained
                                                                      - 27 -
     and drilled, but lack combat experience. Enemy pilots have practiced
     mock dogfights and aerobatics, but lack the quick perception and
     aggressive maneuvering of combat veteran.
        Veteran Opponents: Here the enemy has aircraft and SAMs appropriate
     to the region, like regulars, but tend to use only the better equipment
     in combat (veterans realize the futility of using absolescent weapons
     against a first class enemy like you!). Radar operators are experienced,
     with a good sense of judgement that makes your job harder. Enemy pilots
     are skilled dogfighters, often with a few kills to their credit. Except
     fast, aggressivemoves from them.
        Elite Opponents: Here you face the enemy's best. Elite troops always
     get the best available equipment. Radar operators know their equipment
     inside out, and can interpret your faint, confusing returns only too
     well. Enemy pilots are often aces who know every trick in the book, and
     aren't above inventing new tricks where they can. Dogfighting against
     these guys is the ultimate challange.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flight Performance

        No Crashes: This is the ideal choice when learning to fly. Your F-19
     literally cannot crash. In a crash situation it just rights itself and
     keeps on going. If you hit a mountainside you're bounced upwards and
     keep on going. When landing you can hit the ground as hard as you like
     and still survive. Unless you're landing (i.e., with landing gear down),
     an automatic barometic altimeter keeps your plane above 200',
     simplifying low-level flying.
        However, enemy weapons are not affected by this choice. If your plane
     is shot out of the sky by guns or missiles, it will crash and kill you
     (unless you successfully eject first).
        Your score is significantly reduced if you select this option, making
     promotions and medals hard to get.
        Easy Landings: This is the pregferred choice of casual, weekend
     flyers. Safe landing parameters are relaxed considerably, which makes
     one of the toughest jobs (landing a really hot jet) much easier. To
     avoid a crash you must touch down a runway, aircraft carrier, or
     prepared landing strip. Hittingthe ground or water anywhere else
     destroys the plane. As in "No Crashes", an automatic barometic altimeter
     keeps your plane above 200' unless you're landing (i.e., with landing
     gear down).
        Exact landing parameters are shown on the screen. You may wish to
     copy these down for future reference.
        Your score is only slightly reduced if you select this option.
     Promotions are not materially affected, and you can quality for all but
     the highest medals.
        Realistic Landings: This is the real experience, in full. You must be
     skilled and "in practice" to be consistenly successful with realistic
     landings. Coming down too fast (either vertically or horizontally) can
     mean instant death.
        Exact landing parameters are shown on the screen. You may wish to
     copy these down for future reference.
                                                                      - 28 -
        Your score is full value if you select this option. If all other
     selections are of similar difficulty, you gain higher rank and medals
     quickly.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        On this screen move the CONTROLLER up and down to highlight one of
     the options below. Then press the SELECTOR to toggle that option's data
     on and off the map. When an option's data on and off the map. When an
     option's data is visible, moving the CONTROLLER left or right cycles
     through specific data on each item.
        This screen, with its great variety of information, is the perfect
     place to plan your mission. You may wish to yake notes about especially
     dangerous enemies, or the route you have in mind.
        Your takeoff point (T), primary target (P), secondary target (S), and
     landing point (L) are always visible on the briefing map, as reference
     points.
        Mission Targets: This presents a detailed description of your
     operational orders, with specific information about the primary and
     secondary objectives. You should also look at your flight plan (below)
     for additional information.
        Radar Sites: The SELECTOR toggles radar sites on and off the map.
     You can use the Controller to cycle through data on each site in turn.
        Missile Ranges: The SELECTOR toggles missile sites on and off the
     map. You can use the Controller to cycle through data on each site in
     turn.
        Air Bases: The SELECTOR toggles airbase sites on and off the map.
     You can use the Controller to cycle through data on each site in turn.
        Flight Plan: This presents a detailed desccription of your takeoff
     and landing sites, estimated fuel required, and your ROE (Rules of
     Engagement).
        Special Events: This shows any special enemy activity. Areas marked
     as especially active are likely to have lots of small shoulder-launched
     SAMs, and therefore be quite dangerous.
        Exit Briefing Room: This ends the intelligence briefing. You can
     return later if you desire.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        here you can select whatever weaponry and equipment you desire for
     each of your four weapons bay.
        To select a weapon, use the CONTROLLER to move the highlight among
     the weapons, then use the SELECTOR to choose the highlighted weapon.
     Then you must use the CONTROLLER once move to move the highlight among
     the bays (to select which bay will carry the weapon) and press the
     SELECTOR a second time to put the weapon in that bay (removing the
     weapon originally present).
        Note that your estimated fuel required, and current fuel carried,
     appear along the bottom of the aircraft diagram. Make sure you have
     enough fuel to complete the mission!
        Default Armaments: The initial weapons loaded in Bays #1 and #2
     represent your crew chief's choice of ordnance for your mission. The
     weapon in Bay #1 (the upper left graphic) is for the primary target,
     the weapon in Bay #2 (the upper right graphic) is for the secondary
     target. Extra fuel in Bays #3 or #4 represents the crew chief's guess
     that you'll need it, given the distance involved.
                                                                      - 29 -
        Choosing Armamanets: See the "Data Charts" on pages 129-134, for
     details about each weapon. The "Weapon Effectiveness against Common
     Targets" chart, page 131, rates all weapons against all common targets.
     It's wise to carry at least one "A" or "B" rated weapon for the primary
     and secondary objectives.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Final Choices:

        Your final option before leaving the preflight briefing area has the
     following four choices:
        Select New Mission: You can refuse the current mission and ask for a
     new one. There is no penalty involvrd in this, but it's considered a
     cowardly and unpatriotic act that earns the disdain of real fighter
     pilots everywhere.
        Intelligence Briefing: This returns you to the intelligence briefing
     screen, where you can further examine the current situation and orders.
        Arm Your Plane: This returns you to the arming options, where you can
     reconfigure your aircraft as you prefer.
        Begin Mission: When you select this option, you're ready to fly. In
     seconds you'll be in the cockpit, ready to take off.
                                                                      - 30 -
                              Simulation Controls:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        As an aid to learning flight maneuvers, a variety of out-of-plane
     viewpoints are available. In all these views you are outside of your
     aircraft, looking at it and/or the enemy. Many different perspectives
     are available.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Return to the Cockpit

        Press the COCKPIT key to return to the normal in-the-cockpit
     viewpoint.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Slot View

        Press the SLOT VIEW key for this view. It is named after the famous
     "in the slot" position used by aerial acrobatic teams.
        Here you are positioned directly behind the F-19. Unlike the chase
     plane, the viewpoint remains level with the ground, so you can clearly
     see the degree of pitch and roll in the F-19 itself.
        The ZOOM and UNZOOM keys function in this view, moving your viewpoint
     closer to (ZOOM) and farther from (UNZOOM) the F-19.
        This view is an excellent one for learning the most efficient and
     effective flight maneuvers.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Chase Plane View

        Press the CHASE PLANE key for this view.
        Here you are positioned in a "chase aircraft" that follows a short
     distance behind the F-19. As the F-19 accelerates, it will tend to "run
     away" from the chase plane, while when the F-19 slows down it tends to
     "fall back" toward the chase plane.
        Although this view is very dramatic, its use as a teaching and
     learning aid is limited.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Side View

        Press the SIDE VIEW key for this view.
        Here you are positioned to the right side of the F-19. The ZOOM and
     UNZOOM keys function in this view, moving your viewpoint closer (ZOOM)
     or farther from (UNZOOM) the F-19.
        this view can provide a useful reference point. It's also an
     excellent way to check the state of your landing gear. Missile launches
     are most dramatic when seen from this viewpoint.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Tactical View

        Press the TACTI VIEW key for this view.
        Here you are positioned right behind the F-19, looking past it at
     whatever target is being tracked on the plane's HUD. This view
     automatically rotates and pans to keep both the F-19 and its target in
     view.
        The ZOOM and UNZOOM keys function in this view, moving your viewpoint
     closer to (ZOOM) or farther from (UNZOOM) the F-19.
        This view is invaluable when dogfighting. It helps you outmaneuver
     and
                                                                      - 31 -
     line up on an opponent (although it's wise to return to the cockpit
     before shooting, to avoid wasting ammo). The view is also useful if you
     want to return for a second or third attack run on a ground target.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Inverse Tactical View

        Press the INVRS TACTI key for this view.
        Here you are positioned right behind the F-19's target, looking past
     it at the F-19 itself. The target may be another plane, or a ground
     target - whatever your tracking camera is following (see pages 43-44).
     In either case, you see the target in the foreground, and the F-19 far
     away. In fact, often your F-19 is nothing but a dot in the sky. This
     view automatically rotates and pans to keep both the target and the
     F-19 in view.
        The ZOOM and  UNZOOM keys function in this view, moving your
     viewpoint closer to (ZOOM) or farther from (UNZOOM) the F-19's target.
        Experienced pilots find this a very dramatic view when making attack
     runs on ground targets. It's a great showoff view, swinging to follow
     your plane as you fly overhead.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Missile View

        Press the MISSILE VIEW key for this view.
        Here you are positioned directly behind the F-19's active weapon. If
     ordnance is in flight, you are positioned behind the weapon launched
     most recently. If no ordnance is in flight, you are positioned behind
     the plane, and will follow the first item launched.
        The ZOOM and UNZOOM keys function in this view, moving your viewpoint
     closer to (ZOOM) or farther from (UNZOOM) the missile.
        This view is very entertaining, as it lets you follow the weapon
     directly to the target. If you're having trouble understanding why your
     weapons miss, switching to this view after launch can be extremely
     educational.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Standard & Wide-Angle

        The VIEW ANGLE key toggles a 60o standard view arc and a 120o
     wide-angle viewing arc. This inclusion/exclusion of peripheral vision
     applies to all the views above.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Movie Director

        An experienced pilot, flying in training mode, can use these views to
     good effect. By switching between the cockpit and various views, you can
     illustrate what's happening and impress casual bystanders.
        For example you can use the CHASE PLANE view to watch your plane
     launching from the carrier and turning onto course (use the autopilot
     after launch to simplify this). Then switch to SLOT VIEW and show off
     loops, rolls, split-S turns and Immelmans (see pages  94-95 for details
     on these maneuvers). Find an enemy aircraft and use the TACTI VIEW to
     show your plane maneuvering against his. Then switch to INVRS TACTI to
     watch his responses. Before launching a missile go to the SIDE VIEW, to
     watch the weapon dropping away. Then jump to the MISSILE VIEW to follow
     it into the target. The possibilities are as endless as your
     imagination.
                                                                      - 32 -
     ========================================================================
                                 Other Controls
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Pause

        The PAUSE key immediately and instantly freezes the simulation. To
     resume action, press any key. Some computers have a special "pause" or
     "hold" key. Depending on the internal design of your machine, this key
     may also work.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Accelerated Time

        The ACCEL TIME key doubles the rate at which time passes. "ACCEL"
     appears on the HUD. Accelerated time is useful when flying long
     distances without encountering any significant threats or opposition.
        The NORM TIME key returns the simulation ti its normal time rate,
     regardless of what the accelerated rate was. You should return to normal
     time before combat: it's very hard to control and fight your craft in
     accelerated time.
        In combat and landing situations you're automatically returned to
     normal time. Accelerate time automatically stops if either (a) you're
     detected by enemy radar, (b) open a weapons bay, or (c) lower the
     landing gear.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Detail Adjust

        The DETAIL ADJUST key allows you to change the amount and depth of
     ground detail visible through the cockpit. See the Technical Supplement
     for, details. In general, the slower your computer, the lower the level
     of detail you should use.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Volume Adjust

        The VOLUME ADJUST key allows you to change the type and variety of
     sounds used in the simualtion. See the Technical Supplement for details.
     When you press the key, the new sound settings appears briefly on the
     HUD.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Resupply

        The RESUPPLY key is available ONLY in training missions. Pressing
     this key fills the plane's fuel tanks and gives it extra weapons.
     Resupply is designed for sight-seeing and target practice. Needless to
     say, those who prefer realism in simulations (including in training)
     should never touch this option.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     "Boss" Hide Game

        The "BOSS" HIDE GAME key immediately pauses the simulation and clears
     the screen, effectively concealing what software is really running on
     the computer. To resume, you must press the "BOSS" HIDE GAME key again.
        This key is not only useful at the office, but also to forestall
     irate parents, children, spouses, and relatives who complain time you
     spend at the computer.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Save

        There is no "SAVE" key in F-19 Stealth Fighter. Instead the
     simulation automatically saves your record as a pilot whenever you
     leave the pilot roster during the preflight briefing.
        This "automatic save" feature requires you to be using a copy of the
     program (a copy on either a floppy or hard disk), rather than the
     original MicroProse disk from the box. If you are using the original
     disk, you cannot save data, although you can otherwise run the
     simulation normally.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Quit

        The QUIT key immediately ends the simulation. It does not save any
     information to disk, so any accomplishments since the last time you saw
     the pilot roster will be lost.
                                                                      - 33 -

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     terminology

        KEYS: Each control has a name in UPPER CASE letters, which is used
     on the keyboard overlay. A master list of all names and keys also
     appears in the Technical Supplement (in case your overlay is damaged or
     lost).
        CONTROLLER refers to the pointing device used by your computer. This
     may be a mouse, joystick, or cursor keys, depending on your hardware.
     See the Technical Supplement for details.
        SELECTOR refers to the mouse button, joystick trigger, return key, or
     enter key depending on your hardware setup.
        During flight, the function of joystick and mouse buttons are defined
     in the Technical Supplement. For example, on a typical two-button
     joystick, the first button acts as the FIRE CANNON key, the second as
     the FIRE ORDNANCE key.

     ========================================================================
     Head-Up Display (HUD)

     The HUD is designed to provide you, the pilot, with all the crucial
     flying and weapon information in a graphic format. HUD data is projected
     onto a wide angle clear pane in the front of the cockpit. You look
     "through" the HUD display to the situation outside. As a result,
     valuable information is right in front of your eyes, where it is most
     useful.
        See the Technical Supplement for a detailed depiction of the HUD and
     cockpit display.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     HUD Modes

        The HUD display has three modes:  NAV, AIR-AIR, and AIR-GROUND. You
     switch between modes using the HUD MODES key.
        The current HUD mode appears on the bottom center of the HUD display.
        The NAV mode is designed for flying and navigation between airbases.
     In this mode your tracking system is restriced to friendly and neutral
     airbases and aircraft carriers.
        The AIR-GROUND mode is designed for attacking ground targets. Your
     tracking system is restricted to these targets. Although your tracking
     system contains only a limited subset of the possible targets, you can
     temporarily add more using the DISIGNATE NEW TARG key.
        The AIR-AIR mode is designed for attacking aircraft. Your tracking
     system is restricted to these targets only.
        Some HUD information is iuniversal across all modes. Other
     information is specific, available in just one of the modes.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Universal HUD Informtion

        Airspeed appears on the left-side vertical scale, in knots. Beside
     the tickmark showing your current speed is a digital readout of your
     speed.
        Stall Speed Indicator: At times a colored bar rises from the bottom
     of the scale. This bar represents your stall speed. If the bar rises
     above the center tickmark on the scale, your plane has stalled. A
     stalled plane falls out of control for a period of time before the
     automated recovery system takes over. A stall at low altitude is often
     fatal.
                                                                      - 34 -
        Altitude appears on the right-side scrolling vertical scale, in feet
     above average ground level. At 1000' and higher the scale changes to
     thousands  ("2K" means 2000' altitude, "13K" means 12000' altitude,
     etc.). A digital readout of your current altitude appears next to the
     scale's tick-mark.
        VVI Indicator: At times a colored bar extends upward or downward from
     the center tickmark on the altitude scale. This is the VVI (Vertical
     Velocity Indicator).
        If the VVI bar extends downward, your plane is losing altitude. Each
     tickmark represents 100 feet per minute. Therefore, the larger the bar,
     the faster you're going down.
        If the VVI bar extends upward, your plane is gaining altitude. Each
     tickmark represents 100'/min. Therefore, the longer the bar, the faster
     you're going up.
        Landing Speed Indicator: This colored arrow appears only when your
     landing gear is down. It indicates the safe maximum VVI for landing. If
     the VVI bar is below this mark, attempting to land risks a crash.
        Heading: horizontal scale across the top is your heading in degrees.
     North is 000o, East is 090o, South is 180o, and West is 270o.
        INS (Waypoint) Direction Indicator: The colored diamond marker on
     the top of the scale shows the heading you should fly to reach the
     currently selected INS "waypoint". To get "on course", turn until the
     diamond marker is above the middle tickmark on the scale.
        Nose Indicator: This indicator shows the direction you are flying
     (which can be different from the nose indicator!). It is available only
     in the NAV and AIR-GROUND mode. In AIR-AIR mode it is replaced by the
     gunsight.
                                                                      - 35 -
        The plane is geometrically level when the nose indicator and flight
     path indicator overlap. However, this is rare in an aircraft.
     Furthermore, LEVEL FLIGHT (where you are neither climbing or diving)
     often requires the nose to be pitched slightly above the flight path, to
     achieve a useful ANGLE OF ATTACK. See Aerodynamics and Flying
     Techniques, pages 70, for more information.
        G-Indicator: This readout in the upper left corner of the HUD
     indicates the current G-forces on your plane's airframe. In general,
     the plane can withstand more G stress than the pilot, whose limits are
     between -3 G and +9 G, depending on training and experience.
        Pitch Lines are superimposed on the HUD if your nose is pitched so
     far up or down that the horizon is invisible. each major line represents
     10o of pitch up or down. If your aircraft is geometrically level, pitch
     is 0o. If your aircraft is climbing straight up or diving straight down,
     the pitch is 90o.
        ROLL is indicated by the relationship of the horizon or pitch line to
     the cockpit and nose indicator. If the horizon or a pitch line is
     perfectly horizontal, your craft is level. If the line angles to the
     left or right, your craft is rolled to the right or left.
        Current Armament: In the lower left the HUD indicates what weapon is
     currently selected, and the number currently available, such as 3
     Sidewinder AIM-9M missiles, or 2 Slick Mk 82-0 bombs, etc.
        Below this line is the word "Gun" followed by the number of rounds
     currently available. This refers to your 20mm cannon and its remaining
     ammunition. A jam or loss of the gun, should it occur, is noted here
     also.
        Flight Equipment Indicators: If special flight equipment is
     functioning, a note appears on the lower right of the HUD. "FLAPS"
     appears when the flaps are extended. "BRAKE" appears when the airbrake
     is extended or wheelbrake is on.
        Control Stick Box: If you aren't using a physical joystick, the
     control stick locator box appears in the lower right corner of the HUD,
     to help you see the current stick position.
        Radio Messages: Coded burst transmissions arrive by radio
     periodically. These are decoded by your onboard computers and displayed
     as text across the top of the HUD, just underneath the heading scale.
        Tracking Box: Tap the CAM AHEAD key to activate (or reset) the F-19's
     computerized optical tracker. A small box appears around the nearest
     standard target ahead, to help you locate it. The HUD mode determines
     whether ground or air targets are tracked. The CAM REAR, CAM LEFT and
     CAM RIGHT keys set the optical tracker in that direction instead (see
     below). Once the tracker is locked onto a target, it follows that
     target, even if it moves from one quadrant to another. Of course, the
     box is only visible on the HUD when the target is directly in front of
     you.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air-Air Mode Indicators

        Tap the HUD MODES key to change your HUD^into air-air mode.
        Gunsight: In this mode the gunsight circle replaces the flight path
     indicator
                                                                      - 36 -
     The gunsight shows where your shells would be landing if you'd fired two
     seconds ago (the time it takes them to travel the 6 kilometer maximum
     range). If you're tracking a target that's closer than 6 km, it shows
     where the shells would land if you'd fired the proper time in the past
     for them to travel that range. See "How to Fight, the 20mm Cannon"
     (page 57) for details on using the gunsight.
        Missile Targeting Envelope: This is a large but faint circle fixed on
     the HUD. It represents the area of the sky where and air-to-air missile
     can be aimed and "locked on" to a target.
        Tracking Box & Oval: Any of the four CAM keys activates the tracking
     camera system in that direction. A small box appears around the target,
     to help you locate it. On most systems the tracking box is
     color-coordinated with the current armament (as shown on the HUD, see
     above). The box color indicates whether the current weapon is effective
     against that target. See the Technical Supplement for details on colors.
        When using missiles or other self-guided weapons, the box turns oval
     when the targets is within firing range and the missile is "locked on".
     This is a maximum range shot that assumes the target is stationary and
     your plane is moving at maximum speed (over 500 kts). When the oval
     changes color the shot is now a "sure thing", with nearly no chance of
     missing.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air-Ground Mode Indicators

        Tap the HUD MODES key to change your HUD into air-ground mode.
        Tracking Box & Oval: Any of the four CAM keys activates the tracking
     camera system in that direction. A small box appears around the target,
     to help you locate it. On most systems the tracking box is
     color-coordinated with the current armament (as shown on the HUD, see
     above). The box color indicates whether the current weapon is effective
     against that target. See the Technical Supplement for details on colors.
        When using missiles or other self-guided weapons, the box turns oval
     when the targets is within firing range and the missile is "locked on".
     The oval changes color when accuracy has reached its maximum.
        Bombsights: When free-fall and/or retarded bombs are the current
     armament, a special set of bombsight aids appears on the HUD. Note that
     the fall-line and bullseye only appear for free-fall bombs.
        Bombing Flightpath Guie: This indicates the "path in the sky" you
     should fly for a perfect bombing run. Keeping your flight path indicator
     centered within this symbol means you're "on course".
        Bombsight Ranging Bar: This indicates the distance before
                                                                      - 37 -
     proper bomb release. As you get closer to the drop point, the bar
     compresses. When it becomes a single vertical line (or dot) it's time
     to drop the bomb
        Bombsight Fall-line: This appears only if free-fall bombs are the
     current armament. A line extends from your flight path toward the
     ground. At the end of this line is a circle. Your bomb will land in
     the middle of this circle.
        Bombsight Bullseye: This is a circle at the end of the fall-line. The
     center of the circle indicates the predicated strike-point of the bomb.
        Killing Yourself: If your current course, speed and altitude will
     take you within a bomb blast, the HUD bombsight symbology flashes. You
     can still drop a bomb in this situation, but you should take appropriate
     action to escape the resulting blast.
        Camera Lens Sight:  If your current armament is the 135 mm/IR camera,
     the camera lens sight appears on the HUD. This is a small "+" symbol in
     the lower center. It represents the direction your camera lens aims.

     ========================================================================
     Cockpit CRTs
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Maps (Left-Side) CRT

        This CRT appears on the left side of the cockpit. It displays two
     differenttypes of maps. Tap the CRT MAPS key to toggle between the two
     types.
        Either map can be expanded or contracted to show more area or more
     detail, using the ZOOM and UNZOOM keys.
        THE SATELLITE/RADAR MAP portrays the geographical features of the
     region, and is oriented so North is always toward the top of the CRT.
        Enemy radar signals are displayed graphically on the map. Dotted arcs
     are pulse radars, solid line arcs are doppler radars. Ground search
     radars are entire 360o circles, while ground fire-control tracking
     radars are short arcs. Aircraft radars, search or fire-control, are
     short arcs except for AEW&C aircraft (the I1-76 "Mainstay" or E-3C
     "Sentry"), which have an entire 360o circle.
        Missiles and aircraft also appear on this map as color-coded dots.
     See the Technical Supplement for details. If a dot is your primary
     target, it flashes and glows.
        THE TACTICAL DISPLAY portrays the local tactical situation. It is
     oriented so the top of the face corresponds to your flight path. Thus
     the map rotates as you turn.
        The map graphically depicts aircraft (color-coded for altitude),
     missiles, ground radar sources, airfields, and incidental ground
     targets. A 16km square grid is superimposed for range referencing. See
     the Technical Supplement for details on the color coding of this map.
        WARNING: The airbase symbols on this map are icons only. They may
     not be correctly aligned. Do not use this map for landings!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Camera/Data (Right-Side) CRT

        This CRT appears on the right side of the cockpit. It has many
     different functions. Tap the appropriate key to activate the desired
     function: 
        CAM AHEAD: This aims the tracking camera ahead and locks it on the
     nearest standard target. A zoom TV view of the target appears on the
     CRT with
                                                                      - 38 -
     range and direction information.
        CAM REAR: This aims the tracking camera to the rear, locking it onto
     the nearest standard target, and showing the zoom TV picture on the CRT.
        CAM LEFT: This aims the tracking camera to the left, locking it onto
     the nearest standard target, and showing the zoom TV picture on the CRT.
        CAM RIGHT: This aims the tracking camera to the right, locking it
     onto the nearest standard target, and showing the zoom TV picture on
     the CRT.
        DATA: Displays data on the target currently targeted by the tracking
     camera.
        Ordnance: Displays the ordnance currently on board your F-19.
        Damage: Displays which system (if any) are damaged on your F-19.
        Waypoints: Displays waypoint data for each of the four INS waypoints,
     and displays predicted fuel consumption (given current flight
     performance).
        Way Reset: Resets the INS (inertial navigation system) waypoints to
     the initial (default) values. Wypoint #2 always becomes the primary
     target, waypoint #3 always becomes the secondary target.
        ILS:  Toggles the Instrument Landing System (ILS) on and off. When
     turned on, it projects ILS symbology on the HUD and locks the tracking
     camera to an airbase.
        Mission: Displays a summary of your mission orders.

     ========================================================================
     Flight Controls
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Control Stick

        The F-19 has a standard aircraft control stick. Pushing the stick
     forward pitches the plane down, pulling it back pitches the plane up.
     Pushing the stick left rolls the plane to the left, while pushing it
     right rolls the plane to the right.
        Note that the more you push the stick, the more the aircraft pitches
     or rolls in that direction. When you release the stick (i.e., center it)
     the aircraft remains pitched or rolled in that attitude. You must move
     the stick in the opposite direction to level your plane.
        The control stick may be represented by a physical joystick,
     numeric/cursor keypad, or some other device. See your Technical
     Supplement for details. If you are not using a "real" joystick, a
     control stick locator box appears in the lower right corner of the HUD.
     This shows you the current position of your stick.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Throttle

        The throttle controls the power output of your engines. Maximum
     throttle ("full military power") gives you maximum speed and
     performance, but also uses up fuel faster and increases your EMV
     (electro-magnetic visibility).
        Throttle Handle & Indicator: The twin handle device on the far left
     of the cockpit represents the throttle control. The closer the handles
     are to the main cockpit panel, the greater your engine power. On the
     base of the handles is a bar-like scale that shows the amount of thrust
     being generated.
        Throttle Controls: The MAX PWR key immediately opens the throttle,
     giving you maximum thrust.
                                                                      - 39 -
        The NO PWR key immediately closes the throttle, shutting down the
     engines.
        The INCREASE key opens the throttle a small amount.
        The DECREASE key closes the throttle a small amount.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Autopilot

        The AUTOPILOT key toggles the automatic pilot on and off. The
     autopilot, when active, flies you toward the next INS waypoint. If
     you're below 500' altitude, the autopilot climbs to that altitude. When
     the autopilot is on, the cockpit "AUTO" light is on.
        If you touch the control stick in any way, the autopilot
     automatically turns off. In other words, it works like the "cruise
     control" of a modern American automobile.
        WARNING: The autopilot does not avoid hills and mountains!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Brake

        If your aircraft is airborne, the BRAKE key toggles the airbrake
     retracted (in) and extended (out). When the brake is extended the
     aircraft slows down because the airbrake causes extra drag.
        If the aircraft is on the ground, the BRAKE key toggles the landing
     gear brakes on and off.
        In either case, if the brakes are on, the word "BRAKE" appears in
     the lower right corner of your HUD.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flaps

        The FLAPS key toggles the wing flaps between extended (out) and
     retracted (in). When the flaps are extended (out) the aircraft slows
     down, gains lift, and stall speed is reduced.
        If the flaps are extended, the word "FLAPS" appears in the lower
     right corner of your HUD.
        Do not have your flaps extended above 300 kts speed. Higher speeds
     can rip off the flaps, causing serious damage to your wings.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Landing Gear

        The GEAR key toggles your landing gear up and down. The "GEAR" light
     in the cockpit indicates the landing gear position (see the Technical
     Supplement for colors).
        If the "GEAR" light flashes, it means the gear is down at too high a
     speed - you should either slow down or raise the landing gear. Not only
     does extended landing gear slow you down, but high speeds can rip it
     off entirely, causing serious damage.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Viewing Controls

        Cockpit:  Tap the COCKPIT key for the standard pilot view, looking
     out of your cockpit through the HUD.
        View Angle: The VIEW ANGLE key toggles between a standard viewing arc
     (about 60o) and a wide-angle viewing arc (about 120o). The wide angle
     arc is an excellent way to spot and track objects, especially in a
     fast-moving dogfight.
        The current viewing angle (standard or wide) applies to all other
     views, and can be changed from any view.
        View Forward: Tap the VIEW AHEAD key to turn off the HUD and look up
                                                                      - 40 -
     over the cockpit control panel. This vire gives you maximum visibility
     forward, unobstructed with the cockpit or HUD.
        View Rear: Tap the VIEW REAR key to look out the back of your
     aircraft.
        View Left: Tap the VIEW LEFT key to look out the left side of your
     aircraft.
        View Right: Tap the VIEW RIGHT key to look out the right side of
     your aircraft.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     INS "Waypoints" System

        Concept: The INS (inertial navigation system) has up to four
     programmable "waypoints". you use these to map out a route to your
     target(s) and back again. The default waypoint setup puts the first
     point halfway between your starting base and the primary target. The
     second is the primary target; the third is the secondary target; and
     that last is your landing point.
        Waypoints Display: The SELECT WAY PT and CHANGE WAY PT keys display
     the INS waypoints list on the right-side CRT and your projected flight
     path from waypoint to waypoint on the satellite/radar map on the
     left-side CRT.
        The waypoints list includes the current time at top, the flight time
     to each waypoint, and across the bottom a fuel gauge. The fuel gauge is
     a bar-graph of predicted fuel consumption, given your current speed and
     altitude. The far right side of the bar shows the amount of empty space
     in the tank, the far left side shows your reserves, while the center
     parts show the amount of fuel needed to reach each waypoint. The gauge
     is color-coded, see the Technical Supplement for details.
        Selecting Waypoints: The INS waypoints list on the right-side CRT
     has one point highlighted. Your HUD's INS Waypoint Direction Indicator
     steers you toward the highlighted waypoint.
        To select a new destination, tap the SELECT WAY PT. Then use the LAST
     POINT and NEXT POINT keys (among the WAYPOINTS controls) to move the
     highlight up and down the list. As you move the highlight the HUD's INS
     Direction Indicator moves accordingly.
        Changing Waypoints: To change a waypoint to a new location, first
     tap the CHANGE WAY PT key. Then use the LAST POINT and NEXT POINT
     controls to select the waypoint you wish to move. Finally, use the
     keypad waypoint keys to actually move the point.
        To observe the results, make sure to tap CRT MAPS. This sets the
     left-side CRT to the satellite/radar map. Then use the UNZOOM key as
     necessary to show the entire course. Notice that as you move a waypoint
     the flight paths adjust accordingly.
        Tap the RESET WAY PT key to reset all waypoints to the original
     (default) waypoints described in "Concept" above.
                                                                      - 41 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Fuel

        Fuel Warning: The "FUEL" light on the cockpit control panels goes on
     whenever your fuel tanks are low.
        Extra Fuel: If you are carrying extra fuwl in your weapons bay, you
     can pump that fuel from the bay into the main tank by tapping the SELECT
     ORDNANCE key until "EXTRA FUEL" appearson the lower left of the HUD.
     Then tap the FIRE ORDNANCE key to move the fuel from the bay into your
     main tanks.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     ILS (Instrument Landing)

        The ILS key toggles the ILS (instrument landing system) display on
     and off your HUD. When the ILS is on, a vertical and horizontal bar
     guide you toward the nearest friendly airbase.
        Principles of Operation: The ILS is designed to aid you "on final",
     steering you down the descending "glide path" to the runway. if you are
     flying a pattern to land, use the ILS to guide you to the airport, then
     turn it off until you are "on final".
        The ILS guides you to the runway or carrier deck, but end there.
     Rather than produce inaccurate readings over the runway, the ILS
     automatically turns off before it degrades to being useless.
        Vertical "Course" Bar: To use the ILS, fly the plane so that the
     vertical bar lines up with your HUD Nose Indicator. This means you're on
     course toward the airbase.
        Horizontal "Glide Slope" Bar: The horizontal bar of the ILS
     represents the "glide slope", an imaginary line extending from the
     airbase up into the sky. You can either fly straight ahead until you
     "intercept" it, or climb to get to the glide slope faster.
        If the bar is beneath your HUD Nose Indicator, you are above the
     glide slope. You should descend until the bar crosses directly through
     the HUD indicator.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Mission Summary & Success

        Tap the MISSION key to display a short summary of your mission on
     the right-side CRT.
        When you accomplish your primary or secondary mission, the mission
     summary is updated to show this. Therefore, if you're uncertain wheter
     you hit the target, just check this display.
                                                                      - 42 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Bailing Out

        Tap the EJECT key to "punch out" of your plane. Your F-19 has a
     zero-zero ejection seat, the safest and most flexible design available.
     Ejection is never entirely safe, but your best chance of survival exists
     if your altitude is between 2000' and 14000' while you are flying level
     or slightly climbing.
        To prevent sensitive technology from falling into hostile hands, you
     should eject far out over open sea whenever possible. If not, bail out
     in friendly territory where you can. Ejections while over enemy
     coastlines or inland territory should be avoided at all costs.

     ========================================================================
     Weaponry

        These instructions only give the bare rudiments of how to operate
     each weapon. Many important secondary considerations (like not launching
     some too low) and tactical tricks are described in "How to Fight"
     (pages 56-63) and "Techniques & Tactics" (pages 78-97).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Selecting Weapons

        See "Equipment, USAF Ordnance", page 131, for a chart that indicates
     which weapons are most effective against which targets. Further details
     about each weapon can be found on pages 140-146. The Ordnance currently
     available always appears in the lower left corner of the HUD.
        Cannon: Your 20mm cannon is always available for use (unless out of
     ammo or damaged).
        Ordnance: Tap the ORDNANCE key to display your weapons bay equipment
     on the right-side CRT. This includes both names and illustrations of all
     weaponry, cameras, fuel, etc. The ordnance currently selected is
     highlighted. The current armament also appears in the lower left of the
     HUD.
        Tap the SELECT ORDNANCE key to change the weapon "locked into" your
     fire control system. Each keypress changes you to the next item in a
     weapons bay.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Tracking Targets

        If your HUD is in AIR-AIR mode you can track aircraft targets. If
     your HUD is in AIR-GROUND mode you can trach ground targets. The F-19
     uses a zoom TV system with backup thermal imaging. Although the most
     useful and flexible system available today, it is limited to about 80
     to 100 kilometers maxumum range in day time, less at night.
        Tracking Camera: Tap on of the CAM keys to lock your target tracking
     camera onto the nearest target within 80-100 km ahead of you plane. A
     zoom TV view of the target appears in the right side CRT, including the
     target's name, range, and bearing.
        Primary and secondary objectives are listed as such. Civilian targets
     (which you shouldn't hit in Cold War or Limited War situations) are
     noted also.
        Normally you'll use the CAM AHEAD key to track a target in front of
     you. This is because all your weapons are forward firing. However, you
     can use the CAM LEFT, CAM RIGHT, and CAM REAR as well, although weapon
     launches are unlikely to hit the target.
        Tracking Box:  On your HUD the target is framed by a colored box
     (see the Technical Supplement for the meaning of various colors). If
     the box is invisible
                                                                      - 43 -
     on the HUD, but you have an image on right-side CRT, mission target is
     not directly ahead of you.
        The color of the target box indicates whether the target can be hit
     with the current ordnance selected from the bay. The size of the box
     indicates the potential effectiveness of the weapon (a small box means
     poor effectiveness, a large box means superior effectiveness).
        NOTE: If you have the weapons bay open and selected the 135 mm/IR
     recon camera as your current weapon, the right-side CRT shows the view
     through the fixed recon camera rather than the normal tracking camera.
     Close the weapon bay or select a different weapon to see the tracking
     camera view.
        Target Data: Your F-19 has an onboard computer file of data on common
     targets for that region. Tap the DATA key to get additional information
     about the current target.
        Changing Targets: The onboard computer has a pre-programmed list of
     possible targets in the region, including your primary target and
     secondary targets. Tap the SELECT TARGET key to move the tracking camera
     to the next nearest target within 80-100 kilometers.
        Designating New Targets: In addition, you can reprogram the tracking
     camera to aim at any target on the ground. Simply aim your nose at the
     target and tap the DESIGNATE NEW TARGET key. The camera will lock onto
     the nearest new target.
        Due to a limitation in your onboard computer, you can only designate
     new targets ahead of your aircraft. When you select this option the
     tracking camera automatically switches to the view ahead.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Firing Weapons

        See "How to Fight", pages 57-60, for specific instructions on
     launching ordnance. Alos see "Air-to-Ground Tactics" (pages 78-88),
     "Air-to-Air Tactics" (pages 89-97), and "USAF Ordnance" (charts on
     pages 129-134, detailed descriptions on pages 135-146).
        Cannon: The FIRE CANNON key (or button) fires one burst. Your 20mm
     cannon is always available for use (unless out of ammo or damaged).
        Weapons Bay Doors: Before using ordnance you must toggle open the
     weapons bay doors, using the BAY DOORS key. The "BAY" cockpit light
     flashes when the bay doors are open.
        After you have launched the ordnance you should toggle the doors
     closed again (tap the BAY DOORS key once more).
        Launching Ordnance: Tap the FIRE ORDNANCE key (or button) to launch
     a weapon. This fires one missile or drops one bomb. The weapon
     currently selected is the one used.
        Reconnaissance Cameras (the 135 mm/IR Camera) are "fired" like a
     weapon from an open weapons bay. Each "shot" takes on picture.
        SPECIAL EQUIPMENT can be airdropped by opening the doors and "firing"
     it out. It floats to the ground using a parachute. It is also loaded or
     unloaded on the ground at appropriate airstrips automatically (a message
     appears on your HUD when loading or unloading is complete).
                                                                      - 44 -
     ========================================================================
     Evasion & Defense

        For detailed information on the concepts of stealth aircraft, enemy
     weapons, and appropriate defensive tactics see Part 3 ("Techniques &
     Tactics", pages 74-97) and Part 5 ("Equipment", pages 129-156).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     EMV (Electro-Magnetic Visibility) Scale

        This gauge shows the "stealthiness" of your aircraft.
        Your EMV: The "visibility" of your plane to enemy radars appears as a
     bar rising from the bottom of this gauge. Your visibility increases as
     you climb to a higher altitude, increase speed, open bay doors, lower
     gear, or use jammers.
        Enemy Radars: The bars coming down from the top of the scale are
     incoming enemy radar signals. Ground-based radars appear on the left,
     aircraft radars on the right. The bar color represents whether the radar
     sees you or not (see the Technical Supplement for a color key). Bar
     colors match the radar arc colors that appear on the Satellite/Radar
     map (on the left-side CRT).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Warning Devices

        Select Warning: Enemy search radar detects your plane when the
     enemy radar strength bar overlaps your EMV bar, on the EMV scale. Search
     radar appears as a round, expanding circle on the Satellite/Radar map
     (on the left-side CRT).
        The enemy radar symbol changes color on the EMV scale. The
     Satellite/Radar map also shows these color changes. (See the Technical
     Supplement for the radar color key).
        Frequently a single search detection does not give the enemy
     sufficient data to recognize your plane. A message on the HUD warns you
     when repeated detections indicate the enemy has "found" your plane.
        Tracking Warning: Long-range and medium-range SAMs must track a
     target with radar before firing. Tracking radar appears as a short,
     narrow arc on the Satellite/Radar map.
        When the enemy tracks you, the "TRAK" warning is lighted in the
     cockpit.
        Some short range enemy missiles do not use radar tracking system.
     Therefore, "TRAK" is not a foolproof warning of impending attack.
        Missile Warning Lights: If a radar-homing missile is launched toward
     you, the "R" missile warning light flashes in the cockpit. If an IR
     (infrared) homing missile is launched toward you, the "I" missile
     warning light flashes.
                                                                      - 45 -
        The appropriate light continues to flash as long as the missile is
     homing on your plane. If jammers or some other device confuse the
     missile, the light goes off. If the missile later finds you again and
     starts homing once more, the light begins flashing again.
        If two or more missiles of the same type are homing on you, that
     light continues to flash as long as any missile is homing.
        Missile warning lights are very important, since they're the only way
     to tell what kind of missile is attacking. The type of attacking missile
     (radar or IR) determines what sort of defenses you should use.
        Missile Proximity Klaxon: When a missile approaches within a few
     seconds flight time of your plane, the proximity klaxon goes off. This
     very loud signal means you must do something, immediately, or you'll be
     hit soon. Typically you'll drop a chaff or flare cartridge, depending on
     the type of threat (chaff for radar missiles, flares for IR missiles).
     However, you should also make some last-minute maneuvers, especially if
     under attack by missiles with doppler radar guidance systems.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Missile Defenses

        ECM (radar) Jammer:  The ECM key toggles this device on and off. When
     the jammer is running the cockpit "ECM" light is on.
        The ECM radar jammer "blinds" radar-guided missiles. Their missile
     stops homing on your plane and just flies straight ahead. The jammer is
     very effective against older "beam rider" (command guidance) radar
     homing missiles, but only good at long ranges against advanced
     "semi-active" radar homing missiles. These can "burn through" your
     jamming at short range.
        When the ECM jammer is running your EMV is much larger.
        IR (infrared) Jammer: The IR JAMMER key toggles this device on and
     off. When the jammer is running the cockpit "IRJ" light is on.
        The IR jammer "blinds" IR (infrared) guided missiles. They missile
     stops homing on your plane and just flies straight ahead. The jammer is
     highly effective against older "first generation" IR missiles, but only
     good at long ranges against advanced "second generation" missiles.
        When the IR jammer is running your speed is reduced. In addition, the
     jammer cannot run for long periods. When it gets too hot it shuts down
     automatically!
        Chaff:  Tap the CHAFF key to release one chaff decoy cartridge into
     the sky
                                                                      - 46 -
     behind your plane. For the next two or more seconds most enemy radar-
     guided missiles will home in on the chaff instead of your aircraft.
        IMPORTANT EXCEPTION: Enemy doppler-radar guided missiles will not
     home on the chaff unless your on course is perpendicular (at right
     angles to) the missile. As long as the missile chases you from the rear,
     or attacks from straight ahead, chaff has no effect on doppler radar
     missile.
        Flare: Tap the FLARE key to release a flare decoy cartridge into the
     sky behind your plane. For the next two or more seconds all enemy IR
     (infrared) guided missiles will home in on the flare instead of your
     aircraft.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Decoys

        Your F-19 carries only three decoys. To launch a decoy, tap the DECOY
     key. The "DCY" light in the cockpit turns on, and remains lighted while
     the decoy is running.
        Each decoy is a computer-controlled radar emitter and reflector, plus
     IR source. To enemy radar and infrared it looks just like your plane,
     only stronger. The decoy gradually floats down under a parachute. It
     self-destructs before hitting the ground.
        Enemy missiles, aircraft, and ground radars are all fooled by decoys,
     although the amount of time depends on the experience and skill of the
     opposition (time typically varies from 15 to 60 seconds). During this
     time the enemy chases and attacks the decoy instead of you.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Damage

        Theupper left of the cockpit has a bank of "telltale" lights that
     indicate which systems (if any) are damaged. See the Technical
     Supplement for the layout and color-coding of these telltales.
        To see a detailed display of your F-19, with all systems and their
     status, tap the DAMAGE key. The display appears on the right-side CRT.
        RWR/IWR: The Radar Warning Receiver and IR Warning Receiver are
     inoperative. The "R" and "I" warnings of approaching missiles will not
     work.
        Engines:  Engine damage reduces the maximum thrust possible.
     Additional damage anywhere on the aircraft further reduces thrust.
        Flight Controls: Control surface damage makes the plane more
     difficult to control.
        Avionics: Avionics damage means the INS system is malfunctioning, so
     waypoints are no longer available. In addition, the autopilot is
     disabled, since without an INS it cannot function.
        Bay Doors: The ordnance bay doors are damaged and jammed open. Your
     EMV is permanently increased.
        Jammers: The ECM and IR jammers are inoperative.
        Fuel Tanks: Damage and stress breakage is causing fuel to leak. Once
     a leak starts, any further damage, anywhere on the aircraft, increases
     the rate of fuel loss.
                                                                      - 47 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Random Malfunctions

     Your F-19 is an extremely complicated piece of equipment. Random
     malfunctions are possible in any of the systems at any time. The
     malfunction may include the reporting systems on board the craft. If so,
     you won't know that something has malfunctioned until you discover it
     doesn't work!
        Malfunctions are more likely in intense combat situations, due to the
     heavy burden that places on your sophisticated electronic systems.
                                                                      - 48 -
                                   How to Fly
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This section only provides the rudiments of flying. For a more in depth
     description see "Aerodynamics & Flight" (pages 69-73).
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Takeoff

        The preflight checklist for your F-19 Stealth Fighter is:
        1. Check your INS system. Display the satellite/radar map on your
     left-side CRT (using the CRT MAPS key), and the INS waypoints on the
     right-side CRT (using the SELECT WAY PT key). Look up on the HUD and
     note on the heading indicator the location of the INS Direction
     Indicator. Fly in this direction to reach the first waypoint. Advanced
     pilots often adjust their waypoints at this time.
        2. Check Armament: Check your ordnance (tap the ORDNANCE key) on the
     right-side CRT. Use the SELECT ORDNANCE key to toggle through the
     weapons. Note the active weapon is in the lower left corner of the HUD.
        3. Extend the Flaps by tapping the FLAPS key. Note the "FLAPS"
     indicator in the lower right corner of the HUD. Flaps give you more
     lift during takeoff.
        4. Check the Catapult System (on Aircraft Carriers only): When
     launching from an aircraft carrier, the brakes must be start set
     (i.e., "on"). This represents attaching the aircraft to the deck's
     steam catapult. If the HUD does not show "BRAKE" in the lower right
     corner, tap the BRAKE key to set the brakes and engage the catapult.
        5. Start the Engines: Turn on your engines by tapping the MAX PWR key.
        6. Activate Catapult (on Aircraft Carriers only): First wait until
     the bar gauge on the throttle (left side of the cockpit) shows maximum
     power. Then tap the BRAKES key. This releases the brakes and catapult,
     hurling your off the deck.
        7. Accelerate Past Stall Speed: As you move down the runway or
     carrier deck, watch the speed scale (left side of the HUD) very
     carefully. A colored bar on the side of that scale will gradually go
     down. This is the Stall Speed Indicator. When the bar drops below the
     center tick-mark on the scale your plane is past stall speed. This
     happens very quickly on a carrier deck, and somewhat slower on a runway.
        8. Climb into the Sky: Pull back gently on the stick. Watch the
     altitude scale to the right side of the HUD: you'll start climbing.
        9. Retract Landing Gear: Tap the GEAR key to retract you landing
     gear. Don't leave the gear down - both it and your can be damaged if
     left down at too high a speed.
        10. Retract Flaps: Tap the FLAPS key to retract your flaps. You no
     longer need the extra lift.
        11. Turn onto Course: Pull the control stick left or right until the
     INS Direction Indicator along the top of the HUD matches up with the
     center tick of the Heading scale. Since this is a stealth mission,
     you'll want to stay low. About
                                                                      - 49 -
     200' to 500' is ideal.
        Alternatively, you can simply tap the AUTOPILOTkey and let your
     autopilot turn you onto the correct course to the first waypoint.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flying Techniques

        A Light Touch:  Use a light touch on your CONTROL STICK. The most
     common pilot error is a "ham-fist" on the stick, throwing the plane
     around the sky in uncontrolled abandon. That kind of heavy-handed flying
     may be fun in a dogfight, but it's tottaly useless for lining up a
     bombing run, or making a landing. Unless it's an emergency never "peg"
     your control stick (push it to the limit).
        Chasing the Gauges: When you change an aircraft's operating regime,
     by moving the stick, changing the throttle, etc., the effects of the
     change don't happen instantly. It takes a second or two for your gauges
     and displays to "settle out" and show the new situation. For smooth
     flying a pilot always makes a change, then observes the effects.
     Constant adjustments and correction should be avoided, because all
     you'll do is "chase the gauges", overcorrecting every move.
        Straight & Level Flight: To be a good combat pilot, you need to
     master level flight. Do this in a training scenario, rather than real
     life.
        To learn level flight, climb to an altitude above 500' (say 2000',
     or 2K on the HUD altimeter). Now level the aircraft so the nose of the
     plane points at the horizon. Next reduce the throttle to about 75% to
     achive an economical cruising speed.
        Although the cross-hair nose indicator on the HUD may appear level
     with the horizon, a glance at the HUD's altimeter and VVI will probably
     show that the plane is gradually climbing or descending. If you're
     gradually climbing, push forward a tiny bit on the Control Stick (pitch
     down), then let go and see what happens. If you're descending pull back
     (pitch up) a bit instead. Your objective is to keep the altimeter rock
     steady. You'll notice that your flight path indicator aims at the
     horizon, but your nose indicator may be pointed above or below it,
     depending on your speed. Generally, the slower you're travelling, the
     higher you must pitch the nose up to achieve level flight )i.e., to
     place the flight path indicator on the horizon).
        Now experiment. Tap the BRAKES key. This slows down you plane. Watch
     the HUD and notice how the flight path indicator frops down. Meanwhile,
     on the sides of the HUD, your speed is dropping (no surprise, with the
     brakes on!) and so is your altitude. To achieve level flight at this
     new, lower speed pitch up (pull back on a stick a tiny bit) until the
     flight path indicator is level with the horizon. You may adjust once or
     twice to find the setting.
        This adjustment of pitch to achieve level flight is called changing
     your "angle of attack" (the angle at which your wings slice through the
     air). See "Aerodynamics & Flight", page 70, for a detailed explanation.
        Turns: As your roll angle (when turning right or left) increases
     beyond 45o, your stall speed rises from the normal 120 knot range to
     over 200 knots (in a 90o
                                                                      - 50 -
     roll). Since tight turns often "bleed off" airspeed, a long, tight turn
     can reduce your airspeed below the stall speed. Keeping an eye on the
     airspeed and stall speed is especially important when making tight turns
     at low altitide. If you're only a few hundred feet from the ground, a
     stall means a crash!
        In very tight turns (where you roll 80o, 85o, or even 90o), once in
     the turn uou can tighten your turn rate by pulling back on the stick
     (i.e., pitching up the nose). However, this trick bleeds off airspeed
     even faster, so keep a close eye on the stall speed bar (on the HUD
     airspeed gauge).
        LOOPS are easy in your F-19 Stealth Fighter, but ballistic ("straight
     up") climbs can only be maintained for short periods: the engines are
     insufficient for a prolonged ballistic climb.
        Remember that any prolonged vertical maneuver greatly reduces
     airspeed, which risks a stall if you didn't start the maneuver with a
     lot of speed. However, going vertical is very handy for changing
     direction, since you can roll while vertical, quickly pointing your nose
     in the desired direction, then push down into level flight again.
        Low Altitude Flying: At altitudes under 500 feet you can expect
     increased buffets, downdrafts and other irregularities that make flying
     difficult. Also beware of low ridges and mountains. It's easy to fly
     into a mountain if you're not looking. Good pilots develop a "cross
     check" routine of scanning the entire HUD periodically, to make sure
     everything is okay.
        In "No Crash" and "Easy" flight options you have a barometic/laser
     altimeter. If you drop below 200' this device automatically but gently
     pushes your plane above 200 feet. Be warned, the device does
     automatically turn off when the landing gear is down, or when the gun is
     firing. The device is not proof against power dives, stalls, or other
     radical maneuvers, but works fine in normal flight regimes.
        In fully realistic flight the automatic altimeter that keeps you
     above 200' is turned off. This allows a skillful pilot to cruise at even
     lower altitude.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Runway Layouts

        Airbases: All ground runways and aircraft carriers have a nort-south
     orientation and a center stripe down their middle. On approach a course
     of 000 (if coming from the south) or 180 (if coming from the north) will
     aim you directly at the runway.
        Airbase runways are more than twice as long as your safe landing
     distance at 200 kts. You have a large safety margin.
        Aircraft carriers have arrestor wires near the stern. You must touch
     down before or on these wires, which catch and stop your plane. If you
     miss the wires, which catch and stop yor plane. If you miss the wires
     you will you will roll off the deck (your brakes aren't good enough to
     stop the plane in such a short distance). Do not attempt to land on the
     bow of an aircraft carrier. There are no arrestor wires there.
     Furthermore, regular aircraft spotted for launching may be positioned
     there. You don't want to crash into them!
        The ILS glide slope (see below) for aircraft carriers is steeper. In
     fact, some pilots refer to a carrier landing as a "controlled crash".
,                                                                       - 51 -
        Aborted Landings: If you get in trouble landing, open the throttle to
     full power, thenretract the flaps and landing gear. Climb away and come
     around for another try. Do not make wild movements with the control
     stick while landing or aborting. Wait for your airspeed to exceed 300
     knots before making any big turns or similar maneuvers. Until then,
     gross maneuvers with the control stick may stall the plane, causing a
     fatal crash.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Using the ILS (Instrument Landing System)

        To use the ILS, switch the HUD to NAV mode (tap the HUD MODES key as
     necessary), turn on the tracking camera (tap the CAM AHEAD key), and tap
     the ILS key. The ILS and camera will automatically track the nearest
     friendly or neutral landing site. It will not track on rough air-strips
     behind enemy lines; there you must land without ILS aid.
        Concept: The ILS symbols represent your position in relation to the
     "glide slope". The glide slope is an invisible "beam" that angles out
     and up from the end of the runway. Approaching from a distance (say, 50
     km away) you first fly beneath the glide slope and turn onto its
     bearing. Then you follow it toward the airbase, eventually intercepting
     it. Then you follow it down to the airbase.
        Line Up Your Approach: The first step is to line up on the correct
     course to the airbase (or aircraft carrier). To do this, fly at 500' to
     1000' ('1K') to a point about 40 to 50 km north or south of the base and
     turn until the ILS vertical bar is centered on your HUD's nose
     indicator.
        If the horizontal bar is above the HUD's nose indicator, you are
     flying beneath the glide slope (the bar represents the position of the
     glide slope). This is correct. Since all airbases and carriers are
     north-south oriented, your course should be either 000 or 180.
        If the bas is beneath your nose indicator, you are flying above the
     glide
                                                                      - 52 -
                               <<< EMPTY >>>                          - 53 -
     slope. You are either too high to the airbase, perhaps both. Fly away
     and/or lower and try again.
        Intercept the Glide Slope: Once you are beneath the glide slope
     (vertical bar centered, horizontal bar high), fly along this course. The
     horizontal bar should gradually drop down, until it tii us centered.
     When the horizontal bar is centered, you are now intercepting (flying
     through) the glide slope.
        As you fly your course to the intercept, you should prepare for
     landing by reducing the throttle (see below). Using this "straight-in"
     approach, you can now extend (open) the flaps.
        Descent: When you intercept the glide slope, begin your landing
     descent. You want to keep the horizontal bar centered, which means
     making a gradual descent.
        You must manage the descent like a normal landing (see below). This
     means opening flaps, extending the landing gear, reducing the throttle,
     and making small pitch-up adjustments to maintain the correct descent
     speed.
        Touch down: The ILS will not guide you to touch down. It is not
     accurate in the immediate vicinity of the base. It turns off
     automatically before you reach the runway.
        ILS and Landing Patterns: The ILS is designed to guide you to the
     airbase. It does not control your plane through a landing pattern.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Straight-in Landing

        1. The ILS (Instrument Landing System): First use the ILS to line up
     onto a correct approach (see above). Beginners should plan to intercept
     the glide slope (i.e., get onto their approach) about 40 km to 50 km
     from the runway. Attempting to find the approach and make a landing
     less than 20 km from base is NOT advised for beginners.
        2. Approach at 300 kts: Fly your approach at 500' to 1000'. Reduce
     the throttle to about 70%, which should reduce your speed to about 300
     kts. Eventually you'll need to pitch up (raise the nose) a little to
     maintain level flight.
        3. Level flight at 300 kts (throttle 70%): As you approach in level
     flight, reduce your throttle until the airspeed shows 300 knots (about
     70% throttle). You'll need to raise the nose 5o to 7o maintain level
     flight until you're about 20 km from base.
        4. Flaps Out, Throttle 50%, Gear Down: Now extend the flaps and
     reduce the throttle to about 50%. This slows the plane to about 230 kts.
     As you reach this speed, lower your landing gear. If you're moving to
     fast, extend the brakes (tap the BRAKE key) for a brief period, then
     retract them again.
        5. Descend 'On Final': When the ILS horizontal bar reaches the
     middle of the
                                                                      - 54 -
     HUD nose indicator, you should start descending down the glide slope.
        There are two methods for descending. One is to reduce the power
     slightly. If you were in level flight, but now have less thrust, you
     will gradually descend. This method is generally preferred by pilots,
     but in a hot jet like the F-19 it takeseffect very slowly.
        The other method is to reduce the pitch of the nose slightly.
     Typically you're landing with the nose pitched up about 5o to 7o, to
     maintain level flight at low power. Therefore, reducing this upward
     pitch a few degrees will cause a gradual descent. Do NOT point the nose
     down and dive for the runway.
        In either case, your nose should always have a positive pitch (i.e.,
     the HUD nose indicator should be above the HUD flight path indicator).
        Use the ILS horizontal bar to control your rate of descent. Adjust
     the throttle or pitch (depending on your technique) to keep the bar in
     the middle of the HUD's nose indicator. A good pilot will set up his
     descent rate as he enters the glide path and leave it untouched as the
     plane gradually descends.
        Finally, keep an eye on your airspeed and the stall bar. If the stall
     bar indicator gets too close to your current airspeed (within 25 kts),
     your throttle is too low or you're flying with brakes on. Increase the
     throttle or take off the brakes. Conversely, if you're moving too fast
     (over 250 kts), extend the brakes (tap the BRAKE key) for a breif
     period, then retract them again.
        6. Touch Down: Your altimeter will read an altitude of 0o' on a
     runway, and 125' on an aircraft carrier deck. These are your "touch
     down" altitudes. The safe touch down verticaly velocity is shown by an
     arrow on the VVI portion of your HUD altimeter. A VVI of 400'/minute or
     less (4 ticks on the scale) is always safe. In certain conditions a
     higher VVI is allowable.
        The easiest and safest touch down is simply to gradually continue
     the descent until you're on the runway. Then cut the power (tap the NO
     PWR key) and engage the brakes (tap the BRAKES key).
        Aircraft Carriers: Landing on a carrier is slightly more difficult,
     since you must touch down in the arrestor cables area. To avoid
     overshooting the cables, increase your descent by lowering the nose a
     little extra, then at the last second extend the air brake (tap the
     BRAKES key) as you pull the nose back up a bit.
        If you miss the carrier's arrestor cable area, don't bother trying
     to touch down. Instead close the brakes (if you opened them earlier)
     and hit maximum throttle (tap the MAX PWR key). Since your nose is
     pointed up, you'll climb upwards again.

                                                                      - 55 -
                                  How to Fight
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This section provides a short primer is how to engage the enemy, and how
     to defend yourself from their attacks. For more information see
     "Techniques & Tactics", pages 74-97
     ========================================================================
     Firing Procedures
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Hitting the Target

        See "Aircraft Controls, Weaponry" (pages 43-44) for a detailed list
     of each weapon control.
        (1) Find the Target: The world is a very large place. Fortunately,
     your primary and secondary targets are stored in the memory of your INS.
     Initially your #2 waypoint is always the primary target, #3 your
     secondary target. If you've changed the waypoint positions, you can
     recover the initial default by pressing the RESET WAY PT key.
        To reach to the target easily, call up the waypoints (press the
     SELECT WAY PT key), step by keypress down to the appropriate point (#2
     or #3) using the NEXT POINT key, then steer toward it using the INS
     Direction Indicator on the HUD's heading scale.
        (2) HUD: Change the HUD to the correct mode. Use the HUD MODES key
     to select the right mode: NAV (for takeoffs and landings), AIR-AIR (for
     firing at aircraft), or AIR-GROUND (for firing at everything else).
        (3) Camera: Lock your tracking camera onto the target. Tap the CAM
     AHEAD ket to aim the camera at the nearest standard target ahead. The
     camera remains blank if there are no targets ahead within 80 to 100 km
     in daytime, less at night.
        To see other standard targets, tap the SELECT TARGET key. However,
     the selection is limited to those "standard" targets in your onboard.
     This group always includes the primary and secondary target, of course.
        To line up a target not in your onboard computer tap the DESIGNATE
     NEW TARGET key. The nearest target ahead is temporarily added to the
     computer's database. If you previously designated some other target,
     this new designation replaces that one. Once you've added a target, it
     remains in the computer, and becomes part of the group that "Select
     Targets" cycles through.
        (4) Weapon Selection: Make sure you have the correct weapon selected.
     The size and color of the tracking box on the HUD indicates whether the
     current weapon is effective against that target. The larger the box, the
     more effective the weapon. See the Technical Supplement for the color
     key.
        Press the SELECT ORDNANCE key to cycle through the weapons available
     in your bay. The 20mm cannon is always available (it has a separate
     firing control).
        (5) Aim & Fire: Different weapons are aimed in different ways,
     described below. Depending on the weapon selected, make sure it is
     correctly aimed at
                                                                      - 56 -
     the target before you fire. See below for details.
        (6) Results: Friendly AWACS aircraft observing your mission will
     report the result. Sometimes a hit will damage a target without
     destroying it, sometimes you may miss entirely, and other times a hit
     may be ineffective. Ineffective hits are caused by using the wrong
     weapon (your fault), or because the weapon was a dud.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The 20mm Cannon

        See "Equipment, USAF Ordnance", page 131, for a chart that indicates
     the cannon's effectiveness against various targets.
        Air-to-Air - Anticipation Firing: The tracking box on the HUD shows
     the enemy airplane that's your target. The range appears in the
     right-side CRT. Your maximum cannon range is 6 kilometers. Effective
     cannon range is about 3 km (beyond that shells miss frequently).
        The moving gunsight shows the position your shells would be landing,
     assuming you fired in the past. This is called an "historical gunsight".
     It takes cannon shells about 1 second to travel 3 kilometers. The
     gunsight assumes shells will travel about 2 seconds (6 kilometers)
     unless you are tracking closer target.
        To fire, you must "anticipate" when the enemy and your gunsight will
     meet. At the appropriate time before that meeting you open fire. For
     example, if the enemy and your gunsight are converging and the range is
     6 km, you should open fire 2 seconds before they converge. If you
     estimated correctly, they will converge just as your gunsight moves
     onto them.
        Air-to-Ground - Walking Fire: Attacking ground targets is much
     easier, since they don't move. The easier way to score hits is by
     "walking" your fire over the target. Do this by opening fire about 6 km
     from target and observe where the shells hit the ground. Guide your
     plane to "push" the advancing explosions onto the target. Unfortunately,
     this technique consumes ammo rapidly unless you fire in short bursts,
     spaced well apart until.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Guided Missiles

        See "Equipment, USAF Ordnance", page 131, for a chart that indicates
     which weapons are most effective against which targets.
        Target Envelope: If the HUD is in Air-Air mode and an AAM is your
     current armament, a wide circle appears on the HUD. This is the target
     envelope of your missile's seeker head. The missile can lock on to enemy
     aircraft within this area, provided it's within range.
        Oval lock-on: The tracking box on the HUD shows your target. When the
     tracking box becomes an oval, the missile is locked on and has a good
     chance of hitting. When the oval changes color, the missile has superior
     accuracy.
        To fire, open the weapons bay (tap BAY DOORS key) and then tap the
     FIRE ORDNANCE key.
                                                                      - 57 -
        Restrictions: Missiles drop about 300 to 400' from your plane when
     launched, depending on weight, etc. In addition, they drop away with
     whatever airspeed, climb rate, or dive rate your plane has. As a general
     rule, don't launch a missile below 500' or in a power dive - it may hit
     the ground before it can fly away! See part 5, "Equipment, USAF
     Ordnance", page 131, and the descriptions following on pages 140-142 for
     more details.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     PAVE TACK Laser-Guided Bombs

        These weapons are essentially motorless missiles. They glide from
     your plane to a target "painted" by the PAVE TACK laser mounted on the
     bottom of your plane. See part 5, "Equipment, USAF Ordnance", page 131,
     for a chart that indicates which weapons are most effective against
     which targets.
        Oval & CRT lock-on: The tracking box on the HUD shows your target.
     When the tracking box turns oval, the bomb is locked on and has a good
     chance of hitting. When the oval changes color, the bomb has superior
     accuracy.
        You should always use the tracking camera (tap CAM AHEAD key) with
     these weapons. When the box turns oval the "Missile Lock" crosshairs
     appear on the right-side CRT. If you are "toss-bombing" (see below) the
     HUD box/oval is often invisible, so the tracking camera message on the
     CRT is your only indication of lock-on.
        Toss Bombing: The problem with glide bombs is that they travel about
     as fast as your plane. If you launch them from low altitude, they arrive
     at the target about the same time as your plane, and the resulting
     explosion can damage or destroy you.
        Therefore, the standard attack technique is "toss bombing". Approach
     level, flying full speed at 500' altitude. At 3 km to 6 km from the
     target you pitch up into a climb (30o to 40o) and watch the CRT until
     lock-on occurs (see below). Then launch the bomb and turn away. you must
     keep the underside of your plane aimed at the target until the bomb
     hits, so don't make the turn too violent! For more details on toss
     bombing, see page 79.
        To fire, open the weapons bay (tap the BAY DOORS key) and then tap
     the FIRE ORDNANCE key.
        Restrictions: Laser-guided bombs glide to the target; they have about
     1 km of range for every 500' of altitude you have. The weapon explosion
     has a danger space of 3000', so it's important that you gain enough
     distance or altitude to avoid being caught in the blast. However, you
     must keep the underside of your aircraft facing the target until the
     bomb hits. If not, the laser guidance for the bomb breaks and it will
     almost surely miss.
                                                                      - 58 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Retarded Bombs

        These are unguided bomb with special fins that slow them down very
     quickly. As a result, they rapidly fall behind your aircraft, allowing
     safer bombing at lower altitudes. See "Equipment, USAF Ordnance Charts",
     page 131, for a chart that indicates which weapons are most effective
     against which targets.
        Level Bombing: In this standard technique for retarded bombing, you
     fly straight over the target at low altitude, releasing the bomb(s)
     according to the cues on your HUD. For details and tactics on level
     bombing, see page 79.
        Flightpath Guide: Begin your bombing run by flying level above 500'.
     Turn to match your course (the flightpath indicator) to the
     diamond-shaped flightpath guide on your HUD.
        You can be above or below the flightpath guide without losing
     accuracy, but being left or right of the guide will cause a miss.
        Ranging Bar: As you approach the target, the ranging bar gets shorter
     and shorter. The cue to release a bomb is when the line becomes a single
     dot. You may wish to extend your brakes (tap the BRAKES key) to make your
     bombing run slower and more manageable.
        To Fire: Open the weapons bay (tap BAY DOORS key) and then tap the
     FIRE ORDNANCE key. If your brakes are extended, retract them immediately
     (tap the BRAKE key a second time) after firing to hasten your escape
     from the blast area.
        Restrictions: The HUD bombing symbols flash if dropping a bomb could
     injure your aircraft. For example, this may occur early in a bombing run,
     before you climb above 500'. However, the computer predictions assume
     you continue to fly "as is". If you drop the bomb, then immediately turn up
     and away, you could drop a bomb within the "danger area" and escape.
        As a general rule, it's very unsafe to drop retarded bombs below 500'
     altitude.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Free-fall Bombs

        These are traditional bombs that arc down at high speed toward the
     target. See "Equipment, USAF Ordance", page 131, for a chart that
     indicates which bombs are most effective against which targets.
        Level Bombing: This is the easiest method of using free-fall bombs.
     Level bombing with free-fall bombs is essentially the same as using
     retarded bombs, except the minimum safe bombing altitude is 3000' instead
     of 500'.
        See page 79 for additional tactics and techniques, notablt dive
     bombing.
        Flightpath Guide: Begin your bombing run by flying level at 3000'.
     Now turn to match your course (the flightpath indicator) to the
     flightpath guide on the HUD.
        You can be above or below the flightpath guide without losing
     accuracy, but being left or right of the guide will cause a miss.
        Ranging Bar: As you approach the target, the ranging bar gets shorter
     and shorter. The cue to release a bomb is when the line becomes a single
     dot. You may wish to extend your brakes (tap the BRAKES key) to make
     your bombing run slower and more manageable.
                                                                      - 59 -
        Bombsight Fall-line & Bullseye: In level bombing the fall-line
     indicator usually extends off the HUD, with the bullseye out of sight
     below.
        To fire, open the weapons bay (tap BAY DOORS key) and then tap the
     FIRE ORDNANCE key. Then immediately turn away. Don't fly over the
     target, since you could be caught in the explosion. If your brakes are
     extended, retract them immediately (tap the BRAKES key a second time)
     after firing to hasten your escape from the blast area.
        Restrictions: The HUD bombing sysmbols flash if you're within the
     blast area of the bomb (within 3000' of the predicated drop point). Do
     not drop the bomb unless you are confident you can escape the blast. As
     a general rule, you need 3000' altitude when level-bombing with
     free-fall bombs.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     135 mm/IR recon Camera

        This is a reconnaissance camera mounted in the weapons bay that is
     fixed forward (unlike your target tracking camera, which moves):
        Camera Operations: To configure your HUD and cockpit for camera
     operations, follow these steps:
        (1) Switch the HUD to Air-Ground mode (use the HUD MODE key).
        (2) Select the 135mm/IR camera as your ordnance (use the SELECT
            ORDNANCE key).
        (3) Aim the tracking camera at the target (use the CAM AHEAD key,
            with the SELECT TARGET key if necessary).
        (4) Open the weapon bay doors (tap the BAY DOORS key).
        Taking pictires: To take pictures, fly the plane so the small cross
     symbol passes through the center of the target box on the HUD. As this
     happens, you'll see the object pass through the lens on the CRT. As it
     does, hit the FIRE ORDNANCE key once or more to take the pictures.
     You'll see a message on the CRT indicating a good picture (when and if
     you get one).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Special Equipment

        Delivering or Picking Up Equipment: Finding the secret airbase and
     landing there is a major challange. Secret airstrips have no ILS system
     - just a few flares at each end of the runway! Furthermore, the runway
     is very short: only half the lenght of the runway at a major airbase.
        To pick up or deliver equipment at a secret airbase, land at the
     airbase. Equipment is unloaded or materials delivered to you
     automatically. A message in the HUD indicates when this occurs. Then
     you can take off again.
        Airdropping Equipment: To airdrop equipment, open the weapon bay
     (tap BAY DOORS key) and make sure the equipment is the current bay
     ordnance (tap SELECT ORDNANCE key until it appears in the lower left
     corner of the HUD). As you pass over the top of the radio beacon launch
     the equipment by tapping the FIRE ORDNANCE key.
        The minimum safe altitude to airdrop equipment is 500'. Try to avoid
     dropping it from altitudes above 1000' (1K'), since the higher you are,
     the less accurate the drop.
                                                                      - 60 -

     Stealth & Defenses
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Evading Detection

        Keeping a Low EMV: The lower your EMV, the more difficult it is for
     enemy radars to spot your aircraft. To maintain a low EMV you must fly
     low and level. Your gear should be up and your weapons bay doors closed.
     The jammers should be off.
        Enemy Radar Effectiveness: Enemy radars vary with terrain, range, and
     type (pulse or doppler). On must systems, color represents the strength
     of an enemy radar signal. See the Technical Supplement for the color
     codes used.
        Terrain: Radar is most effective over open water or flat countryside.
     In wooded and rolling hills radar effectiveness is less, while in
     mountainous country radar effectiveness is greatly reduced. The lower
     the radar effectiveness, the weaker their signal. This weakening is
     visible on the EMV scale: the bars represents enemy radar signals become
     shorter.
        Range: At very long ranges enemy radar is weak. As the range gets
     smaller, the radar becomes more powerful. Maximum range for a radar
     varies dramatically with the set. As enemy radars emit signals you can
     graphically see their ranges on the Satellite/Radar map on the left-side
     CRT (use CRT MAPS key).
        Pulse Radar: These radars are represented by dotted arcs on maps.
     Pulse radars are least effective when your nose or tail is pointing
     toward them, and most effective when your side points at them. Therefore
     a common tactic is to fly directly at a pulse radar, then just after it
     emits a signal make a tight turn and fly away from it again.
        Doppler Radar: These radars are represented by solid arcs on maps;
     they are generally more powerful than pulse radars. Doppler radar is
     most effective when you are flying toward or away from them, and least
     effective when you keep a constant distance from it (i.r., your side
     point at it). Therefore a common tactic is to fly toward a doppler until
     just before it detects you, then turn and fly in an arc around it,
     keeping a constant distance.

     Rules of Engagement

        The war situation (Cold, Limited or Conventional) determines the
     Rules of Engagement (ROE) in force. In Cold or Limited War you must
     prevent enemy aircraft and radars from reporting your presence. This
     means any who do see you should be destroyed if possible.
        Aircraft visual sightings are especially dangerous. You should make
     every effort to shoot down an aircraft that gains a visual sighting.
        Radar sightings are less dangerous, but a number of sightings is also
     very bad. Destroy radar sets that sight you where possible.
        Also note that the ROE during Cold and Limited War will penalize you
     for hitting certain targets. Indescriminate slaughter and destruction is
     not rewarded in these situations! See "Briefings, Rules of Engagement",
     page 99 for more details.
                                                                      - 61 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Defending Against Attacks

        Recognizing an Attack: Missiles cannot be fired until the enemy
     discovers your presence. As long as enemy search radars don't see you,
     you're safe from attack (with one exception, see below.
        Enemy radar-guided missiles and longer-ranged IR (infrared) missiles
     "telegraph" their intentions by tracking you on radar first. This
     activity lights up the "TRAK" warning light in your cockpit. Once a
     missile is fired the "R" radar missile warning light, or "I" infrared
     missile warning light begins flashing. When a missile is within a few
     seconds of hitting your craft the missile alarm klaxon sounds.
        Many short-range Ir missiles don't use radar guidance. Therefore,
     these missiles do not activate the "TRAK" light. Instead they're
     launched from a visual sighting. They do not require any radar searches
     or tracking. If you fly near these launchers or over troop
     concentrations, you can be attacked at any time.
        Disappearing: If you are attacked by radar-guided missiles (either
     the "TRAK" light is on, or the "R" missile warning is lighted), you can
     evade the attack by reducing your EMV or lower the enemy radar's
     effectiveness (or both). If the enemy radar loses sight of you the
     missile loses guidance and flies blindly ahead. It continues until
     either the enemy finds you again and steers the missile back on course,
     or the missile runs out of fuel.
        Decoys: Your F-19 carries three (3) general-purpose decoys (launched
     with the DECOY key). Each one lasts 150 to 60 seconds after launch,
     depending on enemy quality. Launch a decoy to draw the enemy away from
     your course, or if you're under attack by so many missiles and planes
     you can't possibly evade them all.
        Jammers: Use the ECM jammer against radar-guided missiles (missiles
     that light the "R" missile warning in your ockpit); use the IR jammer
     against IR guided missiles (those which light the "I" missile warning
     in your cockpit).
        After you turn on the jammer, change to a different course and get
     away from the missile. If you don't, when you turn off the jammer (or an
     advanced missile gets close enough to "burn through" your jammer), it
     will start homing on you again. Advanced missiles that can "burn
     through" jamming include semiactive radar and second generation IR
     missiles.
        Don't leave your jammers running. The ECM jammer increases your EMV,
     while the IR jammer reduces your speed. In addition, the IR jammer can
     overheat, causing it to automatically shut down until it cools off.
        Chaff and Flares: A chaff or flare cartridge will decoy a missile
     for a few seconds. During that time the missile flies toward the chaff
     (if a radar homing missile) or a flare (if an IR homing missile).
        Fire a flare cartridge (tap the FLARE key) when an infrared missile
     ("I" missile warning is lighted) causes the klaxon to sound.
        Fire a chaff cartridge (tap the CHAFF key) when a radar missile ("R"
     missile warning is lighted) causes the klaxon to sound. Then
     immediately turn
                                                                      - 62 -
     perpendicular to the missile's path, which is the safest way to evade
     a doppler-radar missile.
        Maneuvering:  Missiles only have a 45o forward "view". If you are
     outside of this arc, the missile cannot track you. Therefore, if you
     can lure the missile with a decoy, chaff or flare, or jam it, then fly
     outside of this arc, it will fly off. Some missiles, unfortunately, may
     circle around for another pass.
        Missiles also have very wide turning circles. you can "turn inside"
     a missile, causing it to zoom past you.
        A Note on Missile Warheads: Most missiles have proximity warheads:
     they explode when they pass within a certain distance of an aircraft.
     The warhead is in the center section of the missile. However, the rocket
     motor to the rear is often unaffected by the warhead, and continues
     running. Therefore a missile may appear to keep on going after it
     explodes.
                                                                      - 63 -
                             Postflight Debriefing
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ending a Mission

        Safe Landings: When you land, stop, and turn off your engines the
     mission is over. Once you land, you CANNOT refuel or rearm to continue
     the mission. All stealth missions are costly, carefully planned "one
     shot" operations. If a missile fails, higher-ups will decide later
     whether to try again, and if so, when, where and how. You may even get
     the same mission again some day!
        Crashes: If you're using easy or realistic flight, crashing the
     aircraft ends the mission. It also ends your career. To remain alive,
     you must eject before the plane hits the ground. Of course, selecting
     "no crash" eliminates this problem. Its also greatly reduces your
     possible score.
        Bailing Out: Safe ejection occurs between 2000 and 14000' altitude
     with the plane in a gentle climb. Ejecting outside of these limits,
     especially from a plane under 2000' altitude or in an inverted dive,
     can cripple or kill you.
        Where you eject is important. Ejecting over water, away from an enemy
     coastline, is the ideal location. You can be rescued and the aircraft
     sinks out of sight. The next best location is over friendly territory.
     Again, you can be rescued, but fragments of the wreckage could be found
     by the public or enemyspies. Bailing out over enemy territory is the
     worst option. You will probably be captured, and fragments of the
     wreckage will certainly be found by the enemy, helping them learn the
     secrets of American stealth technology. Furthermore, if you are
     captured, you may suffer a public trial and other humaniliations before
     the Air Force manages an exchange to get you back.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ratings

        After the mission you are debriefed. Your cammander goes over the
     mission step by step, evaluating each event as it occurs and assigning
     a numerical score. Basically, if you accomplish the mission and follow
     the Rules of Engagement (ROE, see page 99), you'll  do well. The more
     difficult or impossible to gain any credit.
        Cold War: Here it's important that nobody detect your presence.
     Visual sightings by enemy aircraft do the most damage. Enemy radars
     that positively track your plane are also bad. On the other hand, your
     commander gives you some credit for undetected flight through enemy
     territory.
        Needless to say, random destruction is also a "no-no" in cold war.
     Naturally, destroying friendly planes and ground installations is the
     worst possible event. However, destruction of neutral or civilian
     target is almost as bad. The least embarassing events are destruction
     of enemy military targets, although even that should be avoided. In
     fact, the only time it is "permissible" to destroy
                                                                      - 64 -
     targets is if your mission orders require it, the enemy has sighted or
     tracked you, or if the enemy fired first.
        Limited War: Here it's still important to avoid detection, although
     the penalties aren't as great. Flying undetected is worth a bit, but not
     much. On the other hand, your commander wholeheartedly approves of
     attacks on enemy forces, including military aircraft and obvious
     military installations. Civilian targets (such as passenger airliners,
     oil wells, refineries, bridges, etc.) will cause political problems and
     lower your rating.
        Conventional War: Here your commander doesn't care if you're
     detected. Of course, you may still care, since when the enemy detects
     you they tend to launch all sorts of aircraft and missiles in your
     direction!
        You will gain credit for destroying anything in enemy territory, even
     civilian targets (although military ones are worth more). In fact, your
     commander rather expects that you'll do a bit more than just hit the
     objectives. The only negatives possible come from the destruction of
     neutrals and friendlies.
        Training: You get no credit for training missions. Training missions
     do not count toward promotions either (and therefore don't "drag down"
     your average either).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Decorations, Promotion & Reputation

        Combat Decorations: If your rating on a single mission is high, your
     commander will recommend you for a decoration. The five possible
     decorations, from easiest to most difficult to achieve, are:
        AM:    Airman's Medal - recognizez heroic performance
        DFC:   Distinguished Flying Cross - for superior performance in
               combat
        SS:    Silver Star for Valor - for heroism in combat
        AFC:   Air Force Cross - for extreme heroism
        CMOH:  Congressional Medal of Honor - America's highest military
               decoration

        You'll find that you must be outstandingly successful against the
     toughest opposition in the world to be nominated for the Congressional
     Medal of Honor.
        Other Decorations: The PURPLE HEART is awarded to pilots who come
     home wounded. Surviving a mission with a badly damaged aircraft
     frequently yields this award.
        The COMBAT READINESS MEDAL is awarded to pilots who successfully
     complete combat training by achieving the mission objective. Beyond
     this, the number of missions you survive determines what other ribbons
     you may receive: 5 missions for the OVERSEAS RIBBON - SHORT TOUR, 15
     missions for the OVERSEAS RIBBON - LONG TOUR, 30 missions for the
     LONGEVITY SERVICE RIBBON, and 60 missions for the LONGEVITY SERVICE
     RIBBON with GOLD CLUSTER.
        Promotions: Your starting rank is 2nd Lieutenant. Promotions are
     based both on your total score and on your average score per mission.
     Therefore, if you "goof up" and do badly in a mission, you may need
     extra high-scoring missions before you quality for promotion. In
     addition, you can't get promoted
                                                                      - 65 -
     without having sufficient experience (at least 2 missions for First
     Lieutenant, 5 missions for Captain, 10 for Major, etc). Ranks available
     from lowest to highest, include:

          2nd Lt:   Second Lieutenant (lowest)
          1st Lt:   First Lieutenant
          Capt:     Captain
          Maj:      Major
          Lt. Col:  Lieutenant Colonel
          Col:      Colonel
          B. Gen:   Brigadier General (highest)

        Brigadier General is not a flying rank. You don't have a chance of
     earning that until you're retired from active duty. No pilot is
     expected to fly more than 99 missions. After that the Air Force
     decides: are you promoted to Brigadier General, are you simply given
     a Washington desk job, or do they suggest you leave the service and
     seek your fortune in civilian life? Very, few pilots survive 99
     missions  with a record good enough to earn their "star".
        Incidentally, don't feel badly about a middling rank. In active
     fighter squadrons most pilots are First Lieutenants and Captains.
     Majors serve as flight leaders, Lieutenant Colonels as higher squadron
     officers or commanders, and full Colonels as squadron or wing
     commanders. Promotion to Major or above is increasingly difficult. A
     Lieutenant Colonel still flying active combat missions is an awesome
     thing in the USAF.
        Reputation: In the Officer's Club ("O-club") bar, a flier's
     reputation is based primarily on how many missions he's flown. A
     50-mission veteran has much greater prestige than a 1-mission greenhorn.
     Veterans of similar seniority mat sometimes compare ratings, but nobody
     worries much about ranks or medals: as a fighter pilot, you're already
     a member of a very exclusive club.

     Saving Your Record & Ending the Simulation

        Pilot records are saved automatically. Every time the simulation
     exits the Pilot Roster screen (either to quit the game or to start a
     new mission) the records for all pilots on the roster are updated.
        Note that dead (KIA - killed in action) and retired pilots cannot
     fly missions, but you can leave them on the roster to remind you of
     past glories (or failures).
                                                                      - 66 -

                            3: TECHNIQUES & TACTICS
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Aerodynamics and Flying

     This discussion of lift and flight is not rigorous or precise in a
     scientific sense, It only provides a rudimentary portrayal of the
     physics of flight and its practical effect on aircraft handling.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Basic Forces

        Lift: Aircraft fly because of a pressure difference as air flows over
     and under the wing. The wing design and airflow result in air moving
     faster over the top than over the bottom. This causes high pressure
     beneath the wing and low pressure above it. The wing is pushed upward,
     providing lift. If the pressure difference is great enough, the upward
     lift is greater than the plane's weight (i.e., the force of gravity)
     and the aircraft flies.
        The Four Forces: Aircraft in flight have four basic forces acting on
     them. Thrust pushes the plane forward; it varies with engine power. Drag
     reduces the effct of thrust, but is relatively constant. Therefore, when
     horizontal, more thrust means faster forward velocity. Gravity pulls the
     plane toward the ground, regardless of the plane's attitude. Lift pushes
     upward from the wings, directly opposing gravity gravity when the wings
     are level.
                                                                      - 69 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     How Lift Varies

        Speed & Lift:  The amount of lift generated by the wing varies with
     airspeed. The faster the plane flies, the faster the air flows, so the
     greater the pressure difference. If your plane is in level flight at a
     certain speed, reducing the speed reduces lift, causing a descent (even
     though you didn't nose down).
        Angle of Attack & Lift: The amount of lift generated also varies
     with the angle between the wings and the airflow. If you pitch up a few
     degrees, you increase the pressure difference across the wing,
     increasing the lift. If you pitch down the nose, the reverse occurs.
     This difference between the airflow direction and a line through the
     wing (the wing "chord") is the "angle of attack" (AoA).
        Angle of attack is visible on your HUD in NAV and AIR-GROUND modes.
     In level flight, whenever your nose indicator is above your flight
     path, the difference between the two is the Angle of Attack.
        Level Flight: To acheive "level" flight at a given power setting, a
     pilot raises or lowers the nose until the VVI shows zero (i.e., no
     ascent or descent appears on the "V" strip gauge). Note that a pitch
     of 0o may show ascent or descent. Nosing up or down to a new "angle of
     attack" adds or subtracts lift as needed to acheive level flight.
     NEVER assume that a pitch of zero automatically means level flight.
     Chances are good it doesn't!
        To achieve "level" flight at a specific airspeed, the pilot first
     gets into level flight, next adjusts his throttle to achieve the
     desired speed, then adjusts his nose to find level flight for the new
     airspeed.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Effect of Roll

        Lift is a force perpendicular to the wing. If the wings are tilted
     (your aircraft is rolling or banking) the lift force is no longer
     straight up. Instead it has two components, one moving the aircraft
     sideways, the other straight up. This causes the plane to turn.
     However, it also reduces the force opposing gravity.
        As the bank increases, more and more force is needed to keep the
     plane flying level, since a smaller part of the fource counteracts
                                                                      - 70 -
     gravity. This forece is measured in Gs, and is the reason pilots are
     pressed into their seats during a tight turn. Normal gravity and weight,
     standing on earth, is 1G. Pilots normally cannot survive more than
     7 to 9Gs; any more and they black out, losing control and crashing.
        During a turn a pilot can adjust the angle of attack by control stick
     "backpressure", that is, by pulling back slightly on the stick. The
     amount of adjustment is very small. Overcorrecting is a common error
     among beginner pilots.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Special Situations

        Stalls: An aerodynamic stall occurs when the wing's angle of attack
     becomes too large. The air stops flowing smoothly over the wing, and
     instead part breaks away onto an independent path. This erases the
     pressure difference, vastly reduces lift, and generally causes the nose
     to drop. Stall speed varies considerably depending on aircraft attitude,
     flaps configuration, etc. Tight turns increase the stall speed. Note
     that simultaneously the act of turning tends to decrease your airspeed.
     As a result, stalls are quite common in tight turns.
        Some versions of the F-19 have an audible stall warning horn. All
     versions have a colored bar showing stall speed on the HUD's airspeed
     indicator.
        The F-19 includes a computerized stall recovery governor that
     instantly reconfigures the wing edges for automatic recovery, making
     your job much easier. To recover from a stall, first level the wings,
     then bring the pitch back to normal. A stall invariably costs you
     altitude, so a stall at low altitude can be fatal!
        Flaps: Lowering flaps extends the wing surface and increases the
     pressure difference, adding more lift. They also increase drag, which
     lowers your speed. However, flaps are only useable at low speeds
     (under 300 knots).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Military Landings

        The "straight-in" landing technique described on page 69 is used by
     pilots who are wounded or are flying damaged aircraft. Military pilots
     normally use a 360o Overhead Pattern for maximum speed and efficiency in
     the landing pattern. Pilots who fancy themselves "real Air Force men"
     should use real military landings, not simple straight-in landings.
        A military land pattern has 7 parts: Initial, Pitch Out, Inside
     Downwind, Perch, Final Turn, Final, and Touch Down.
        Pitch Out: Shortly after the runway disappears beneath you, begin the
     "pitch out" turn by banking gradually to a 45 to 60o roll (a left bank
     is preferred by many pilots). This will be a full 180o turn. Your speed
     should drop to about 300 knots while in the turn. You may need to raise
     or lower your nose in the turn to maintain your altitude.
        Inside Downwind: When you finish the turn and level out, you're on
     the
                                                                      - 71 -
     "inside downwind" leg of the landing. Immediately reduce the throttle
     and nose up a bit more to maintain level flight at 300 kts, then lower
     your landing gear.
        Pearch: Look to the side at the runway. When you are even with the
     end of the runway or carrier deck, you've finished the inside downwind
     and are at "the perch", ready to start the final turn. Don't be
     surprised if the first time you look, you're already at the pearch - it
     comes up fast!
        At this point you lower your flaps. Now pitch the nose down until
     your VVI indicates a descent. As you drop the nose begin your final
     turn.
        Final Turn: This is a slow 180o descending turn. You will descend to
     about 300' (for a runway) or 100' (for an aircraft carrier) at 200 to
     230 knot airspeed. Your roll should be 15o to 30o in the turn. Notice
     that the altitude gauge on the HUD gains speed and detail once you pass
     the 1000' (1K) mark. Make sure you don't start out with too fast a
     descent.
        Change your nose pitch (up or down) to control the rate of descent in
     this final turn. You should finish the turn with the runway or carrier
     deck dead ahead.
        Final: When you finish the final turn lined up with the
     runway/carrier, pull the nose up to gain level flight, then back off a
     tiny bit for a very gentle descent. Change pitch to adjust your descent,
     and your throttle to adjust your speed. However, regulating your descent
     rate with pitch changes takes practice. You regulate with pitch (not
     throttle) because if you're too fast you can always cut the throttle or
     use the speed brake at the last minute, or at least come around again
     for another try. But if you get the throttle setting too low you may
     stall and crash
        Touch Down on Runways: When the wheels touch down on the runway, cut
     the throttle, lower the nose wheel to level, and apply the brakes. When
     you stop moving the
                                                                      - 72 -
     mission is over. As in all landings, the downward vertical velocity
     should be less than 400'/minute at touch down.
        A gradual touchdown, as described on page 55, is the safest and
     easiest method. However, "real" pilots reduce the throttle and pull on
     the stick slightly to "flae" on touch down. This scrubs extra speed and
     softens the landing. Of course, this can be tricky - novices sometimes
     "porpoise" or "bunny hop" down the runway because of too much stick
     movement, or worse yet, go too far and stall the plane.
        Touchdown on Aircraft Carriers: When the wheels touch down on the
     stern of the carrier, you should snag an arrestor cable and stop
     immediately. Cut the throttle and apply the brakes to end the mission.
     You can touch down on a carrier at greater vertical velocity than on a
     runway.

                                Radar & Stealth
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Radar

        Radar sends high frequency electro-magnetic waves through the
     atmosphere at virtually light speed. These waves bounce off solid
     objects. Some bounce back toward the radar set, which includes a signal
     receiver. By measuring the strenght of the returning signal, angles of
     returning waves, time it took to return, etc., radars estimate the
     range, position, and size of an object.
        Radar waves bounce best from solid, dense, flat, perpendicular
     surfaces. Traditional aircraft shapes, especially aircraft engine
     intakes, slab-sided fuselages, and vertical tail fins make excellent
     radar reflectors

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Stealth Technology

        The radar reflections of an object are greatly reduced if its shape
     minimizes the returning waves. This does not make the object invisible,
     but does make it very hard to "see". For example, if a normal airplane
     is visible to a radar at 200 kilometers away, a carefully shaped
     airplane might be invisible beyond 50 kilometers! Creating this shape
     in a form that is also aerodynamic requires extremly complex computer
     modeling. As the world's leader in computer applications, it's
     inevitable that America would be first in this field. The SR-71 spy
     plane is an early example of such shapes in aerodynamics; the redesign
     of the B-1 bomber fuselage is another example.
        In addition to shape, certain rubber and ceramic compounds tend to
     "absorb" radar waves, making the return signal weaker than normal. Known
     generically as RAM (Radar Absorbent Material), it can be incorporated in
     paints, or plantes in "wedges" along the surface of a wing or fuselage.
        Finally, an airplane's heat signature is an important consideration.
     Many airplane-killing missiles home on the heat sources. The newer
     longer-wavelenght sensors see warm parts of the craft (such as leading
     edges of the wings, tail, and air intakes) heated by air friction. The
     main defense against heat-seekers is to incorporate heat-resistant
     materials onto edges that "cut" through the air, and to mask and
     disperse the hot engine exhaust as much as possible.
        "Stealth" is the combnation of superior shapes and RAM materials
     that vastly minimizes the radar and infrared visibility of an aircraft.
     The F-19 design sacrifices speed, maneuverability, and payload for
     maximum stealth. The air intakes to the twin turbofan engines are
     masked. The fuselage is molded into the wing shape to eliminate hard
     angles, as well as letting the
                                                                      - 74 -
     fuselage itself act as a "lifting body". The tail is twinned and tilted
     inward to reduce reflections. Upper and lower hull and wing surfaces are
     covered with RAM inserts. All weapons are carried internally, since
     external pylons and armaments are excellent radar reflectors. All
     leading edges incorporate heat-resistant surfaces. The jet exhausts is
     directed through slats that absorb heat and mix in cooler air to break
     up the rearward heat signature.
        Stealth also demands a new approach to combat operations. For decades
     jet aircraft have carried radars of increasing power, using them to aim
     weapons, check altitude, and to fly low at high speeds. All this radar
     broadcasting often reveals a plane long before enemy radars discover it.
     A stealth aircraft must fly without active radar emissions. The F-19
     uses visual, thermal and laser systems instead of radars. In addition,
     it has radio burst decoder that is designed compatible with other USAF
     transmission equipment. On an active mission the F-19 constantly
     receives data bursts from friendly AWACS planes and ground radars.
        Overall, the F-19 is most difficult to detect at very low altitudes.
     Even at higher altitudes (over 1000') it is far less visible on radar
     than a normal aircraft. This not only allows the F-19 to "sneak up" on
     the enemy, it also reduces the range and accuracy of enemy weapons.
                                                                      - 75 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Stealth Tactics

        Planning: As a stealth pilot, you must plan your mission. You're
     seeking the best way to slip past the enemy radar defenses, a route in
     and out that either makes you invisible, or makes you visible for the
     shortest periods of time.
        Even the best of plans must be modified once the mission starts.
     Enemy fighter patrols and Mainstays can force you to change your plan,
     while the periodic shut-downs of enemy radars can suddenly open new
     opportunities. You must keep your plans flexible.
        EMV: The F-19's stealth configuration is most effective when flying
     at very low altitude (at 500' or less, and preferably about 200'). The
     EMV is further reduced if the engines are throttled back to cruise speed
     (70% power). Level flight, which presents a horizontal profile, is best.
     The steeper the turn, the more topside or underside surface is presented
     as a radar reflector, and thus the higher your EMV.
        Your flight path is a crucial consideration with enemy doppler
     radars. Changing distance to a doppler radar increases their detection
     abilities manyfold. If you remain at a constant distamce, arcing around
     the radar, their detection ability drops precipitously.
        On the negative side, opening the weapons bay, firing a weapon, or
     using the ECM jammer all raise your EMV, making the plane more visible.
     On the plus side, if you want to deliberately lure the enemy to a
     certain location without wasting a decoy, then turn on your jammer,
     opening the bay, and spiralling upward in a tight turn often raises the
     EMV enough to make you visible. You can then close up, dive down to
     200' again, and zoom away while they chase phantoms.
        Low Altitude Tactics: On long missions with flight legs outside
     effective enemy radar range it's perfectly safe to use the autopilot
     and cruise at 500'. When within enemy radar maximum range, get down as
     low as you can. Flying through valleys between hills and mountains is
     always better than flying over them. Although coming up over ridgelines
     is fun flying, every time you crest a ridge you're a sitting duck for
     enemy radar. Under 500' be prepared for a rough ride due to air
     temperature changes near the ground.
        One especially sneaky tactic is to fly extremely low (200' or less)
     and throttle back your engine to about 30% power. You'll need to extend
     flaps and pitch up (far a high angle of attack) to stay airborne, but
     your EMV is now extremely low. F-19s have skimmed underneath patrolling
     MiG-29s and MiG-31s using this tactic.
        Threading the Needle:  Penetrating through enemy radar umbrellas is
     a tricky job. Remember that you should arc around doppler radars, but
     fly directly toward (or away from) pulse radars. The plotting of paths
     through radar areas is sometimes termed "threading the needle".
        Typically the pulse radars are shorter ranged and less efficient,
     making the dopplers your biggest problem. If you must fly into a pulse
     radar's effective range, you can arc around just inside and hope that
     your EMV is low enough,
                                                                      - 76 -
     and their crews sleepy enough that they don't see you.
        Beware of enemy fighter and AEW&C patrols when "threading the
     needle". Your ideal course can turn into a death trap if enemy fighters
     are waiting for you, or you fly strait toward an Il-76 "Mainstay".
        Decoys: In Cold War or Limited War you must avoid leaving a positive
     radar ID. If your flight path takes you too close to enemy radars, you
     can try leaving one or two decoys behind you. This can prevent them from
     getting a positive radar ID on you.
        Dash: Many radars turn off periodically. If you see a critical
     doppler radar station stop broadcasting, that may give you just the edge
     you need to get past them without being seen. Dashing through a radar's
     area while he's off the airis always risky: you never know if he'll
     "wake up" and find you. Alas, sometimes there's no better way.
        Blast: If you can't think of any better way to get through the
     enemy radar screen, a final device is to use a Maverick or HARM missile
     to destroy the radar, opening a gap. Of course, you've got to dash
     through the gap and get away quickly, since enemy aircraft are drawn
     like flies to the site of any attack. Other radar stations also tend to
     "wake up" and stay on the air more after an attack. One way to "set up"
     a blast attack is show yourself briefly in one location, drawing enemy
     fighters away from the area you plan to fly through and/or attack.
                                                                      - 77 -
                             Air-to-Ground Tactics
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ground Attack
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Target Selection

        Regardless of the weapon system you're using, attacks are much easier
     if your tracking camera is following the target. Remember that the color
     and size of the target box on your HUD graphically illustrates the
     effectiveness of your current ordnance. A totally ineffective weapon
     shows a special color target box (see the Technical Supplement). If a
     weapon is effective, the larger the box, the greater its effectiveness.
        The SELECT TARGET key cycles among all pre-programmed targets in the
     near vicinity ahead of you. Pre-programmed targets include your primary
     and secondary targets, SAM sites, warships, and airbases.
        If you wish to select some other target, you must use the DESIGNATE
     NEW TARGET key function. This locks the tracking camera onto the nearest
     available target directly ahead. The new target joins the pre-programmed
     list (in the Select Target cycle) until you either destroy it or
     designate something else instead. A nearly infinite variety of ground
     targets can be designated, from troop concentrations to major bridges.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Strafing with Cannon

        See "How to Fight, The 20mm Cannon", page 57 for specific
     instructions on how to operate the cannon.
        Using your M61A1 20mm Vulcan cannon against ground targets requires
     some skill. In a strafing attack you fly low (under 500') and level.
     Because the cannon gunsight is optimized for air-air combat, "walking"
     your shells across the ground is the be way to hit a target.
     Unfortunately this uses a lot of ammunition. Experienced pilots confine
     themselves ranging bursts until they're close, then use continous
     "walking" fire at the very end, just before they pull away.
        The most difficult problem in strafing runs is your limited range.
     Maximum cannon range is only 6 kilometers, and effective range really 3
     kilometers. This means you have a couple of seconds to hit the target
     before it passes beneath your gun.
        A common error when strafing is "target fixation" where you ignore
     altitude. Remember that strafing means diving - and you've got to come
     up again sometime!
        After you pass your target, close the air brakes, open the throttle
     and turn away. Keep an eye on your missile warnings and be ready to
     drop chaff or flares.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air-to-Ground Missile Launch

        See Aircraft Controls, Weaponry, page 43-45 for specific
     instructions on how to use air-to-ground missiles.
        The Maverick (AGM-65D) and HARM (AGM-88A) missiles are both "fire
     and forget" weapons. Once your tracking camera is on the right target,
     it's just a
                                                                      - 78 -
     Matter of waiting for the tracking box to change from square to oval
     (indicating a lock-on), and then the oval to change color (indicating a
     high-accuracy firing solution). Air-to-Ground missiles are valuable, so
     it's generally wise to wait for the highest accuracy shot possible.
        When launched the missile starts with your course and velocity, but
     will fall through the air about 300' before its motor fully ignites and
     accelerates the weapon. Therefore, unless you're climbing, it's unwise
     to fire below 500', and very unwise to fire in a power dive (as the
     missile may slam into the ground before it can fly away). It is also
     extremely unwise to fire while in a tight turn or inverted, as the
     missile may tumble when leaving the bay, losing guidance or even
     smashing into your plane.
        The maximum range of a missile depends both on the amount of fuel it
     has and its launching speed. The faster you're flying, the greater the
     missile range. The tracking box turns oval when you are in absolute
     maximum range. Therefore, if you're flying slowly it's wise to wait a
     bit before launching.
        Once the missile is launched you can change to new targets, new
     weapons, and maneuver as you wish.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     PAVE TACK: Laser Glide Bombing

        See "How to Fight", page 58 for specific instructions on operating
     PAVE TACK laser-guided bombs, including toss bombing.
        Range: Glide bombs can fly about 2 kilometers distance for every
     1000' of altitude you have.
        Toss Bombing: This tactic (described on page 58) is the best method,
     since you can approach the target low (about 500'), and only pitch up
     briefly during the release, after which you roll over and turn away as
     the bomb hits the target.
        Level Bombing: You can level bomb with glide bomb weapons. As a
     general rule you'll need to attack from at least 2000' altitude. Here
     you can lock onto the target at 4 km range. Attack immediately and turn
     away. Remember, though, to keep your underside facing the target. You
     can fly over the target instead of flying past at an angle, but you must
     rise above 3000' to do this safely.
        Needless to say, these high altitudes make you a sitting duck for
     enemy radars and SAMs.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Retarded Bombs

        See "How to Fight", page 59 for specific instructions on launching
     retarded bombs.
        Altitude: Retarded bombs are the easiest and safest weapons to use,
     and one of the most popular among USAF pilots. If you keep up speed in
     your bombing run, you can safely release from just above 500' altitude,
     even though the burst area is 3000'. This is because retarded bombs
     lose speed very quickly,
                                                                      - 79 -
     causing them to rapidly fall behind your aircraft.
        Accuracy: Retarded bombs are also less accurate than free-fall or
     laser-guided bombs. Therefore it's unwise to attack from a high
     altitude, since they will probably miss. It's also very difficult to hit
     pin-point targets with retarded bombs, although cluster bombs (like the
     Rockeye or the Mk 35) give good area coverage, compensating to some
     degree for drop inaccuracies.
        Dive bombing and toss bombing don't produce useful results with
     retarded bombs. You must use level bombing.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Free-Fall Bombs

        See "How to Fight", pages 59-60 for specific instructions on dropping
     free-fall bombs in level flight. Although easily perfected, this
     technique requires you to fly a long, straight course at high altitude
     (3000') - a rather dangerous practice! Dive bombing is a more accurate
     technique, but requires considerable practice and skill.
        Dive Bombing Technique: To make a dive-bombing attack, start by
     flying low toward the target. Switch your HUD to Air-Ground mode, make
     sure the correct ordnance is selected (Mk 82-0 Slick or Mk 122 Fireye),
     and put your tracking camera onto the target. Now follow these three
     steps:
        (1) GUIDE ON THE BOMBSIGHT FLIGHT PATH: Approach the target by
     flying straight at the diamond-shaped bombing flight path indicator.
     It's okay if the indicator is above or below your flight path, but make
     sure it's not to the left or right.
        (2) CLIMB TO ATTACK POINT: As you get to 6 km from the target, zoom
     up into a 55o climb to reach an altitude of 8K (8000') opening your bay
     doors as you climb. Your objective is to reach the 8000' point about
     1.5 to 2 km away from the target.
        (3) DIVE ONTO THE TARGET: Level out, flick open the brakes (tap the
     BRAKES key), and at just under 1 km away push down into a steep (80o)
     dive. As you plummet earthward, line up the bomb bullseye (the circle
     on the end of the fall-line) onto the target box center. Keep an eye on
     your altitude. If you drop below 3K' (3000'), pull out and try again -
     you must drop before reaching 3K' altitude.
        (4) RELEASE BOMB AND TURN AWAY: If you manage to keep the bullseye
     steady within the
                                                                      - 80 -
     target box before reaching 3K' altitude, release a bomb immediately.
     Then continue the dive and alignment, releasing another just before you
     reach 3000' assuming you can keep the plane aligned on the target box.
     After the release pull up sharply and roll away in a 90o turn. Close the
     brake as you do this, to maintain maximum speed into the turn. Then
     close the weapon bay doors.
        Notes: The zoom climb to 8K is the most critical phase of the attack.
     If performed flawlessly, a 55o climb will cover 4 km of ground, assuming
     you start at maximum level speed with 200' altitude and wish to arrive
     at 8000'. Some pilots refer to use a slightly shallower zoom climb up to
     10000', but this exposes you longer, at higher altitudes, to enemy fire.
        Climbing to a dive bombing position usually broadcasts your presence
     to the opposition. Therefore, once you're turning away from the target
     after the bombing run, look over and check the R and I missile warning
     lights for an attack.
        The most common mistake when dive bombing is forgetting to open the
     brakes at the top of the climb (i.e., just before you dive). With the
     brakes closed you plummet so fast it's almost impossible to line up the
     target and release the bomb before reaching 3K' altitude.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Cameras

        See "How to Fight", page 60 for specific instructions on how to
     operate the 135mm/IR camera. Always remember to use Air-Ground mode and
     lock the tracking camera onto the target at the start of the run. After
     you open the bay doors you'll fly to align the Camera Lens Sight in the
     target box, snapping the pictures as you do so.
        Camera runs are similar to strafing runs, but somewhat easier because
     the downward cant of the camera means you can fly a level run, rather
     than dive and pull-out. Some camera experts prefer to fly in a gradually
     increasing climb to hold it on target.
        The greatest difficult in camera runs is clicking the picture at just
     the right instant. Flying with air brakes extended slows your speed,
     making it easier to line up your shots.
        Remember: A successful photographic mission requires a safe landing
     to deliver the film.

     ========================================================================
     SAMs (Surface-to-Air Missile Systens)

     To avoiding enemy SAMs you must understand them. Then you can
     intelligently apply the appropriate defense.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Radar-Controlled SAMs

        Concept: Medium- and long-ranged SAMs are controlled by radar. All
     types use the same three-step process to engage you, their target:
        (1) RADAR SEARCH: Their search radar scans the sky for alien planes,
     such as yours. Although human eyesight can aid in the search, its range
     is much less,
                                                                      - 81 -
     especially in bad weather. Search radars scan an entire 360o area
     periodically.
        (2) RADAR TRACKING: When a search radar finds your plane, it "hands
     off" the prospective target to a narrow-beam fire control radar,
     usually running on a different frequency. This narrow beam finds and
     locks onto your craft. When the fire control operators are sure their
     beam is tracking correctly they launch a missile.
        (3) RADAR CONTROL: Once the missile is launched, the ground radar
     continues tracking your plane so the missile's course can be updated
     and corrected. There are two common methods of doing this, the older
     "beam rider" (or "command guidance") technique, and the newer
     "semi-active homing" technique.
        Beam Rider SAMs: Using this system, the tracking radar simply
     continues tracking you, its target, while the SAM guides along that
     radar beam toward you. As long as the tracking beam remains on your
     plane, the SAM will hit.
        ECM jammers are an excellent all-purpose defense against beam riding
     missiles. Since your radar reflections must travel all the way back to
     the ground radar, the jammer remains effective even if the missile is
     very close.
        Beam-riders are also the least maneuverable of missiles. If the radar
     beam moves too fast the missile can't correct fast enough and "loses"
     guidance.
        Semi-Active SAMs: This type of missile has a radar receiver and
     computer in its nose. The tracking radar on the ground "paints" your
     aircraft with a radar signal and the missile's nose receiver "catches"
     the reflections. The missile homes on these reflections until it hits
     you.
        ECM jammers are useful only at long range against these semi-active
     SAMs. At close range the "painting" reflections to the missile are very
     strong - strong enough to "burn
                                                                      - 82 -
     through" your jamming. As a result, the missile finds you again,
     assuming you've remained in its 45o field of view.
        Command Guidance SAMs: These modern missiles use semi-active guidance
     (see above). In addition, the firer has a command link to the missile,
     which he can use to override the semi-active guidance. This means that
     if the missile loses guidance or is otherwise confused, the ground
     controller can turn the missile around and try again.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Evading Radar Guided SAMs

        Reduce EMV: The basic way to evade radar-guided SAMs is to disappear
     from their radar. If their signals are just barely overlapping your EMV,
     you should find a way to simply "disappear".
        First and foremost, the further you are from the enemy radar, the
     weaker their signal. Therefore you may wish ti simply turn and run away
     from a while,  until their signal is too weak to "see" you. If the enemy
     is a doppler radar, at various points you should turn parallel to the
     radar. When you do, his signal weakens.
        Also remember that reducing your altitude, lowering your engine
     power, and levelling out your flight all help. Make sure the weapon bay
     doors are closed, the landing gear up, and the ECM jammer is off.
        Decoys: A decoy will fool enemy radars for 15 to 60 seconds,
     depending on the skill of the enemy. During this time missiles, like
     everyone else, will pursue the decoy instead of you. This gives you a
     perfect opportunity to outmaneuver the missile by escaping its 45o
     field of view.
        ECM: Your ECM (electronic counter-measures) radar jammer is an
     excellent defense against beam-riders. As long as it's running they are
     flying blind, and therefore unable to hit you. However, ECM is effective
     against semi-active SAMs only at long range. Remember that if you
     continue flying toward a jammed semi-active missile, eventually it will
     "burn through" and start homing on you.
        ECM jamming makes a lot of noise. Therefore, don't use a jammer
     against semi-active SAMs unless you're going to turn away.
        Chaff: Each chaff cartridge deploys a cloud of tiny tin-foil strips
     that reflect enemy radar. For two or more seconds the strips from a huge
     radar reflector, effectively blinding it, lika a smoke screen.
        Therefore, the classic chaff technique is to wait until a
     radar-guided missile is just a couple seconds away (i.e., when the
     missile proximity klaxon sounds). At that instant fire a chaff cartridge
     (tap the CHAFF key) and turn away. The blinded missile will fly straight
     into the chaff, missing you.
        WARNING: Chaff may not fool a doppler-guided missile (SA-10, SA-12,
     SA-N-6, or AA-10). In this case, you must turn perpendicular to the
     missile.
        Maneuvering: It's important to remember that defense devices aren't
     perfect. Some missiles can "burn through" your ECM. All missiles
     continue seeking after your decoy or chaff expires. Doppler missiles
     will ignore chaff if you're on the wrong course.
                                                                      - 83 -
        Therefore, it's important to maneuver out of the missile's field of
     view when the defense expires. If you don't, the missile will re-acquire
     you and continue on a collision course!
        If you're an especially skillful pilot, you can try out-maneuvering
     and enemy missile without mechanical aids.
        In any case, see "Outmaneuvering a Missile", below. Smart pilots
     normally use both their equipment and their maneuvering skills.
        Warnings & Responses: Your first warning of a radar SAM attack is
     when enemy search radar finds you. Your second warning is when they
     switch over and begin tracking. This sets off your cockpit TRAK light.
     During these stages reducing the EMV is your best defense.
        Your third and most important warning is when the missile warning
     light (in this case the "R" light) comes on. This means a missile is in
     the air, flying toward you. Reducing your EMV may derail the enemy
     attack, but if you're too close to their radar you must use other
     defenses.
        Against a beam-rider you can turn on the ECM, change course a bit,
     and laugh as it flies blindly past.
        Against a semi-active missile you can either jam with ECM or drop a
     decoy, then change course. Some people use both - decoy first, then the
     jammer for insurance. However, this technique only makes sense if you
     can escape the missile's 45o field of view before the decoy and/or ECM
     effects end.
        Your final warning is the missile proximity klaxon. It sounds when
     the missile is just a couple of seconds away. Check the cockpit - if the
     "R" light is burning then a radar missile is inbound. IMMEDIATELY drop a
     chaff cartridge and turn away.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     IR (Infrared) Homing SAMs

        Concept:  Short-range SAMs are usually IR (infrared) homing. The
     largest and most powerful use a three-step process like radar-guided
     missiles:
        (1) Radar search: A search radar inds your aircraft (the "TRAK" light
     comes on in the cockpit).
        (2) Radar tracking: A tracking radar follows your aircraft (the "TRAK"
     light comes on in the cockpit).
        (3) Missile launch: The IR homing missile is launched (the "I"
     missile warning light comes on in the cockpit). At this point tracking
     radar is unnecessary, as the missile can guide itself to target.
        (1) Search: The enemy, searching the sky, detects your plane. Some
     systems use a search radar, others get search information from other
     radar stations over the radio, and some rely on simple eyesight.
        (2) Missile lock-on: The missile is aimed at your plane. If you're
     close enough and "hot" enough, the missile will see your heat signature
     and lock on.
        (3) Missile launch: Once locked on, the missile launches and guides
     itself toward you.
        Shoulder-Launched IR SAMs: The existence of man-portable IR SAMs

                                                                      - 84 -
     makes your life difficult. The enemy frequently waits until point-blank
     range to launch these missiles, the preferred technique being to launch
     them during your attack run.
        Carried by infanterymen, in trucks and jeeps, or stacked inside a
     building door, they are virtually undetectable until fired. Whenever
     significant enemy military forces are deployed you can except these
     weapons. This includes rear area headquarters and depots as well as
     frontline troops.
        First Generation IR Hormers: Early IR homing systems required a large
     heat signature as a target. On a jet airplane, the only area hot enough
     was the engine exhaust. As a result, the missile wouldn't "lock on"
     until aimed at the rear of the plane. Furthermore, the homing head
     wasn't especially sophisticated or sensitive. Just about anything would
     confuse it (including the sun or hot rocks on the ground!)
        Your IR jammer is almost guaranteed to confuse a first generation IR
     homer. As long as you leave the jammer on, the missile will be unable to
     follow your plane. Remember, though, that the jammer slows you down, and
     will eventually overheat, causing it to shut off automatically.
        You can also outmaneuver first generation IR missiles by turning
     tightly toward them. This "rotates" your hot exhaust away from the
     missile's view. The missile may try to turn and follow your exhaust,
     but a tight enough turn always outmaneuvers it (see "Outmaneuveringa
     Missile", below).
        Second Generation IR Homers: Modern IR homing systems are far more
     sophisticated or sensitive. They are tuned to fine changes in
     temperature, and only "recognize" temperature variations typical of
     aircraft. This includes not only the hot exhaust, but all surfaces
     heated by air friction. This heating typically occurs at the nose, wing
     roots, and across the upper surfaces of the plane. Therefore the front
     and top of a plane appear "hot", while the underside is relatively
     "cool". The missile can lock onto your plane whenever it "sees" a hot
     surface.
        IR jammers are only effective at long ranges against second
     generation IR homing missiles.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Evading IR SAMs

        Reduce EMV: As with radar-guided SAMs, if you reduce your EMV and
     disappear from search radars, the enemy is unable to launch new missiles
     at you. Unfortunately, it has no effect against missiles already in the
     air.
                                                                      - 85 -
        EMV reducing methods are the same as above (see "Evading Radar Guided
     SAMs").
        Decoys: A decoy will fool enemy IR missiles (like everyone else) for
     15 to 60 seconds. Tactics are therefore just like decoys against radar
     missiles - outmaneuver the missile by getting outside its view before
     the decoy expires.
        IR Jammers: This device is a heat strobe. It sends out pulses of heat
     that confuse a missile's warhead. The disadvantage of this equipment is
     that it must deploy a generator to provide sufficient power, slowing
     your airspeed by roughly 15%. In addition, the strobe can overheat if
     left running too long. When it overheats an automatic shut-off occurs
     (before it melts down!). If you try to turn it on again shortly after
     shut-off, the strobe is still hot. It will only run for a short time
     before shutting off again!
        First generation IR missiles are easily confused. The jammer is
     effective at virtually any range against these missiles. Unfortunately,
     second generation IR missiles are more "intelligent". They are "fooled"
     by IR jammers only at longer ranges. Even then the strobe pattern can be
     recognized by a seeker with advanced computer logocand once recognized
     the seeker actually homes on the jammer, instead of being confused by it.
        Therefore, it's unwise and sometimes downwright dangerous to leave a
     jammer running when second generation IR missiles are getting close (not
     to mention the jammer overheating and shutting off at an inconvenient
     time).
        Flares: Although called "flares", these are really small, finely
     tuned heat decoys. A flare lures an IR missile toward it (and away from
     you), but only during the 2 to 3 seconds it burns. After that the flares
     dies and the missile resumes seeking. Therefore, like chaff, the
     standard technique is to wait until the missile is a couple of seconds
     away (the klaxon sounds), then drop a flare while you turn away.
        Maneuvering: Maneuvering techniques against IR missiles are the same
     as those used against radar guided missiles. The only differnece is that
     IR missiles tend to be smaller and more maneuverable. Second generation
     missiles are often the most maneuverable, so you're best off relying on
     decoy, jammer and/or flares agianst them.
        Unlike radar guided SAMs, most IR SAMs are very maneuverable, with
     the ability to turn toward their target almost immediately after launch.
     As a result, flying low and close to a battery of maneuverable IR SAMs
     is very dangerous!
        Warnings & Responses: Your first warning of an IR missile attack can
     occur at any time. A search or tracking radar may alert you, just like a
     radar-guided SAM attack. In fact, at that point you can't tell that an
     IR missile attack is coming. However, when the missile is launched, the
     "I" missile warning light goes on (rather than the "R" light).
        In many cases your first warning of attack is the "I" missile warning
     light. This is because lots of cheap IR SAMs have no search radar - just
     eyesight searching. Your first warning is their launch.
        If you know the missile is a first-generation homer, you can turn on
     the IR
                                                                      - 86 -
     jammer, change course and laugh it off. However, it pays to be wary.
     Against second generation missiles the IR jammer may still work - if you
     can get outside it's 45o field of view before it gets too close, or the
     jammer overheats. The reduced airspeed due to using the jammer doesn't
     help, either. Otherwise, you'll have to wait for the proximity alarm
     klaxon.
        Many IR missiles are fired from very short ranges, so short that the
     "I" light is almost immediately followed by the proximity alarm klaxon.
     When you hear the klaxon and see the "I" light burning, your first act
     must be to drop a flare and then dodge!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Outmaneuvering a Missile

        Whether you're using jammers, decoys, or just plain guts, the basic
     principles of outmaneuvering a missile remain the same.
        Evading the Missile's View: SAMs can only "home" on targets within
     the acquisition arc of their seeker. This arc is a bare 45o ahead. If
     decoys, jammers, or whatever temporarily confuse a missile, you evade
     attack by moving outside this 45o arc. Usually the quickest escape
     course is one perpendicular to the missile's flight path.
        Turning inside a Missile: When a missile is close, you still have a
     chance to outmaneuver him. Its turning arc is larger than yours.
        If the missile is trying to fly up your tail, roll over onto a wingtip
     for a tight turn, then pull back hard on the control stick to tighten
     the turn further. Keep an eye on the airspeed, since you can't stay long
     in this kind of a turn - soon the plane will stall. But meanwhile, the
     missile is making a wider, faster turn that causes it to zoom past
     harmlessly.
        Turning toward a Missile: If a SAM approaches you from the side,
     gradually turn toward it, increasing the tightness of your turn as it
     comes closer. The objective is to keep the missile's course at right
     angles (perpendicular) to your own.
        This tactic works because the missile cannot turn with you. Instead
     it gradually falls behind, zooming past your tail.
        Evading Frontal Attacks: If a SAM approaches you from the front, wait
     until it's about 8 to 12 kilometers away (about 2/3rds of a grid square
     on the tactical display).
        Then make a quick 90o turn. This puts the missile facing your side.
     Now roll over 180o and turn toward the missile. Now you're set up for a
     turning battle (see "Turning toward a Missile" above).
                                                                      - 87 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Special Tactics & Problems

        Missile Minimum Range: Large less-maneuverable missiles fire straight
     up when first launched. This means that they can't begin homing until
     they're beyond a certain distance (in range and altitude) from their
     launchers. As a result, circling right over a battery of low-
     maneuverability SAMs can actually be very safe.
        Doppler Missiles: Enemy missiles with doppler guidance systems are a
     special danger. These missiles will not home on the chaff unless your
     course is perpendicular (at right angles to) the missile. If the missile
     chases you from the rear or attacks from straight ahead, chaff has no
     effect.
        Only three SAMs (Surface-to-Air missiles) currently have doppler
     guidance: the SA-10, SA-12, and SA-N-6. Only one AAM (air-to-air missile)
     has doppler guidance: the AA-10.
                                                                      - 88 -

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Attack Techniques
     ========================================================================
     Missiles

        Missile Ranges: The maximum range of a missile depends not only on
     its motor, but your plane's speed at launch and the direction of enemy
     movement. The initial "lock-on" range corresponds to missile maximum
     range if you're at maximum speed. However, if you're moving slower the
     missile may not get that extra boost needed to reach the target.
        A much more important consideration is the enemy's flight path. If
     the target plane is flying toward you, even a maximum range launch is
     likely to reach him. However, if the target plane is flying away the
     missie has a long "stern chase" ahead of it. In such a situation you
     should wait until the oval turns red before launching.
        Radar Guided Missiles: Your AIM-120 AMRAAM missile is one of the best
     medium-range weapons in the world. It is the only "fire and forget"
     radar-guided missile in American inventory. It has sufficient circuitry
     to penetrate most defenses, and sufficient maneuverability to chase down
     most fighters, not to mention nailing bombers and transports. Because
     the AIM-120 has greater range than the Sidewinder (32 km compared to 17
     km), pilots typically open fire with the AIM-120, then switch to
     Sidewinders if any enemy aircraft survive to that range.
        IR Guided Missiles: The short-range AIM-9M Sidewinder is probably the
     best dogfighting missile in the world. It is more maneuverable than the
     AMRAAM, giving it a better chance of "hanging on" to a twisting, turning
     target. The most advantageous firing position for the Sidewinder is up
     the enemy's tailpipes. The next best position is from above, diving down
     onto the top (hot side) of the enemy plane. The third best position is
     directly into the enemy's nose. Shots against the enemy as it crosses in
     front of you, or at its underside (the cold side) have very little
     chance of hitting.
        The main weakness of the Sidewinder is its limited range.
        Technique: When firing a missile, always remember to (1) open the bay
     doors, and (2) wait for the lock-on. If you don't wait for the target
     box to become oval-shaped, you're firing without a lock-on, and will
     almost certainly miss. Then look at your airspeed. If you're moving fast
     (around 500 kts) or the target is closing, a maximum range lock-on shot
     will probably hit. However, if your speed is low or the target flying
     away you should wait until the range closes, ideally until the oval
     turns red.
        Missile accuracy doesn't take into account enemy defensive equipment
     or evasive maneuvering. First line and elite fighter aircraft may prove
     more difficult to hit. Although the "Mainstay" AEW&C craft maneuvers
     poorly, it has superior defensive equipment. You may find that guns are
     necessary against Mainstays flown by a capable crew.
                                                                      - 89 -
        Firing Attitude: Also remember that AAMs, like other missiles, will
     fall 300' to 400' before their motor is powerful enough to guide them
     away to the target. Until then the missile has your speed and VVI. If
     you're diving at the ground, the missile may slam into the ground before
     it can fly away. Firing in a tight turn, or while inverted, can cause
     the missile to tumble as it leaves the weapons bay. The wisest method is
     to fire only when you're level and above 500'.
        Target Discrimination: Sidewinders and AMRAAMs always home on the
     most prominent target, which is usually the nearest. They will do so
     even if you were tracking someone else. In Cold War and Limited War,
     beware of this limited "brainpower" in your missiles. You may be
     tracking a primary or secondary target, fire a missile, and then
     discover it goes for one of the fighter escorts that happens to be
     closer!
        Notes: Your F-19 uses a tracking camera instead of weapon guidance
     radars. This system "downloads" appropriate launch parameters to the
     AIM-120 AMRAAM. Although the AIM-120 itself uses radar, the set switches
     on when the missile is launched. As a result, missile targeting does not
     increase your EMV. Of course, opening the bay doors to fire does
     increase your EMV. A skillful stealth pilot only opens the bay doors
     just before a launch, or during a dogfight.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Guns

        Jet aircraft travel so quickly that conventional machine guns and
     cannons cannot fire fast enough to guarantee a hit: a plane could
     literally fly between the shells. Therefore, modern aircraft cannon are
     either a group of guns (such as the twin 23mm cannons in many Russian
     MiGs) or a multi-barrel gatling gun (such as the six-barrel 20mm M61A1
     on most American jets). Cannons are used because they fire explosive
     shells (machine guns fire less destructive solid lead slugs). Small 20mm
     to 30mm cannons are used because large weapons cannot fire fast enough.
        Aircraft cannons have an effective range of 0.5 to 3 kilometers, a
     maximum range of 6 kilometers. Inside 0.5 kilometers there is a
     significant danger that a piece from a disintegrating target might hit
     you.
        The Historical Gunsight: Your F-19 has the most modern and advanced
     gunsight available: a "historical" gunsight with automatic laser
     rangefinder. In normal operation this gunsight "assumes" you are firing
     at maximum range (6 kilometers). However, if your tracking box is on a
     closer target, that shorter range is used instead for gunsight
     calculations.
        The gunsight computer constantly calculates range, flight path, and
     ballistics for you. It then displays where your shells would be if they
     were hitting the target now. The gunsight continually calculates firing,
     delays the appropriate time and display potential hits as they would
     occur. Therefore, the sight is "assuming" that you fired at the correct
     time in the past (hence the term "historical" gunsight).
        Anticipation Firing: It takes about two seconds for M61A1 20mm shells
     to travel the maximum 6 kilometer range. Therefore, to hit a target you
     must
                                                                      - 90 -
     judge the speed at which the target and your sight converge. You
     should fire about two seconds before they meet. If the range is less
     than 6 km, wait a little less. For example, at 3 km wait until target
     and sight are one second apart; at 1.5 km wait until target and sight
     are a half second apart, etc.
        You can use this sight like an old fashioned predicting sight. That
     is, wait until the sight is on the target, then shoot. But at 6 km range
     you'll have to hope the target stays on the same course for two seconds
     to insure a hit. Airplane targets aren't always so obliging!
        In short, the key to using a historical gunsight is anticipation.
     Don't wait for the sight to reach the target. Instead, learn to
     ANTICIPATE the meeting of sight and target, then shoot ahead of time.
        Performance Limitations: Although the maximum range of your M61A1
     20mm Vulcan cannon is 6 kilometers, this is not the recommended
     engagement range. At ranges beyond 3 kilometers accuracy falls off
     considerably. Also beware of firing at ranges less than 0.5 kilometers.
     If the enemy is any closer, you could be hit by pieces of wreckage.
        Your 20mm cannon has a large ammunition supply, bu the huge rate of
     fire means it goes quickly. Fire short bursts instead of long ones,
     especially against aircraft. "Hosing down" a target is extremely
     wasteful. If the shot is that difficult to achieve, you're crazy to
     waste ammo on it. In air combat cannon shots are usually very good or
     very bad, with very few intermediate cases.
        Notes: The historical gunsight requires conscious "retraining" to use
     well, since it doesn't require you to "place the sight on the target".
     However, this weakness is more than compensated for by the advantages of
     anticipation firing. The sight allows you to fire sooner, and more
     accurately, than any other sight in existence. The historial gunsight is
     the device of choice among "in the know" fighter jocks.
        The gunsight on this model uses a laser rangefinder slaved to the
     tracking camera, rather than the traditional ranging radar. This means
     you can use your gun without increasing your EMV.

     ========================================================================
                                Air-to-Air Duels
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Ambush

        The best way to start air-to-air combat is to surprise your opponent.
     Enemy aircraft have only forward-facing radars (except the Il-76
     "Mainstay" AEW&C craft). The best way to ambush an enemy plane is to
     slide up behind him.
        Traditionally fighter pilots prefer to attack from above. This gives
     them an energy advantage in any dogfight. However, missile tactics and
     the importance of secrecy make a height advantage less valuable for a
     stealth pilot. Gaining height makes you visible to enemy radar, which in
     turn will certainly warn your targets. Therefore, approaching low and
     from behind is often wiser. Only if your missile attacks fail and the
     enemy discovers you should you begin to seek an altitude advantage.
        If you're surprised or "bounced" (attacked from above) by the enemy,
     immediately
                                                                      - 91 -
     look for incoming missiles and take appropriate defensive action.
     Missiles arrive faster than aircraft, and therefore must be avoided
     first. Only then can you begin dogfighting or attempt to escape.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Missile Exchange

        Often an air-to-air battle starts because the enemy has discovered
     you, and vectors fighters in your direction. The result, quite
     frequently, is a head-to-head face-off, you against him.
        In this western-style showdown each side starts with an exchange of
     long- to medium-ranged radar missiles. Be prepared to decoy, jam, and
     possibly chaff the "incoming". Once your radar missile is away, switch
     to an AIM-9M Sidewinder. You may get a second close-range missile shot
     if the AMRAAM fails. Scoring with a head-to-head cannon shot is much
     more difficult, and not worth the ammo unless either (a) you're out of
     missiles, or (b) you're an incredibly good marksman.
        Naturally, if you can get off a second missile shot, so can the enemy
     if he carries second-generation IR missiles (the AA-8 or AA-10 IR
     version). These nasties show up frequently on MiG-29s and Su-27s, but
     aren't unknown on other craft flown by Veteran or Elite pilots.
        The Early Turn: One of the most difficult, but most useful tactics in
     a head-to-head match is making an early turn. This is a maneuver where
     you make a tight 180o turn so that you come out of the turn already
     closing on the incoming MiG's tail. Against inexperienced pilots this
     trick is easy, since greenhorns usually keep boring in, hoping for a
     cannon shot, and only thinking about a turn after they've passed you.
     Against vets and better an early turn requires fine timing. If you turn
     more than a second or two ahead of the enemy you're just telegraphing
     your intentions. If you wait too long, you get no advantage at all.
                                                                      - 92 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Enemy Missiles

        Radar-Homing AAMs: The Russian AA-10 Alamo is a "fire and forget"
     missile just like your AIM-120 AMRAAM. All other Russian radar-guided
     weapons are semi-active homers. Here the launching aircarft must
     continue to "paint" you with its radar - the missile homes on the
     "paint".
        You avoid radar-homing AAMs just like SAMs (see Air-Ground Tactics,
     Defensive Tactics Against SAMs, earlier). That is, use reduced EMV, ECM
     jamming and ultimately chaff. Decoys can be very effective. Note that
     the MiG-25 and MiG-31 carry extremely long-ranged radar AAMs. Low EMV,
     ECM and decoy tactics are especially effective against these weapons.
        Consider yourself fortunate that none of the Iranian F-14s have
     operational Phoenix missiles. These long-range killers are especially
     difficult to evade.
        Infrared (IR) Homing AAMs: All IR homing AAMs are "fire and forget"
     weapons. Of these the AA-8 is the most dangerous because of its second
     generation IR seeker and great maneuverability. If enemy MiGs and
     Sukhois close to AA-8 range (8 kilometers) you're often in trouble.
        Techniques to evade IR AAMs are the same as those used against IR
     SAMs (see Air-Ground Tactics, Defensive Tactics Against SAMs, earlier).
     That is, use the IR jammer at long range, flares at short range. The
     decoy also works.
        In practice, many IR homers are fired at short ranges during a
     dogfight. This means that you've got to leap onto the IR jammer when you
     get a launch warning, then dodge out of the missile's 45o field of view
     immediately. At dogfighting ranges missile flight times are very short -
     you don't have time to fool around! If this fails, or you delay too
     long, the missile approach klaxon will go off. Now you've got bare
     seconds to react: dump a flare immediately and dodge, or you're history.
        One nice thing about IR AAMs is that the older AA-2, AA-6 and AA-7
     designs all use first generation seekers. The enemy must get on your
     tail before these missiles lock on. Keep him off your tail and you avoid
     this entire class of weaponry. Of course, doing that requires
     dogfighting skills.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Dogfighting

        The essential rule in dogfighting is to get on the enemy's tail. On
     all fighter aircraft, guns and missile guidance systems only face
     forward. If you're on the enemy's tail, you can shoot and he cannot. If
     you can't get on his tail, at least try to place his aircraft ahead of
     you as much as possible, so you have the maximum number of firing
     opportunities.
        Maintaining higher speed or altitude is valuable in a dogfight. A
     plane slower and lower can only dodge attacks. A plane faster or higher
     can attack or retreat as desired. Having a higher speed or altitude is
     termed the "energy advantage".
        If the enemy is behind you, there are various classic escape
     maneuvers: Turning Inside, the Scissors, the Immelmann, the Split-S, and
     the Yo-Yo. Not only should you learn them, but also learn to recognize
     these maneuvers so you can apply the appropriate counter-maneuver.
        Turning Inside: The simplest solution to an enemy plane coming up
                                                                      - 93 -
     behind you is - turn toward him (i.e., turn in the direction of the
     enemy aircraft). If you're turning faster than he, you'll gradually
     circle around and get onto his tail. This kind of a "turn match" is
     frequently seen when greenhorns dogfight.
        Of course, if the enemy is turning faster than you, he will
     eventually come around behind you. If this happens try something else
     immediately. The longer you wait the worse it gets, until he lines up a
     shot and toasts you.
        Scissors: A more complex way to out-turn an enemy aircraft is the
     scissors maneuver. Begin a turn toward him, but once he begins to turn
     with you, quickly roll over to turn in the other direction. This opens
     the scissors. As the enemy realizes you've turned away and turns toward
     you again, you reverse the procedure and roll back toward him again. If
     your turns were quicker and tighter than his, and/or you're a slower
     plane, he will eventually pass in front of you. This allows you to get
     onto his tail.
        Novice pilots trying to turn with you can be lured into a scissors
     with ease. Even if their planes turn better, their slow reactions to
     each scissor opening and closing will quickly give you the edge. More
     experienced enemies may avoid this tactic by anticipating your next turn
     and blasting you (if they're less maneuverable), or by pulling up and
     over in a yo-yo (if they're faster).
        Immelmann Turn: This maneuver is an excellent way to reverse
     direction quickly. First you perform a half loop to reverse direction,
     then a half roll to right your aircraft. If an enemy aircraft is behind
     you, an Immelmann can bring you nose-to-nose with him.
        The original Immelmann, a German WWI fighter pilot, reputedly rolled
     while vertical, allowing him to finish the loop in whatever direction he
     desired. He still finished the half-loop inverted - it's aerodynamically
     more efficient that way.
        Note that an Immelmann gives you an
                                                                      - 94 -
     altitude gain but costs speed, since a half-loop upward slows you down
     significantly.
        Split-S Turn: This maneuver complements the Immelmann. Begin by
     rolling inverted, then pull the stick back to half-loop downward. Many
     pilots begin the loop before the roll is completed, rolling the plane
     while looping. The split-S causes you to lose considerable altitude, so
     it's often wise to reduce throttle and/or use speed brakes to minimize
     altitude loss.
        The Split-S complements the Immelmann because you gain speed and lose
     altitude. Unwary fighter pilots have sometimes tried to Split-S into or
     away from the enemy without remembering their altitude. The result can
     be a Split-S right into the ground!
        Yo-Yo Turn: This maneuver is used mainly by higher speed jets against
     slower opponents. Therefore the relatively slow F-19 has little occasion
     to use it dogfighting. However, you may see enemy MiGs attempting it
     against you! This turn also requires excellent cockpit visibility,
     something that both the F-19 and early MiGs lack.
        In a Yo-Yo turn you climb and roll toward the enemy - until he's
     visible out the top of your canopy. Then pull over into a dive while
     still turning. During the dive you roll the plane to help line up your
     shot. Very often you'll take that shot while inverted. Don't let it
     bother you.
        Because a Yo-Yo requires good spacial perception, first practice it
     using the Slot View (if alone) or Tacti View (if you've got a target).
     In combat conditions switching to a wide angle view is extremely helpful
     in pulling the HUD around onto the enemy after you come over the top.
     Then you can switch back to normal view again.
        In effect a Yo-Yo plane makes a very big turn in three dimensions.
     Most of the turn radius is "consumed" with the climbing and diving,
     allowing a faster plane to travel further and turn wider, yet still come
     out on the tail of the more maneuverable plane. American F-4 Phantom
     pilots used the maneuver with great success against slower but more
     maneuverable MiG-21's over North Vietnam during the Vietnam war.
        Note that the best defense against a Yo-Yo is to

                                                                      - 95 -
     reverse your turn, or to use the third dimension yourself, usually by
     going into a split-S).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Enemy Guns

        The enemy has cannons equivalent to yours in range and power.
     However, the enemy still uses old predicting gunsights. This means they
     are virtually required to get behind you before they can make a decent
     shot. In addition, all but the most elite pilots will be slow to fire,
     since they must place the gunsight on the target and keep it there to
     score a hit.
        If you sense the enemy is behind you and ready to fire cannons,
     "jinking" (small violent moves in random directions) can throw off his
     aim.
        Finally, Russian-built aircraft with the older GSh-23 cannon may not
     always hit, since the lower volume of firepower increases the chances of
     you "flying between the shells" and escaping serious injury. Don't rely
     on this, though - not every 23mm shell is an unlucky one!
                                                                      - 96 -

                              4: MISSION BRIEFINGS
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Rules of Engagement

        Rules of Engagement (ROE) outline what targets a pilot can and cannot
     attack. In an age of nuclear weapons unrestricted warfare would destroy
     the planet within 24 hours. Therefore, all wars are limited to some
     degree. If warfare is limited to just a local area with specific goals,
     ROEs are much more restrictive. If an official state of war does not
     exist then the rules will be extremely restrictive.
        In stealth missions, ROEs also determine what "exposure" of your
     aircraft is allowed. In cold and limited war situations it is important
     that the enemy not know exactly who or what performed the attack. This
     allows the politicians to say whatever they want.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Cold War Situations

        ROE: "You may attack and destroy a target only if it is specifically
     required by your mission orders. You may engage other targets only if
     they fire first, or if they have spotted your plane. The mission is
     completely clandestine. You must avoid detection, especially visual
     detection by enemy aircraft. Enemy air or ground forces that do detect
     your should be destroyed, to prevent embarassing disclosures. Neutrals
     and civilians must be considered friendlies, and above all you should
     avoid detection by neutral aircraft and radars."
        Background Notes: In cold war situations the State Department must
     have "deniability" for every mission. If the mission is successful and
     the political climate seems good, the USA may claim credit for the deed.
     In other cases, however, American may not wish to attach its name to the
     action.
        You are warned when enemy radar returns are good enough to spot your
     craft, or when enemy aircraft come close enough to visually identify
     you. These enemies should be destroyed, although the effort can be
     counterproductive if the attack generates lots of additional sightings!
        Gratuitous or wanton destruction of all other targets is very bad in
     cold war. Hitting targets of value to the civilian sector, such as
     bridges, oil wells and tanks, refineries, etc., is especially bad. Your
     record will rapidly accumulate
                                                                      - 99 -
     black marks if you act like "Rambo" during the Cold War. After all,
     Rambo is fiction, this is reality!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Limited War Situations

        ROE: "You will engage, attack, and destroy all targets specifically
     required by your orders. In addition, all other targets with active
     weaponry (i.e., which could fire on your craft) may be attacked. You may
     engage these military targets even if they haven't seen you yet. You may
     never attack non-military targets unless so required by your orders.
     Neutrals must be considered friendlies at all times, and in addition you
     should avoid detection by neutral aircraft and radars at all costs."
        Background Notes: In limited war the State Department may require
     deniability, since American aid to the contestants may need to be secret.
     However, since there is a war, and military targets get destroyed in
     war, you can attack military targets of opportunity and be rewarded
     (rather than penalized) for your efforts. However, hitting non-combatant
     targets of value to the civilian sector (unless ordered to) is
     forbidden.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Conventional War Situations

        ROE: "You will engage, attack, and destroy all targets specifically
     required by your orders. In addition, any and all other targets in enemy
     territory may be attacked, including civilian targets. If able to select
     additional targets, select those with immediate military capability
     first. Neutrals must be considered friendlies at all times, and in
     addition you should avoid detection by neutral aircraft and radars at
     all costs.
        Background Notes: In a conventional war you are allowed unrestricted
     conventional attacks on enemy territory. This includes civilian targets
     formerly forbidden. However, targets with immediate military capability
     are more important. Therefore, destroying enemy aircraft, airbases,
     SAMs, radars, depots, headquarters, etc., gives more reward than
     bridges, oil refineries, oil wells and platforms, etc., whose importance
     is long-term. This is because even conventional wars are fought for
     short-term goals (such as the Grenada invasion in 1983, or the Falkland
     Islands campaign of 1984).
        However, from a pilot's point of view, conventional war is "fun"
     because anything in enemy territory is fair game. Of course, the
     disadvantage is that the enemy are prepared and alert for intruders.

     ========================================================================
     ONC Map Coordinates

        ONC maps use the standard US Army military grid system for locating
     positions anywhere on the globe.
        The maps are divided into large squares. Each square is identified by
     a two-letter code, such as WX, JC, etc. Within each square are smaller
     rows and columns, ruled into smaller squares. These smaller squares are
     identified by a column and row number from 0 to 9. Following the "read
     right and up" rule, the column number appears first, then the row
     number. This is the same as basic algebra, where the "x" horizontal
     value is given first, then the "y" vertical value.
        For example, coordinate JC79 means large map square JC, column 7,
     row 9.
                                                                     - 100 -

                                    Missions
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air-Air Missions
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Selecting Armaments

        In limited or conventional war situations the AIM-120A AMRAAM is the
     missile of choice. You can lob these at the enemy from a full 30
     kilometers range. If you're firing at a plane with close escorts, space
     the shots 5 to 10 seconds apart (the higher their altitude, the longer
     the spacing). This is because a burning, exploding plane is a prominent
     target to the missile's seeker. If your missiles arrive right behind one
     another, those following may home on the plane hit by the first. Worse,
     the terminal homing of the AMRAAM is somewhat questionable - it tends to
     take the closest target at the time, rather than the target you
     originally designated! Therefore, when shooting into a group you can't
     count on which plane will be hit. Finally, if the enemy is veteran or
     elite, don't be surprised if the enemy manages to outmaneuver your
     missile by turning inside it.
        In cold war, guns are the weapons of choice. With these you can
     insure the proper target is hit, and no others. Unfortunately, getting
     close enough for a shot may reveal your presence. A good compromise is
     the AIM-9M Sidewinder, a fast-turning close-in dogfighting missile. It's
     usually easy to line up a 5 to 8 km shot, where the Sidewinder has a
     clear run at the target and nobody else is likely to get in the way.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ambushing a Leader

        Here an important personage is travelling by plane; your job is to
     make sure he doesn't arrive! The plane takes off about the same time as
     your own. Remember that his plane, your objective, is NOT the flashing
     dot on the satellite/radar map (on your left-side cockpit CRT).
        Although it's possible to just fly to his destination and wait,
     roving fighter patrols or local air defenses eventually will spot you.
     In general, the wiser approach is to find the best way to "sneak through"
     enemy patrols and SAM radars to intercept him EN ROUTE.
        In limited or conventional war you can take down his plane and escort
     with AMRAAMs. In a cold war situation you'll need to close for a clean
     Sidewinder or gun shot. Remember, though, that if the fighter escorts
     get a visual ID on your plane you must "zap" them too. If your attack
     location is well away from any ground radars or Mainstay AEW&C planes,
     you can attack from above, hit your man, drop a decoy to confuse them,
     and zoom away with maximum speed at low altitude (say 200').

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Intercepting Terrorists or Commandos

        In this mission you know a transport plane, accompanied by fighters,
     will head for friendly territory. Your objective is to eliminate them
     before they arrive. The problem is, you don't know their destination.
        As you take off, watch the enemy aircraft carefully. Circle around a
     bit,
                                                                     - 101 -
     observing their course until you can guess their objective. Once you
     know their goal, it's easy to pick a nice quiet spot to ambush them.
     Often you can stay in friendly territory all the way! Properly executed,
     this mission is a nice, easy milk run.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Eliminating a Fighter Patrol

        Enemy fighter patrols have a nasty habit of lurking near their own
     air defense systems, and/or being supported by Mainstay AEW&C planes.
     Going in after them can cause quite a battle.
        One trick to avoid this mess is to publicize your presence in a
     nearby area. You should pick an area with little or no SAM coverage, and
     with no nearby airbases. If you can lure the fighter patrol to you, at
     this spot, the battle may be much easier. The typical way to accomplish
     the lure is to raise your EMV (by flying high, turning on the ECM, and
     opening the bay doors). If that doesn't work, clobbering a thing or two
     on the ground may catch their interest.
        Once you've "dangled the lure", it's wise to take a low profile
     again, so you can ambush the enemy fighters as they arrive. As in many
     other aspects of modern warfare, getting the first shot is a big
     advantage.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Destroying a Recon Bomber

        In most cases you must chase an enemy plane on its way home. Catch
     and attack him as quickly as possible. The longer you delay, the closer
     he gets to SAM cover and fighter aid. This is one mission where climbing
     to a higher altitude can be rewarding - you travel faster, farther at
     high altitude than low. Of course, don't go so high that you wake up the
     enemy and attract lots of fighters and missiles.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Attacking a Cruise Missile

        These aircraft are most unobliging targets. They cruise around deep
     behind their own lines, guarded by SAMs and closely escorted by
     fighters. Given the defenses, attacking these planes is like hitting a
     ground target. You need to sneak or punch your way through defenses,
     elude counterattacks, and blast the primary, just like a strike mission.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Taking Down the Mainstay

        The Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C plane is the most difficult aircraft
     target. Sooner or later its radar will see you, forcing you to fight
     through fighters and SAMs to reach it. Make your approach as stealthy as
     possible: it postpones this hour of reckoning. Destroying one or two
     crucial SAM radar sites on your way in can be useful - it opens a
     radar-free corridor to the target, and at the same time may draw off
     enemy interceptors, perhaps even some of the Mainstay's fighter escort.

     ========================================================================
                                Strike Missions
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Choosing Your Weapons

        Selecting armaments for ground attacks is always difficult. The
     favorite weapon is the AGM-65D Maverick missile. It's your longest-
     ranged ground attack weapon (30 km; the Harpoon fires farther but is
     only good against warships). The Maverick's also an accurate "fire and
     forget" weapon. Its only
                                                                     - 102 -
     weakness is that one missile can't always do the job (see the Weapon
     Effectiveness Chart at the end of this doc - ratings below B- mean the
     missile may not destroy the target). Fortunately, Mavericks are just
     fine against radar installations. Most pilots carry as many as they can
     afford, and fear the day when the crew chief tells them no more are
     available.
        Choosing between laser-guided bombs, retarded bombs, and free-fall
     bombs is often a matter of personal preference. Many times more than one
     weapon will do the job, so you can pick a type whose attack run suits
     your style. Other times you may be forced to use a certain weapon
     because nothing else does the job right.
        When choosing weapons, don't expect much from a weapon rated C or D
     against a target. Scoring a hit with such always requires a lot of luck.
     Certainly don't rely on such to take out your primary target. Weapons
     rated A or B can be relied upon, provided you deliver them accurately.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Secret Airstrips

        Dropping off or picking up items deep behind enemy territory seems
     rather straightforward. After all, you don't have to fly into SAM
     batteries or go head-to-head with fighter patrols.
        Instead, a secret airstrip challenges your flying skill. You must
     manage a landing without an ILS to guide you. Worse, the strip is only
     half the length of a normal runway. You must land gently, at low speed
     (under 160 kts, preferably), and touchdown near the start. Otherwise
     you'll roll off the other end and crash! To make matters worse, the
     strip's lights are only on for a limited time. Make a note of the time
     the lights go off, then periodically check the Waypoints screen on the
     right-side CRT (tap SELECT WAY PT key) to see how much time you've
     got. Once the lights are out landing is virtually impossible.
        If your opponents are skillful, their intelligence may have dangerous
     information about this mission. You could find enemy fighter patrols
     uncomfortably close to your objective, or bouncing you just as you're
     trying to land!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Airdrops

        These missions are usually "milk runs". Your job is to avoid action
     and just fly over a radio beacon that's quite clear on your HUD. The
     only real worry is reaching the beacon before it is turned off. Make a
     note of the "turn off" time and periodically check the Waypoints screen
     on the right-side CRT (tap SELECT WAY PT key). Once the beacon turns off
     there's no way to find the drop site.
        Be warned that skillful opponents may have intelligence about this
     mission from their spies. You could find enemy fighter patrols lurking
     around the objective. If so, you could attempt to lure them away, or
     blow them away, depending on your ROE (rules of engagement).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Photo Recon Runs

        There are two hard things about photographic missions: using the
     camera, and keeping a low profile while you're doing it!
        Because the 135mm/IR camera is on a fixed mounting, you must steer
     the plane to aim the camera. This is more difficult than it seems, since
     the target swims into and out of view all too fast. Experienced pilots
     advise you to line up
                                                                     - 103 -
     on the target 8 to 10 km away. Set up a perfectly straight course and
     keep to it. At 2 km to 4 km hit the bay doors and brakes, then pull the
     nose gradually up, bringing the camera's aim onto the target. Keep in
     this regime, using subtle pitch changes to keep the target in the
     camera, while snapping pictures. You've got plenty of film: don't be
     afraid to take plenty of extras!
        Success is announced right on the CRT. As soon as you have it, close
     the doors and brakes, then dive low for your escape. Don't be surprised
     if the enemy spots you during the photo run.
        Photo runs over enemy troop concentrations and/or near SAMs are
     especially nerve-wracking. You may need to take out a SAM radar before
     making the run. If shoulder-fired SAMs infest the area, your only hope
     is to dump a decoy before you start, run your IR jammer as long as you
     can, and/or periodically dump flares.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flying against SAMs

        Destroying a SAM battery requires that you "sneak up" on them as best
     you can, then nail his radar first with a Maverick or HARM. With the
     radar out of action, the missiles are helpless. Unless there are other
     SAMs nearby you can have a strafing "picnic" with the missile launchers
     until a fighter patrol shows up.
        Remember that the safest place around a SAM battery is directly above
     it. The radar cannot look straight up, and the longer-ranged missies
     (such as the SA-2, -5,-10 and -12) have a minimum range of 4 to 5 km. Of
     course, getting to this point can be rather tricky. It doesn't hurt to
     run over the litany of defense techniques before going after a SAM:
     disappearing, decoys, ECM, chaff and manuevering.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Hitting the Sub Pens

        The Severomorsk submarine pens in the North Cape are a unique and
     special target. These must be attacked by toss bombing from the north:
     you must place an FAE THROUGH the sea doors. This means flying straight
     at the mountain, pulling up at the last minute. You may wish to make
     your run at 500' to 1,000', instead of 200'. This lets you begin the
     toss sooner (about 3 to 4 km away), giving you more leeway to clear the
     mountainside.
        Beware the Krivak-class frigates that patrol seaward of this
     submarine base. Their radars and SAMs cannot be ignored! You'll want to
     bring along a couple of Penguin-3 ASMs to eliminate these fellows. Even
     in Cold War, chances are good a Krivak will get a radar "make" on you,
     forcing you to hit him.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Sinking Ships

        The ideal ship-killer is the AGM-84A Harpoon. This heavy missile is
     your longest-ranged weapon. It has a superb targeting system that hits
     the ship you target, even a carrier with a ring of escorts.
        However, don't underestimate enemy warships, especially those of the
     Russian Northern Fleet. The larger ships have exceptionally good radars
     and very powerful SAMs. Patrol ships can be knocked out with a single
     missile, but a task force has so many ships that any close approach
     means you'll be dodging missiles left and right.
                                                                     - 104 -
        Most enemy ships stay close to friendly shorelines, with fighter
     cover nearby (if not overhead already). Don't forget that enemy
     aircraft carriers have their own fighters: you can count on a few
     flying CAP (combat air patrol).
        When fighting a conventional war with Libya, or in the Persian Gulf,
     be careful about attacking merchant ships. Avoid those on the high seas
     or near friendly coastlines; only attack ships close to enemy ports or
     shore. Otherwise, you could end up hitting a neutral ship by accident.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Bombing Runs

        When attacking with laser or free-fall bombs, you'll have to rise
     above minimum altitude during the attack run. This, combined with the
     open bay doors, raises your EMV considerably. Try to minimize this
     exposure as much as possible. Remember, the higher your EMV, the better
     target you are for enemy missiles. The longer you're a big target, the
     more chances the enemy has to launch and hit you.
        The most frightening prospect is a bombing run directly over enemy
     troop concentrations. There's nothing worse than a host of shoulder-
     fired SAMs rising up at you. These are on the one missile site you can't
     knock out. Fortunately, they have a very short range. Still, flying
     through a barrage of SA-14s, dumping a flare every two seconds, while
     trying to line up a bomb, will turn your hair prematurely white.
                                                                     - 105 -
                                     Libya
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Introduction

        Politics: Libya is ruled by Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhaffi, leader of the
     secret army organization that deposed the former king in 1969. The
     capital city is Tripoli and the nation's cjief source of wealth is oil
     sold to western nations.
        Military Forces: Rich by third world standards, Libya buys most of
     its armaments from the Soviet Union. Personnel are trained by Soviet
     military advisors, but national pride has prohibited (so far) any
     significant Soviet presence. Soviet advisors are not invited on combat
     operations.
        The Libyan Army has approximately 60000 men, the Navy has 53 ships
     and 6500 men, while the Air Force has about 530 planes, 30 combat
     helicopters, and 8500 men. A paramilitary "Pan-African Legion" of about
     10000 also exists.
        In addition, Libya has built and supported a variety of training
     camps for terrorist groups.
        Geography: Libya is a desert nation. Along the coast it has only one
     mountain region that is visually distinctive: the Jabal al Akbar to the
     east of Benghazi. These mountains greatly restrict the capabilities of
     Benghazi and Benina radars. Deep in the desert, east of Sabha, are the
     more desolate and isolated mountains of the Al Haruj al Aswad, while to
     the west are the great sand seas (ergs).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Level of Conflict

        Cold War: At times Libya has been enthusiastic backer of
     international terrorist organizations. It provides funds, arms, military
     training, and base camp sites for a variety of Arab and other terrorist
     groups. America has already attacked tactical military targets in
     retaliation for Libya's role in numerous incidents of international
     terrorism in Europe and the Mediterranean.
        Limited War: The Libyan army has fought minor border clashes against
     Egypt to the east. Egypt is an American ally, and so far has proved
     considerably superior, militarily, to Libya. The Libyan army has also
     attempted an invasion of Chad to the south. After a protracted campaign
     against Chad and her ally France, Libyan supply lines through the Sahara
     desert were cut, forcing a Libyan retreat. Future limited wars between
     Libya and any of her neighbours are possible.
        Conventional War: In the even of NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict in the
     Mediterranean and/or Europe, Libya is expected to provide bases for
     Soviet aircraft and warships operating in the Mediterranean. These bases
     could become the westernmost outposts of Russian forces contesting the
     Mediterranean.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Friendly Bases

        Sigonella on Sicily (UD15): The USA maintains a military base at
     Trapani, on western Sicily, and the Sigonella military field in
     southeastern Sicily. The Sigonella runway is the main staging point for
     air attacks against the North African coast, especially Libya.
     Unfortunately, the flight distances are quite long. Using this base
     virtually requires that your F-19 carry extra fuel.
                                                                     - 106 -
        CV America at Sea (UD70): This 60000-ton "Kitty Hawk" class
     conventional aircraft carrier, designated CV66, often serves with the US
     6th fleet in the Mediterranean. It participated in the 1986 raids
     against Tripoli and Benghazi. The carrier is ideally positioned for
     launching and recovering strikes against Benghazi, the Gulf of Sirte, or
     targets deep in the Libyan desert. Here it cruises on a southerly course
     with its traditional ring of close escorts. The carrier remains well
     north of the Gulf of Sirte to avoid SSM attacks from enemy ships and
     aircraft. It is surrounded by escorts and regularly replenishes the CAP
     (combat air patrol) with F-18 launches.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Neutral Bases

        These airbases are in neutral territory. You should not use these
     bases unless specifically so ordered, or if you must make an emergency
     landing.
        Suda Bay on Crete (VD41): This airfield, near the city of Khania, is
     not an American base, although in years past it was a major NATO air
     and naval base. It has the advantage of being both closer and less
     public than equivalent airfields in Greece or Egypt.
        Halfar on Malta (UD13): This airfield is on the island of Malta. Once
     a critical strength position for the British Commonwealth in the
     Mediterranean, it is now a neutral port and sometime tourist haven.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Seeing the Sights in Libya

        Flying over Libya is a unique experience. It is a truly desert
     nation, a land of red and brown hardscrabble with patches of tan sand
     and gray boulder fields. Water is all underground, seeping to the
     surface in occasional patches of green oasis or mountain valley.
     Mountain ranges are low, undulating areas full of small hillocks and
     short peaks. From the air it's often hard to tell the difference between
     again roadways and the dark wadis (gullies) in the desert. But some
     works of man stand out, particularly the rust red of oil wells and
     pipelines, or the distinctive star-pattern of SAM batteries.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Libya

        Tripoli (TC87): The capital city of Libya has a large military-
     civilian airbase at Idris, and is well protected by SAM batteries. Until
     recently these were long-range SA-5 Gammons, but there are indications
     that Russian military advisors may replace these with the formidable
     SA-12 Gladiator.
        Tripoli is also the site of a major army headquarters, various
     military depots, oil storage areas, and sometimes terrorist training
     camps. Missile boats often cruise off the coast.
        Sabha (UB17): This southern town is the main military base supporting
     Libya's southerly border expansion. It was the major depot for the Chad
     war, and is still extremely important to Libyan trans-Saharan ambitions.
     The most important military installations here are the large airbase and
     the SAM battery protecting it.
        Misratah (UC26) & Sirt (UC43): These two coastal towns are much
     smaller areas, with lower level military headquarters. The ports include
     oil storage tanks for refueling ships. Sirt is a secondary naval base,
     supporting missile boats that cruise the western side of the "Line of
     Death".
                                                                     - 107 -
        Ras Lanuf (UC82) & Port Brega (UC92): Ras Lanuf is Libya's largest
     and newest oil facility. The majority of all oil for export is stored
     here, and a large number of oil tankers are usually coming and going at
     all times. There is also a refinery, vast "farms" of oil tanks, and a
     major military headquarters. Port Brega is an older oil facility, still
     in operation despite the completion of Ras Lanuf.
        A number of SAM batteries are sited in this strategically vital area.
     In addition the Port Brega airfield, west of the town, serves both
     ports.
        Benghazi (VC16): This city is the site of Libya's second-largest
     military base, including the Benina airfield and powerful protective SAM
     batteries. The city itself is large, with a military headquarters and a
     few small oil storage facilites to serve the ancient port. Terrorist
     training camps are not uncommon in the hills to the west.
        Al Badya (VC37): This sleepy coastal town in the mountainous Jabal al
     Akbar has major military significance. It overlooks the narrow Ionian
     sea between Libya and Greece, making it an ideal site for anti-ship
     missiles. There is a small airstrip and SAM site as well.
        Oil Fields: The great oil fields of Libya are in the southeast,
     where literally thousands of wells pump crude from the ground, which is
     piped to Ras Lanuf and Port Brega. The great producing fields can be
     found near Raguba (UC90), Waha (VB18), Amal (VC30), Jalo Oasis (VC40),
     and Gialo (VB49). Most of the great fields have a few storage tanks on
     site, to hold crude temporarily until it can be piped to the port.
     However, the majority of storage tanks are at the ports, not here on the
     fields.
        Secret Bases: Western intelligence operatives in Libya are preparing
     two secret, hard-pack surfaces suitable for aircraft landings. One is
     at Al Mukhayli (ONC VC43), the other is on the edge of the great ergs,
     at Yafran (ONC TC93).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air Defenses

        Libyan air defenses use Russian-built equipment. Russian advisors
     train native Libyan crews, who then operate the equipment. SA-2
     Guideline and SA-5 Gammon SAMs have been the backbone of Libyan air
     defenses, but there are rumors of upgrades to the new SA-10 Grumble and
     SA-12 Gladiator systems.
        Local military forces make use of the SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder-fired
     missiles. These are also popular terrorist weapons, and can be expected
     in the vicinity of terrorist camps, Libyan army units use various
     medium-range SAMs, including the SA-8, -9, -11, and -13. However, these
     are not always in the best state of repair.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air Force

        Fighters: The Libyan Air Force is primarily composed of MiG-23MF
     "Flogger" fighters, with over 140 craft in inventory. It also has a
     smaller number of MiG-25 "Foxbats" for reconnaissance and long-range
     interception, as well as some antiquated MiG-21s. The Air Force also
     has various Mirage 5D fighter-bombers for ground attack missions.
        Intelligence expects that MiG-23s and 25s will be your primary air-
     to-air opponents, although in Conventional War, or against higher
     quality pilots, you
                                                                     - 108 -
     may encounter the new MiG-29 "Fulcrum" flown by Soviet personnel.
        Reconnaissance Bombers: Although Libya does not possess any Tu-95
     "Bear" reconnaissance bombers, Russian planes of this type frequently
     operate from Libyan bases.
        Airborne Early Warning & Control: Libya has no AEW&C craft. No
     Russian Il-76 "Mainstays" are expected to use Libyan bases, since they
     are too precious. In wartime Libya is a distant outpost in the middle
     of NATO's great strength in the Western Mediterranean. Aircraft losses
     would be high - too high to permit risking the rare and costly AEW&C
     craft.
        Air Transports: It is suspected that Libya's antiquated fleet of
     C-130H and C-47 air transports (built in America) will be replaced
     with Russian equipment, perhaps including the new An-72 "Coaler" jet
     transport.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Navy

        The Libyan Navy is primarily composed of Missile Corvettes and
     Missile Patrol Boats. The largest of these are the 770-ton Russian-built
     Nanuchka II class armed with Styx surface-to-surface missiles, SA-N-4
     surface-to-air missiles, and a twin 57mm gun turret. The other boats
     include the Russian Osa-class, Italian-built Wadi M'ragh class and the
     French-built La Combattante II types; these have poorer missiles and
     SA-N-5 SAMs, or no SAMs at all.
        The Nanuchkas are the best boats in the Libyan Navy. They perform
     the most aggressive patrols, making them the primary threat. Patrols
     occur frequently in the Gulf of Sirte, south of the "Line of Death".
     Sometimes the Libyan air force flies fighter missions in support of
     the patrols.
                                                                     - 109 -

                                The Persian Gulf
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Introduction

        Politics: Iran has been ruled by Shi'ite (a Moslem sect) radicals
     since their overthrow of the pro-American Shah in 1979. In September,
     1980 Iraq attacked Iran, beginning a long, costly war between those
     nations. Both contestants are viewed with distrust by the Arab states
     along the south of the Persin Gulf. Iran's use of international
     terrorism as a tool of foreign policy has not improved the nation's
     image.
        Iran also calls for a Shi'ite religious revolution throughout the
     Islamic world. This naturally bothers the leadership of the Arab states,
     since their governments are Sunni (another Moslem sect). However, Iran
     is populated by Persians, not Arabs. So far this cultural and linguistic
     barrier has hindered the spread of Iranian Shi'ite radicalism across the
     Persian Gulf to the Arab states.
        Military Forces: Under the Shah, Iran's oil-rich finances permitted
     massive investment in military forces, mostly from the USA. Since the
     revolution many complex weapons have failed for lack of spare parts and
     maintenance, while most of the rest were damaged or destroyed in the war
     with Iraq. Iran has some sophisticated aircraft and missiles remaining,
     but these are deployed to protect key cities in the interior, rather
     than as a border defense.
        Geography: Iran is a large nation with varied geography. The Elbruz
     and Zagros mountain ranges run from the northwest corner (where Iran
     touches Turkey and the Soviet trans-Caucasus) diagonally southeast,
     along the border with Iraq, and then parallel to the Persian Gulf. South
     of these mountains, at the head of the Gulf, are Iran's oilfields. North
     of the mountains the nation is divided into two regions. The western
     part, near Iraq, Turkey, and trans-Caucasus Russia, is fertile, heavily
     populated, and includes most of the major cities and industrial plants.
     The eastern part, bordering Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Soviet Central
     Asia, is mostly barren deserts and mountains with a small, impoverished,
     undereducated population.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Level of Conflight

        Cold War: Iran's use of terrorism has been very effective to data.
     America's confused policy respons, culminating in the Iran-Contra
     scandal, is one example. However, eventually the continue violence may
     provoke a military response from the Western nations.
        Limited War: Iran and Iraq have been fighting a limited war since
     1980. The cities of Abadan and Basra, on the national border where the
     Tigris-Euphrates rivers empty into the Gulf, are largely ruined by the
     fighting. Running northward are two opposing lines of trenches and
     bunkers with a "no-man's land" between.
        Each side attempted to discourage Persian Gulf shipping from aiding
     the opposition, resulting in missile and rocket attacks on many
     freighters and tankers. In 1987 and 1988 American fleet units escorting
     oil tankers became involved in surface battles with Iranian ships and
     boats, as well as an
                                                                     - 110 -
     unfortunate civilian airliner that flew through a battle area and was
     shot down by the somewhat inept crew of the missile cruiser USS
     Vincennes.
        Conventional War: Russia could invade Iran as part of a wider
     NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict, or as a counter to the Shi'ite radicals, who
     would like to spread their revolution to the USSR's Moslem population.
     America may be drawn into invading Iran by its confused foreign policy.
     The vast and often hostile geography, not to mention a large and
     hostile population, argue against traditional military invasions.
     Instead, a gradual escalation from limited war, including bigger and
     deeper air attacks, is more probable.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Friendly Bases

        America's strongest allies in the Persian Gulf are Saudi Arabia and
     the tiny island kingdom of Bahrain.
        CV Nimitz at Sea (KY83): This huge 80000-ton nuclear carrier is the
     class ship of the latest and most powerful program of aircraft carriers.
     Normally assigned to the Pacific Fleet, it is prepared to visit the
     Indian Ocean at any time. Here it sails with a close escort of
     destroyes, and has its F-18s on regular rotation in CAP (combat air
     patrol).
        American aircraft carriers do not sail into the restricted waters of
     the Persian Gulf, where they would be "sitting ducks" for land-based air
     and missile attacks. Carrier task forces remain in the Indian Ocean,
     although the Nimitz and her ring of close escorts have sailed deep into
     the Gulf of Oman, to provide a base as close as possible to Persian Gulf
     targets. If threatened the ship can always sail to the southeast and
     escape into the vast expanses of the Indian Ocean.
        Ras as Saffaniyah (JY19): This is Saudi Arabia's northenmost oil
     terminal and port along the Gulf. Its airfield is in a useful strategic
     location. Basing privileges for a secret "stealth" mission can be
     arranged with the pro-American Saudi monarchy.
        Dhahram (JY54) & Al Hufuf (JY44): Dhahram is Saudi Arabia's largest
     port city on the Persian Gulf, making its airfield and unwise choice for
     stealth aircraft operations. However, the Al Hufuf airfield slightly
     inland is a strategically useful and less public position for basing
     missions and raids. Either can be used for stealth missions, although
     Al Hufuf is preferable.
        As Salamiyah (JY00): This small airbase outside of the capital Riyadh
     is a nice, quite location where clandestine missions can be organized
     easily. Unfortunately, the gulf coast is far away.
        Bahrain (JY65): This small island nation is strongly pro-American,
     providing large naval and air base facilities for American military
     forces. It is fairly easy to operate stealth missions from here.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Neutral Bases

        Kuwait is a friendly neutral nation, Oman is neutral but pro-Western,
     and the UAE are studiously neutral.
        Kuwait City in Kuwait (JZ12): Originally neutral, Iranian threats and
     attacks caused Kuwait to seek US military aid and support. The Kuwait
     airport can be used to occasionally stage missions that demonstrate
     America's
                                                                     - 111 -
     support to Kuwait, or for emergency landings. However, Kuwait is fearful
     of provoking more Iranian hostility, and therefore will not grant
     America basing rights. Besides, they'd like to stay on the good side of
     the Soviet Union too!
        Kuwaits great oil fields are south of the city, in ONC JZ20 and JZ30.
        Qatar (JY75): This small independent nation works hard at the
     appearance of neutrality, probably because it has strong pro-American
     and strong pro-Iranian factions. Although missions cannot be staged
     regularly from here, it is possible to use the pro-American groups to
     aid in specific clandestine missions or emergency landing situations.
        Ruweiss (KY01) & Tarif (KY11): These small oil ports of the United
     Arab Emirates are not especially friendly to the American cause. Because
     the UAE is a decentralized government, pressure and money in the right
     places could permit a clandestine mission or emergency landing.
        Some of the largest oil fields of the UAE are in this area
     (ONC KY22-23).
        Abu Dhabi (KY31): Abu Dhabi is the major city of the United Arab
     Emirates (UAE), where the appearance of neutrality is most important.
     Staging missions or emergency landings from this base is very difficult,
     but not impossible if Iranian diplomacy succeeds in making yet more
     enemies.
        Al Khafi at Dubai (KY65): This large airfield, outside the city of
     Dubai, is the most strategically useful of all UAE airfields. It is the
     base closest to south-central Iran, and as such an important launching
     or retrieval point for deep missions. However, as at Abu Dhabi,
     political problems make the use of this base difficult to impossible.
        Muscat in Oman (KY90): Oman is careful to remain neutral in all
     affairs, but is strongly pro-Western. For example, much of its army is
     trained and officered by "retired" British military personnel. The
     military portion of the Muscat airfield is available for missions and
     emergency landings, provided everything remains secret and politically
     "deniable".

     The Sights in the Persian Gulf

        The Persian Gulf is a desert region, not unlike Libya, except for
     the large, high spine of mountains that runs diagonally through Iran
     from the northwest to the southeast. However, water is more plentiful,
     especially in Iran, resulting in increased agriculture and a large
     number of local irrigation works to control the seasonal run-off from
     the mountain highlands.
        The Gulf has many interesting and exceptional areas, such as the
     Tigris-Euphrates watershed that reaches the head of the gulf around
     Abadan. Once a great seaport and teaming metropolis, the destruction
     of the Iran-Iraq war has reduced the area to a ruin of small towns and
     villages.
        Kharg Island, despite wartime attacks, remains one of the great
     wonders of the world. Surrounded by oil platforms and supertankers,
     guarded by missile boats and fighter patrols, it remains the site of
     numerous refineries and oil storage tanks. There are also great
     oilfields south of Kuwait City, north of Bushehr in the Bandar-e-Rig,
     on Bahrain and Qatar, and along the UAE coastline near Ruweiss and
     Tarif, as well as assorted individual platforms
                                                                     - 112 -
     along the Arabian Gulf coast.
        Another interesting region of Iran is the great valley of
     Bandar-e-Lengeh and Bandar 'Abbas. Seasonal rivers, flowing from the
     mountains, have formed a fertile valley floor that empties into the
     Straits of Hormuz, the strategic doorway to the Persian Gulf. On the
     opposite side (the southern side) of the straits, the mountainous
     peninsula of Musandam knifes into the straits, creating a narrow
     choke-point of naval traffic.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Iran

        Upper Khuzestan Triangle - Dezful (JZ38), Masjed Soleyman (JZ47),
     Ahvaz (JZ37): These cities are the main "rear areas" behind the
     Iraq-Iran battlefront. They have a variety of SAMs. Although all
     originally had airbase facilities, it is believed that only Masjed
     Soleyman's is still intact.
        Abadan (JZ24): This city is located at the final junction of the
     Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, just before they empty into the Persian
     Gulf. Numerous battles in and around this area have destroyed a large
     part of the city. The surrounding countryside, once contained with
     dikes and irrigation projects, is now reverting to a poisonous
     marshland in the aftermath of heavy fighting, which included the use
     of poison gas.
        Bandar Khomenyi (JZ44): This is the main Iranian military base
     behind the southern part of the Iran-Iraq front, and a major staging
     base for military supplies and munitions of all sorts. It has a large
     airbase, powerful SAM batteries, and a major military headquarters.
        Bandar-e-Rig Oil Fields: These oil fields, clustered along the coast
     and inland hills (JZ61 and JZ71) are a key source of Iran's oil wealth.
        Kharg Island (JZ60): This island is covered with refineries, oil
     storage tanks, and port facilities for oil tankers. Until the Iran-Iraq
     war it was the greatest oil terminal in the world. Repeated attacks
     have ruined many of the facilities, but never all of them. Now
     protected by SAM batteries, and missile boat patrols, it is still
     Iran's main port for oil export.
        Much of Iran's oil wealth is slightly offshore. One of the heaviest
     concentrations of oil platforms exists in the vicinity of Kharg Island.
     Beware that some platforms are now used by Iranian Shi'ite "Guards" as
     military bases.
        Bushehr (JZ80): This important coastal city was once a major oil
     port, but is now completely overshadowed by neighboring Kharg Island.
     The military forces on its airbase, and the SAM batteries, are not
     always first rate. However, it is home port for many Iranian frigates
     and missile boats that patrol the gulf.
        Shiraz (KZ03): This inland city, sited on a highland plateau, is one
     of the largest Iranian cities. It is also the nerve center and main
     headquarters for Iran's southern military command - the forces
     responsible for the Persian Gulf. There is an exceptionally large
     military airbase here, and it is usually protected by a powerful SAM
     battery.
        Esfahan (JZ89): This inland city, nestled in a large col of the
     Zagros Mountains, is the classic "gateway" to northwestern Iran. As a
     transportation and population center it naturally boasts an airfield,
     and SAM sites protecting
                                                                     - 113 -
     it. The current state of the Iran-Iraq war has a powerful effect on
     what sorts of aircraft are based here.
        Yazd (KZ38) and Kerman (KZ84): These two cities are distant
     population centers on the edge of the Iranian deserts. Both cities are
     dominated by a strong traditionalist sentiment, which in recent years
     has translted into fervent Shi'ite extremism. However, the huge war
     losses are causing many families to reconsider their support for the
     Jihad.
        Bandar-e Lengeh (KY57): This western city on the Straits of Hormuz
     has a minor military base, including an airfield and SAM battery.
     However, its primary function is civilian, serving the large oil fields
     in this area.
        Seasonal rivers running from the mountains to the west down into
     Bandar-e Lengeh have a variety of interesting road and rail bridges over
     them.
        Offshore Oil Platforms are especially common in KY35-45.
        Bandar 'Abbas (KY68): This city is Iran's major military base on the
     Straits of Hormuz. Major Iranian Navy elements are based here, as well
     as the latest SAMs and a large, well equipped military airbase.
        Secret Bases: Western intelligence operatives in Iran are preparing
     two secret, hard-pack surfaces suitable for aircraft landings. One is in
     the Shalamzar valley (JZ67) in the Zagros Mountains, the other in the
     mountains south of Kerman, at KZ82.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air Defenses

        HAWK batteries are Iran's longest ranged surface-to-air missiles.
     Nearly exhausted in fighting with Iraq, these weapons are formidable
     defenders of Iran once more. The reason? A large shipment of parts and
     spare missiles by Lt. Colonel Oliver North, USMC. He hoped to trade
     them for American hostages in Lebanon. Iran got the missiles, the
     hostages remained in Lebanon, and North resigned from the Marines
     Corps. Think about that when one fires at you!
        Rapier batteries, sold by Britain to Iran, are fast, but shorter
     ranged, and hindered by a fire control system that is primarily visual,
     with the radar intended originally as backup. The Rapier radar system
     never approached the quality or sophistication of the HAWK. In fact,
     in the Falkland Islands fighting, the Rapier was surprisingly
     ineffective.
        The Tigercat, an antiquated British design, appears in less-important
     areas. Many Tigercat sites have little or no radar, since the missile is
     designed for visual control. The Seacat is a naval version of the
     Tigercat, found on Iranian Vosper Mk 5 type frigates. It is somewhat
     more dangerous because the frigates have decent radar search systems.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Iranian Air Force

        This service arm is composed primarily of American-built aircraft
     acquired during the Shah's rule. Before the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq
     war the Air Force had a nominal strength of 75 F-14 Tomcats, about 200
     F-4D and F-4E Phantom IIs, 140 F-5E Tiger IIs, plus various other planes
     and helicopters, including C-130 Hercules transports and P-3F Orion
     reconnaissance bombers.
        Fighters: Iran lacks the sophisticated technicians and parts to keep
     its F-14s operational. Within a year after the revolution fewer than
     five were
                                                                     - 114 -
     functional. No missiles or parts exist for the long-range Phoenix AAM
     system, but some F-14s still have functional long-range radars. F-14s
     can carry AIM-7F Sparrows or AIMN-9H Sidewinders.
        The older but less effective F-4s and F-5s are easier to maintain.
     These planes are the backbone of the Iranian fighting air force,
     intercepting Iraqi raids, guarding rear areas and ships from attack,
     and occasionally attempting a raid into Iraqi territory.
        Iranian fighters are equipped with AIM-9H Sidewinders, one of the
     last and best first-generation IR AAMs. The F-4 Phantoms (but not the
     F-5 Tigers) are designed to carry the AIM-7F Sparrow, a long range
     radar-homing missile.
        Reconnaissance Bombers: Iran has few naval reconnaissance bombers,
     and most of those are P-3C Orions with inoperative electronic gear.
     Such planes are reduced to making visual patrols only - a waste of
     aviation fuel in a modern warfare environment!
        However, it's possible that long-range Russian Tu-95 "Bear" bombers
     may make an appearance, flying from Afghanistan or Yemen.
        Airborne Early Warning & Control: Iran has no "AWACS" or other AEW&C
     aircraft. Instead, the few operational F-14s are used in this role,
     since the F-14 has an extremely powerful air search radar.
        Air Transports: Iran has a variety of small, medium and large air
     transports, including the American C-130 Hercules, German Fokker F.27,
     French Dassault-Breguet Falcon 20, and Boeing 707 and 747 transport
     models. The exact types available vary greatly, depending on the supply
     of spare parts and the presence of knowledgeable mechanics. Given
     Iran's dislike of the West, some consider it likely that she will shop
     in Russia for the next transports bought, perhaps the new and very
     flexible An-72 Coaler.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Navy

        The Iranian Navy has suffered greatly in the Iran-Iraq war, since
     most resources go into the army and air force. Many ships were damaged
     in the fighting and remain unrepaired; others have deteriorated badly
     for lack of maintenance. The great naval base at Khorramshahr, near
     Abadan, was destroyed early in the war and remains a ruin in no-man's
     land.
        It is believed that one or more of the four Vosper Mark 5 frigates
     are still functional. These 1100-ton ships include a Seacat SAM
     surface-to-air missiles, system and a 4.5" gun turret. Occasional
     patrols by these or smaller ships can be expected in the region of
     Kharg Island or in the Straits of Hormuz. If functional, the Vosper
     frigates pose a significant military threat.
        Iran's Shi'ite "Guards" also man a large number of fast motorboats.
     The crew carry rocket-propelled grenades to attack shipping, and
     shoulder-launched IR SAMs to protect themselves from air and helicopter
     attack. Virtually invisible, these "mosquitos" are a threat only to
     unarmed merchant shipping, or an aircraft unlucky enough to pass over
     the area. These boats are based all along the Iranian coast, especially
     at Bandar 'Abbas, and from a variety of offshore oil platforms.
                                                                     - 115 -
                                 The North Cape
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Introduction

        Politics: The North Cape area is shared by four nations. West to
     east, they are Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Soviet Union. Their
     political orientation parallel their geographic locations: Norway
     belongs to NATO, Sweden is a pro-Western neutral, neutral Finland
     accomodates the Soviets, and the Soviet Union, of course, leads the
     Eastern bloc.
        Military Forces: In terms of global politics, the North Cape is the
     single most important military region in the Soviet Union. Murmansk is
     Russia's only year-round open-sea access to the Atlantic ocean. Russian
     SSBNs (ballastic missile nuclear submarines), the heart of nuclear
     deterrence, sail from here into the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The
     Soviet Northern Fleet protects these invaluable weapons, as well as
     maintaining a credible threat to NATO's Atlantic lifelines.
        NORWAY fields a large, tough force tailored for a dogged defense of
     its mountainous homeland. Reasonably well-equipped, the majority of the
     forces guard the populous southern regions. The northern bases have only
     token garrisons. Northern Norway seems more important to NATO than it is
     to the Norwegians, since important NATO air, naval and marine troop
     assets are planned to reinforce this area in time of war.
        SWEDEN's armed forces are designed to make the Russians (or anyone)
     think twice about violating that country's neutrality. The forces are
     well equipped and well trained, with a nationwide reserve system that
     makes a large part of the citizenry part-time soldiers. However, the
     northern part of Sweden is almost unpopulated, so the defenses there
     are considerably lighter.
        Recently Sweden has been greatly irritated by Russian midget
     submarines literally crawling around inside her fleet bases, and by a
     Russian diesel sub that ran aground in a harbour entrance while carrying
     a nuclear-tipped torpedo (a serious insult to anti-nuclear Sweden). As a
     result, Sweden may be willing to support NATO clandestine operations as
     a form of revenge.
        FINLAND fields a much smaller and less sophisticated force than its
     neighbours. Although fiercly independent, Finland has learned to
     accomodate the desires of its powerful neighbour, the Soviet Union. The
     Soviets maintain this "friendly" attitude by garrisoning powerful
     military forces near the Finnish border, and strongly encouraging
     Finland to buy Soviet military equipment. So even if Finland could
     detect F-19 overflights in its northern regions, it's unclear whether
     it would bother informing its "friend" Russia immediately.
        Geography: This entire region is a harshly cold climate. Northern
     Norway is a long, mountainous country with a harsh climate and "iron"
     (rocky) seacoast. In this terrain a small group of determined defenders
     could stop an army for years. The "open" areas of Finland and Sweden
     are deceptive. On the map it may appear to be an open plain, perfect
     for attack. In reality it's a frigid wilderness in the winter and a
     vast, marshy bog in the summer.
                                                                     - 116 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Level of Conflict

        Cold war: Because of the potential threat posed by the Northern
     Fleet's ships and aircraft to the shipping lanes in the Atlantic, NATO
     and Russian forces are constantly sparring with each other, testing the
     other's responses and jockeying for position should hostilities break
     out. Officially at peace, the two sides wage a covert conflict of
     intelligence gathering and military posturing that can turn deadly at
     any instant.
        Limited War: If Russian or American foreign policy was conducted
     with greater hostilty, the North Cape would make an ideal place for
     Western raids of retaliations against the Soviets. Similarly, their air
     and sea defences could get excessively "trigger happy" and shoot before
     asking questions. Even among men of good faith, there is always a
     temptation to send in a secret mission to "take out" something that
     really bothers you. Israel and South Africa, for example, have
     surrendered to this temptation from time to time.
        Conventional War: The baloon's gone up. NATO and the Warsaw Pact are
     officially shooting at each other in this part of Europe (perhaps
     elsewhere too). The Northern Fleet is making a sortie into the Atlantic,
     Soviet troops have crossed the border into Norway, Mainstays and MiGs
     are clouding the skies. Now missions are no joke at all. Getting in and
     out with your skin intact will be very, very tricky!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Friendly Bases

        The two Norwegian land bases here are civilian airfields, but both
     are closer to the Russian border than the NATO bases at Banak and Bardu.
     It is easy and wise to stage stealth missions through either Lakselv or
     Kautokeino, rather than flying longer distances from more rearward
     fields. Such staging could be just a quick landing and refueling both
     inbound and outbound. In effect, the fields can function as grounded
     refueling tankers.
        Kautokeino (WX11): Located in the barren tundra of the
     Finnmarksvidda, Kautokeino airfield is well suited for operations across
     the top of Finland to Murmansk. The population is very small and the
     entire area well defended by tundra swamps and bogs in the summer, or
     sub-zero blizzards in the winter.
        Lakselv (WX34): Located at the inland end of the Porsangen Fjord,
     Lakselv town has an airfield ideally suited to operations into Russia.
     It is far enough from the border to survive the first few days of
     fighting, but close enough for easy flying.
        CV Kennedy at Sea (WX67): In the middle 1980s the Secretary of the
     Navy announced a new policy - a wartime policy of sending aircraft
     carriers deep into the Norwegian Sea, to challenge Russia's fleet near
     its home ports. Although considered suicidal by some, this policy is
     certainly useful for launching stealth missions. Here CV67, one of the
     conventional carriers with the US Atlantic Fleet, makes a quick dash to
     the North Cape to launch your mission. As always, the carrier is
     accompanied by a screen of escorts, and is constantly launching and
     recovering a CAP of F-18s.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Neutral Bases

        Available neutral bases in this region are all Swedish. Sweden is
     strictly neutral in international politics, but economically closely
     tied to the Western
                                                                     - 117 -
     bloc. Given recent events and aggressive Russian moves, it's not
     unlikely that a few clandestine stealth missions, or emergency landings,
     would be allowed at northern Swedish airbases. 
        Kiruna (WW28): The northernmost airfield in Sweden, this base is
     located in the nearly unpopulated foothills of the Esrange mountains.
     Stealth missions could operate easily from this area, with nobody but
     reindeer to observe the events.
        Gallivare (WW26): Although this airfield is also far north in
     Sweden, Gallivare town is a junction of rails and roads. In the summer
     months it is also a popular tourist area, with the Muddus National Park
     a few miles to the west. Stealth missions operating from this base must
     be very discreet.
        Lulea (WW13): This fairly populous city is the main Swedish military
     base in the Northern Region. It is also a port on the Gulf of Bothnia,
     the northernmost arm of the Baltic sea.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Land of the Midnight Sun

        The North Cape (Nordkapp in Norwegian) is a realm of extremes. In
     summer the sun shines throughout the night, while in winter it never
     rises above the horizon.
        The most northerly areas are realms of tundra and permafrost - ground
     that remains frozen thoughout the year, save for the top few inches in
     the summer. Only moss and coarse grass grows here, although it can turn
     brilliant green on good summer days.
        The majority of the region is taiga, vast pine forests that are home
     to reindeer, artic fox, and rock ptarmigan. The southerly lowlands are
     a deep watershed, full of small lakes, marshes and bogs. The White Sea
     coastline is almost entirely marsh as the land blends gradually into
     sea.
        The interior of the Kola Peninsula has the characteristic mountains
     of a tundra-taiga borderland: low, rolling, rocky and bare, with pockets
     of snow even in summer. The Norwegian coast has more dramatic terrain.
     Here is the topmost end of the spine of mountains that divides Norway
     from Sweden. Even here they are still steep, bare rock with clinging
     patches of ice and snow.
        Amid this monotonous, desolute terrain are impressive human works,
     especially the city of Murmansk with its sprawling military complexes.
     Hideously expensive to build and maintain through the long, deep winter,
     this region is surely the most valuable military real estate in the
     world, judging by money invested per acre!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Northwestern Russia

        Murmansk (XX11): This major city is Russia's only year-round port on
     the Atlantic ocean. Its great piers and depots support not only a steady
     stream of merchant shipping, but the powerful Red Banner Northern fleet.
     Murmansk is literally "at the end of the line", in this case a long
     railway line that runs southward 700 miles to Leningrad.
        Murmansk is also the nerve centre of Russia's powerful airforces,
     including both PVO air defence planes and Naval Aviation of the Northern
     fleet. Satellite airfields surround the city, including large bases at
     Kildenstroy (XX10) and
                                                                     - 118 -
     Kilpyaur (XX00). The Northern fleet includes, roughly, one aircraft
     carrier, 75 other major surface warships, one marine brigade, 133
     submarines, and 446 naval aircraft. The protection of its bases is the
     duty of 12 Divisions of army troops (about 300000 men total) and 150
     planes of Tactical Aviation (airforce planes supporting the army) and
     the PVO (airforce interceptors guarding the border).
        The great Severomorsk (XX31) submarine pens are also just outside of
     Murmansk. This underground base is the home port for the new Typhoon
     class of ballistic missile subs, as well as many other diesel and
     nuclear undersea craft.
        Pechenga (WX91): This town is Russia's forwardmost military base in
     the far north. Just a few miles from the Norwegian border, Pechenga is
     the inevitably staging point for any invasion into NATO territory.
     Although it has an airbase and strong SAM defenses, the Polyarnyy
     airbase complex to the east (in WX80) is somewhat larger.
        Monchegorsk (XW18) & Olenegorsk (XW19): These two towns, near the
     base of the Kola peninsula, are major airbases for long-range naval
     aviation bombers, as well as providing fighter and SAM cover to the
     railroad link between Murmansk and the south.
        Kandalaksha (XW16): This small city is the main population centre at
     the base of the Kola peninsula. It is primarily a transportation hub,
     with rail lines and a naval port that faces eastward, into the White
     Sea.
        South of the city lies the Loukhi (XW04) air defense complex,
     including a large SAM battery that covers this section of the
     Murmansk-Leningrad rail line.
        Kem (XW21): South of Kandalaksha, Kem is the next significant city
     along the Murmansk-Leningrad line. It too is a small port facing onto
     the White Sea. It is also the starting point for the Voknavolok rail
     line that runs westward to the Finnish border. This is a purely military
     line, intended to support the Russian military presence on the Finnish
     border.
        Arkhangel'sk (XW71): This city is Russia's largest port on the
     Atlantic. Although closed by ice during the winter, it has much better
     rail and road connections to the interior of Russia, and is almost
     totally invulnerable to enemy attack. In addition to large port
     facilities, the city is surrounded by military defenses, the most
     notable being the complexes at Severodvinsk (XW51) and Kushkushara
     (XW84). In addition, units of the Northern Fleet patrol offshore in the
     White Sea.
        Secret Bases: Western intelligence operatives in this area have
     secretly created two hard-frozen airstrips suitable for landings, one
     at XW57, the other at XX20.

     Air Defenses

        The Kola peninsula is vital to the Soviet Union because of the access
     it affords to NATO's lines of communications, but its very proximity
     also makes it particularly vulnerable to NATO counterstrokes.
     Consequently, the Kola
                                                                     - 119 -
     Peninsula is likely to prove one of the most challenging anti-aircraft
     environments in the world today.
        In clandestine missions it may prove impossible to penetrate and
     escape this area without eliminating at least one radar system. However,
     you get lucky - the systems often shut down for varying periods of time
     due to maintenance difficulties in this most rigorous of climates.
        Long Range SAMs: These are area defense weapons that, along with
     fighters, are your primary opposition. The older SA-2s and SA-5s have
     been undergoing continual upgrade to SA-10 and SA-12 quality. The
     entire system is enhanced by the LPAR early warning system at Kirovsk.
        Light SAMs: Soviet ground forces in this area are outfitted with the
     usual battlefield SAMs, including the older SA-9 and SA-13 IR missiles,
     as well as the newer SA-8 and SA-11 radar guided missiles. Mobile
     infantry carrying SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder-launched IR SAMs are a
     significant threat as well. Check out your intelligence briefing
     (preflight) for "special event" areas showing the latest enemy troop
     concentrations.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The PVO and Naval Aviation

        Fighters: This region is defended partly by the PVO units, with
     long-range MiG-25 and MiG-31 interceptors using long-range radar-homing
     AAMs. Naval aviation fighters operating from either carriers or land
     strips include the Yak-38 V/STOL jet and the new Su-27 multi-purpose
     fighter. During wartime shorter-ranged units may arrive, including
     MiG-29 and SU-27 dogfighters with short-range IR missiles as well as
     long-range radar weapons.
        All these planes but the Yak-38 are worthy opponents. The Yak can
     only carry IR homing missiles (generally AA-8 Aphids). It is
     considerably slower and less flexible than the other fighters.
        Reconnaissance Bombers: Many long-range Tu-95D "Bears" are based
     in this area, to keep tabs on NATO naval activity in the North Atlantic.
     A nuisance in peacetime, these planes pose a serious threat in a war.
     Eliminating them is always a high priority in NATO war plans. That would
     blind the Russian high command to activities in the Atlantic and
     Norwegian seas.
        Transports: Russia possesses numerous air transports for its huge
     force of airborne units. The most modern of these is the jet propelled
     An-72 "Coaler", which is particularly suited to fast, high priority
     missions like inserting commando teams or transporting critical command
     personnel.
        AEW & C Aircraft: The Soviets routinely deploy Il-76 "Mainstay"
     aircraft in this region. The 300+ mile radars on this plane may be your
     most formidable enemy. If you're spotted and can't discover how or by
     whom, chances are it's a Mainstay.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Red Banner Northern

        Russia's Northern Fleet offers both tempting targets and a
     significant threat. Its modern Sovremennyy-class destroyers carry SA-N-7
     missiles, while the numerous Krivak-class frigates sport the SA-N-4. The
     larger Kiev-class carrier has the powerful SA-N-6, a sea-going
     equivalent to the SA-10. These warships are more than capable of
     defending themselves. Stationed off the
                                                                     - 120 -
     northern coast, they significantly extend the Soviet anti-aircraft
     umbrella.
        In addition to these ships' SAMs, the Kiev carries a complement of
     Yak-38 "jump-jet" fighter aircraft. While less capable than ground-based
     fighters, the British Harriers in the Falklands taught the world not to
     underestimate the capabilities of such planes.
        An upcoming addition to the northern fleet is a class of huge
     aircraft carriers fitting out in the Crimea. Tentatively titled the
     "Kremlin" class, these ships are expected to join the Northern Fleet
     soon.
                                                                     - 121 -
                                 Central Europe
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Introduction

        Politics: Central Europe is where the full force of East and West
     meet. Since World War II Europe has been two hostile Blocs, with a few
     neutrals balanced between. On one side are the communist East European
     nations, created in the wake of Soviet armies at the end of WWII. On the
     other side are democratic Western European nations, created by the USA
     and Britain in the wake of their armies during WWII. Since 1949 the West
     has been linked by NATO. In 1955 the East formalized an equivalent
     organization, the Warsaw Pact, dominated by the USSR. From then to now
     the two greatest military organizations on earth have uneasily eyed each
     other along the German border.
        Military Forces: The Warsaw Pact can deploy almost three million men,
     about 80000 armored fighting vehicles, and 6000 combat aircraft. Against
     this juggernaut, the Western powers can field around two million men,
     40000 AFV's, and 4000 combat aircraft. The numerical imbalance is
     partially offset by the higher quality of the Western troops and
     equipment, presumably along with the traditional advantages of being the
     defender.
        Together, the two sides have almost ten thousand nuclear weapons for
     battlefield use in Europe. These range from small, sub-kiloton shells
     designed to wipe out troop concentrations, up to multi-megaton city
     busters. Artillery, planes, and missiles of all types and ranges can
     deliver these weapons. At one time NATO felt it had to use nuclear
     weapons to compensate for numerical inferiority. Today it has an
     alternative plan: "Air-land battle, 2000". In this NATO uses superior
     technology, including its stealth planes, to attack deep in the rear of
     the Warsaw Pact armies, destroying their logistical support. If this
     innovative strategy works NATO need not use nuclear weapons to stem the
     Red tide. However, if this fails, NATO must choose between a nuclear
     holocaust and the conquest of Europe by the Soviet Union.
        Geography: The "Central Front" stretches 1000 kilometers through the
     middle of Germany, bordered on the north by the Baltic Sea, and on the
     south by the Alps. The initial strategic objective of a Russian invasion
     would almost certainly be the Rhine river, only 150 kilometers from the
     frontier (at the closest point).
     West German terrain is mildly favourable to the defender, especially in
     the forested and hilly southern half. The broad, flat North German Plain
     is the traditional invasion route. But every few kilometers there is a
     new town, village or city. Each could become a new defensive bastion.
        One often neglected geographic consideration is the terrain to the
     east of the frontier. With the development of the "Air-land battle" this
     region takes on a new significance. The North German plain broadens
     towards the east, encompassing most of East Germany and Poland. It is
     crossed by a number of major rivers flowing northward, channeling road
     and rail traffic into a variety of bridges. This combination of open
     countryside and numerous "choke points" is well suited to air operations.

                                                                     - 122 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Level of Conflict

     Cold War: This is the situation of the last 40 years. The two sides
     maintain a wary posture, generally trying to avoid overt provocations,
     probing each other to gain information, stir discontent in the enemy
     population, and gain psychological advantages. The stealth fighter,
     designed for clandestine penetration, is the perfect aircraft for the
     secret operations common in this situation.
        Limited War: Now the conflict is at the brink of open warfare, but
     armies have not yet crossed any borders. As military acts escalate, the
     opportunity for stealth missions increases as well. Military actions are
     political signals that urge the other to back away in forceful terms.
     Unfortunately, sometimes fighting just escalates. This technique was
     successful for America on Grenada and against Libya, but it failed in
     Vietnam. Well, you're just a stealth pilot, carrying out orders.
        Conventional War: This is it! Russian tanks pour over the West German
     border while NATO forces scramble to stem the onrushing tide. On one
     side lies conventional defeat, on the other the disaster of
     thermonuclear war. "Air-land battle, 2000" goes into effect. Stealth
     aircraft, airmobile raiding groups, and long range "smart" munitions
     make the dangerous crossing over the front to hammer Soviet rear
     echelons. If they can isolate the Russian spearheads from their base,
     they may give the politicians an opportunity to avert disaster.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Friendly Bases

        West Germany, Holland, and Denmark are studded with airfields that
     could serve as bases for stealth raids into Eastern Europe. They form a
     gentle, north-south crescent bulging west in the middle. Which is the
     most suitable starting point for a particular airstrike depends mainly
     on the location of the target. However, the stealth fighter's unique
     characteristics will be most affective in the areas only thinly covered
     by radar to the north and south of the main arena. Therefore, deep
     penetration raids will usually start from Denmark or Southern Germany.
     Shorter tactical strikes, however, must fly directly into the mouth of
     the tiger.
        Jutland Peninsula - Vandel (CC52) & Leck (CB59): These far northern
     bases make ideal jump-off points for raids out across the Baltic. Often
     it's easier to deal with missile boats in the Baltic than the heavier
     SAM defenses in East Germany and Poland.
        Northern Germany (Hanover) - Ahlhorn (CB37) & Gutersloh (CB53): These
     bases, directly behind BAOR (British Army Of The Rhine), face across the
     flat, densely populated North German Plain, the most likely axis of
     advance should the Warsaw Pact attack NATO. Therefore, they represent
     the most direct route to one of the greatest concentrations of hostiles
     in the world.
        Central Germany (Westphalia) - Rhein-main (CB52) & Ramstein (CB50):
     These bases are the great, famous bases of American air power in Europe.
     Rhein-main is one of the largest military bases in the world, while
     Ramstein is headquarters for the 4th Tactical Air Force.
        Southern Germany (Bavaria) - Neuberg (CA68), Leipheim (CA57) &
     Memmingen (CA65): These bases are all Luftwaffe (air force of the

                                                                     - 123 -
     Federal Republic of Germany), but like many German bases, are entirely
     willing to host American aircraft as needed. Any of these bases makes
     an excellent jump-off point for missions into Czechoslovakia.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Sightseeing from the Baltic to Bohemia

        Without doubt, the most impressive sights in this region are the vast
     urban metroplexes, from the northern ports of Hamburg (CB67) and Lubeck
     (CB77) to the old cities of Leipzig (CB82) or Warsaw (DB95), or the
     industrial sprawl of Prague (DB30) and Krakow (DB90). Those northern
     areas not covered with cities, towns or villages are divided into small
     plots of farmland. Much of the area is watered by extensive river
     systems flowing northward. Bridges large and small are common near
     cities. An especially impressive suspension bridge can be found on the
     southwestern outskirts of Hamburg (CB67). The southern part of this
     region is dominated by low mountains that virtually surround the
     Czechoslovakian lowlands of Bohemia (to the west) and Moravia (to the
     east). The valleys and passes amid the mountains provide numerous
     natural routes, and not a few flying challenges. Although much of the
     highland areas were once forested, in the last few decades acid rain has
     denuded many areas and started rampant erosion. The once green mountains
     are now more frequently brown, gray, and black. The much higher Alps,
     capped by perpetual snow, are generally obscured by haze to the
     southwest.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Eastern Bloc

     East Germany: During a limited or conventional war the main strength of
     the Warsaw Pact forces will travel through here, surging into West
     Germany. The greates natural barrier in East Germany is the Elbe River,
     running from the Czechoslovakian mountains northward to Hamburg.
     Destroying these river bridges would cut off the Pact's forward troops
     from their supply lines.
        Covering the Pact's forward areas are two main air defense complexes,
     one in the north near Wittstock (CB97) and Wittenburg (CB87), another in
     the south just east of Leipzig and Magdeburg, including the big radars
     at Mittenwalde (CB93) and Grossenhaim (CB92).
        Poland: In a NATO-Pact confict Poland is the "rear area" through
     which Russian troops and supplies would flow toward the front lines.
     Many important headquarters and depots are situated in the central and
     western part of the nation. The Wista-Vistula river system divides
     Poland in half, from north to south. Destroying the road and rail
     bridges can seriously damage Pact operations. Polish defense complexes
     include a powerful system west of Gdansk at Stupsk (DB48), and south of
     Lodz at Radom (DB83). In addition, Warsaw (DB95) is a major
     transportation hub, so active SAM batteries can be expected in that area
     during wartime.
        Czechoslovakia: This Pact nation, seperated from Germany by the
     mountains and the rugged highlands of the Bohemian Forest, is likely to
     play a secondary role in wartime. Czechoslovakian defenses are also
     somewhat lighter than those of East Germany and Poland. Tabor (DA38) is
     the most significant installation. Far to the east, guarding the
     entrance to Hungary and southern Poland, is another defense complex at
     Konmamo (DA87).

                                                                     - 124 -
        Kaliningrad: This region of Russia, named after the major seaport of
     Kaliningrad (renamed from Konigsberg in 1945) at DB89, is the Soviet
     "front line" on the Baltic. It includes a major OTH (over-the-horizon)
     radar station at EB09, as well as the Klaipeda airbase (EC02).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air Defenses

        Equipment: Since the "Central Front" forms the focal point of the
     war, the anti-aircraft defenses on both sides are the most intensive in
     the world. The Soviets are certain to deploy large quantities of their
     most modern weapons, SA-10s and SA-12s, for area defense. In some areas
     the older, less effective SA-5 long range systems may still be in place.
        Radar guided SA-8s and SA-11s are the most commonly used for more
     local defenses, especially near important military concentrations or
     objectives. A few are even sited near the larger SAM batteries to
     provide local defense. The shorter-ranged infrared SA-9s and especially
     SA-13s may appear instead if the radar-guided weapons are not available.
        At sea the Baltic missile boats typically have either SA-N-5 or
     SA-N-7 systems, although Krivaks and larger ships with the SA-N-4 can be
     expected in wartime.
        Defended Areas: The whole region is alive with lethal metal. The most
     dangerous areas will undoubtedly be on or near the front lines in West
     Germany, and perhaps at any invasion sites in Denmark. Also beware of
     reserve troop concentrations in East Germany or Poland. But these are
     relative assessments, not absolute. Let down your guard anywhere and
     your aircraft will undoubtedly follow.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air Forces

        The Soviet Air Force is the largest in the world, and one of the most
     modern. It deploys a wide variety of interceptor, bomber, and support
     aircraft. Some are obsolescent, but many can meet the best of the West.
     The Soviets know the value of air superiority. They'll give high priority
     to that goal in any European war.
        Fighters: As always, the primary foe is another pilot. With 6000
     combat aircraft to chose from, you can bet that the Red Air Force will
     find a few to spare for you. They'll also have the hot new models. If
     you're lucky, you'll only see second-line MiG-23s, but more likely you'll
     encounter quality dogfighters like the MiG-29 and Su-27. In the rear
     areas you're more likely to see long-range interceptors like the MiG-25
     and MiG-31.
        Bombers: The Russians have many different bomber aircraft. One of the
     most troublesome is the Tu-95 "Bear" modified to carry cruise missiles.
     Keeping a number of these craft in orbit deep behind Russian lines gives
     them an "untouchable" airborne nuclear force. Your job as an F-19
     attacker is to prove that this nuclear weapon can be hurt too.
        Airborne Early Warning & Control: The Soviet Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C
     was designed for work in this kind of environment. Flying "racetrack"
     orbits deep behind friendly lines, its powerful radars can see NATO air
     operations develop and radio appropriate orders to various fighter
     squadrons.
                                                                     - 125 -

     The effort to develop these planes has been long and costly; the size,
     weight and expense of the electronic gear is gigantic. Each plane is
     precious. Eliminating them would cripple Soviet air operations. The Pact
     appreciates this too, so getting to them won't be an easy job.
        Transports: Thousands of air transports will shuttle back and forth
     on both sides of the front line, carrying troops, raiding parties,
     munitions, staff officers, etc. The new Russian workhorse that flies
     anywhere and carries almost anything is the An-72 "Coaler". Its high
     speed and short-field capability make it the natural choice for secret
     missions, and a natural target for your stealth fighter.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Naval Forces

        The Russian Baltic fleet, headquartered at Baltiysk outside of
     Kaliningrad, controls 4 cruisers, 16 destroyers (many of them
     obsolescent), 7 Krivak-class large frigates, 22 missile boats and other
     light warships, and 21 amphibious assault ships, as well as 45 submarines
     (mostly older diesel-electric models). It also controls the East German
     and Polish navies, which have numerous additional frigates and missile
     boats. This force has two goals: to cover the northern flank of the
     Warsaw Pact from air attack, and to invade Denmark in the event of war.
        Stealth missions will generally deal with the former, your problem
     being how to penetrate the warship screen in the Baltic. Because of the
     many confusing classes of Russian, Polish and East German missile boats
     and frigates, it's always wise to check the data on a ship. The SA-N-5
     is just a first generation IR homer, and no serious threat. The SA-N-4
     uses older pulse radar guidance, but the new SA-N-7 is a more serious
     problem. Fortunately very few Baltic warships carry the powerful,
     long-ranged SA-N-10.
                                                                     - 126 -

     Key to USAF Ordnance Summary

        Qty: The number of weapons of this type you can carry in one of your
     bay positions (you have four weapons positions). The M61A1 cannon is
     fixed in the nose and always available.
        Weapon: The name of the weapon.
        Max Range: The maximum range at which the weapon can be launched or
     fired effectively.
        A 0km range means the weapon is a free-fall or retarded bomb that
     must be dropped onto the target.
        Max Speed: The speed at which the weapon reaches the target. This is
     given in knots so you can compare it with your own flight speed.
        GLIDES means the weapon 'flies' without power. Therefore your speed,
     at the time of launch, becomes the speed of the weapon.
        RETARDED means the weapon is a retarded bomb that falls away behind
     your craft, decelerating as it drops. Some retarded weapons even open a
     parachute during their descent, to stabilize the fall and line up the
     warhead(s).
        FREE FALL means the weapon is a traditional free-fall bomb that arcs
     downward to the target.
        Guidance System: If the weapon has an onboard targeting system, it is
     mentioned here for general interest.
        Attack Altitude: The recommended altitude for the typical attack
     method. The "500 and up" entry means any altitude above 500' is fine.
     The "500 & climb" entry means that a toss-bombing technique is used
     where the bomb is launched while the plane climbs from 500'.
        Attack Techniques: This references the appropriate attack technique.
     Techniques noted in parenthesis are alternate attack methods that are
     either more dangerous or more difficult to learn. See "How to Fight"
     (pages 56-61) and "Air-to-Ground Tactics" (pages 78-80) for more details.

     the grade, the more effective the weapon.
        A+, A and A- means the weapons are especially effective against this
     target.
        B+, B and B- means the weapons are of normal accuracy and
     effectiveness against this target.
        C+, C and C- means the weapons are not very effective against this
     target, but may do damage if either you're skillful or lucky (or both).
        D means the weapon has marginal effectiveness against this target.
     You have to be very skillful or very lucky to achieve an effective hit.
        F means the weapon is totally useless against this target. Any

     Key to Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs)

        System Name: The name of the missile system.
        Plane: The type of plane which can carry the missile. If a specific
     plane is listed, only those planes can carry that missile. Aircraft
     listed are restricted to those commonly encountered.
        ANY USA means any plane of the US Air Force, but not current or
     former American allies (and therefore not Iran).
        ANY Western means any plane of a western-allied nation, including
     former American allies such as Iran, or neutrals such as Sweden.
        ANY USSR means any plane of a USSR-allied nation, including such
     Soviet allies as Libya, Finland, Iraq, East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
     Poland, etc.
        Guidance System: How the missile finds its target.
        Semi-active Pulse Radar requires that the launching plane continue to
     "paint" the target with radar until the missile hits.
        Active Doppler Radar means the missile has its own radar set,
     allowing the plane to "fire and forget". In addition, the missile's
     doppler radar is only fooled by chaff if the target plane generates a
     small doppler (by running perpendicular to the missile's course).
        IR (First generation) means the missile is a first generation
     infrared homer. It chases the hot engine exhaust only, and is easily
     fooled by jammers and flares.
        IR (second generation) means the missile is a second generation
     infrared homer. It aims at any hot part of a plane, including the nose,
     wings and tail as well as the engine exhausts. It can recover from jamming and
     continue seeking a target.
        Effective Range: The maximum range at which the missile can "lock on"
     to a target.
        Maximum Speed: The launching speed of the missile. Mach 1 is about
     660 knots at sea level.
                                                                     - 132 -

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Key to Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs)

        Name: The commonly used name of the system.
        Mounting: How the system operates when seen.
        SITE means fixed missile launchers are positioned around a central
     radar station in a "star" pattern.
        VEHICLES (plural) means the missile launchers and radars are mounted
     on vehicles. The vehicles are usually parked on open ground in an
     irregular pattern. Radars and missile launchers are on seperate vehicles,
     so they remain fairly close together.
        VEHICLE (singular) means each vehicle has both radars and missiles.
     Although a battery usually has 2 to 4 vehicles, often widely dispersed.
        WARSHIP means the radar and missile launcher are mounted on a warship.
        INFANTRY means the missile is man-packed, and therefore carried by
     ground military units, including installation guards, as well as by
     well-equipped terrorists.
        Search Guidance: The type and quality of search radar used by the
     missile. Eyesight is a very poor search method.
        DOPPLER RADAR measures the change in range; it is most effective when
     you fly toward or away from it, least effective when you arc around it
     at a constant distance.
        PULSE RADAR bounces signals off a surface; it is most effective when
     you fly sideways to it, least effective when you fly straight at it.
        Search Range: The theoretical maximum range of the search radar.
     However, against your F-19 radar performance is greatly reduced. The
     quality of the radar and local conditions determine its real, effective
     range.
        Firing Guidance: The way the missile finds your aircraft. Pulse and
     doppler radars have varying effectiveness depending on your flight path
     in relation to the missile (see search guidance, above, for details).
        BEAM-RIDER PULSE RADAR means the missile uses pulse radar guidance,
     with the radar receiver at the launching site. It cannot "burn through"
     jamming at close range.
        SEMI-ACTIVE PULSE RADAR means the missile use pulse radar guidance,
     with the radar receiver in the missile. Therefore it may "burn through"
     jamming at close range.
        SEMI-ACTIVE DOPPLER RADAR means the missile uses doppler radar
     guidance, with the radar receiver in the missile. It too can "burn
     through" jamming at close range.
        SA+CG DOPPLER RADAR means the missile uses doppler radar guidance,
     with the radar receiver in the missile. It can "burn through" jamming at
     close range. In addition it has command guidance that permits multiple
     attacks (should the first attack miss).
        IR homing (first gen.) means the missile uses infrared homing that
     seeks hot exhausts. It is very vulnerable to both jamming and flares.
        IR homing (second gen.) means the missile uses infrared homing that
     seeks any hot surface, including nose, wing edges, tail, etc. It has
     logic circuits that help it recover from jamming or flares.
        VISUAL means the missile is guided by a controller on the ground, who
     must watch your plane and react to your maneuvering.
        Firing Range: Maximum range at which the missile is fired.
        Max Speed: Maximum speed in flight of the missile. Mach 1 is about
     520 to 660 kts.
        Max Alt: Maximum altitude the missile can reach.
        Maneuverability: The turning ability of the missile in flight.
                                                                     - 134 -

     M61A1 20mm "Vulcan"

     very Short range general purpose gun
        Quantity: 1 fixed internally
        Effective Range: 3 km
        Maximum Range: 6 km
        Attack Technique: Tracking camera/laser historical gunsight
        NOTES: This six-barrel gatling-gun type cannon is the standard
     internal armament of most US fighters today, including the F-4, F-14,
     F15, F-16 and F18.
     It can fire 6000 rounds a minute, a high rate of fire that increases the
     chance that a shell will be in the "same piece of sky" as the target
     aircraft. Of course, this rate of fire also means that a wise pilot must
     fire in short bursts (otherwise he'll quickly exhaust all his
     ammunition).

     AIM-9M "Sidewinder"

     Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing

        Effective Range: 17 km
        Missile Speed:  Mack 3+
        Missile Maneuverability: Excellent
        Attack Technique: Air-to-Air "fire and forget"
        NOTES: Almost every aspect of this missile has been redesigned and
     upgraded numerous times. The "M" model is the latest, with a greatly
     improved all-aspect seeker head, a new warhead and an improved rocket
     engine. Although an "N" model exists, it represents rebuilds of early
     "B" and "E" models and is less reliable.

        Effective Range: 32 km
        Missile Speed: Mach 4
        Missile Maneuverability: Very good
        Attack Technique: Air-to-Air "fire and forget"
        NOTES: This the West's first radar-guided "fire and forget" missile.
     The AMRAAM (advanced medium range air-to-air missile) has its own
     inertial guidance, onboard track-while-scanning radar, and computerized
     target discrimination. Pre-production and early production models are
     becoming available to Stealth units.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     M61A1 20mm "Vulcan"

     Very short range general purpose gun
        Effective Range: 3 km
        Maximum Range: 6 km
        Attack Technique: Radar predicting gunsight
        NOTES: This gun is carried by Iranian F-4 Phantom and F-17 Tomcat
     fighters, which were purchased from the USA in the 1970s (when Iran was
     still an American ally).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     GSh-23 23mm Cannon

     Very short range general purpose gun
        Effective Range: 3 km
        Maximum Range: 6 km
        Attack Technique: Radar predicting gunsight
        NOTES: This is the standard aerial cannon of USSR-built aircraft. It
     is a twin-barrel design fires about 3000 rds/minute. Range is equivalent
     to the US weapon. The slow rate of fire (compared to the American M61)
     makes it a less effective weapon. A six-barrel version with a rate of
     fire equivalent to the American weapon may arm the MiG-29 and/or Su-27.

     ========================================================================
                                 Enemy IR AAMs:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AIM-9H "Sidewinder"

     Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
        Effective Range: 12 km
        Missile Speed: Mach 3+
        Missile Maneuverability: Excellent
        Attack Technique: Locks onto tail exhaust, then "fire and forget"
        NOTES: This was the most advanced model Sidewinder sold by America to
     Iran. The missile is solid, reliable and easy to maintain - admirable
     features that unfortunately mean it must be taken seriously by American
     planes flying against Iran.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AA-2 "Atoll"

     Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
        Guidance: First generation infrared seeker
        Missile Speed: 14 km
        Missile Maneuverability: Very good
        Attack Technique: Locks onto tail exhaust, then "fire and forget"
        NOTES: This early 1960s vintage IR missile is now obsolete. However,
     it was produced in vast quantities and sold throughout the world to
     Soviet clients. As a result, it is still carried by aircraft of poorer
     nations, as well as the second-line planes of larger and richer nations.

                                                                     - 136 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AA-6 "Acrid" (IR)

     Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
        Guidance: First generation infrared seeker
        Effective Range: 50 km
        Missile Speed: Mach 4
        Missile Maneuverability: Poor
        Attack Technique: Locks onto tail exhaust, then "fire and foret"
        NOTES: Designed exclusively for the MiG-25 interceptor, this missile
     is an IR version of the powerful AA-6 radar homer (see below).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AA-7 "Apex" (IR)

     Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
        Guidance: First generation infrared seeker
        Effective Range: 34 km
        Missile Speed: Mach 3
        Missile Maneuverability: Fair
        Attack technique: Locks onto tail exhaust, then "fire and forget"
        NOTES: This missile is an IR version of the AA-7 radar guided AAM
     (see below). It is most commonly found on MiG-23s.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AA-8 "Aphid"

     Short range air-to-air missile with infraredhoming
        Guidance: Early second generation infrared seeker
        Effective Range: 12 km
        Missile Speed: Mach 3
        Missile Maneuverability: Excellent
        Attack Technique: All aspect lock on, then "fire and forget"
        NOTES: This small, lightweight missile is a pure dogfighting missile.
     Although its IR seeker may be inferior to the AIM-9M, it is considerably
     superior to earlier Soviet designs. This missile is replacing the now
     obsolete AA-2, and is carried by just about every Soviet-built fighter,
     interceptor and combat helicopter now in service. Soviet clients within
     Europe have the weapon, as do an increasing number of client states and
     customers around the world.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AA-10 "Alamo" (IR)

     Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
        Guidance: Second generation infrared seeker
        Effective Range: about 64 km
        Missile Speed: Mach 3+
        Missile Maneuverability: Good
        Attack Tachnique: all-aspect lock on, then "fire and forget"
        NOTES: This missile is the IR version of the AA-10. It may be the
     longest-ranged second-generation IR missile in Soviet inventory today.

                                                                     - 137 -

                                Enemy Radar AAMs
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AIM-7E "Sparrow"

     Medium range air-to-air missile with semi-active radar homing
        Guidance: Semi-active radar homing (requires radar guidance from plane)
        Effective Range: 44 km
        Missile Speed: Mach 3.7
        Missile Maneuverability: Very good
        Attack Technique: Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft
        NOTES: Nicknamed "The Great White Hope" because of its prominent
     exhaust plume, this missile was America's standard radar AAM in the
     1960s and 1970s. The missile is not especially accurate, and depends on
     a close match with the firing aircraft's radar. Both the missile and
     radar demand regular and exacting maintenance. Although Iranian F-4s
     have this weapon, all these drawbacks greatly compromise its
     effectiveness.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AA-6 "Acrid" (Radar)

     Long range air-to-air missile with semi-active radar homing
        Guidance: Semi-active radar homing (requires radar guidance from plane)
        Effective Range: 50 km
        Missile Speed: Mach 4
        Missile Maneuverability: Poor
        Attack Technique: Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft
        NOTES: This huge missile is the standard long-range armament of PVO
     MiG-25 interceptors, and is rougly equivalent (though technically
     inferior) to the Phoenix AAM on the F-14. The missile is matched purely
     to the MiG-25; other aircraft cannot control it. MiG-25Rs sold to Soviet
     client states are not normally equipped with this weapon.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AA-7 "Apex" (Radar)

     Medium range air-to-air missile with semi-active radar homing
        Guidance: Semi-active radar homing (requires radar guidance from plane)
        Effective range: 34 km
        Missile Speed: Mach 3
        Missile Maneuverability: Poor
        Attack Technique: Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft
        Notes: This was the standard USSR radar homing missile of the 1970s,
     the Russian equivalent of the AIM-7 "Sparrow". It requires a matching
     aircraft radar, found in MiG-23s of the USSR and Warsaw Pact. Many
     MiG-23s sold to smaller Soviet clients outside of Europe had inferior
     radars incapable of controlling this missile.

                                                                     - 138 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AA-9 "Amos"

     Long range air-to-air missile with semi-active radar homing
        Guidance: Semi-active radar homing (requires radar guidance from plane)
        Effective range: 82 km
        Missile Speed: Mach 3.5
        Missile Maneuverability: Fair
        Attack Technique: Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft
        Notes: This new, large missile is a revision or redesign of the AA-6
     "Acrid" and is designed exclusively for the MiG-31 interceptor. There
     are some reports that the missile is an active radar homer (i.e., has
     its own radar), allowing "fire and forget" launching. There is even
     speculation that the missile could receive mid-course corrections from
     the launching aircraft or a ground radar station, but it is unlikely
     that Russian computer electronics are capable of successfully
     implementing this yet.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AA-10 "Alamo"

     Medium range air-to-air missile with active radar homing
        Guidance: Active radar homing (has its own radar in nose)
        Effective range: 64 km
        Missile Speed: Mach 3+
        Missile Maneuverability: Good
        Attack Technique: Active radar homing independent of launching aircraft
        Notes: This new, medium-sized radar AAM is strongly believed to be an
     activeradar homer, that is, it carries its own onboard radar for "fire
     and forget" use, like the AIM-120 AMRAAM. It is commonly found on the new
     MiG-29 and Su-27.
                                                                     - 139 -

                                Guided Missiles
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Penguin-3 ASM

     Medium-altitude infrared-homing anti-ship missile
        Quantity per bay: 2
        Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Ships at sea
        Effective Range: 32 kilometers
        Maximum Speed: Mach 0.8
        Attack Technique: Air-Ground fire-and-forget launch against any
                          warship
        Minimum Launch Altitude: 500'
        Maximum Launch Altitude: 40000'
        Notes: Designed by Norway, this modestly-sized and priced missile is
     aimed at a point on the surface, and flies there under its own inertial
     guidance. At this pre-designated point the missile switches on an
     infrared homer, seeking out the heat of a ship against the cool ocean
     background. The missile is not a sea-skimmer, and is therefore easier to
     shoot down. However, the missile's guidance system are entirely passive
     (unlike the Harpoon, which broadcasts its presence with radar signals).
     Although maximum range in high altitude launch is supposedly 80
     kilometers, the range used here is appropriate to a lower altitude
     attack. Supplies of this weapon are limited because the US government is
     reluctant to purchase weapons from the same source that sold important
     military technology to the USSR in 1981.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AGM-84A "Harpoon"

     Sea-skimming radar & inertial-guided anti-ship missile
        Quantity per bay: 1
        Optimum (grade A) Targets: Ships at sea
        Effective Range: 60 kilometers
        Maximum Speed: Mach 0.8
        Attack Technique: Air-Ground fire-and-forget launch against any
                          warship
        Minimum Launch Altitude: 500'
        Maximum Launch Altitude: 40000'
        Notes: The Harpoon is the standard anti-ship missile of the American
     Navy and Air Force. This weapon is more powerful, longer ranged and
     harder to stop than the Penguin. It is launched under inertial guidance
     with considerable computer assistance, flying at sea-skimming altitudes
     to avoid detection. At a pre-programmed point it turns on its radar, to
     find and home in on the target. Depending on the terminal guidance
     package installed it will either pop up and dive on the target, or fly
     straight in. Like most anti-shipping missiles, the remaining rocket fuel
     is almost as destructive as the warhead itself.
                                                                     - 140 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AGM-88A HARM

     High speed anti-radiation ("homes on radar") missile
        Quantity per bay: 1
        Optimum (grade A) Targets: Ground radar stations
        Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Warship radars
        Effective Range: 20 kilometers
        Maximum Speed: Mach 2+
        Attack Technique: Air-Ground fire-and-forget launch against any radar
        Minimum Launch Altitude: 500'
        Maximum Launch Altitude: 60000'
        Notes: This is America's most advanced anti-radar missile. It can
     lock and home on hostile radars even if they jump frequencies or switch
     off. The US Defense Department has hinted that it can even home on radar
     set components that are still warm, even if the set itself is turned off!
     The missile also has a "loiter" mode where it is fired blind and circles,
     waiting for a hostile radar to appear so it can attack it. The "loiter"
     attack mode is not available to HARMs carried on the F-19.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AGM-65D "Maverick"

     Thermal-imaging air-to-ground guided missile
        Quantity per bay: 2
        Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Bridges, bunkers, radar sites, oil
                                      facilities, ships
        Poor (grade C) Targets: Airbase hangars, ground planes, buildings,
                                depots, missile sites
        Effective Range: 32 kilometers
        Maximum Speed: Mach 1+
        Attack Technique: Air-Ground fire-and-forget launch
        Minimum Launch Altitude: 500'
        Maximum Launch Altitude: 40000'
        Notes: The Maverick is America's standard air-to-ground guided
     missile, and has a wide variety of guidance systems. The original design
     put a simple video camera in the missile's nose. While the missile
     remained attached to the plane the pilot used a miniature stick and
     screen to aim the bomb at the target below, locked it in, and released
     the weapon. Once in flight the bomb steered toward the image locked into
     its computer brain. Later versions added zoom-lenses, PAVE TACK lasers,
     and ultimately, in the "D" model, a FLIR (forward-looking infrared)
     thermal imaging system that can "see" through clouds, smoke, and night.
     The missile usually carries a shaped-charge warhead for maximum effect
     against hardened targets impervious to normal bombing attacks. However,
     high explosive warheads can be fitted instead for maximum destructive
     effect against unarmored targets.
                                                                     - 141 -
     ========================================================================
                              Laser-Guided Bombs:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     GBU-12 Paveway

     Laser-guided glide bomb
        Quantity per bay: 2
        Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Hangars, buildings, bridges, bunkers,
                                      depots, missile sites, radar sites,
                                      oil facilities
        Poor (grade C) Targets: Ships
        Effective Range: 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
        Maximum Speed: Glide bomb
        Attack Technique: Toss bombing or level bombing
        Toss Bombing Attack Altitude: 500' and climb
        Level Bombing Attack Altitude: 2000' and turn away
        Notes: The GBU-12 is one of the standard laser-guided bombs in the US
     armory. Large fighter-bombers like the F-111 favor heavier 1000lb and
     2000lb models, but the F-19 must carry lighter weight munitions in its
     small bays. The Pave Tack guidance system is the most accurate way of
     placing a bomb on a target (short of using a guided missile like the
     Maverick). The advantage of using a bomb is that the weapon weight is
     almost entirely explosive, while guided missiles must, of necessity, use
     some of their weight for the rocket motor.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     CBU-72 FAE

     Laser-guided triple fuel-air explosive ("overpressure") bomb
        Quantity per bay: 2
        Optimum (grade A) Targets: Buildings
        Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Submarine pens, hangars, bunkers, oil
                                      platforms
        Poor (grade C) Targets: Ships
        Effective Range: 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
        Maximum Speed: Glide bomb
        Attack Technique: Toss bombing or level bombing
        Toss Bombing Attack Altitude: 500' and climb
        Level Bombing Attack Altitude: 2000' and turn away
        Notes: This weapon contains a mixture of three heavier-than-air gases.
     When the bomb lands, the gases are released into the air, forming an
     explosive mixture. A delayed-action fuse ignites the mixture, which
     causes the contaminated air to burn. As well as incinerating everything,
     the burning gas expands instantly. In the open air this is sufficient to
     set off mines and flatten soft objects (such as men). However, in an
     enclosed space the effect is vastly magnified, with the walls, floor and
     roof of the structure broken and blown apart. The result in underground
     structures, like submarine pens, is total destruction.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Mk 20 "Rockeye" II

     Laser-guided high-explosive cluster bomb
        Quantity per bay: 2
        Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Grounded planes, buildings, depots,
                                      missile
                                                                     - 142 -
                                      sites, radar sites, oil
                                      facilities, ships
        Effective Range: 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
        Maximum Speed: Glide bomb
        Attack Technique: Toss bombing or level bombing
        Toss Bombing Attack Altitude: 500' and climb
        Level Bombing Attack Altitude: 2000' and turn away
        Notes: This weapon marries a laser-guided glide-bomb system with a
     Mk 20 Rockeye cluster munition (see below). The laser guidance allows
     for earlier release and greater bomblet release accuracy. With an area
     weapon like a cluster bomb the former is more important, since it gives
     an increased safety margin to the launching aircraft.

     ========================================================================
                                Retarded Bombs:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Mk 20 "Rockeye"

     Retarded fragmentation cluster bomb
        Quantity per bay: 2
        Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Grounded planes, buildings, depots,
                                      missile sites, radar sites, oil
                                      facilities
        Poor (grade C) Targets: Ships
        Effective Range: Nil
        Maximum Speed: Retarded bomb
        Attack Technique: Low-altitude level bombing
        Level Bombing Attack Altitude: 500'
        Notes: This cluster bomb breaks open about 100' above the surface,
     spinning out 247 shaped-charge bomblets that can destroy buildings,
     armored vehicles, and people. The opening height and pattern can be
     pre-set for various types of targets. The U.S. Navy discovered these
     bombs were effective against small warships when a single cluster bomb
     wrecked a Libyan Nanuchka-class missile boat in 1986. Of course, not all
     warships are as vulnerable.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Durandal Bomb

     Parachute-deployed runway-penetration bomb
        Quantity per bay: 2
        Optimum (grade A) Targets: Runways
        Poor (grade C) Targets: Bridges
        Effective Range: Nil
        Maximum Speed: Retarded bomb
        Attack Technique: Low-altitude level bombing
        Level Bombing Attack Altitude: 500'
        Notes: This is the standard anti-runway weapon in the USAF arsenal,
     even though it's French made. When the Durandal is released over target
     it deploys a parachute. This causes it to float nose-down and roughly
     stationary over the runway surface. Then its rocket motor ignites,
     blasting the warhead straight down through the concrete, where a delayed
     action fuse explodes it. This heaves up large sections of runway surface,
     while smaller shards fly hundreds
                                                                     - 143 -
     of feet through the air. The result is
     a thoroughly ruined surface and tons of wreckage that requires both
     heavy equipment and considerable time to repair.

     ISC B-1 Minelets

     Parachute-deployed minelet dispenser
        Quantity per bay: 1
        Optimum (Grade A) Targets: Runways
        Poor (Grade C) Targets: Buildings, depots, missile sites, oil
                                facilities on land
        Effective Range: Nil
        Maximum Speed: Retarded bomb
        Attack Technique: Low altitude level bombing
        Level bombing attack altitude: 500'
        Notes: This new weapon breaks open at altitude and dispenses a
     variety of small anti-personnel, anti-vehicle and delayed fuse mines.
     Used on airfields they prevent flight operations until cleared. They can
     also cause problems around open-air structures such as refineries, oil
     wells etc. Clearing the mines is complicated by the variety of types, as
     well as random delayed-fuse bombs (i.e., you'll never know when another
     will explode!).

     Mk 82-1 "Snakeye"

     Retarded high-explosive ("iron") bomb
        Quantity per bay: 3
        Acceptable (Grade B) Targets: Grounded planes, buildings, depots, oil
                                      facilities on land
        Poor (Grade C) Targets: Radar sites
        Effective Range: Nil
        Maximum Speed: Retarded bomb
        Attack Technique: Low altitude level bombing
        Level bombing attack altitude: 500'
        Notes: Retarded bombs use parachutes ar vanes to slow their descent,
     allowing the plane to clear the area before they land and explode. As a
     result they can be dropped from a lower altitude than free-fall bombs.
     However, they are less accurate, making them unsuitable against small
     targets. For the most accurate release, retarded bombs should be dropped
     in level flight. The Snakeye is the standard vane-type retarder unit for
     many US bombs, here attached to the Mk 82 500 lb. high-explosive bomb.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Mk 35 IN Cluster

     Retarded incendiary cluster bomb
        Quantity per bay: 2
        Optimum (Grade A) Targets: Grounded planes, depots, missile sites,
                                   oil facilities
        Acceptable (Grade B) Targets: Buildings
        Poor (Grade C) Targets: Radar sites, ships
        Effective Range: Nil
        Maximum Speed: Retarded bomb
        Attack Technique: Low-altitude level bombing
        Level bombing attack altitude: 500'
                                                                     - 144 -
        Notes: This cluster bomb is similar to the Rockeye, but filled with
     57 incendiary bomblets. The cluster breaks apart in mid-air, spreading
     the bomblets over an area of several hundred yards. Then each bomblet
     spreads a burning liquid wherever it lands. The result is a raging fire
     that completely covers a wide area.

                                Free-Fall Bombs
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     MK 82-0 "Slick"

     Free fall high explosive ("iron") bomb
        Quantity per bay: 3
        Acceptable (Grade B) Targets: Buildings, depots, oil facilities on
                                      land
        Poor (Grade C) Targets: Hangars, grounded planes, missile sites,
                                radar sites, oil platforms, ships
        Effective Range: Nil
        Maximum Speed: Free-fall bomb
        Attack Technique: Level bombing or dive bombing
        Level bombing attack altitude: 3000'
        Dive bombing attack altitude: Dive from 8000', release at 3000'
        Notes: This weapon is the traditional 500 lb high explosive bomb,
     virtually unchanged in concept since WWII. The effectiveness of this bomb
     depends almost entirely on the skill of the bomber. The most important
     consideration when using "iron" bombs is that releases below 2000' don't
     give the bomb time to arm in flight, causing "dud" hits. This occurred in
     the Falklands war of 1982, when Argentine pilots repeatedly hit British
     ships with bombs dropped from 50' to 100'. Not one bomb exploded.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     MK 122 "Fireye"

     Free fall incendiary ("fire") bomb
        Quantity per bay: 2
        Acceptable (Grade B) Targets: Grounded planes, buildings, depots, oil
                                      facilities on land
        Poor (Grade C) Targets: Hangars, bunkers, missile sites, radar sites,
                                oil platforms, ships
        Effective Range: Nil
        Maximum Speed: Free-fall bomb
        Attack Technique: Level bombing or dive bombing
        Level bombing attack altitude: 3000'
        Dive bombing attack altitude: Dive from 8000', release at 3000'
        Notes: This weapon contains an incendiary gel that spreads a burning
     liquid over a wide area. The liquid can flow into vents, grates, weapon
     slits, etc., making it effective against vehicles and fortifications as
     well as open-air targets. Of course, the bomb must be placed on the
     target with some accuracy to achieve this effect. Bombing skill is
     extremely important with this weapon.
                                                                     - 145 -

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     135mm/IR Camera

     Visual and Infrared photographic reconnaissance camera
        Quantity per bay: 1
        Targets: Any
        Effective Range: Not Applicable
        Maximum Speed: Not Applicable
        Attack Technique: Level low-altitude photographic run
        Photo run altitude: 200'
        Notes: This pallet contains a 135mm high resolution camera for use in
     visible light and, and a second camera for infrared (IR) thermal
     photography. Both photographs are taken simultaneously under pilot
     control. When this camera is deployed through the bomb bay, the F-19's
     tracking camera is "frozen" into a pre-programmed position, allowing it
     to function as a viewer for the big 135mm lens.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     1900 lbs Fuel

     Additional fuel for extended range flying
        Quantity per bay: 1
        Targets: Not Applicable
        Effective Range: Improves flight range by 19% per tank
        Maximum Speed: Not Applicable
        Attack Technique: Not Applicable
        Altitude: No effect
        Notes: This fuel container gives extra range with the minimum
     container weight. It replaces the weapons mounting in one bay. The fuel
     can be transferred into the main tanks by the flip of a switch. The F-19
     turbofan engine fuel lines run only to the main tanks; the engines
     cannot be fed directly from extra tanks.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Special Equipment

     The data below refers to airdropping secret equipment
        Quantity per bay: 1
        Targets: Not Applicable
        Effective Range: Not Applicable
        Maximum Speed: Not Applicable
        Attack Technique: Airdrop from level flight or land at airstrip
        Airdrop altitude: 500' to 1000'
        Notes: Airdropped equipment in the F-19 uses a simple ripcord-and-
     chute design. When the equipment package is released from the weapons
     bay, a long ripcord remains attached. Within a second the cord draws
     taut and pulls open the chute.
                                                                     - 146 -

     SAM Technical Specifications

        Radar Ratings: Pulse radars are generally less effective than doppler
     radars. Obsolescent radars of either type are greatly inferior to modern
     radars. As a result, modern doppler radars are the most dangerous, while
     obsolescent pulse radars are the least dangerous.
        RANGES are given in kilometers. Note that a maximum firing range is
     often less than the maximum search range, due to the limited fuel
     carried by most missiles.
        Guidance Systems: RADAR GUIDED missiles, with or without command
     guidance, are confused by your ECM jammer unless they are very close.
     If they are close, chaff is needed instead. INFRARED GUIDED missiles are
     confused by your IR jammer unless very close, where flares are used
     instead. A decoy is effective against any type of missile.
        VISUALLY GUIDED missiles cannot be fooled, but are usually slow
     reacting, allowing you to outmaneuver them fairly easily.
        MAXIMUM SPEED is a useful measure of whether you can outrun a missile,
     and how much reaction time you have if one is fired. Mach 1 or 2 missiles
     are fairly slow and easier to deal with. Mach 3 or faster missiles are
     much more formidable opponents.
        MAXIMUM ALTITUDE is also a useful measure, since in some cases you
     can fly above the missile's ceiling.
        MANEUVERABILITY indicates how easy it is to outmaneuver the missile.
     The less maneuverable the missile, the better your chance of turning
     perpendicular to its course and outmaneuvering it.

     ========================================================================
     Radar-Controlled SAMs

        The standard long-range SAM is controlled by radar. First the search
     radar scans the sky to find your plane. Search radars are graphically
     portrayed in the preflight briefing, and on your cockpit CRT maps.
        When the search system finds your plane, it will "hand off" the
     prospective target to a narrow-beam fire control radar, usually running
     on a different frequency. The "TRAK" warning light in the cockpit alerts
     you whenever a narrow-beam tracking radar "paints" your craft. Tracking
     continues while the missile is airborne.
        BEAM RIDER radar-guided missiles are the least flexible. They "ride"
     the controlling radar's beam. They can be easily jammed, have poor
     maneuverability, and cannot "turn around" for a second attack if they
     miss.
        SEMI-ACTIVE radarguided missiles are more flexible. They can "burn
     through" jamming as they approach the target, and often have better
     maneuverability. However, like beam riders, they cannot "turn around"
     for a second attack
                                                                     - 147 -
     if they miss.
        COMMAND GUIDANCE radar-guided missiles are the most flexible. Like
     semi-active missiles, they can burn through jamming at short distances
     and have good maneuverability. In addition, they can be commanded to
     turn around and try again if they miss on the first pass.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-2 Guideline

     Long-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Radar bunker with missile emplacements
        Search System: Obsolescent pulse radar
        Maximum Search Range: 200 kilometers
        Guidance System: Obsolescent pulse radar "beam-rider"
        Maximum Firing Range: 125 kilometers
        Maximum Speed: Mach 3+
        Maximum Altitude: 55000'
        Maneuverability: Very poor
        NOTES: This very old system is used by many third world nations
     outfitted with Soviet equipment. Although the radar systems have been
     upgraded over the last two decades, they are still inferior to modern
     systems. The last time SA-2s were used effectively was in the air
     defense of North Vietnam in the early 70s. Today it is almost worthless.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-5 Gammon

     Long-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Radar bunker with missile emplacements
        Search System: Obsolescent pulse radar
        Maximum Search Range: 350 kilometers
        Guidance System: Obsolescent pulse radar "beam-rider"
        Maximum Speed: Mach 3
        Maximum Firing Range: 150 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 95000'
        Maneuverability: Poor
        NOTES: The SA-5 is the largest and longest ranged SAM in the world
     today. However, bigger is not always better. Missile accuracy at extreme
     ranges is poor, its radar control system mediocre, and the huge missile
     has very poor maneuverability. Still, the extreme range poses a
     formidable threat. In its 1986 exchanges with Libya, the US Navy's first
     priority was disabling the SA-5 Gammon batteries with HARM missiles.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-10 Grumble

     Long-range fixed-site or vehicular radar-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Radar bunker or armored vehicle with missile
                               emplacements or armored vehicle missile
                               launchers.
        Search System: Phased-array doppler radar
        Maximum Search Range: 320 kilometers
        Guidance System: Modern doppler radar and command guidance
        Maximum Speed: Mach 3
        Maximum Firing Range: 125 kilometers
                                                                     - 148 -
        Maximum Altitude: Over 70000'
        Maneuverability: Fair
        NOTES: This semi-mobile all-altitude defense system was originally
     designed to defend the borders of the USSR from both cruise missiles and
     aircraft. However, recent failures to detect and engage low-flying
     aircraft suggest this system is less than perfect. The SA-10 is a "new
     generation" long range air defense weapon designed to replace the
     obsolescent SA-5 Gammon. Because this weapon is new, details may be
     innaccurate.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-4 Ganef

     Medium-range fixed-site or vehicular radar-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Radar bunker with missile emplacements, or
                               radar and launcher on tracked vehicles.
        Search System: Obsolescent pulse radar
        Maximum Search Range: 100 kilometers
        Guidance System: Obsolescent pulse radar & semi-active radar homing
        Maximum Firing Range: 70 kilometers
        Maximum Speed: Mach 2.5
        Maximum Altitude: 75000'
        Maneuverability: Very poor
        NOTES: The SA-4 was Russia's first mobile, battlefield SAM, designed
     to accompany large military formations as they maneuver on the
     battlefield. It operates in the rear areas of the front lines, attacking
     aircraft that IR SAMs fail to hit. The SA-4 entered service in the 1960s.
     It is now obsolescent, found only in 2nd and 3rd line Russian units. It
     has been sold extensively to Russian allies and client states.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-12 Gladiator

     Medium/long-range site or vehicular radar-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Temporary site with radar and missile
                               launchers, or dispersed radar and launcher
                               vehicles.
        Search System: Phased-array doppler radar
        Maximum Search Range: 290 kilometers
        Guidance System: Modern doppler radar and command guidance
        Maximum Speed: Mach 3+
        Maximum Firing Range: 150 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: Over 70000'
        Maneuverability: Fair
        NOTES: This very new system is believed to be a semi-mobile SAM
     designed to accompany armies, deploying far to the rear. From that
     position the missile can provide a wide umbrella of defense against both
     air raids and missile attacks. Because this weapon is quite new, the
     details may be innaccurate.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-6 Gainful

     Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Radar and launcher on tracked vehicles.
        Search System: Obsolescent pulse radar
        Maximum Search Range: 80 kilometers
                                                                     - 149 -
        Guidance System: Obsolescent pulse radar and command guidance
        Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
        Maximum Speed: Mach 2.8
        Maximum Altitude: 60000'
        Maneuverability: Fair
        NOTES: This medium range battlefield SAM is also obsolescent in the
     Russian army, but extensively used by the first-line forces of Soviet
     allies and client states. It is designed to accompany combat troops,
     protecting them from positions only a short distance behind the front
     lines. The missile was very effective in the first few days of the 1973
     Arab-Israeli War, but soon succumbed to advanced ECM jammers.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-8 Gecko

        Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Radar and launcher on a single vehicle
        Search System: Modern pulse radar
        Maximum Search Range: 125 kilometers
        Guidance System: Modern pulse radar, semi-active with video backup
        Maximum Speed: Mach 2
        Maximum Firing Range: 65 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 25000'
        Maneuverability: Good
        NOTES: This shorter-ranged but higher quality successor to the SA-6
     was the standard "up front" radar SAM of the Soviet Army in the 1970s
     and early 1980s. Now being replaced by the SA-11, it is likely to appear
     among the armies of Russia's allies and client states soon.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-11 Gadfly

     Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Radar and launcher on a single vehicle
        Search System: Modern doppler radar
        Maximum Search Range: 200 kilometers
        Guidance System: Modern pulse radar, backup unknown
        Maximum Speed: Mach 2.5
        Maximum Firing Range: 100 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 45000'
        Maneuverability: Good
        NOTES: This weapon is the "next generation" battlefield radar SAM
     designed to replace the SA-6 and SA-8. The weapon is very new, and
     details may well be inaccurate.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     MIM-23B Hawk

     Medium-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Radar bunker or trailer with missile launcher
                               emplacements or trailers
        Search System: Moder pulse radar
        Maximum Search Range: 175 kilometers
        Guidance System: Modern pulse radar & command guidance
                                                                     - 150 -
        Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
        Maximum Firing Range: 125 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 52000'
        Maneuverability: Good
        NOTES: The HAWK has long been the standard SAM of the USA, with
     various models exported to allies, including Iran. Lt.Colonel North's
     famous arms deal to Iran included extra parts and missiles for HAWK
     batteries, then Iran's most powerful air defense system. This missile
     was adequate for the 1970s, but is no longer "state of the art" against
     first-line 1980s aircraft. The US Army's replacement, the MIM-104
     "Patriot" has not been sold to any other nation.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Rapier

     Short-range fixed-site visual/radar-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Combined radar and launcher pedestal, or on
                               tracked vehicle.
        Search System: Modern pulse radar
        Maximum Search Range: 75 km
        Guidance System: Optical command guidance with semi-active pulse
                         radar backup
        Maximum Speed: Mach 2+
        Maximum Firing Range: 65 km
        Maximum Altitude: 24000'
        Maneuverability: Very good
        NOTES: This is a British high-precision, high-speed SAM for general
     battlefield defense (roughly equivalent to the SA-8). However it is
     greatly hampered by its short range, and was not very effective in the
     Falklands for this reason. Fixed pedestal versions were sold to the
     Iranian air force for airbase defense.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-N-4

     Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
        Battery configuration: Integral to warship
        Search System: depends on the ship, usually some type of pulse radar
        Maximum Search Range: Depends on the ship. Typically 100-200 km
        Guidance System: Modern pulse radar with video backup
        Maximum Speed: Mach 2
        Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 25000'
        Maneuverability: Good
        NOTES: This missile is the naval version of the SA-8 Gecko, used on
     some cruisers, frigates, newer missile boats (including the Nanuchka
     class), and amphibious warfare ships. The twin missile launcher pops up
     from an armored silo when ready to fire. The missiles can be fired
     against surface ships as well as airplanes, but are ineffective against
     modern anti-ship cruise missiles. This is a serious drawback, since many
     cruisers have a longer range than this SAM.
                                                                     - 151 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-N-6

     Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
        Battery configuration: Integral to warship
        Search System: Phased array doppler radar
        Maximum Search Range: 300+ kilometers
        Guidance System: Modern doppler radar and command guidance
        Maximum Speed: Mach 3
        Maximum Firing Range: 125 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: over 70000'
        Maneuverability: Average
        Notes: This is the naval version of the SA-10 Grumble long-range
     air-defense SAM, mounted on the Kiev-class aircraft carriers and
     Kirov-class battlecruisers. It is an excellent all-altitude weapon
     capable of reaching out long distances to intercept incoming airstrikes
     before they launch their own missiles, as well as planes that approach
     more closely. It is also designed to shoot down incoming cruise
     missiles, should a hostile aircraft manage to launch one.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-N-7

     Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
        Battery configuration: Integral to warship
        Search System: depends on ship, usually modern doppler radar
        Maximum Search Range: depends on the ship, 50-200 kilometers
        Guidance System: Modern pulse radar, backup unknown
        Maximum Speed: Mach 2.5
        Maximum Firing Range: 100 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 45000'
        Maneuverability: Good
        NOTES: This is the naval equivalent of the SA-11 Gadfly, found on
     Sovremennyy-class and later destroyers. It is a good self-defense weapon
     against air attacks that fly near or over the ship, but lacks the range
     to engage distant planes launching anti-ship cruise missiles. This
     missile is not good enough to shoot down anti-ship cruise missiles, but
     the Sovremennyys carry 30mm gatling guns for that job.

                          Short Range IR & Visual SAMs
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Expensive, sophisticated short range SAMs rely on search radars, but
     the less expensive designs use simple eyesight. Once acquired, the
     target may be tracked by eyesight, cameras, or radar.
        If the missile is an IR homer, it is aimed along the tracking line,
     and its infrared seeker turned on. When the seeker locks onto the target
     the missile is launched. From that point onward the missile steers
     itself, using its seeker.
        Infrared seekers home on heat sources. "First generation" seekers
     were easily confused by the sun, common distress flares, even
     greenhouses or sun-heated rocks. More modern "second generation" seekers
     have filters, improved technology and computer logic, making them more
     difficult to "fool" with jammers or flares.
                                                                     - 152 -
        Visually guided weapons require that the controller guide the missile
     to the target in sight. Early designs (such as the Tigercat and Seacat)
     required the controller to actually fly the missile like a plane, later
     designs (such as the Rapier) require that the controller just keep the
     target in his crosshairs - the missile automatically guides itself in
     whatever direction the crosshair sight indicates, Visually guided
     systems cannot be jammed, have trouble tracking wildly maneuvering
     targets, or even finding a target in bad visibility.

     SA-7B Grail

     Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Carried by infantrymen, or in any light
                               vehicle.
        Search System: Eyesight
        Maximum Search Range: Eyesight
        Guidance System: Infrared homing (first generation)
        Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
        Maximum Firing Range: 10 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 20000'+
        Maneuverability: Good
        NOTES: One of the first shoulder fired SAMs, this missile has good
        speed and range but a very weak warhead. The IR seeker has been
        improved in the B model, but even more upgrades appeared in the
        SA-14 (see below).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     FIM-43A Redeye

     Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Carried by infantrymen, or in any light
                               vehicle.
        Search System: Eyesight
        Maximum Search Range: Eyesight
        Guidance System: Infrared homing (first generation)
        Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
        Maximum Firing Range: No more that 7 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 10000'+
        Maneuverability: Very good
        NOTES: This was America's first shoulder-fired SAM, and was never
     really very effective. Its IR seeker was very simple, the warhead small,
     and the range and speed barely adequate. However, during the 1970s the
     US Army had nothing better, and a few NATO allies were loyal enough to
     buy it.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-14 & SA-16

     Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
        Battery configuration: Carried by infantrymen, or in any light
                               vehicle.
        Search System: Eyesight
        Maximum Search Range: Eyesight
        Guidance System: Infrared homing (second generation all-aspect)
        Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5+
        Maximum Firing Range: About 16 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 20000'+
        Maneuverability: Excellent
        NOTES: This is a completely upgraded version of the SA-7, with greater

                                                                     - 153 -
     speed, range, and a much improved IR seeker. Even further improvements
     and refinements will appear with the upcoming SA-16.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     FIM-92A Stinger

     Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
        Battery Configuration: Carried by infantrymen, or in any light
                               vehicle.
        Search System: Eyesight
        Maximum Search Range: Eyesight
        Guidance System: Infrared homing (second generation all-aspect)
        Maximum Speed: Mach 2
        Maximum Firing Range: about 10 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: about 20000'
        Maneuverability: Excellent
        NOTES: Entering production in 1981, this was a much-needed
     replacement for the Redeye. The Stinger is much more effective missile,
     largely because of its excellent and quite "intelligent" IR seeker. The
     CIA has been supplying quantities of this missile to guerilla movements,
     who in turn have traded or given this weapon to groups hostile to
     America, including the Iranian Shi'ite militia.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-9B Gaskin

     Short-range vehicle mounted infrared-homing SAM.
        Battery Configuration: Radar and launcher on same armored vehicle
        Search System: Eyesight
        Maximum Search Range: Eyesight
        Guidance System: Pulse radar aiming and infrared (IR) homing
        Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
        Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 20000'
        Maneuverability: Very good
        NOTES: This is an upgraded version of the SA-9 missile vehicle. The
     original design did very poorly in the Bekaa Valley against Israeli
     aircraft in 1981. The SA-9 is designed to accompany front-line combat
     units and provide low-level defense against strike aircraft and
     helicopters. The missile itself is fairly small and not especially
     destructive.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-13 Gopher

     Short-range vehicle mounted infrared-homing SAM.
        Battery Configuration: Radar and launcher on same armored vehicle
        Search System: Obsolescent pulse radars or eyesight
        Maximum Search Range: visual or 30-60 kilometer pulse radar
        Guidance System: Pulse radar aiming and infrared (IR) homing
        Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
        Maximum Firing Range: 65 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 30000'
        Maneuverability: Very good
        NOTES: This is an improved SA-9 with a new launcher, better radar,
     and an improved missile. Unlike the SA-9, it can be linked with a
     seperate search
                                                                     - 154 -
     radar system, including other obsolescent systems from older radar-
     guided SAMs. A number of third world nations have received this with the
     SA-9B missiles on the new tracked launcher.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Tigercat

     Short-range fixed site visual SAM.
        Battery Configuration: Emplacements with controller position, trailer
                               laucher(s).
        Search System: Visual or obsolescent pulse radar
        Maximum Search Range: Eyesight or 65 kilometer pulse radar
        Guidance System: Joystick (visual) command guidance
        Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
        Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 12000'
        Maneuverability: Good
        NOTES: This inexpensive land version of the Seacat missile is only
     useful for protecting installations from direct air raids. It is very
     short ranged, cannot reach high altitudes, and has a primitive "operator
     must fly the missile" control system. Missiles are heavy, and mounted on
     trailers that must be deployed well to the rear of any battlefield
     frontline. It's hard to take this missile seriously.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     SA-N-5

     Short-range point defense naval SAM.
        Battery Configuration: Integral to warship
        Search System: Naval pulse radar of varying quality
        Maximum Search Range: Varies with ship, 50-150 kilometers
        Guidance System: Infrared (IR) homing
        Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
        Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 20000'
        Maneuverability: Very good
        NOTES: This is the naval version of the SA-7 Grail. Older frigates
     and missile boats (including the very common Osa class) use this system.
     The missiles are aimed visually, their IR locked on, and then fired.
     Larger launcher systems have four launching tubes and an operator
     position. The system is effective only against aircraft that fly close
     to the boat or ship.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Seacat

     Short-range point defense naval SAM.
        Battery Configuration: Integral to warship
        Search System: Obsolescent pulse radar (on Vosper Mk 5 Frigates)
        Maximum Search Range: 200 kilometers (on Vosper Mk 5 Frigates)
        Guidance System: Joystick (visual) command guidance
        Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
        Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
        Maximum Altitude: 12000'
        Maneuverability: Good
                                                                     - 155 -
        NOTES: The Seacat missile is the naval version of the Tigercat, with
     the same primitive control system and short range. It is the anti-
     aircraft defense of Mark 5 frigates, built by Vosper in England for
     export. Iran bought a number of these ships. The Vosper's search radar
     is the obsolescent AWS-1, whose maximum range is 200 kilometers. Its
     effective range against a stealth aircraft would be much, much less.

                                                                     - 156 -
                                   Warplanes
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Key to Aircraft
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Roles

        A FIGHTER plane specializes in air-to-air combat, where the objective
     is destroying enemy aircraft.
        An INTERCEPTOR is a fighter designed to fly long distances and attack
     distant enemy aircraft. Many interceptors are poor dogfighters.
        A STRIKE plane is designed to hit surface targets in enemy territory.
     CLOSE SUPPORT strikes are against enemy front-line troops, INTERDICTION
     strikes are against military rear areas (headquarters, supply dumps,
     columns on roads, etc.), while DEEP STRIKES attack enemy installations
     far behind the front line (railroad yards, bridges, airbases, etc.).
     Strike aircraft designed to function against warships are sometimes
     termed ATTACK aircraft.
        BOMBERS are designed for interdiction, deep strike, and/or naval
     attack, as well as carrying nuclear weapons and/or reconnaissance gear.
        TRANSPORTS carry personnel and equipment. They are not designed to
     fight, and almost never carry any armament.
        AEW&C (Airborne Early Warning & Control) planes carry powerful search
     radar and communications gear, designed to watch friendly and hostile
     aircraft while simultaneously controlling friendly air operations.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Crew

        If a plane has a crew of one man, cockpit aids are important: the
     workload for one man in a jet warplane is quite high.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Mission Weight

        This is the typical total weight of the plane, with fuel and weapons,
     at takeoff. If the plane can serve in both fighter and strike role, the
     fighter (air-to-air) weight is given. In a strike role a plane often
     carries 15-35% additional weight.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Engines

        The total thrust of the engines (on afterburners if available) is
     important. Airplanes with greater thrust than weight can fly
     "ballistically", a useful advantage in air combat. A high thrust/weight
     ratio is desired by all fighter pilots.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Range

        This is the combat radius of the plane when loaded for action, but
     using only internal tanks (no extra fuel tanks). Often the figure is an
     approximation.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ceiling

      Maximum altitude of the plane, using afterburners if available.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Maximum Speed at 0'

        Sea-level maximum speed is often much less than high altitude maximum
     speed, especially in high-speed jets.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Maximum Speed at 36,000'

        This altitude level is an important benchmark because above it Mach 1
     is a constant 573 knots. Although this speed is important, note that the
     optimum
                                                                     - 157 -
     turning speed for most aircraft is Mach 0.75 to 0.90 (i.e., 550-650
     knots, depending on the plane and altitude); higher speeds are only good
     for chasing opponents, escaping from them, or quick dashes into and out
     of enemy airspace.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Armament

        Often weapons pylons can be fitted to carry multiple bombs or
     lightweight missiles. The number of pylons need not limit the number of
     ordnance items.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air-to-Air Radar Quality

        As a stealth pilot, you are naturally interested in the range and
     quality of enemy airborne search radar.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Maneuverability

        This is a comparative rating of how well the plane can maneuver in a
     dogfight. All aircraft are rated on the same standard: the superb
     maneuverability of the F-16 Falcon.

     F-4E Phantom II
        Designer/Manafacturer: McDonnell Douglas, USA
        Role: Fighter & strike fighter
        Crew: Two
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 27 tons
        Engine(s): Two General Electric J79-17 turbojets for 35,800 lbs
                   thrust.
        Range: 830 kilometers
        Ceiling: 58750'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 800 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1260 kts
        Armament: 6-barrel 20mm cannon, 4 missile recesses, 5 weapon pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Fair quality and range pulse radar
        Maneuverability: Fair to good
        NOTES: This all-purpose plane served the US Navy and Air Force as
     both a fighter and strike fighter throughout the 1960s and early 1970s.
     In the USAF it is now obsolescent, serving mainly for reconnaissance and
     electronic warfare ("Wild Weasel"). However, hundreds were sold to
     western nations worldwide, including Iran under the Shah. For air-to-air
     combat the plane can carry four AIM-9 Sidewinders and four AIM-7
     Sparrows.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     F-5E Tiger II

        Designer/Manafacturer: Northrop, USA
        Role: Fighter & strike fighter
        Crew: One
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 12 tons
        Engine(s): Two General Electric J85-GE-21B turbojets for 10000 lbs
                   thrust
        Range: 220 kilometers
        Ceiling: 51000'
                                                                     - 158 -
        Maximum Speed at 0': Not available, probably 500-600 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 950 kts
        Armament: Two 20mm cannon, 5 weapon pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Poor quality and range pulse radar
        Maneuverability: Fair
        NOTES: This inexpensive and unsophisticated fighter was never adopted
     by US combat arms, but has been widely sold abroad, including 138 to
     Iran. Underpowered, with poor avionics, it is useful only against
     obsolete opponents. It can carry AIM-9 Sidewinders, but not AIM-7
     Sparrows.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     F-14D Tomcat

        Designer/Manafacturer: Grumman, USA
        Role: Fighter & interceptor
        Crew: Two
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 35 tons
        Engine(s): originally two Pratt & Whitney TF30-412A turbofans for
                   41800 lbs thrust, upgraded in D model to two General
                   Electric F110-400 turbofans for 54-58000 lbs thrust
        Range: 1280 kilometers
        Ceiling: over 56000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 800 kts with TF30, higher with F110
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1350 kts with TF30, higher with F110
        Armament: 6-barrel 20mm cannon, 4 weapons pallets, 2 weapons pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Excellent range, high quality doppler radar
        Maneuverability: Good
        NOTES: This heavy, long-range interceptor has extremely powerful
     avionics for use with the AIM-54 Phoenix semi-active radar-homing
     missile, which has a 200 km effective range. The aircraft is the US
     Navy's long-range defender of carrier battle groups. Standard USN
     armament is four Phoenix and four Sidewinder missiles (two per pylon).
     The swinging wings are computer controlled for maximum performance, but
     their swing also shows the plane's energy state to the enemy. In 1987
     the Navy began a program that upgraded the original TF30 engines with
     the newer, more powerful F110s. About 80 TF30-engined F-14s were
     supplied to Iran, but engine troubles, complexities in the avionics
     system, and the delicacy of the Phoenix missiles have greatly reduced
     their military value. They are often used as radar-warning patrol
     aircraft.

        Engine(s): Two Pratt & Whitney F100-100 turbofans for 47660 lbs thrust
        Range: 1200 kilometers
                                                                     - 159 -
        Ceiling: 63000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 810 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1260 kts or greater
        Armament: 6-barrel 20mm cannon, 4 missile ejectors, 4 weapons pylons,
                  2 FAST pallet points
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium range, high quality doppler radar
        Maneuverability: Very good
        NOTES: This large, powerful dogfighter is the dream plane of many
     USAF pilots. Although not as nimble as the lightweight F-16, it has
     longer ranged avionics, plus a brute size and power unmatched by any
     fighter until the new Su-27 appeared.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     F-16C Falcon

        Designer/Manafacturer: General Dynamics, USA
        Role: Fighter & strike fighter
        Crew: One
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 12.5 tons
        Engine(s): One Pratt & Whitney F100-200 turbofan for 23830 lbs thrust
        Range: 540 kilometers
        Ceiling: over 50000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 800 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1190 kts
        Armament: 6-barrel 20mm cannon, 7 weapon pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium range, high quality doppler radar
        Maneuverability: Excellent
        NOTES: The latest production fighter added to the US Air Force, the
     F-16 is the most maneuverable dogfighter in the world (possibly excepting
     the MiG-29). The inherently unstable airframe that gives this agility
     would be unflyable except for the computerized electronic controls, hence
     its nickname "Electric Jet". Advanced air-ground avionics and anti-
     missile defenses are "extras", making the basic aircraft relatively
     cheap. Many western nations have purchased F-16s. However, until the
     AIM-120 AMRAAM it had no long-range AAM.

        Maximum Speed at 0': less than 660 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1050 kts
        Armament: 6-barrel 20mm cannon, 9 weapons pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium range, high quality doppler radar
        Maneuverability: Good to very good (see note below)
                                                                     - 160 -
        NOTES: Although not as maneuverable as the F-16 (see note below),
     this multi-role fighter has numerous avionic and defensive aids built in.
     These were required by the US Navy, its main user, who needed an all-
     purpose fighter and attack bomber able to fire a variety of sophisticated
     weapons. Like the F-16, it also is sold to western nations.

        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Poor, but superb air-to-ground weapons
                                  radars
        Maneuverability: Fair to poor
        NOTES: Designed at the end of the 1950s as a low-level attack bomber
     for use in bad weather or at night, this plane remains an unqualified
     success. Avionics and weapons have been rebuilt more than once to
     maintain the "state of the art", with upgrades under development.
     Electronic warfare (EA-6 and EA-6B) and aerial tanker (KA-6D) versions
     exist.

     AV-8B Harrier II

        Designer/Manafacturer: British Aerospace, UK (original design) and
                               McDonnell Douglas, USA (American version)
        Role: S/VTOL Fighter & strike fighter
        Crew: One
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 15 tons STOVL, 10 tons VTOL
        Engine(s): One Rolls Royce Pegasus 11-21E for 22000 lbs vectored
                   thrust (no afterburner)
        Range: 240 kilometers
        Ceiling: 55000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 585 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 520 kts
        Armament: one 25mm cannon, 7 weapon pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Poor, target acquisition is usually visual
        Maneuverability: Very good
        NOTES: Originally designed as a strike fighter, the British-American
     co-redesign greatly enhanced maneuverability. The avionics are designed
     for ground attack rather than air-to-air combat. Despite this, Harriers
     were successful as interceptors and combat air patrol in the 1982
     Falklands War. The Harrier is the primary fighter of the US Marines, the
     British Royal Navy, and frontline squadrons of the British Royal Air
     Force (RAF) in Germany. Usually it
                                                                     - 161 -
     uses short segments of roadway or a "ski-jump" deck for rolling
     takeoffs, and later lands vertically, like a helicopter.

     A-10A Thunderbolt II

        Designer/Manafacturer: Fairchild Republic, USA
        Role: Close support aircraft
        Crew: One
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 20 tons
        Engine(s): Two General Electric TF34-100 turbofans for 18130 lbs
                   thrust
        Range: 960 kilometers
        Ceiling: under 40000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 370 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': Unknown, probably less than 370 kts
        Armament: 7-barrel 30mm cannon, 11 weapon pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Poor, air-to-ground avionics quite basic
        Maneuverability: Very good
        NOTES: This slow, heavily-armored plane was designed purely for
     frontline ground attack with "tank busting" its speciality. This role
     (unglamorous to the USAF), along with its peculiar appearance, earns it
     the unofficial nickname "Warthog". Although intended for combat in
     Europe where low clouds and bad weather are frequent, the A-10 is a
     fair-weather day-only plane. The manafacturer hopes to interest the USAF
     in a night-flying variant, currently without success. Unless protected
     by good fighters (F-15s and F-16s), this plane is doomed if sent into
     airspace contested by USSR fighters.

     EF-111A Raven

        Designer/Manafacturer: General Dynamics, USA
        Role: Electronic warfare escort
        Crew: Two
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 43.5 tons
        Engine(s): Two Pratt & Whitney TF30-3 turbofans for 37,000 lbs thrust
                   (with afterburners)
        Range: 1,900 kilometers
        Ceiling: 54700'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 700 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1020 kts
        Armament: ALQ-99E electronic warfare system, no other weapons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium-long range, high quality pulse &
                                  doppler
        Maneuverability: Fair
        Notes: This is a specially built electronic warfare version of the
     F-111 strike and interdiction bomber. The original concept of the F-111
     was a high-speed bomber for deep strikes at high and/or low altitude,
     especially at night or in bad weather. The EF-111 is popularly known as
     the "Electric Fox", or "Spark Vark" (the unofficial nickname of the
     F-111 is "Aardvark" or "Vark"). It is designed to accompany deep strike
     and interdiction missions, providing electronic screening and jamming.
     It is the fastest, most powerful such craft in the world.
                                                                     - 162 -

     B-1B Bomber

        Designer/Manafacturer: Rockwell International, USA
        Role: Strategic bomber
        Crew: Four
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 225 tons with internal load only
        Engine(s): Four General Electric F101-102 turbofans for 120000 lbs
                   thrust
        Range: 5,900 kilometers
        Ceiling: Unknown, probably under 50000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 530 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 725 kts
        Armament: 37.5 ton capacity bomb bay, 29.5 tons additional on
                  external mounts if desired
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium range, high quality doppler radar
        Maneuverability: Poor
        NOTES: This redesign of the B-1A (cancelled in the late 1960s)
     emphasizes low-level attack and minimal radar signature. The aircraft is
     now seriously overloaded by the numerous revisions and often unreliable
     electronic defensive gear. Despite the usual carping from the US press,
     in combat against first-line Russian aircraft this bomber has some hope
     of survival. The obsolescent B-52s it replaces would have no chance
     whatsoever.

     E-3C Sentry "AWACS"

        Designer/Manafacturer: Boeing, USA
        Role: Airborne Early Warning & Control
        Crew: 15 to 17
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 162.5 tons
        Engine(s): Four Pratt & Whitney TF33-100/100A turbofans for 84000 lbs
                   thrust
        Range: 3000 kilometers (11 hours unrefueled endurance)
        Ceiling: over 29000'
        Cruise Speed at altitude: over 350 kts
        Maximum Speed at altitude: 460 kts
        Armament: Surveillance radar, communications, air traffic control,
                  and electronic defenses; weapons pylons may be added
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Excellent range and quality radars
        Maneuverability: Poor
        NOTES: This 707 airliner frame holds the most sophisticated and
     effective airborne radar in the world. No other nation has a plane of
     equivalent effectiveness (the British Nimrod and Russian Moss are
     failures, the new Russian Mainstay is still unproven). Flying "racetrack"
     circles behind friendly lines at 25-30000', this AWACS can watch and
     direct aircraft out to 300 miles range. Until the "C" model upgrade, too
     many aircraft and limited computer power caused temporary "blind spots".
     In wartime weapons pylons carrying AIM-9 Sidewinders or AIM-120 AMRAAMS
     could be added. In addition each Sentry carries various electronic
     defenses and always has a fighter escort.
                                                                     - 163 -

     MiG-21 Fishbed

        Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
        Role: Fighter
        Crew: one
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 9 tons
        Engine(s): One Tumansky R-11F2S-300 turbofan for 14500 lbs thrust
        Range: 630 kilometers
        Ceiling: 59000' (often only 50000')
        Maximum Speed at 0': 700 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1220 kts
        Armament: Two 23mm cannon, 4 weapons pylons, 1 fuel tank pylon
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Very short range, low quality pulse radar
        Maneuverability: Good
        NOTES: This agile, maneuverable, easy-flying fighter was the premier
     dogfighting plane of the 1960s and early 1970s. It has simple avionics
     and a standard armament of 2 or 4 AA-2s (now often replaced by AA-8s),
     making it inexpensive to buy, arm and maintain. However, it has little
     or no HUD, weak radars, and low quality defenses, making it obsolete as
     a fighter. Unfortunately, its limited carrying capacity makes it poor as
     a strike fighter.

     MiG-23 Flogger

        Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
        Role: Fighter
        Crew: One
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 16 tons
        Engine(s): One Tumansky R-29B turbofan for 27500 lbs thrust
        Range: 900 kilometers
        Ceiling: 61000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 740 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1190 kts
        Armament: Two 23mm cannon, 4 weapon pylons, 1 fuel tank pylon
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Very poor, short range pulse radar
        Maneuverability: Fair
        NOTES: This swing-wing fighter replacement for the MiG-21 originally
     had few avionics and a 22485 lb. R-27 engine. This variant, incapable of
     firing sophisticated weapons and with serious performance flaws, is
     often sold abroad. The more advanced models, listed above, are mediocre
     performers. All commonly carry AA-2 and/or AA-8 missiles, most USSR and
     East European versions use the AA-7 radar homing missile also. With its
     MiG-27 brother, this plane has huge production runs, making it the
     cheapest fighter available today. This alone makes it one of the world's
     most popular aircraft.
                                                                     - 164 -

     MiG-27 Flogger

     [Physical appearance equivalent to MiG-23]
        Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
        Role: Strike Fighter
        Crew: One
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 22 tons
        Engine(s): One Tumansky R-29 turbofan for 25353 lbs thrust
        Range: 400 kilometers
        Ceiling: 52000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 635 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 925 kts
        Armament: One 6-barrel 23mm cannon, 5 weapon pylons, 2 bomb racks
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Very poor, very short range pulse radar
        Maneuverability: Fair
        NOTES: This is the ground-attack variant of the MiG-23. In Russian
     frontline units it includes a laser designator for laser-guided
     munitions and simple terrain-avoidance radars for low-level attacks.
     Improved jammers and decoys are added as well. However, many
     sophisticated attack aids common on western strike fighters are not
     present. Presumably the MiG-27s compensate for this with quantity, as
     huge production runs greatly lower its cost.

     MiG-25 Foxbat

        Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
        Role: PVO Interceptor
        Crew: One
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 40 tons
        Engine(s): Two Tumansky R-31 turbofans for 48500 lbs thrust
        Range: 1100 kilometers
        Ceiling: 80000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 570 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1860 kts
        Armament: 4 weapons pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium quality, medium range pulse radar
        Maneuverability: Poor
        NOTES: This plane was originally designed to defend the distant
     borders of the USSR from air attack, working with special ground radars
     to attack enemy bombers with a special long-ranged AAM (the AA-6). It is
     extremely fast, but quite unmaneuverable. A few are bought by client
     states for status reasons, but the reconnaissance version (MiG-25R) is
     more popular - it's 88,000' ceiling makes it immune to normal SAM or
     fighter interception.

     MiG-29 Fulcrum

        Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
        Role: Fighter
        Crew: One
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 18 tons
        Engine(s): Two Tumansky R-33D turbofans for 36600 lbs thrust

                                                                     - 165 -
        Range: 650 kilometers
        Ceiling: Probably 55-65000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 700 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1260 kts
        Armament: One multi-barrel cannon, 6 weapons pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium quality and range doppler radar
        Maneuverability: Very good to excellent
        NOTES: Originally designed to outfight the F-15, this plane is a
     modern, lightweight dogfighter with superlative agility. It has engine
     power in excess of its weight. Common armament is AA-10 "fire and
     forget" radar-homers along with some AA-8 and/or AA-10 IR missiles. The
     degree of sophistication in the avionics is unknown, but unlikely to
     match western models. Considerable debate exists regarding the relative
     superiority of this plane versus the F-16.

     MiG-31 Foxhound

        Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
        Role: PVO Interceptor
        Crew: One
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 45 tons
        Engine(s): Two turbofans or turbojets, estimated thrust 50-60000 lbs
        Range: 1500 kilometers
        Ceiling: 75500'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 790 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1400 kts
        Armament: Cannon possible, 4 missile recesses, 4 weapons pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Superior quality and range doppler radar
        Maneuverability: Fair
        NOTES: This aircraft is a redesigned MiG-25. Although slightly slower,
     it is improved in all other categories, especially low-altitude
     interceptions against planes and cruise missiles. The new AA-9 long-range
     missile is designed for look-down attacks on low-level cruise missiles.
     It also has AA-8s and AA-10s.

     Su-24 Fencer

        Designer/Manafacturer: Sukhoi, USSR
        Role: Strike Fighter & Interdictor
        Crew: Two
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 43.5 tons
        Engine(s): Two Tumansky R-29B turbofans for 50700 lbs thrust
        Range: 300 to 1800 kilometers (varies with mission profile and load)
        Ceiling: 57400'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 765 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1400 kts
        Armament: 6-barrel 23mm cannon, 8 weapon pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: nil, avionics designed purely for
                                  air-ground role
        Maneuverability: Fair
        NOTES: This is the most advanced air-ground attack plane built by the
     USSR. Externally it appears similar to the F-111, including the side-by-
     side
                                                                     - 166 -
     seating in the cockpit. However, its armament and avionics are
     designed for front-line and rear-area strikes, into the teeth of enemy
     air defenses. Western air and ground commanders fear the Su-24 more than
     any other Soviet aircraft. The aircraft may carry a few AA-8s for
     self-defense, but it is not designed for air-to-air combat.

     Su-27 Flanker

        Designer/Manafacturer: Sukhoi, USSR
        Role: Fighter
        Crew: One
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 25 tons
        Engine(s): Two unknown turbojets for estimated 60000 lbs thrust
        Range: 1150 kilometers
        Ceiling: probably 60000' or more
        Maximum Speed at 0': 725 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 1350 kts
        Armament: Probably a cannon, 6 weapons pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Above average quality and range doppler
                                  radar
        Maneuverability: Very good to excellent
        NOTES: This aircraft was designed to defeat the F-14 and F-15
     fighters. It is a large, powerful dogfighter whose usual armament is
     probably four AA-8 and four AA-10 missiles. In comparison to the MiG-29,
     the Su-27 is a larger, heavier plane. If its avionics and flight
     controls are truly modern, the Su-27 may be the superior plane. However,
     in dogfighting maneuverability the MiG-29 and F-16 probably have the
     edge.

     Yak-38 Forger

        Designer/Manafacturer: Yakovlev, USSR
        Role: VTOL Fighter

        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 12 tons
        Engine(s): One Lyulka AL-21 vectored-thrust turbojet for 17985 lbs
                   thrust (no afterburner), plus two Koliesov lift engines
        Range: 370 kilometers
        Ceiling: 39370'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 535 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 550 kts
        Armament: 4 weapons pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Poor quality and range pulse radar
        Maneuverability: Fair
        NOTES: Originally known as the Yak-36MP, this vertical take-off
     fighter operates from the Kiev-class aircraft carriers. These lack the
     equipment and deck space for conventional jets. Initially thought to be
     a Russian equivalent of the Harrier, the Yak-38 is considerably
     inferior. It has a limited interception ability and very limited strike
     capacity. However, until this plane the Russian navy had nothing bigger
     than helicopters for its warships at sea.
                                                                     - 167 -

        Mission Weight at Takeoff: 61 tons
        Engine(s): Two uprated Kuznetsov NK-144 turbofans for 88180 lbs thrust
        Range: 5500 kilometers
        Ceiling: 55000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 525 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 970 kts
        Armament: Three heavy Air-Surface missiles or 13 tons of bombs
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Fair, with excellent air-to-surface avionics
        Maneuverability: Very poor
        NOTES: Many of these swing-wing bombers are in service with the Soviet
     naval air arm, carrying long-range missiles to attack hostile warships up
     to 3000 kilometers out to sea. The Backfire's exceptionally long range
     and high speed, plus its powerful missiles make it a mortal threat to
     USN aircraft carriers. With aerial refueling it has sufficient range to
     get within curise-missile-launch position of the USA. As a gesture to
     arms control, the USSR has removed air refueling equipment from its Air
     Force Backfires.

        Armament: Unarmed
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Very good long-range pulse radars
        Maneuverability: Terrible
        NOTES: The Tu-95 has been the world's most sophisticated turboprop
     bomber for over thirty years (it entered service in 1955). It is
     primarily used for long-range reconnaissance, electronic intelligence,
     electronic warfare (jamming), anti-ship missiles, and cruise-missiles.
     The "D" model is a reconnaissance version, the "H" model (on a slightly
     modified airframe) a cruise-missile carrier.

     Il-76 Mainstay

        Designer/Manafacturer: Ilyushin, USSR
        Role: Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C)
        Crew: Estimated at 15 to 20
        Mission Weight at Takeoff: About 150 tons
        Engine(s): four Soloview D-30KP turbofans for 106000 lbs thrust
        Range: About 6400 kilometers (7 hours endurance)
        Ceiling: About 40-50000'
        Maximum Speed at 0': 400 kts
        Maximum Speed at 36000': 460 kts
        Armament: Possibly twin 23mm tail cannon, 2-4 weapons pylons
        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Excellent long-range doppler radars
        Maneuverability: Terrible
        NOTES: The "Mainstay" is a conversion of the huge Il-76 Candid
     transport plane to "AWACS" duties. Its purpose is to detect enemy
     aircraft and low-flying missiles, and act as a mobile, airborne command
     post that controls friendly aircraft engaging such threats. The earlier
     Tu-126 "Moss" AEW&C with turboprops was a disastrous failure. Like many
     AEW&C planes, the Il-76 could carry a few AAMs (AA-8s or AA-10s) for
     self defense, as well as extensive jammers, decoys, etc.

        Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Navigational only
        Maneuverability: Terrible for a fighter, but good for a transport
        NOTES: This is the latest general-purpose medium air transport of
     the Soviet Union. Its jet engines and short-takeoff performance make in
     an outstanding utility craft for transporting all types of personnel and
     cargo between remote airfields.

     Ace-of-the-Base: Best flyer in the squadron.
     AFV: Armored Fighting Vehicle, an armored vehicle designed for front
          line combat. This includes tanks, armored personnel carriers,
          anti-aircraft tanks, SAM missile carriers, etc.
     AGM: Air-to-Ground Missile. Originally used by the US Air Force for
          missiles designed to hit land surface targets, but commonly
          extended to mean missiles designed for use against land or sea
          targets.
     ARM: Anti-radiation Missile. Missile designed to home on enemy radar
          sets.
     ASM: Air-to-Surface Missile. Often used for missiles designed to attack
          ships, but sometimes generalized to mean any missile launched
          against targets on the surface of the earth.
     Bravo Sierra: Military words for BS, which in turn is an abbreviation
          for a common expletive, here indicating something especially
          unpleasant or unbelievable. For example: "Doing the bunny hop down
          the brunway to a bellyflop landing, then complaining about the wind
          sheer, is true Bravo Sierra!"
     BVR: Beyond Visual Range. Any engagement where you cannot visually
          distinguish the target. During peacetime pilots are often prohibited
          from firing BVR. for fear of hitting the wrong target.
     CAP: Combat Air Patrol. Aircraft patrolling over friendly forces.
          Originally it meant fighters launched from aircraft carriers, and
          assigned to patrol over those carriers, protecting them from air
          attack.
     Check your Six: Watch your tail; literally, watch the six o'clock
          position of your aircraft.
     Colors: Silk neck scarf worn by fighter pilots.

          against jamming or "spoofing" by enemy ECM.
     Electric Jet: F-16 Falcon.
     Fangs Out: Seeking air-to-air victory in a dogfight, regardless of other
          dangers or considerations, such as worry about other enemy
          aircraft, your EMV, or even your altitude. See Knife Fight.
     FEBA: Forward Edge of the Battle Area. Older NATO abbreviation for the
          front line or battle line with the enemy.
     FitRep: Fitness Report. A report by commander that recommends
          subordinates for promotion (or not, as appropriate).
     FLOT: Forward Line of Troops. Current NATO abbreviation for the front
          line or battle line with the enemy.
     Flying a Desk: Staff or command job with no flying duties.
     Frisbee: Unofficial nickname of the F-19 Stealth Fighter.
     HUD: Head-Up Display. A large piece of glass mounted on the cockpit
          front arranged so a pilot can look forward through the glass. All
          crucial (i.e., "real time") information is projected onto the
          glass, so the pilot can watch the outside while getting detailed
          information. Some HUDs have become so complex they defeat their
          designed purpose (and are equipped with a "de-clutter" switch!).
     Knife Fight: Dogfight to the death - what happens when you go
          "fangs out." This situation is advantageous to low-speed, highly
          maneuverable planes and disadvantageous to higher speed but less
          maneuverable planes. However, either or both contestants can be
          surprised by other fighters and SAMs.
     ILS: Instrument Landing System. A device that receives signals from an
          airport and displays to the pilot his position in relationship to a
          hypothetical glide path.
     INS: Inertial Navigation System. A device that keeps track of an
          airplanes's position (using a gyroscope) and displays that position
          and a desired destination. There are many different types of INS
          systems; those which use cockpit CRT maps and HUD pointers are the
          most sophisticated.
     IR: Infrared. A portion of the electro-magnetic spectrum where the
          intensity of the signal is directly related to the heat of the
          object.
     Mike Mike: Military words for "mm", generally referring to 20 mm cannon
          shells. Ex: "Then i placed some Mike Mike right up his tail".
     MiG: Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau, which specializes in the design and
          construction of jet fighters for the Soviet Union. Often used as a
          generic name for all Soviet-bulit fighter aircraft (even though
          other bureaus contribute fighter designs).
     Niner Reference to the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile. The 9L version is known
          as the "Niner Lima", the 9M version used by the F-19 is a "Niner
          Mike".
                                                                     - 172 -

     Obsolescent: Outdated but not yet useless; not quite obsolete.
     Promo: Promotion.
     Pucker Factor: Level of fear (e.g., "When those 20 Flankers jumped us,
          the pucker factor sure went up!").
     Punch His Ticket: To shoot down an enemy fighter plane.
     Punch Out: Specifically to bail out using an ejection seat, but generally
          applied to a departure ("Let's punch out of here!").
     SAM: Surface-to-Air Missile.
     Sierra Hotel: Military expansion of the letters "SH", here an
          abbreviation for heated excrement. Curiously, the expression
          denotes admiration and excitement. For example, "Sierra Hotel, look
          at that guy smoke MiGs!".
     Skunk Works: Quasi-official nickname of the Lockhead plant in Burbank,
          California that designs and builds top-secret aircraft.
     Smoke: To destroy, as in "Smoked that MiG!". Originally from the smoke
          plume emitted by burning aircraft as they fall to earth.
     Star: As in, "getting your star." Refers to the much coveted promotion
          from Colonel to General, where your rank insignia is now a single
          gold star.
     VVI: Vertical Velocity Indicator. A gauge that indicates how fast a
          plane is ascending or decending.
     Whiskey Delta: Military expansion of the letters WD, which in turn
          refers to weakness in a certain male organ rarely discussed in
          polite company. The term is an especially derogatory and insulting
          description of a fighter pilot (e.g., "that Whiskey Delta couldn't
          even find his own airbase, much less hit it with a bomb.").
     Wing Weenie: Administrative staff officer attached to a fighter unit, but
          with no combat or flying duties. A mildly derogatory term.
     Zero-Zero: Nickname for the zero-zero type ejection seat. So named
          because in theory, a pilot can eject safely from a plane with zero
          speed and zero altitude (i.e., sitting on a runway).
                                                                     - 173 -

     Designer's Notes:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Concept:

        MicroProse's fame and reputation have come from flight simulators,
     especially the classic F-15 Strike Eagle, first published in 1984. Since
     that date we've released many novel and popular products (Silent
     Service, Pirates, Airborne Ranger), but only one combat flight
     simulator, Gunship, and that about a helicopter (the AH-64A Apache). In
     the meantime, flight simulators have suddenly become popular, with
     almost every software publisher scrambling onto the bandwagon.
        Clearly, it was time for us to create a new military aircraft
     simulator, a state-of-the-art product that showed what "flight simulator
     experts" could do. For this we selected the F-19 "Frisbee" Stealth
     Fighter. Although the plane is both conjectural and highly classified,
     it is the ideal subject for a one-man/one-plane/one-mission situation.
     Modern air attacks are usually a complex dance of many different
     machines, each with a unique specialty and role - the scouts, the
     electronic warfare escorts, the strike planes, the fighter cover, and
     the AWACS airborn controllers. The F-19 is the exception: it flies
     alone, relying on stealth and subtlety instead of brute force. not since
     1916 have fighter pilots gone off alone to duel the enemy. Now that
     bygone era of the lone wolf hero is possible again, in a very modern,
     high-tech environment

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Design:

     Our first "new generation" jet simulator appeared in late 1987,  for the
     Commodore C64/C128. Originally titled "Project: Stealth Fighter", it was
     an impressive, ground-breaking achievement for 8-bit, 1 MHz, 64K
     computers. However, the 3-D graphics technology in that simulator was
     customized to its limited environment. The 16-bit, 4.77 to 25 MHz
     computers with 384K or more required an entirely new programming
     approach. Our experience with earlier flight simulators, including
     Gunship, was a tremendous help in deciding what to do, and what not to
     do.
        When you look at a flight simulator, the first thing to check is the
     detail and fidelity of the "3-D" out-the-cockpit graphics. Many
     "simulators" use arcade-style sprite graphics. They move a picture of
     the object around the screen. There are two or three (or four, or
     whatever) sizes of each picture, to give the impression of depth; but
     it's still really in two-dimensional cardboard cutout sliding around the
     screen. In comparsion, a true simulator like F-19 Stealth Fighter has a
     data record for each object's dimensions, and then adjusts it for
     distance and viewing angle, as well as removing objects hidden behind
     others. We also add a scaling adjustment to compensate for the
     "coarseness" of a computer screen. This is because the human eye can see
     tiny forms and shapes that are rendered as a dot on screen. To achieve
     all this on a microcomputer you must make constant trade-offs between
     speed and detail.
        You'll notice that this program automatically adjusts itself to the
     speed of
                                                                     - 174 -
     your computer. Regardless of wheter your processor is a 4.77 MHz 8088 or
     a 25 MHz 80386, the simulation moves at the same real-time speed. The
     only changes are in the smoothness and detail of the 3-D out-the-cockpit
     graphics. You can even change the smoothness/detail tradeoffs we
     selected with the Detail Adjust key.
        It's quite possible to create a technically impressive and factually
     accurate simulation, that is nonetheless a turkey. We don't allow that
     at MicroProse. The experience of flying the simulation, the "game play"
     (if you insist on viewing this as a game) must be enjoyable and
     interesting. We spend a great deal of time on the "feel" of the flight
     controls, organizing the worlds you fly in, the changing radar
     environment, the skill of enemy pilots, enemy reaction times, and much
     more.
        All this realism in a flight simulator must still have a purpose. In
     our case, the purpose is playable, enjoyable situations. Who wants a
     simulator that kills you unless you've logged thousands of hours of
     flying? We want more than accurate missile ranges or realistic Paveway
     attack profiles. We also want an endless supply of new missions,
     situations, and opponents. We want the enemy to behave logically and
     rationally in these new situations. We want you to have new problems and
     new opportunities, with every mission. Further-more, we've willing to
     spend the time and effort needed. However, we try to make things easy to
     learn and use. After all, what good are fifty zillion software features
     if you can't find them? So we insisted on including maps and keyboard
     overlays.
        Some of our customers have asked for specific program data,
     especially scoring data. Unfortunately, while boardgames present this in
     simple tables or lists, we use more complicated techniques. In fact, the
     scoring logic is so complicated that we wrote a separate "scoring
     tester" program just to check it. But the objective of this complexity
     is simple: don't fly the plane for the maximum point score. Instead,
     imagine yourself a real pilot, in a real situation, and act accordingly.
     The scoring is like your CO, rewarding your good judgement, and pointing
     out your mistakes!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Design Team:

        Simulations such as F-19 Stealth Fighter require a large, talented
     creative team to produce. The 16-bit version was engineered by that
     now-famous team of Sid Meier (master of algorithms and data structures
     that recreate reality) and Andy Hollis (one of the hottest 3-D and
     assembly programmers in the nation).
        Sid's the founding father of MicroProse (along with President "Wild
     Bill" Stealey), and brings a veteran viewpoint of game programming and
     game design. A large number of features in this product started with Sid
     saying, "Wouldn't it be neat if..." The neat part is that Sid then goes
     and implements the code that very day!
        Andy is one of MicroProse's veterans, and has done fast, tight 3-D
     code before - in C64 Gunship, and then again in IBM Gunship. Each time
     Andy finds new ways to get more, faster, in less space. Andy isn't our
     only 3-D expert. For
                                                                     - 175 -
     example, he used some Scott Spanburg's secret and magical object logic,
     which Scott had just finished conjuring for another (future) MicroProse
     product. Andys a great fan of high speed anywhere: in computers and in
     cars (he races autocross in his spare time).
        Jim Synoski, creator of the original C64 Stealth Fighter, was dragged
     into this version to help out. He was nice about it, especially about
     all the things Sid changed! He worked with ace computer artist Max
     ("Maximum") Remington to create the entire preflight and postflight
     system. Even an "old guard" expert like Jim, veteran of many other
     MicroProse games, can be impressed (distressed?) by the complexity and
     detail involved in Briefings and Debriefings. The apparently limitless
     variety if IBM graphics modes (VGA, MCGA, EGA, CGA, Tandy and Hercules)
     doesn't help!
        The 3D databases for the four "worlds" were created by game designer
     Bruce Shelley and artist Max Remington. It was here that "Maximum" got
     his nickname. For a while every object he created went right to the data
     space maximum, causing something new to "blow" in Andy's code, like an
     engine overrevving too far. Fortunatly 3D graphic glitches are fairly
     obvious to a trained eye - all were spotted and eventually fixed.
     Bruce's job was more difficult. A veteran of many board wargame designs,
     he worked within the very complicated and often frustrating limitations
     of a microcomputer's data space layout. The remarkable fidelity of the
     data space world to the "real" world is a testament to his perseverence.
     Fortunately he was a good sport through it all, perhaps inspired by the
     7:00 AM basketball games in the warehouse with "Major Bill" and other
     B-ball fanatics within MicroProse.
        All this data and graphics takes up a lot of room. In fact, F-19
     Stealth Fighter on our development systems occupies about 5 megabytes
     (fifteen 360K floppy disks!). It's problems like these that David
     McKibbin was born to solve. His compression schemes "shrank" the code
     and data to its current size! Every time the disk drive loads something,
     it runs through a special "decompressor" that expands the code and/or
     data to "full size" in memory. This means you're getting a product that
     would otherwise require a hard disk and command a retail price well over
     $100. So David's saving you a lot of cash as well as making F-19
     commercially viable.
        The paper materials were conceived by designer Arnold Hendrick,
     author of this manual. Usually MicroProse's marketing department is
     concerned about the size, weight and cost of our manuals (not that it
     does any good, the manuals always go over budget). But for this product
     the word was, "go all out". Arnold took them at that, although they
     gulped hard when the page estimate jumped from 128 to 192! The rumor
     that marketing's office furniture was pawned to pay for the extra paper
     is entirely unfounded. Incidentally, the design, layout and artwork of
     the manual, maps and overlays were all done on computer with final
     output on Linotronic typesetters. In his alter ego as manager of the
     game design group, Arnold kibbitzed unmercifully about various aspects
     of the 
                                                                     - 176 -
     design. Surprisingly, Sid, Andy, Jim and Bruce even took him seriously
     (at times)
        Murray Taylor, 3-D artist extraordinaire, designed the basic "look"
     of this manual, executed the weapons illustrations, and did the six
     full-page computer pictures that grace these pages (OBS! not included in
     ASCII version.. sorry but it's quite hard to do em with ASCII "GRAPHIC"
     -* SNUSKBUSKE/DUAL CREW *-) How he finds time for the triathlon remains
     a mystery even within MicroProse.
        Barbara Bents did veoman (veowoman?) work with the technical
     drawings, maps and keyboard overlays. MicroProse uses state-of-the-art
     drafting and layout software on MacII's for many internal graphics.
     Barbara's designs, however, consistently went beyond the abilities of
     current postscript interpreters. Unfortunately, we didn't write the
     software... so when we phoned the creators they just said, "Oh, gee,
     sorry. You'll just have to do less complicated things!" The keyboard
     overlays were difficult for a different reason: we redesigned about as
     fast as she could redraw them on the Mac! For surviving these trails and
     tribulations, she wins MicroProse's competitive and coveted "most
     tolerant artist of the year" award.
        Everybody at MicroProse takes Ken Lagace for granted. He's the quiet,
     silver-haired gent who gave up teaching and performing professional
     classical music for a career as a computer sound composer, with scores
     of brilliant scores to his credit. You'll probably take him for granted
     too, since the sounds for F-19 Stealth Fighter fit right in!
        Finally, the QA (quality assurance) staff at MicroProse approached
     this product like all others: with the maniacal glee of a mad scientist!
     Al Roireau, Chris Taormino and Russ Cooney just love to find bugs, then
     torment the poor, exhausted programmers with multi-page bug reports. In
     fact, they enjoyed it so much they stayed late nights, then came in on
     Saturdays and Sundays, for weeks on end, for just that purpose. In fact
     they're still cackling over the airfield-in-the-ocean bug, or the 1500
     kts level flight bug, or... well, you get the idea. Unlike many software
     companies, at MicroProse QA really does have the final say for shipment.
     Until "Big Al" gives thumbs up, the product stays in testing and the
     programmers continue slaving over the bugs.

     Copy Protection:

        F-19 Stealth Fighter is protected from duplication in software, and
     throught the aircraft identification quiz. Responding to past critiques,
     we've changed our schemes, making them unobtrusive. You can copy files
     to and from hard disks normally. However, we have not removed software
     copy protection.
        The reason is simple: the tragic truth is that some people aren't as
     honest as you, the reader, who's purchased F-19 Stealth Fighter. The
     situation is much worse abroad, where organized piracy of American
     software is rampant in many nations. A substantial portion of your
     purchasing dollars go toward R&D on new and better simulations. You
     purchase helps support our future work on new and better simulations. In
     other words, by buying this product, you're investing in quality future
     products. Copy protection is an "insurance policy" that helps protect
     and maximize this investment.
                                                                     - 177 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Secrets & Politics:

        When creating simulations of military equipment that are partly or
     entirely classified, such as a stealth fighter, MicroProse has a
     standing policy: use only unclassified sources. Although we talk to real
     pilots and military personnel, we neither solicit nor use any classified
     information. Naturally, we must make some educated guessed. However, the
     amount of information available to the public is quite remarkable if you
     know where to look and how to interpret seemingly unrelated details. In
     the past our "guesses" have turned out correct more often than we
     imagined. One USAF pilot, a brigadier general, confessed to us his
     surprise at how close our C64 version was to an unspecified plane he'd
     worked with!
        Our selection of regions for game scenarios is not intended to convey
     a political viewpoint, or promote antipathy toward any nationally or
     race. Military forces are required to fight whomever their government
     says is the enemy (even other family members, in a civil war). In this
     simulation, as in all our products, political circumstances of the day
     dictate who is hostile to whom. In the late 1980s problems with Lybia,
     Iran, and the USSR loom large in America's war planning.
        In summary, military simulations like F-19 Stealth Fighter allow us
     to experience the vicarious thrills of combat flying without having to
     declear war on anyone, much less hurt anybody. We enjoyed creating F-19
     Stealth Fighter. We're sure you'll enjoy flying her.

     Further Reading:

        A wide variety of sources were consulted for this simulation. No
     single source gives specifics on aircraft tactics and weapons,
     especially as they apply to a hypothetical stealth fighter. Among the
     many books and magazines used, the following stand out as generally
     available and interesting reading:

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Books:

        Advanced Technology Warfare, by Friedman, Miller, Richardson,
     Gunston, Hoobs and Walmer, 1985, Salamander Books, London / Crown
     Publishers, New York. This book has a variety of interesting details
     about current and near future equipment and tactics, including various
     speculative designs for stealth fighters.
        Arsenal of Democracy, by Tom Gervasi, various editions in early
     1980s, Grove Press Inc., New York City. This volume, updated with II,
     and later III, is a detailed survey of all American defense systems.
     Although the author's intent was perhaps to horrify you with the cost,
     purpose, and occasional ineptitude in the systems described, the volume
     does have a variety of details and illustrations unavailable elsewhere.
        Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering, by Robert L. Shaw, 1985,
     Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland. This is the book on modern
     fighter tactics. Extremely detailed, technical, and specific, it puts
     all other books to shame. If you're serious about dogfighting with jets,
     put aside the glossy picture books and dig into this.
                                                                     - 178 -
        Modern Airborn Missiles, by Bill Gunston, 1983, Salamander Books,
     London / Arco, New York. This small, moderately priced volume is an
     excellent unified source of data on airborne missiles, including model
     histories that would otherwise require considerable digging. Unlike most
     volumes in the series, it has some very useful and specific data.
        Modern Weapons, Ray Bonds editor, 1985, Salamander Books, London /
     Crescent Books, New York. Of the innumerable Salamander books on modern
     military equipment (books which often copy sections from one other!),
     this volume stands out as a useful, concise source for many items.
        Modern Air Combat, Bill Gunston & Mike Spick, 1983, Salamander Books,
     London / Crescent Books, New York. This is the standard glossy "picture
     book" about modern air warfare. It is an excellent and entertaining
     introduction to the subjects, with lots of useful illustrations. If
     you're limited to just one book on contemporary air warfare, buy this
     one.
        Stealth Aircraft, Bill Sweetman, 1986, Motorbooks International,
     Osceola, Wisconsin. This book presents a design history of stealth
     aircraft technology since World War II, details on stealth construction
     techniques, and speculations on future stealth aircraft, including both
     the F-19 stealth fighter and the B-2 stealth bomber. The speculations
     here were very close to the design the USAF unveiled about the B-2 in
     1988.
        USAFE, by Michael Skinner, 1983, Presidio Press, Novato, California.
     This small book is full of photographs of the US Air Force in Europe
     (USAFE) and lots of pilot lingo. The author spent considerable time with
     combat pilots in Europe, and it shows. If you want to get into the
     spirit of military flying, this book encapsulates it very nicely.
        Zones of Conflict: an Atlas of Future Wars, by Keegan & Wheatcroft,
     1986, Simon and Schuster, New York City. This book provides many useful
     insights into the world's trouble spots, why they are troubled, and the
     resource of the various contestants. Unfortunately, the book is a bit
     too general, with little specific data.

     Periodical Publications:

        Aviation Week & Space Technology, published weekly by McGraw-Hill,
     New York City. This magazine is the premier source of information about
     the entire aerospace industry, including military programs. Anyone
     interested in large scale aviation operations, or in space programs,
     should subscribe. A variety of articles and reports first appeared here
     on stealth aircraft and stealth technology.
        Jane's Weapon Systems, published annually by Jane's Publishing
     Company Ltd, London. This expensive volume provides indispensible
     specifics on missiles, radars, and electronic equipment of all types and
     descriptions. In other words, it gives the details about the equipment
     on the weapons platform, an extremely important issue often overlooked
     in modern warfare. Like all Jane's, the information is limited to what
     the manufacturer and various national governments publish. However, due
     to the desire for overseas arms
                                                                     - 179 -
     sales, this data can be fairly extensive.
        Jane's All the World's Aircraft, published annually by Jane's
     Publishing Company Ltd, London. This is the standard volume on world
     aircraft, complete with performance statistics and model variants. Each
     aircraft is illustrated with both line drawings and photos. Specifics on
     electronic systems and armamentare sparse (see Jane's Weapons Systems
     for that).
        The Military Balance, published annually by International Institute
     for Strategic Studies, London. This moderately priced report is a gold
     mine of specific information about equipment and orders of battle for
     every nation in the world. No serious student of modern military affairs
     should be without it.
        Soviet Military Power, published annually by the US Department of
     Defense, in Washington DC. This propoganda document appears each year as
     part of DoD's publicity broadside for more and better weapons (not that
     America doesn't occasionally need them, mind you!). Although extremely
     general, it always reveals at least one new Soviet weapon system each
     year, as well as a variety of small but interesting facts.
        War Annual, by John Laffin, published annualy by Brassey's, London.
     This short volume is a compendium of news reports and public statements
     about any and all wars happening around the world. No less than 34
     different wars (including guerilla wars) are listed in the War Annual 2
     of 1987, with three to six pages of information on each. Although the
     data is slim, the volumes are an excellent continuing overview of
     current conflicts.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Maps:

        The Times Atlas of the World, 7th edition (1985), with maps by John
     Bartholomew & Sons, Edinburgh. This is, by far, the single best volume
     of topographical world maps currently available. Although the price is
     high, it's worth any number of less expensive volumes (we have five
     others, and none match this one).
        Defense Mapping Agency, Washington DC, produces land, sea, and
     aeronautical maps and charts for the military, and for various civilian
     agencies such as the National Ocean Service. The military maps available
     through the DMA vary from year to year with the whims of policy. Our
     practice is to purchase anything interesting every few years, since they
     do not maintain a back catalog (i.e., what they have now is usually
     unavailable a few years hence).
                                                                     - 180 -

                           Atari ST & Commodore Amiga

     F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER. GETTING STARTED.
     --------------------------------------

     Required Equipment:

        Please note that this simulation requires a minimum of 512 K of RAM. A
     colour monitor or television is required for the ST version.
        This simulation can be run entirely from the keyboard, with mouse and
     keyboard, or with joystick and keyboard. A joystick greatly improves the
     "feel" and realism, and is therefore strongly recommended.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Installation:

        The F-19 Stealth Fighter manual asks you to install the simulation
     onto back-up Floppy Disks. This is only necessary for IBM PC compatible
     versions. You do not need to install Atari ST or Commodore Amiga
     versions.
        Your pilot records will be automatically saved to disk A, provided
     that it is write-enable proir to loading.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Atari ST:

        Turn off your computer and remove all unnecessary peripherals. Insert
     A into the internal drive and switch on the computer. The program will
     auto-load. Please follow any on-screen prompts. (if you have an
     additional extra drive, disk B may be inserted into this drive, and will
     be automatically accessed by the computer when necessary).

     Commodore Amiga:

        Turn off your computer and remove all unnecessary peripherals. Insert
     disk A into the internal drive and switch on the computer. The program
     will auto-load. Please follow any on-screen prompts.

     WHAT IF MY GAME FAILS TO LOAD ?
     -------------------------------

        In the vast majority of cases a loading problem is not because of
     faulty software, but either an incorrect loading proceedure or a
     hardware fault.
        Please ensure that the loading instructions have been correctly
     executed. The commonest hardware failures are due to a misalignment of
     the heads in the disk drive. Such faults may be detected by loading the
     game on another computer.(Either use a friend's machine or ask the
     software store from which the game was purchased to test it).
        Alternatively, a virus may have transfered into your hardware from
     another piece of software. Pirated copies of games are an incredibly
     common source of viruses. It always pays to own original software.
        In the unlikely event of a software fault., please return the
     complete package, with receipt to the place of purchase. MicroProse
     regret that goods cannot be replaced unless bought from the company
     directly.
        If you have any difficulty whilst loading F-19, or need help whilst
     running the simulation, MicroProse will be happy to help you on the
     Helpline. Please ring (0666) 504399.

     FACT OR FICTION ?: THE DEVELOPMENT OF "F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER"
     ------------------------------------------------------------

     NEWSFLASH:

     From the department of Defense, Office of the Assistant Secretary
     (Public Affairs)

        November 10, 1988 (Washington D.C.): Today the U.S. Air Force
     announced the existence of an operational stealth fighter aircraft. This
     single seat, dual-engine jet was constructed by the Lockhead Corporation,
     built with bipartisan congressional support, it has been perational
     since 1983 with the 4450th Tactical Group, based on the Tonopah Airfield
     at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada.
        Technical specifications, possible missions, and operations have not
     been disclosed. However, design features and the use of A-7 trainers
     suggest that the plane is intended for clandestine reconnaissance, ground
     attack, and air-to-air ambushes. In short, the US Air Force's actual
     stealth fighter is amazingly similar to MicroProse's "F-19 Stealth
     Fighter" simulation, published for IMB PC compatible machines twelve
     months prior to the actual plane's disclosure. It is known that the Air
     Force uses the designation "F-117A" instead of "F-19".

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Stealth Fighter:

     1978:          Lockheed receives the program "go ahead" from the U.S
                    Department of Defense
     1981:          Lockheed test-flies the new Stealth Fighter.
     1983:          The U.S. Air Force accepts delivery of the first fighters
                    and the 4450th TG becomes an operational unit.
     1986:          A fatal Stealth Fighter crash in Bakersfield, California
                    is hushed up by the Air Force before the news media
                    discovers what happened.
     1987:          MicroProse first publishes a Stealth Fighter computer
                    simulation for IBM PC compatible machines.
     1988:          The U.S. Air Force admits that Stealth Fighters have been
                    operational for the last five years.
     1989:          MicroProse begin work in the UK an "F-19 Stealth Fighter"
                    for Atari ST and Commodore Amiga machines. The decision
                    is taken to reatin the original characteristics of
                    MicroProse's "F-19 Stealth Fighter", as a testament on
                    the accuracy of MicroProse's research, and to enhance the
                    simulation by including an option to see the actual
                    F-117A plane in external 3-D views.
     1990:          Atari St and Commodore Amiga versions are released.

     ADDITIONAL FEATURES for ATARI ST and COMMODORE AMIGA VERSIONS
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     Pre-Flight Options
     ------------------
     
        Method of Control:
        ------------------
        Once the game has loaded, you will be asked to select your method of
     control, by pressing one of the numeric keys on the keyboard, as
     follows;

               1. Mouse
               2. Joystick
               3. Keyboard

        The Pilot Roster:
        -----------------
        The original pilot roster will be automatically updated after each
     mission, provided that you have write-enabled your disk A. You do not
     have to "install" the simulation onto back-up Floppy Disks.

        Intelligence Briefing:
        ----------------------
        Move the Controller up and down the list of options to highlight one,
     and press the Selector to toggle that option on and off.
        To receive specific data on an item displayed on the map, move the
     Controller over that item on the map.

        External Aircraft Views:
        ------------------------
        As explained on the previous page, MicroProse's Software Engineers
     have added the option to view your plane in Slot View, Chase Plane,
     Side View, Tacti View or Inverse Tacti View, as either the F-19 or
     F-117A.
        Your choice of plane is made immediately after the Mission Briefing,
     and before choosing the armaments for your mission.

        In-Flight:
        ----------
        The star system has been accurately mapped and is visible during
     night missions. It appears on screen as it would according to your

                              Simulation Controls:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Pause (press any key to un-pause)  Alt and 'p' key
     "Boss" (hides simulation)          Alt and 'b' key
     Quit                               Alt and 'q' key
     Resupply (training only)           Alt and 'r' key
     Change missions to training        Alt and 't' key

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Keyboard Control Stick Adjust           'Ins' key
     keybd sensitivity 3 = keypress causes large stick movement
     keybd sensitivity 2 = keypress causes moderate stick movement (default)
     keybd sensitivity 1 = keypress causes small stick movement

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Volume Adjust (4 sound levels)          Alt and 'v' key
     Sound level 3 = all sounds
     Sound level 2 = all sounds except engine background noise (default)
     Sound level 1 = firing and explosions only (no warning sounds)
     Sound level 0 = no sound

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Detail Adjust (2 levels)                Alt and 'd' key
     detail level 1 = maximum detail on Tactical and Track Cam displays
     detail level 0 = normal detail on Tactical and Track Cam displays

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Slew Controls (4 directions)
     slew north (training only)         Alt and 'i' key
     slew west (training only)          Alt and 'j' key
     slew south (training only)         Alt and 'k' key
     slew east (training only)          Alt and 'l' key

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Notes on Simulation Controls:
     -----------------------------

        Change Mission to Training (Alt and 't' key) tapping this key
     converts your current mission into a training mission. This means that
     henceforth enemy weapons do no damage. Tapping Alt 't' again exits
     training.
        Once a mission is converted to training you cannot score any points
     for it, even if you toggle training off again. However, the slew
     controls and resupply key only function when training is active.
        Keyboard Control Stick Adjust ('Ins' key) This regulates the amount
     of control stick movement a keypress causes. We recommend you use this
     key frequently when flying, and always set the sensitivity to "1" on
     your final approach to landing.
        Detail Adjust (Alt and 'd' key) The detail displayed on the Tactical
     and Track Cam displays may be altered from normal (detail level = 0) to
     maximum (detail level = 1). The tactical display shows all the 16 km
     grid lines at maximum detail, and the Track Cam update will appear to
     be smoother.
        Slew (Alt and 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l' keys) These keys function only in
     training. Tapping the key "teleports" your aircraft in that direction.
     The distance you're "teleported" varies with the current Zoom/Unzoom
     scale pf the satellite/radar map. Slew is an excellent way to check out
     the region whilst training.

                                Tips to Pilots:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        When flying a mission don't except the enemy to act randomly or
     stupidly. They have a surprising amount of intelligence. Fighters and
     AWACS planes patrol to cover radar weak spots, or protect especially
     important areas.
        If you're spotted, interceptors are scrambled and vectored to your
     last known location. If they lose sight of your F-19, they investigate
     your last known position, but will eventually give up and go home. In
     addition, enemy aircraft and radar operators become more aggressive,
     sometimes even frantic, after they have repeated sightings, or have
     suffered a few losses.
        The best way to get all the trouble you can handle is to engage
     "regular" or better enemies, and to loiter about the scene of a battle.
     Conversely, the best way to avoid troubles is to disappear from sight as
     quickly as possible. In general, trying to take on the entire enemy
     defense system with one F-19 is very unwise!

                                    MEDALS:
     ************************************************************************

     Airman's Medal:
     This medal is commonly awarded for heroism that involves the voluntary
     risk of life under conditions other than those of conflict with an
     opposing armed force.

     Distinguished Flying Cross:
     This medal is awarded for heroism or extraordinary achievement while
     participating in aerial flight, including valorious performance in
     combat.

     The Silver Star:
     This medal is awarded for gallantry in action against opposing armed
     forces. The large gold star design has a tiny silver star in the center,
     surrounded by a laurel-wreath design.

     The Air Force Cross:
     This medal is awarded for extraordinary heroism in connection with
     military operations against an opposing armed force. It is the second
     highest combat decoration available to US Air Force pilots.

     The Congressional Medal of Honor is America's highest military
     decoration. According to the United States Department of Defense, it is
     warded for "conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity of the risk of life,
     above and beyond the call of duty, in action involving actual conflict
     with an opposing armed force".

     The Purple Heart:
     This medal is awarded to servicemen who are injured or killed as a result
     of an act by an opposing armed force. Typically the injury must be
     serious enough to require attention at a base hospital, often with
     reduced duties or discharge afterward.
ATTACK TECHNIQUES : --------------------------------------------------------
MISSILES : -----------------------------------------------------------------
MISSILE RANGES:The maximum range of a missile depends not only on its motor,
but your plane's  speed at launch  and the direction  of enemy movement. The
initial "lock-on" range  corresponds to missile  maximum range if  you're at
maximum speed. However, if you're moving slower the missile may not get that
extra boost needed to reach the target.

A much more important consideration is the enemy's flight path.If the target
plane is  flying toward you, even a maximum  range launch is likely to reach
him.However, if the target plane is flying away the missie has a long "stern
chase" ahead of it. In such a situation you should wait until the oval turns
red before launching.

RADAR GUIDED MISSILES:Your AIM-120 AMRAAM missile is one of the best medium-
range weapons in the world.It is the only "fire and forget" radar-guided mis
sile in American inventory.It has sufficient circuitry to penetrate most de-
fenses, and sufficient  maneuverability to chase  down most fighters, not to
mention nailing bombers and transports.Because the AIM-120 has greater range
than the Sidewinder (32 km -> 17 km),pilots typically open fire with the AIM
120,then switch to Sidewinders if any enemy aircraft  survive to that range.

IR GUIDED MISSILES: The short-range  AIM-9M  Sidewinder is probably the best
dogfighting  missile in the world. It is more maneuverable  than the AMRAAM,
giving it a better chance of "hanging on" to a twisting, turning target. The
most advantageous firing position for the Sidewinder is up the enemy's tail-
pipes. The next  best position  is from above, diving down onto the top (hot
side) of the enemy plane.The third best position is directly into the enemys
nose. Shots against the enemy as it crosses in front of you,or at its under-
side (the cold side) have very little chance of hitting.The main weakness of
the Sidewinder is its limited range.

TECHNIQUE: When firing a missile, always remember to (1) open the bay doors,
and (2) wait for the lock-on. If you don't wait for the target box to become
oval-shaped, you're firing without a lock-on,and will almost certainly miss.
Then look at your airspeed.If you're moving fast (around 500kts) or the tar-
get is closing,a maximum range lock-on shot`ll probably hit. However,if your
speed is low or the target flying away  you should wait until the range clo-
ses,ideally until the oval turns red.

Missile accuracy doesn't take into account enemy defensive equipment or eva-
sive maneuvering. First line and elite fighter aircraft may prove more diff-
icult to hit. Although  the "Mainstay" AEW&C craft  maneuvers poorly, it has
superior  defensive equipment. You may find  that guns are necessary against
Mainstays flown by a capable crew.

FIRING ATTITUDE : Also remember that AAMs,like other missiles,will fall 300'
to 400' before their motor is powerful enough to guide them away to the tar-
get.Until then the  missile has your speed  and VVI. If you're diving at the
ground,the missile may slam into the ground before it can fly away.Firing in
a tight turn, or while inverted,can cause the missile to tumble as it leaves
the weapons bay. Best method is to fire only when you're level + above 500'.

TARGET DISCRIMINATION : Sidewinders and AMRAAMs always home on the most pro-
minent target, which is usually the nearest.They will do so even if you were
tracking someone else. In Cold  War and Limited War, beware of  this limited
"brainpower" in your missiles.You may be tracking a primary / secondary tar-
get,fire a missile, and then discover it goes for one of the fighter escorts
that happens to be closer!

NOTES : Your F-19 uses a tracking  camera instead of weapon guidance radars.
This system "downloads" appropriate launch parameters to the AIM-120 AMRAAM.
Although the AIM-120 itself uses radar,the set switches on  when the missile
is launched. As a result, missile  targeting does not  increase your EMV. Of
course,opening the bay doors to fire does increase your EMV.A skillful stea-
lth pilot only opens the bay doors just before launch, or during a dogfight.

GUNS : ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jet aircraft travel so quickly that conventional machine guns/cannons cannot
fire fast enough to guarantee a hit: a plane could literally fly between the
shells. Therefore,modern aircraft cannon are either a group of guns (such as
the twin 23mm  cannons in  many Russian MiGs) or  a multi-barrel gatling gun
(such as the six-barrel 20mm M61A1 on  most American jets). Cannons are used
because they fire explosive shells (machine guns fire less destructive solid
lead slugs).Small 20mm to 30mm cannons are used because large weapons cannot
fire fast enough. Aircraft cannons have an effective range of 0.5 to 3 km, a
maximum range of 6 kilometers. Inside  0.5 kilometers there is a significant
danger that a piece from a disintegrating target might hit you.

THE HISTORICAL GUNSIGHT: Your F-19 has the most modern and advanced gunsight
available:a "historical" gunsight with automatic laser rangefinder.In normal
operation this gunsight "assumes" you are firing at maximum range (6 km).Ho-
wever,if your tracking box is on a closer target, that shorter range is used
instead for gunsight calculations. The gunsight computer constantly calcula-
tes range,flight path,and ballistics for you.It then displays where your sh-
ells would be if they  were hitting the target now. The gunsight continually
calculates firing, delays the appropriate time and display potential hits as
they would occur.Therefore,the sight is "assuming" that you fired at the cor
rect time in the past (hence the term "historical" gunsight).

ANTICIPATION FIRING : It takes about 2 seconds for M61A1 20mm shells to tra-
vel the maximum 6 kilometer range. Therefore, to hit a target you must judge
the speed at which the target and your sight converge. You should fire about
2 sec.  before they meet.If the range is less than 6 km, wait a little less.
For example,at 3 km wait until target and sight are one second apart; at 1.5
km wait until target and sight are a half second apart,etc. You can use this
sight like an old fashioned predicting sight.That is,wait until the sight is
on the target,then shoot. But at 6 km  range you'll  have to hope the target
stays on the same course for 2 secs to insure a hit. Airplane targets aren't
always so obliging! In short,the key to using a historical gunsight is anti-
cipation.Don't wait for the sight to reach the target.Instead,learn to anti-
cipate the meeting of sight and target,then shoot ahead of time.

PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS : Although the maximum range of your M61A1 20mm Vul-
can cannon is 6 km,this is not the recommended engagement range.At ranges be
yond 3 km  accuracy falls off  considerably. Beware of firing at ranges less
than 0.5 km. If the enemy is closer, you could be hit by pieces of wreckage.
Your 20mm cannon has a large ammunition supply,but the huge rate of fire me-
ans it goes quickly.Fire short bursts instead of long ones,especially again-
st aircraft."Hosing down" a target is extremely wasteful.If the shot is that
difficult to achieve, you're crazy to waste ammo on it. In air combat cannon
shots are usually  very good or very bad, with very few  intermediate cases.
NOTES : The historical gunsight requires conscious "retraining" to use well,
since it doesn't require you to "place the sight on the target".However,this
weakness is more than compensated for by the advantages of anticipation fir-
ing.The sight allows you to fire sooner, and more accurately, than any other
sight in existence. The historial gunsight is the device of choice among "in
the know" fighter jocks. The gunsight on this model uses a laser rangefinder
slaved to the tracking camera,rather than the traditional ranging radar.This
means you can use your gun without increasing your EMV.

AIR-TO-AIR DUELS : ---------------------------------------------------------
THE AMBUSH : ---------------------------------------------------------------
Best way to start air-to-air combat is to surprise your opponent. Enemy air-
craft have only forward-facing radars(except the Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C).The
best way to ambush an  enemy plane is  to slide up behind him. Traditionally
fighter pilots prefer to attack from above.This gives them an energy advant-
age in any dogfight.However,missile tactics + the importance of secrecy make
height advantage less valuable for a stealth pilot. Gaining height makes you
visible to enemy radar,which in turn will certainly warn your targets.There-
fore,approaching low and from behind is often wiser.Only if your missile at-
tacks fail and the enemy discovers  you should you begin to seek an altitude
advantage.If you're surprised or "bounced"(attacked from above) by the enemy
immediately look for incoming  missiles + take appropriate defensive action.
Missiles arrive faster than aircraft,and therefore must be avoided first.On-
ly then can you begin dogfighting or attempt to escape.

THE MISSILE EXCHANGE : -----------------------------------------------------
Often an air-to-air battle starts because the  enemy has discovered you, and
vectors fighters in your direction.The result,quite frequently,is a head-to-
head face-off,you against him.In this westernstyle showdown each side starts
with an exchange of long- to medium-ranged radar missiles.Be prepared to de-
coy,jam,and possibly chaff the "incoming".Once your radar missile is away,sw
itch to an AIM-9M Sidewinder.You may get a second closerange missile shot if
the AMRAAM fails.Scoring with a head-to-head cannon shot is much more diffi-
cult,and not worth the ammo unless either (a) you're out of missiles, or (b)
you're an incredibly good marksman.Naturally,if you can get off a second mis
sile shot,so can the enemy if he carries  second-generation IR missiles (the
AA-8 or AA-10 IR version).These nasties show up frequently on MiG-29s and Su
27s,but aren't unknown on other craft flown by Veteran or Elite pilots.

THE EARLY TURN : -----------------------------------------------------------
One of the most difficult,but most useful tactics in a head-to-head match is
making an early turn. This is a maneuver where  you make a tight 180 degrees
turn so that you come out of the turn already  closing on the incoming MiG's
tail.Against inexperienced pilots this trick`s easy,since greenhorns usually
keep boring in,hoping for a cannon shot,and only thinking about a turn after
they've passed you.Against vets an early turn requires fine timing.If you tu
rn more than a sec or two ahead  of the enemy you're  just telegraphing your
intentions.If you wait too long,you get no advantage at all.

ENEMY MISSILES : -----------------------------------------------------------
RADAR-HOMING AAMS : The  Russian AA-10 Alamo  is a "fire and forget" missile
just like your AIM-120 AMRAAM.All other Russian radar-guided weapons are se-
mi-active homers.Here the launching aircarft must continue to paint you with
its radar -the missile homes on the "paint".You avoid radar-homing AAMs just
like SAMs.That is,use reduced EMV,ECM jamming + ultimately chaff. Decoys can
be very effective.Note that the MiG-25 and MiG-31 carry extremely longranged
radar AAMs. Low EMV,ECM and decoy tactics  are especially  effective against
these weapons.Consider yourself fortunate that none of the Iranian F-14s ha-
ve operational Phoenix missiles.These long-range killers are especially dif-
ficult to evade.

INFRARED (IR) HOMING AAMS :All IR homing AAMs are "fire and forget" weapons.
Of these the AA-8 is the most dangerous because of  its second generation IR
seeker and great maneuverability. If enemy  MiGs/Sukhois close to AA-8 range
(8 km) you're often in trouble. Techniques to evade  IR AAMs are the same as
those used against IR SAMs. That is, use the IR jammer at long range, flares
at short range.The decoy also works. In practice,many IR homers are fired at
short ranges  during a dogfight. This means that you've got to leap onto the
IR jammer when you get a launch warning, then  dodge out of the missile's 45
degree field of view immediately. At dogfighting ranges missile flight times
are very short ! If this fails, or you  delay too long, the missile approach
klaxon will go off. Now you've got bare seconds to react: dump a flare imme-
diately and dodge,or you're history. One nice thing about IRAAMs is that the
older AA-2,AA-6 and AA-7 designs  all use first generation seekers.The enemy
must get on your tail before these  missiles lock on. Keep him off your tail
and you avoid this entire  class of weaponry. Of course, doing that requires
dogfighting skills.

DOGFIGHTING : --------------------------------------------------------------
The essential rule in dogfighting is to get on the enemy's tail. On all figh
ter aircraft,guns and missile guidance  systems only face forward. If you're
on the enemy's tail,you can shoot and he can`t. If you can't get on his tail
at least try to place his aircraft ahead  of you as much as possible, so you
have the maximum number of firing opportunities. Maintaining higher speed or
altitude is valuable in a dogfight. A plane slower  and lower can only dodge
attacks.A plane faster or higher can attack or  retreat as desired. Having a
higher  speed or altitude is termed  the "energy advantage". If the enemy is
behind you, there are various classic escape maneuvers : Turning Inside, the
Scissors, the Immelmann,the Split-S,and the Yo-Yo. Not only should you learn
them, but also learn to recognize these maneuvers so you can apply the appro
priate counter-maneuver.

TURNING INSIDE : The simplest solution to  an enemy plane  coming up  behind
you is -turn toward him (i.e.,turn in the  direction of the enemy aircraft).
If you're turning faster than he, you'll gradually circle  around + get onto
his tail.This kind of a "turn match" is frequently  seen when greenhorns dog
fight.Of course,if the enemy is turning  faster than you, he will eventually
come around behind you. If this  happens try something else immediately. The
longer you wait the worse it gets, until he lines up a shot  and toasts you.

SCISSORS : A more complex way to out-turn an  enemy aircraft is the scissors
maneuver.Begin a turn toward him, but once he begins to turn with you,quick-
ly roll over to turn in the other direction. This opens the scissors. As the
enemy realizes you've turned  away + turns toward you again, you reverse the
procedure and roll back toward him again. If your turns were quicker + tigh-
ter than his,and/or you're  a slower plane, he will eventually pass in front
of you. This allows you  to get onto his tail. Novice pilots  trying to turn
with you can be lured into a  scissors  with ease. Even if their planes turn
better, their slow reactions to  each scissor opening and closing`ll quickly
give you the edge. More experienced enemies may avoid this tactic by antici-
pating your next turn and blasting  you (if they're less maneuverable),or by
pulling up and over in a yo-yo (if they're faster).

IMMELMANN TURN : This maneuver is an excellent way  to reverse direction qu-
ickly.First you perform a halfloop to reverse direction, then a half roll to
right your  aircraft. If an  enemy aircraft  is behind you, an Immelmann can
bring you nose-to-nose with him. The original Immelmann,a German WWI fighter
pilot,reputedly rolled while vertical, allowing him to finish the loop in wh
atever direction he desired. He still finished the half-loop inverted - it's
aerodynamically more efficient that way. Note that an Immelmann gives you an
altitude gain but costs speed, since a  half-loop upward slows you down sig-
nificantly.

SPLIT-S TURN : This maneuver complements the Immelmann. Begin by rolling in-
verted,then pull the stick back to half-loop downward. Many pilots begin the
loop before the roll is completed,rolling the plane while looping. The split
S causes you to lose considerable altitude, so it's often wise to reduce thr
ottle and/or use speed brakes to minimize altitude loss. The Split-S comple-
ments the Immelmann because you gain speed and lose altitude. Unwary fighter
pilots have sometimes tried to  Split-S into or  away from the enemy without
remembering their  altitude. Result can be a Split-S  right into the ground!

YO-YO TURN : This maneuver is used  mainly by higher speed jets against slo-
wer opponents.Therefore the relatively  slow F-19 has little occasion to use
it dogfighting. However, you may see enemy MiGs  attempting it against you !
This turn also requires excellent cockpitvisibility, something that both the
F-19 and early MiGs lack.In a Yo-Yo turn you  climb and roll toward the ene-
my -until he's visible out the top of  your canopy. Then pull over into dive
while still turning. During the dive you roll the plane to help line up your
shot.Very often you will take that shot  while inverted. Don't let it bother
you.Because a YoYo requires good spacial perception, first practice it using
the Slot View (if alone) or  Tacti  View (if you've got a target). In combat
conditions  switching to a wide  angle view is extremely  helpful in pulling
the HUD around onto the enemy after you  come over the top. Then you can swi-
tch back to normal view again. In effect a Yo-Yo plane makes a very big turn
in three dimensions. Most of the turn radius is "consumed" with the climbing
and diving,allowing a faster plane  to travel further and turn wider,yet st-
ill come out on the tail of the more maneuverable plane. American F4 Phantom
pilots used the maneuver  with great success  against slower but more maneu-
verable MiG21s over North Vietnam during the Vietnam war. Note that the best
defense against a Yo-Yo is to  reverse your turn, or to use the third dimen-
sion yourself,usually by going into a Split-S).

ENEMY GUNS : ---------------------------------------------------------------
The enemy has cannons equivalent to yours in range and power. However,the en
emy still uses old predicting gunsights. This means they are virtually requi
red to get behind you before they  can make a good shot. In addition,all but
the most elite pilots will be slow to fire, since they must place the gunsi-
ght on the target and keep it there to score a hit. If you sense the enemy`s
behind you and ready to fire cannons,"jinking" (small  violent moves in ran-
dom directions) can throw  off his aim. Finally, Russian-built aircraft with
the older GSh-23 cannon  may not always hit, since the lower volume of fire-
power increases the chances  of you "flying between the shells" and escaping
serious injury. Don't rely on this! Not every 23mm shell is  an unlucky one!

PART 4	MISSION BRIEFINGS : ------------------------------------------------
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT : ------------------------------------------------------
Rules of Engagement(ROE) outline what targets a pilot can and cannot attack.
In an age of nuclear weapons  unrestricted warfare  would destroy the planet
within 24 hours.Therefore,all wars are limited to some degree. If warfare is
limited to just a local area with specific goals,ROEs are much more restric-
tive.If an official state of war does not exist then the rules will be extr-
emely restrictive.In stealth missions,ROEs also determine what "exposure" of
your aircraft is allowed. In cold and limited war situations it is important
that the enemy not know exactly who or what performed the attack.This allows
the politicians to say whatever they want.

COLD WAR SITUATIONS : ------------------------------------------------------
ROE : You may attack and destroy a target only if it`s specifically required
by your mission orders.You may engage other targets only if they fire first,
or if they have spotted your plane.The mission is completely clandestine.You
must avoid detection,especially visual detection by enemy aircraft.Enemy air
or ground forces that do detect you should be destroyed,to prevent embarass-
ing disclosures.Neutrals and civilians must be considered friendlies,and ab-
ove all you should avoid detection by neutral aircraft and radars.Background
Notes: In cold war situations the State Department must have deniability for
every mission. If the mission is successful and the  political climate seems
good,the USA may claim credit for the deed. In other cases, however, America
may not wish to attach its name to the action.You are warned when enemy rad-
ar returns are  good enough to  spot your craft, or when enemy aircraft come
close enough to visually identify you. These enemies should be destroyed,al-
though the effort can  be counterproductive if the  attack generates lots of
additional sightings! Gratuitous  or wanton destruction of all other targets
is very bad in cold war.Hitting targets of value to the civilian sector,such
as bridges,oil wells and tanks,refineries,etc.,is especially bad.Your record
will rapidly accumulate black marks if you  act like "Rambo" during the Cold
War.After all,Rambo is fiction,this is reality!

LIMITED WAR SITUATIONS : ---------------------------------------------------
ROE : You will engage, attack, and destroy all targets specifically required
by your orders.In addition,all other targets with active weaponry(i.e.,which
could fire on your craft) may be attacked.You may engage these military tar-
gets even if they haven't seen you yet.You may never attack non-military tar
gets unless so required by orders. Neutrals must be considered friendlies at
all times,and in addition you should avoid detection by neutral aircraft and
radars at all costs.Background Notes:In limited war the State Department may
require deniability,since American aid to the contestants may need to be sec
ret.However,since there is a war, and military targets get destroyed in war,
you can attack military targets of opportunity and  be rewarded (rather than
penalized) for your efforts.However,hitting noncombatant targets of value to
the civilian sector (unless ordered to) is forbidden.

CONVENTIONAL WAR SITUATIONS : ----------------------------------------------
ROE : You`ll engage, attack,and destroy all targets specifically required by
your orders. In addition,any and all other targets in enemy territory may be
attacked,including civilian targets.If able to select additional targets,se-
lect those with immediate military capability first.Neutrals must be consid-
ered friendlies at all times, and in addition you should avoid  detection by
neutral aircraft and radars at all costs.Background Notes: In a conventional
war you are allowed unrestricted conventional attacks on enemy territory.Th-
is includes civilian targets formerly forbidden.However,targets with immedi-
ate military capability are more important.Therefore,destroying enemy aircr-
aft,airbases,SAMs,radars,depots,headquarters,etc.,gives more reward than br-
idges,oil refineries,oil wells and platforms,etc., whose importance is long-
term.This is because even conventional wars are  fought for short-term goals
(such as the Grenada invasion in 1983,or the Falkland Islands campaign of 19
84).However,from a pilot's  point of view,conventional  war is "fun" because
anything in enemy territory is fair game.Of course, the disadvantage is that
the enemy are prepared and alert for intruders.

ONC MAP COORDINATES : ------------------------------------------------------
ONC maps use the standard USArmy military grid system for locating positions
anywhere on the globe.The maps are divided into large squares.Each square is
identified by a two-letter code,such as WX,JC,etc.Within each square are sm-
aller rows and columns,ruled into smaller squares. These smaller squares are
identified by a column and row number from 0 to 9. Following the "read right
and up" rule,the column number appears first,then the row number.This is the
same as basic algebra,where the "x" horizontal value is given first,then the
"y" vertical value.For example,coordinate JC79 means large map square JC,co-
lumn 7,row 9.

MISSIONS : -----------------------------------------------------------------
AIR-AIR MISSIONS : ---------------------------------------------------------
SELECTING ARMAMENTS : In limited or conventional war situations the AIM-120A
AMRAAM is the missile of choice. You can lob these at enemies from a full 30
km range.If you're firing at a plane with close escorts,space the shots 5 to
10 seconds apart (the higher their altitude,the longer the spacing). This is
because a burning,exploding plane is a prominent target to the missile's se-
eker.If your missiles arrive right behind one another,those following may ho
me on the plane hit by the first. Worse,the terminal homing of the AMRAAM is
somewhat questionable-it tends to take the closest target at the time,rather
than the target you  originally designated ! Therefore, when shooting into a
group you can't count on which plane will be hit.Finally,if the enemy is ve-
teran or elite,don't be surprised if  the enemy manages to  outmaneuver your
missile by turning inside it.In cold war,guns are the weapons of choice.With
these you can insure the proper target`s hit,and no others.Unfortunately,get
ting close enough for a shot may  reveal your presence. A good compromise is
the AIM-9M Sidewinder,a fast-turning close-in dogfighting missile.It's usua-
lly easy to line up a 5 to 8 km shot,where the Sidewinder has a clear run at
the target and nobody else is likely to get in the way.

AMBUSHING A LEADER : Here an important personage is travelling by plane;your
job is to make sure he doesn't arrive!The plane takes off about the same ti-
me as your own.Remember that his plane is NOT the flashing dot on the satel-
lite/radar map (on your left-side cockpit CRT).That is his destination.Alth-
ough it's possible  to just fly to his  destination and wait, roving fighter
patrols or local air defenses eventually will spot you. In general,the wiser
approach is to find the best way to "sneak through" enemy patrols + SAM rad-
ars to intercept him en route. In limited/conventional war you can take down
his plane and escort with AMRAAMs.In a cold war situation you'll need to cl-
ose for a clean Sidewinder or gun shot.Remember, though, that if the fighter
escorts get a visual  ID on your plane you must zap them too. If your attack
location is well away from any ground radars or MainstayAEW&C planes,you can
attack from above, hit your man, drop a decoy to confuse them, and zoom away
with maximum speed at low altitude.

INTERCEPTING TERRORISTS OR COMMANDOS : In this  mission you know a transport
plane,accompanied by fighters,`ll head for friendly territory.Your objective
is to eliminate them before they arrive.The problem is, you don't know their
destination.As you take off,watch the enemy aircraft carefully.Circle around
a bit,observing their course until you can guess their objective.Once you kn
ow their goal, it's easy to pick a nice quiet spot to ambush them. Often you
can stay in friendly territory all the way!Properly executed,this mission is
a nice,easy milk run.

ELIMINATING A FIGHTER PATROL : Enemy fighter  patrols have a  nasty habit of
lurking near their own air defense systems,and/or being supported by Mainst-
ay AEW&C planes.Going in after them can cause quite a battle.One trick to a-
void the mess is to publicize your presence in a nearby area.You should pick
an area with little / no SAM coverage,and with no nearby airbases.If you can
lure the fighterpatrol to you,at this spot,the battle may be much easier.The
typical way to accomplish the lure is to raise your EMV (by flying high,tur-
ning on the ECM,and opening the bay doors). If that doesn't work, clobbering
a thing or two on the ground may catch  their interest. Once you've "dangled
the lure",it's wise to take a low profile again, so you can ambush the enemy
fighters as they arrive. As in many other aspects of modern warfare, getting
the first shot is a big advantage.

DESTROYING A RECON BOMBER : In most  cases you must  chase an enemy plane on
its way home.Catch + attack him as quickly as possible.The longer you delay,
the closer  he gets to SAM cover  and fighter aid. This is one mission where
climbing to a higher altitude can be rewarding-you travel faster, farther at
high altitude than low.Of course,don't go so high that you wake up the enemy
and attract lots of fighters and missiles.

ATTACKING A CRUISE MISSILE : These aircraft are most unobliging targets.They
cruise around deep behind their own lines,guarded by SAMs and closely escor-
ted by fighters. Given the defenses,attacking these planes is like hitting a
ground target.You need to sneak or punch your way through defenses,elude co-
unterattacks,and blast the primary,just like a strike mission.

TAKING DOWN THE MAINSTAY : The Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C plane is the most dif-
ficult aircraft target.Sooner or later its radar will see you,forcing you to
fight through fighters + SAMs to reach it. Make your approach as stealthy as
possible: it postpones this hour of reckoning. Destroying one or two crucial
SAM radar sites on your way in can be useful -it opens a radar-free corridor
to the target, and at the same time may draw off enemy interceptors, perhaps
even some of the Mainstay's fighter escort.

STRIKE MISSIONS : ----------------------------------------------------------
CHOOSING YOUR WEAPONS : Selecting armaments for ground attacks is always di-
fficult.The favorite weapon is the AGM-65D Maverick missile. It's your long-
est-ranged ground attack weapon (30 km;the Harpoon fires farther but is only
good against warships).The Maverick's also an accurate "fire and forget" wea
pon.Its weakness is that one missile can't always do the job.Fortunately,Ma-
vericks are just fine against radar installations. Most pilots carry as many
as they can afford, and fear the day when the crew chief  tells them no more
are available.Choosing between laserguided bombs,retarded bombs,and freefall
bombs is often a matter of personal preference.Many times more than one wea-
pon will do the job,so you can pick a type whose attack run suits your style
Other times you may be forced  to use a certain weapon  because nothing else
does the job right.When choosing weapons,don't expect much from a weapon ra-
ted C or D against a target.Scoring a hit with such always requires a lot of
luck.Certainly don't rely on such to take out your primary target.Weapons ra
ted A or B can be relied upon,provided you deliver them accurately.

SECRET AIRSTRIPS : Dropping off or picking up items deep behind enemy terri-
tory seems rather straightforward. After all, you don't have to fly into SAM
batteries or go head-to-head with fighter patrols.Instead, a secret airstrip
challenges your flying skill.You must manage a landing without an ILS to gu-
ide you.Worse,the strip is only half the length of a normal runway. You must
land gently,at low speed (under 160 kts, preferably), and touchdown near the
start.Otherwise you'll roll off the other end + crash!To make matters worse,
the strip's lights are only on for limited time. Make a note of the time the
lights go off,then periodically check the Waypoints screen on the right-side
CRT see how much time you've got.Once the lights are out landing`s virtually
impossible.If your opponents are skillful,their intelligence may have dange-
rous information about this mission.You could find enemy fighter patrols un-
comfortably close to your objective,or bouncing you just as you're trying to
land!

AIRDROPS: These missions are  usually milk runs. Your job is to avoid action
and just fly over a radiobeacon that's quite clear on your HUD.The only real
worry is reaching the beacon before it is turned off.Make a note of the turn
off time and periodically check the  Waypoints screen on the right-side CRT.
Once the beacon is off there's no way  to find the drop site. Be warned that
skillful opponents may have intelligence about this mission from their spies
You could find enemy fighter patrols lurking around the objective.If so, you
could attempt to lure them away,or blow them away,depending on your ROE.

PHOTO RECON RUNS : There are two hard things about photographic missions: u-
sing the camera,and keeping a low profile while you're doing it! Because the
135mm/IR camera is on a  fixed mounting, you must steer the plane to aim the
camera.This is more difficult than it seems, since the target swims into and
out of view all too fast.Experienced pilots advise you to line up on the ta-
rget 8 to 10 km away. Set up a perfectly straight course and keep to it.At 2
km to 4 km hit the bay doors and brakes,then pull the nose gradually up,bri-
nging the cameras aim onto the target.Keep in this regime,using subtle pitch
changes to keep the target in the camera,while snapping pictures. You've got
plenty of film: don't be afraid to take plenty of extras! Success is announ-
ced right on the CRT.As soon as you have it,close the doors and brakes, then
dive low for escape.Don't be surprised if the enemy spots you during the ph-
oto run.Photo runs over enemy troop concentrations and/or near SAMs are esp-
ecially nervewracking.You may need to take out a SAM radar before making the
run.If shoulder-fired SAMs infest the area,your only hope is to dump a decoy
before you start, run your IR jammer as long as you can, and/or periodically
dump flares.

FLYING AGAINST SAMS : Destroying a SAM  battery requires that you "sneak up"
on them as best you can, then nail his radar first  with a Maverick or HARM.
With the radar out of action,the missiles are helpless.Unless there are oth-
er SAMs nearby you can have  a strafing "picnic" with  the missile launchers
until a fighter patrol shows up. Remember that the safest place around a SAM
battery is directly above it.Radar cannot look straight up,and the longer-ra
nged missies (such as the SA-2,-5,-10 and -12) have  minimum range of 4 to 5
km.Of course, getting to this point can be rather tricky. It doesn't hurt to
run over the litany of defense techniques before going after a SAM: disappe-
aring,decoys,ECM,chaff and manuevering.

HITTING THE SUB PENS : The Severomorsk submarine  pens in the North Cape are
a unique and special target. These must be attacked by toss bombing from the
north:you must place an FAE through the sea doors.This means flying straight
at the mountain,pulling up at the last minute. You may wish to make your run
at 500' to 1,000',instead of 200'.This lets you begin the toss sooner (about
3 to 4 km away),giving you more leeway to clear the mountainside. Beware the
Krivak-class frigates that patrol seaward of this submarine base. Their rad-
ars and SAMs cannot be ignored! You'll want to bring along a couple of Peng-
uin-3 ASMs to eliminate these fellows.Even in Cold War,chances are good a Kr
ivak will get a radar "make" on you,forcing you to hit him.

SINKING SHIPS : The ideal ship-killer is the AGM-84A Harpoon. This heavy mi-
ssile is your longestranged weapon.It has a superb targetingsystem that hits
the ship you target,even a carrier with a ring of escorts.However,don't und-
erestimate enemy warships,especially those of the Russian Northern Fleet.The
larger ships have exceptionally good radars and very powerful SAMs.Patrol sh
ips can be knocked out with a single missile,but a task force has so many sh
ips that any close approach means you'll be dodging missiles left and right.
Most enemy ships stay close to friendly shorelines,with fighter cover nearby
(if not overhead already).Don't forget that enemy aircraft carriers have th-
eir own fighters: you can count on a few flying CAP (combat air patrol).When
fighting a conventional war with Libya,or in the Persian Gulf,be careful ab-
out attacking merchant ships. Avoid those on the high seas  or near friendly
coastlines ; only attack ships close to enemy ports or shore. Otherwise, you
could end up hitting a neutral ship by accident.

BOMBING RUNS : When attacking with  laser or free-fall bombs, you'll have to
rise above minimum altitude during the attack run.This,combined with the op-
en bay doors, raises your EMV considerably. Try to minimize this exposure as
much as possible.Remember,the higher your EMV, the better target you are for
enemy missiles.The longer you're a big target,the more chances the enemy has
to launch + hit you. The most frightening prospect is a bombing run directly
over enemy troop concentrations. There's nothing worse than a host of shoul-
der-fired SAMs rising up at you. These are on the one missile site you can't
knock out.Fortunately, they have a very short range. Still, flying through a
barrage of SA-14s,dumping a flare every two seconds, while trying to line up
a bomb,will turn your hair prematurely white.

LIBYA : --------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION/POLITICS : Libya is ruled by Col.Mu'ammar al-Qadhaffi,leader of
the secret army organization that deposed the former king in `69.The capital
city is Tripoli and the nation's chief source of wealth is oil sold to west-
ern nations.

MILITARY FORCES: Rich by third world standards,Libya buys most of its armam-
ents from the Soviet Union.Personnel are trained by Soviet military advisors
but national pride has  prohibited (so far) any significant Soviet presence.
Soviet advisors are not invited on combat operations.The Libyan Army has ap-
proximately 60,000 men, Navy has 53 ships and 6,500 men, while the Air Force
has about 530 planes,30 combat helicopters,and 8,500 men.A paramilitary "Pan
African Legion" of about 10,000 also exists.In addition, Libya has built and
supported a variety of training camps for terrorist groups.

GEOGRAPHY : Libya`s a desert nation.Along the coast it has only one mountain
region that is visually distinctive: the Jabal al Akbar to the east of Beng-
hazi. These mountains greatly restrict the capabilities of Benghazi + Benina
radars.Deep in the desert, east of Sabha, are the more desolate and isolated
mountains of the Al Haruj al Aswad,while to the west are the great sandseas.

LEVEL OF CONFLICT : --------------------------------------------------------
COLD WAR : At times Libya has been enthusiastic backer of international ter-
rorist organizations.It provides funds,arms,military training, and base camp
sites for a variety of  Arab and other terrorist groups. America has already
attacked tactical military targets in retaliation for Libya's role in numer-
ous incidents of international terrorism in Europe and the Mediterranean.

LIMITED WAR : The Libyan army has fought minor  border clashes against Egypt
to the east.Egypt is an American ally,and so far has proved considerably su-
perior,militarily,to Libya.The Libyan army has also attempted an invasion of
Chad to the south.After a protracted campaign against Chad and her ally Fra-
nce, Libyan supply lines through the Sahara desert were cut,forcing a Libyan
retreat.Future limited wars between Libya and any of her neighbours are pos-
sible.

CONVENTIONAL WAR : In the even of NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict in the Mediterr-
anean and/or Europe, Libya is expected  to provide bases for Soviet aircraft
and warships operating in the Mediterranean.These bases could become the wes
ternmost outposts of Russian forces contesting the Mediterranean.

FRIENDLY BASES : -----------------------------------------------------------
SIGONELLA ON SICILY (UD15): The USA maintains a military base at Trapani, on
western Sicily,and the Sigonella military field in south-eastern Sicily.Sig-
onella runway  is the main staging point  for air attacks against  the North
African coast,especially Libya.Unfortunately, the flight distances are quite
long.Using this base virtually requires that your F-19 carry extra fuel.

CV AMERICA AT SEA (UD70): This  60,000-ton "Kitty Hawk"  class  conventional
aircraft carrier, designated CV66, often serves with the US 6th fleet in the
Mediterranean.It participated in the 1986  raids against Tripoli + Benghazi.
The carrier is ideally positioned for launching and recovering strikes agai-
nst Benghazi, the Gulf of Sirte, or targets deep in  the Libyan desert. Here
it cruises on a southerly course with its traditional ring of close escorts.
The carrier remains well north of the Gulf of Sirte to avoid SSM attacks fr-
om enemy ships and aircraft.It is surrounded by escorts and regularly reple-
nishes the CAP (combat air patrol) with F-18 launches.

NEUTRAL BASES : ------------------------------------------------------------
These airbases are in neutral territory.You shouldn`t use these bases unless
specifically so ordered,or if you must make an emergency landing.

SUDA BAY ON CRETE (VD41): This airfield,near the city of Khania,isn`t an Am-
erican base,although in years past it was a major NATO air and naval base.It
has the advantage of being both closer and less public than equivalent airf-
ields in Greece or Egypt.

HALFAR ON MALTA (UD13): This airfield is on the island of Malta.Once a crit-
ical strength position for  the British Commonwealth in the Mediterranean,it
is now a neutral port and sometime tourist haven.

SEEING THE SIGHTS IN LIBYA : -----------------------------------------------
Flying over Libya is a unique experience.It is a truly desert nation, a land
of red and brown hardscrabble with patches of tan sand and gray boulder fie-
lds.Water is all underground,seeping to the surface in occasional patches of
green oasis or mountain valley.Mountain ranges are low,undulating areas full
of small hillocks and short peaks. From the air  it's often hard to tell the
difference between again roadways and the dark wadis(gullies) in the desert.
But some works of man stand out, particularly the rust red  of oil wells and
pipelines,or the distinctive star-pattern of SAM batteries.

LIBYA : --------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIPOLI (TC87): The capital city of Libya has a large military-civilian air-
base at Idris,and is well protected by SAM batteries.Until recently these we
re long-range SA-5 Gammons, but there are indications  that Russian military
advisors may replace these with the formidable SA-12 Gladiator.Tripoli`s al-
so the site of a major army headquarters,various military depots,oil storage
areas, and sometimes terrorist training camps.Missile boats often cruise off
the coast.

SABHA (UB17): This southern town`s the main military base supporting Libya's
southerly border expansion.It was the major depot for the Chad war,and still
extremely important to Libyan trans-Saharan ambitions.The most important mi-
litary installations here are the large airbase and the SAM battery protect-
ing it.

MISRATAH (UC26) & SIRT (UC43): These two coastal towns are much smaller are-
as,with lower level military headquarters.The ports include oilstorage tanks
for refueling ships.Sirt is a secondary naval base, supporting missile boats
that cruise the western side of the "Line of Death".

RAS LANUF (UC82) & PORT BREGA (UC92): Ras Lanuf  is Libya's largest + newest
oil facility. The majority of all oil for export is stored here, and a large
number of oil tankers are usually coming and going at all times.There`s also
a refinery,vast "farms" of oil tanks,and a major military headquarters. Port
Brega is an older oil facility, still in operation despite the completion of
Ras Lanuf.SAM batteries are sited in this strategically vital area. In addi-
tion the Port Brega airfield,west of the town,serves both ports.

BENGHAZI (VC16): This city is the site of Libya's second-largest military ba
se, including the Benina airfield and powerful protective SAM batteries. The
city itself is large, with a military headquarters + a few small oil storage
facilites to serve the ancient port.Terrorist training camps aren`t uncommon
in the hills to the west.

AL BADYA (VC37): This sleepy coastal town in the mountainous  Jabal al Akbar
has major military significance. It overlooks the narrow  Ionian sea between
Libya and Greece, making it an ideal site for anti-ship missiles. There is a
small airstrip and SAM site as well.

OIL FIELDS : The great oilfields of Libya are in the southeast,where litera-
lly thousands of wells pump crude from the ground,which is piped to RasLanuf
and Port Brega. The great producing fields can be found  near Raguba (UC90),
Waha (VB18),Amal (VC30),Jalo Oasis (VC40),and Gialo (VB49).Most of the great
fields have a few storage tanks on site, to hold crude  temporarily until it
can be piped to the port. However, the majority  of storage tanks are at the
ports,not here on the fields.

SECRET BASES : Western intelligence  operatives in  Libya are  preparing two
secret,hardpack surfaces suitable for aircraft landings.One is at AlMukhayli
(ONC VC43),the other is on the edge of the great ergs, at Yafran (ONC TC93).

AIR DEFENSES : Libyan air defenses use Russian-built equipment. Russian adv-
isors train native Libyan crews, who then operate the equipment. SA-2 Guide-
line and SA-5 Gammon SAMs have been the backbone of Libyan air defenses, but
there are rumors of upgrades to the new SA-10 Grumble + SA-12 Gladiator sys-
tems.Local military forces make use of the SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder-fired mis
siles.These are also popular  terrorist weapons, and can  be expected in the
vicinity of terrorist camps,Libyan army units use various medium-range SAMs,
including the SA-8,-9,-11,and -13. However, these are not always in the best
state of repair.

AIR FORCE : ----------------------------------------------------------------
FIGHTERS : The Libyan Air Force is primarily  composed of MiG-23MF "Flogger"
fighters,with over 140 craft.It also has a smaller number of MiG-25"Foxbats"
for reconnaissance and  long-range interception, as well as  some antiquated
MiG-21s. The Air Force also has various Mirage 5D fighter-bombers for ground
attack missions.Intelligence expects that MiG-23s and 25s will be your prim-
ary air-to-air opponents,although in Conventional War, or against higher qu-
ality pilots,you may encounter the new MiG-29 "Fulcrum" flown by Soviet per-
sonnel.

RECONNAISSANCE BOMBERS: Although Libya does not possess any Tu-95 "Bear" re-
connaissance  bombers, Russian  planes of this type  frequently operate from
Libyan bases.

AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING & CONTROL: Libya has no AEW&C craft. No Russian Il-76
"Mainstays" are expected to use Libyan bases,since they are too precious. In
wartime Libya is a distant outpost in the middle of NATO's great strength in
the Western Mediterranean.Aircraft losses would be high - too high to permit
risking the rare and costly AEW&C craft.

AIR TRANSPORTS: It is suspected that Libya's antiquated  fleet of C-130H and
C-47 air transports (built in America) will be  replaced  with russian-built
equipment,perhaps including the new An-72 "Coaler" jet transport.

NAVY : ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Libyan Navy is primarily  composed of Missile Corvettes + Missile Patrol
Boats. The largest of these are the 770-ton Russian-built  Nanuchka II class
armed with Styx surface-to-surface missiles, SA-N-4 surface-to-air missiles,
and a twin 57mm gun turret.The other boats include the Russian Osa-class,It-
alian-built Wadi M'ragh class and the French-built La  Combattante II types;
these have poorer missiles and SA-N-5 SAMs, or no SAMs at all. The Nanuchkas
are the best boats in the Libyan Navy. They perform the most aggressive pat-
rols,making them the primary threat. Patrols occur frequently in the Gulf of
Sirte,south of the "Line of Death".Sometimes the Libyan air force flies fig-
hter missions in support of the patrols.

THE PERSIAN GULF : ---------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION/POLITICS : Iran has been ruled by Shi'ite (a Moslem sect) radi-
cals since their overthrow of the pro-American Shah in 1979.In September1980
Iraq attacked Iran, beginning a long, costly war between those nations. Both
contestants are viewed with  distrust by the Arab states  along the south of
the Persin Gulf. Iran's use of international terrorism as a  tool of foreign
policy has not improved the nation's image.Iran also calls for a Shi'ite re-
ligious revolution throughout  the Islamic world. This naturally bothers the
leadership of the Arab states,since their governments are Sunni (another Mo-
slem sect).However,Iran is populated by Persians,not Arabs.So far this cult-
ural and linguistic barrier has hindered the spread of Iranian Shi'ite radi-
calism across the Persian Gulf to the Arab states.

MILITARY FORCES : Under the Shah, Iran's oil-rich finances permitted massive
investment in military forces, mostly from the USA.Since the revolution many
complex weapons have failed for lack of spare parts and maintenance,while mo
st of the rest were damaged or destroyed in the war with Iraq. Iran has some
sophisticated aircraft and missiles remaining,but these are deployed to pro-
tect key cities in the interior,rather than as a border defense.

GEOGRAPHY : Iran is a large nation with varied geography.The Elbruz and Zag-
ros mountain ranges run from the northwest corner (where Iran touches Turkey
and the Soviet trans-Caucasus) diagonally southeast,along the border with I-
raq,and then parallel to the Persian Gulf.South of these mountains,at the he
ad of the Gulf,are Iran's oilfields.North of the mountains the nation is di-
vided into two regions.The western part,near Iraq, Turkey,and trans-Caucasus
Russia,is fertile,heavily populated, + includes most of the major cities and
industrial plants. The eastern part, bordering Pakistan,Afghanistan, and So-
viet Central Asia,is mostly barren deserts and mountains with a small,impov-
erished,undereducated population.

LEVEL OF CONFLICT : --------------------------------------------------------
COLD WAR : Iran's use of terrorism has been very effective to data.America's
confused policy respons, culminating in the Iran-Contra scandal,is one exam-
ple.However,eventually the continue violence may provoke a military response
from the Western nations.

LIMITED WAR : Iran and Iraq have been fighting a limited war since 1980. The
cities of Abadan and Basra,on the national border where the Tigris-Euphrates
rivers empty into the Gulf,are largely ruined by the fighting.Running north-
ward are two opposing lines  of trenches  and bunkers with a "no-man's land"
between. Each side attempted to discourage Persian Gulf shipping from aiding
the opposition, resulting in missile + rocket attacks on many freighters and
tankers. In 1987 and 1988 American fleet units  escorting oil tankers became
involved in surface battles with Iranian ships and boats,as well as an unfo-
rtunate civilian airliner that flew through a battle  area and was shot down
by the somewhat inept crew of the missile cruiser USS Vincennes.

CONVENTIONAL WAR : Russia could  invade Iran as part  of a wider NATO-Warsaw
Pact conflict,or as a counter to the Shi'ite radicals,who would like to spr-
ead their revolution to the USSR's Moslem population.America may be drawn in
to invading Iran by its confused  foreign policy. The vast and often hostile
geography,not to mention a large and hostile population,argue against tradi-
tional military invasions.Instead,a gradual escalation from limited war,inc-
luding bigger and deeper air attacks,is more probable.

FRIENDLY BASES : -----------------------------------------------------------
America's strongest allies in the Persian Gulf are Saudi Arabia and the tiny
island kingdom of Bahrain.

CV NIMITZ AT SEA (KY83) : This huge  80,000-ton nuclear carrier is the class
ship of the latest and most powerful program  of aircraft carriers. Normally
assigned to the Pacific Fleet,it`s prepared to visit the Indian Ocean at any
time.Here it sails with a close escort of destroyes,and has its F-18s on re-
gular rotation in CAP (combat air patrol). American aircraft carriers do not
sail into the restricted waters of the Persian Gulf,where they would be sit-
ting ducks for land-based air and missile attacks.Carrier task forces remain
in the Indian Ocean, although the Nimitz and her ring of  close escorts have
sailed deep into the Gulf of Oman, to provide a base as close as possible to
Persian Gulf targets.If threatened the ship can always sail to the southeast
and escape into the vast expanses of the Indian Ocean.

RAS AS SAFFANIYAH (JY19) : This is Saudi Arabia's northenmost oil terminal +
port along the Gulf. Its airfield is in a useful  strategic location. Basing
privileges for a secret "stealth" mission can be arranged with the pro-Amer-
ican Saudi monarchy.

DHAHRAM (JY54) & AL HUFUF (JY44): Dhahram is Saudi Arabias largest port city
on the Persian Gulf, making its airfield and  unwise choice for stealth air-
craft operations. However,the Al Hufuf airfield slightly inland is a strate-
gically useful and less public position for basing missions and raids.Either
can be used for stealth missions,but Al Hufuf is preferable.

AS SALAMIYAH (JY00) : This small airbase outside of  the capital Riyadh is a
nice, quite location where clandestine missions can be organized easily. Un-
fortunately,the gulf coast is far away.

BAHRAIN (JY65) : This small island nation is strongly pro-American,providing
large naval and air base facilities for American military forces.It`s fairly
easy to operate stealth missions from here.

NEUTRAL BASES : ------------------------------------------------------------
Kuwait is a friendly neutral nation,Oman is neutral but pro-Western, and the
UAE are studiously neutral.(At the time of writing/typing this,Iraq has just
invaded Kuwait,but America is being amazingly limp-wristed about it,and have
not offered military assistance, though Kuwait has requested it.USS Indepen-
dence is steaming towards the Gulf,but is unlikely to actually do anything!)

KUWAIT CITY IN KUWAIT (JZ12) : Originally neutral, Iranian threats + attacks
caused Kuwait to seek US military aid and support. The Kuwait airport can be
used to occasionally stage missions that demonstrate America's support to Ku
wait,or for emergency landings. However, Kuwait is fearful of provoking more
Iranian hostility,and therefore will not grant America basing rights.Kuwaits
great oil fields are south of the city,in ONC JZ20 and JZ30.

QATAR (JY75) : This small independent nation works hard at the appearance of
neutrality,probably because it has  strong pro-American + strong pro-Iranian
factions.Although missions can`t be staged regularly from here,it`s possible
to use the pro-American groups to aid in specific clandestine missions or em
ergency landing situations.

RUWEISS (KY01) & TARIF (KY11) : These small oil ports of the United Arab Em-
irates are not especially friendly to the American cause. Because the UAE is
a decentralized government,pressure and money in the right places could per-
mit a clandestine mission or emergency landing.Some of the largest oilfields
of the UAE are in this area (ONC KY22-23).

ABU DHABI (KY31) : Abu Dhabi is the major  city of the  United Arab Emirates
(UAE),where the appearance of neutrality is most important. Staging missions
or emergency landings from this base is very difficult,but not impossible if
Iranian diplomacy succeeds in making yet more enemies.

AL KHAFI AT DUBAI (KY65) : This large airfield, outside the city of Dubai,is
the most strategically useful of all UAE airfields.It is the base closest to
south-central Iran,and as such an important launching or retrieval point for
deep missions. However, as at Abu Dhabi, political  problems make the use of
this base difficult to impossible.

MUSCAT IN OMAN (KY90) : Oman is careful to remain neutral in all affairs,but
is strongly pro-Western. For example,much of its army is trained + officered
by "retired" British military personnel. The military  portion of the Muscat
airfield is available for missions and emergency landings,provided everythi-
ng remains secret and politically "deniable".

THE SIGHTS IN THE PERSIAN GULF : -------------------------------------------
The Persian Gulf is a desert region, not unlike Libya, except for the large,
high spine of mountains that runs diagonally through Iran from the northwest
to the southeast. However,water is more plentiful,especially in Iran,result-
ing in increased agriculture and a large number of local irrigation works to
control the seasonal run-off  from the mountain highlands. The Gulf has many
interesting + exceptional areas, such as the Tigris-Euphrates watershed that
reaches the head of the gulf around Abadan. Once a great seaport and teaming
metropolis,the destruction of the Iran-Iraq war has reduced the area to a ru
in of small towns and villages.Kharg Island,despite wartime attacks, remains
one of the great wonders of the world.Surrounded by oil platforms and super-
tankers,guarded by missile boats and fighter patrols, it remains the site of
numerous refineries + oil storage tanks.There are also great oilfields south
of Kuwait City,north of Bushehr in the Bandar-e-Rig,on Bahrain and Qatar,and
along the UAE coastline near Ruweiss + Tarif, as well as assorted individual
platforms along the Arabian Gulf coast.Another interesting region of Iran is
the great valley of Bandar-e-Lengeh and Bandar 'Abbas. Seasonal rivers, flo-
wing from the mountains,have formed a fertile valley floor that empties into
the Straits of Hormuz, the strategic doorway to the Persian Gulf. On the op-
posite side of the straits,the mountainous peninsula of Musandam knifes into
the straits,creating a narrow choke-point of naval traffic.

IRAN : ---------------------------------------------------------------------
UPPER KHUZESTAN TRIANGLE - DEZFUL (JZ38),MASJED SOLEYMAN (JZ47),AHVAZ (JZ37)
These cities are the main "rear areas" behind the Iraq-Iran battlefront.They
have a variety of SAMs. Although all originally had airbase facilities,it is
believed that only Masjed Soleyman's is still intact.

ABADAN (JZ24) : This city is located at the final junction of the Tigris and
Euphrates Rivers, just before they empty into the Persian Gulf.Numerous bat-
tles in and around this area have destroyed a large part of the city.The su-
rrounding countryside, once contained with dikes and irrigation projects, is
now reverting to a  poisonous marshland in the  aftermath of heavy fighting,
which included the use of poison gas.

BANDAR KHOMENYI (JZ44) : This is the  main Iranian military  base behind the
southern part of the Iran-Iraq front, and a major staging base  for military
supplies + munitions of all sorts.It has a large airbase,powerful SAM batte-
ries,and a major military headquarters.

BANDAR-E-RIG OIL FIELDS : These oil fields,clustered along the coast and in-
land hills (JZ61 and JZ71) are a key source of Iran's oil wealth.

KHARG ISLAND (JZ60) : This island is covered with refineries,oil storage ta-
nks, and port facilities for oil tankers. Until the Iran-Iraq war it was the
greatest oil terminal in the world. Repeated attacks have ruined many of the
facilities,but never all of them.Now protected by SAM batteries, and missile
boat patrols, it is still Iran's main port for oil export.Much of Iran's oil
wealth is slightly offshore. One of the heaviest concentrations of oil plat-
forms exists in the vicinity of Kharg Island. Beware that some platforms are
now used by Iranian Shi'ite "Guards" as military bases.

BUSHEHR (JZ80) : This important coastal city  was once a major oil port, but
is now completely overshadowed by neighboring Kharg Island.The military for-
ces on its airbase + the SAM batteries aren`t always first rate.However,it`s
home port for many Iranian frigates and missile boats that patrol the gulf.

SHIRAZ (KZ03) : This inland city, sited on a highland plateau, is one of the
largest Iranian cities.It is also the nerve center and main headquarters for
Iran's southern  military command - the forces  responsible  for the Persian
Gulf.There is an exceptionally large military airbase here,and it is usually
protected by a powerful SAM battery.

ESFAHAN (JZ89) : This inland city,nestled in a large col of the Zagros Moun-
tains,is the classic "gateway" to northwestern Iran. As a transportation and
population center it naturally boasts an  airfield, and SAM sites protecting
it.The current state of the Iran-Iraq war has a powerful effect on what sor-
ts of aircraft are based here.

YAZD (KZ38) AND KERMAN (KZ84) : These two cities are distant population cen-
ters on the edge of the Iranian deserts. Both cities are dominated by a str-
ong traditionalist sentiment, which in recent years has translted into ferv-
ent Shi'ite extremism. However,the huge war losses are causing many families
to reconsider their support for the Jihad.

BANDAR-E-LENGEH (KY57) : This western  city  on the Straits of  Hormuz has a
minor military base,including an airfield + SAM battery.However, its primary
function is civilian,serving the large oil fields in this area.Seasonal riv-
ers running from the mountains to the west  down into Bandar-e-Lengeh have a
variety of interesting road + rail bridges over them. Offshore Oil Platforms
are especially common in KY35-45.

BANDAR 'ABBAS (KY68) : This city is Irans major military base on the Straits
of Hormuz. Major Iranian Navy elements are based here, as well as the latest
SAMs and a large,well equipped military airbase.

SECRET BASES : Western intelligence operatives  in Iran are preparing 2 sec-
ret,hardpack surfaces suitable for aircraft landings.One is in the Shalamzar
valley(JZ67) in the Zagros Mountains,the other in the mountains south of Ke-
rman,at KZ82.

AIR DEFENSES : HAWK batteries are Iran's longest ranged surface-to-air miss-
iles.Nearly exhausted in fighting with Iraq,these weapons are formidable de-
fenders of Iran  once more. The reason? A large  shipment of parts and spare
missiles by Lt.Colonel Oliver North,USMC.He hoped to trade them for American
hostages in Lebanon.Iran got the missiles, the hostages remained in Lebanon,
and North resigned from the Marines Corps.Think about that when one fires at
you! Rapier batteries, sold by Britain to Iran, are fast,but shorter ranged,
and hindered by a fire controlsystem that is primarily visual,with the radar
intended originally as backup. The Rapier radar system  never approached the
quality or sophistication of the HAWK.In fact,in the Falkland Islands fight-
ing,the Rapier was surprisingly ineffective.The Tigercat, an antiquated Bri-
tish design,appears in less-important areas. Many Tigercat sites have little
or no radar,since the missile is designed for visual control.The Seacat is a
naval version of the Tigercat,found on Iranian Vosper Mk 5 type frigates. It
is somewhat more dangerous because the frigates have decent radar search sy-
stems.

IRANIAN AIR FORCE : --------------------------------------------------------
This service arm is composed  primarily of American-built  aircraft acquired
during the Shah's rule.Before the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war the AirForce
had a nominal strength of 75 F-14 Tomcats,about 200 F-4D + F-4E Phantom IIs,
140 F-5E Tiger IIs,plus various other planes and helicopters,including C-130
Hercules transports and P-3F Orion reconnaissance bombers.

FIGHTERS : Iran lacks the sophisticated technicians + parts to keep its F-14
operational.Within a year after the revolution fewer than 5 were functional.
No missiles or parts exist  for the long-range  Phoenix AAM system, but some
F-14s still have functional longrange radars.F-14s can carry AIM-7F Sparrows
or AIMN-9H Sidewinders.The older but less effective F-4s and F-5s are easier
to maintain.These planes are the backbone of the Iranian fighting air force,
interaepting Iraqi raids,guarding rear areas and ships from attack, and occ-
asionally attempting a raid into Iraqi territory.Iranian fighters are equip-
ped with AIM-9H Sidewinders,one of the last + best first-generation IR AAMs.
The F-4 Phantoms (but  not the F-5 Tigers) are  designed to carry the AIM-7F
Sparrow,a long range radar-homing missile.

RECONNAISSANCE BOMBERS : Iran has few naval reconnaissance bombers, and most
of those are P-3C Orions  with inoperative  electronic gear. Such planes are
reduced to making visual patrols only - a waste of aviation fuel in a modern
warfare environment !  However, it's possible that long-range  Russian Tu-95
"Bear" bombers may make an appearance,flying from Afghanistan or Yemen.

AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING & CONTROL : Iran has no "AWACS" or other AEW&C aircr-
aft.Instead, the few operational F-14s are used in this role, since the F-14
has an extremely powerful air search radar.

AIR TRANSPORTS : Iran has a variety of small, medium + large air transports,
including  the American C-130 Hercules, German Fokker F.27, French Dassault-
Breguet Falcon 20, and Boeing 707  and 747 transport models. The exact types
available vary greatly,depending on the supply of spare parts + the presence
of knowledgeable mechanics.Given Iran's dislike of the West,some consider it
likely that she will shop in Russia for the  next transports bought, perhaps
the new and very flexible An-72 Coaler.

NAVY : ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Iranian Navy has suffered greatly in the Iran-Iraq war,since most resour
ces go into the army  and air force. Many ships were damaged in the fighting
and remain unrepaired;others have deteriorated badly for lack of maintenance
The great naval base at Khorramshahr, near Abadan,was destroyed early in the
war + remains a ruin in no-man's land.It is believed that one or more of the
four Vosper Mark 5 frigates are still functional. These 1,100-ton ships inc-
lude a Seacat SAM surface-to-air missile system and a 4.5" gun turret. Occa-
sional patrols by  these or smaller  ships can be expected in  the region of
Kharg Island or in the Straits of Hormuz. If functional, the Vosper frigates
pose a significant military threat. Iran's Shi'ite "Guards" also man a large
number of fast motorboats.The crew carry rocket-propelled grenades to attack
shipping,and shoulder-launched IR SAMs to protect themselves from air + hel-
icopter attack.Virtually invisible,these "mosquitos" are a threat only to un
armed merchant shipping,or an aircraft unlucky enough to pass over the area.
These boats are based all along the Iranian coast,especially at Bandar 'Abb-
as,and from a variety of offshore oil platforms.

THE NORTH CAPE : -----------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION/POLITICS : The North Cape area  is shared by four nations. West
to east,they are Norway,Sweden,Finland,and the Soviet Union. Their political
orientation parallel their geographic locations: Norway belongs to NATO,Swe-
den is a pro-Western neutral,neutral Finland accomodates the Soviets,and the
Soviet Union,of course,leads the Eastern bloc.

MILITARY FORCES : In terms of global politics, the North  Cape is the single
most important military region in the Soviet Union.Murmansk is Russia's only
year-round  open-sea access to  the Atlantic ocean. Russian SSBNs (ballastic
missile nuclear submarines), the heart of nuclear deterrence, sail from here
into the Atlantic and Arctic oceans.The Soviet Northern Fleet protects these
invaluable weapons,as well as maintaining a credible threat to NATO's Atlan-
tic lifelines.Norway fields a large,tough force tailored  for dogged defense
of its mountainous homeland.Reasonably well-equipped,the majority of the for
ces guard the populous  southern regions. The northern bases have only token
garrisons.Northern Norway seems more important to NATO than it is to the Nor
wegians, since important NATO air, naval and marine troop assets are planned
to reinforce this area in time of war. Sweden's armed forces are designed to
make the Russians (or anyone) think twice about violating that country's neu
trality.The forces are well equipped and well trained,with a nationwide res-
erve system that makes a large part of the citizenry part-time soldiers.How-
ever,the northern part of Sweden is almost unpopulated,so the defenses there
are considerably lighter.Recently Sweden has been greatly irritated by Russ-
ian midget submarines literally crawling around  inside her fleet bases, and
by a Russian dieselsub that ran aground in a harbour entrance while carrying
a nuclear-tipped torpedo (a serious insult to anti-nuclear Sweden). As a re-
sult,Sweden may be willing to support NATO  clandestine operations as a form
of revenge. Finland fields a much  smaller and less sophisticated force than
its neighbours. Although fiercly independent, Finland has learned to accomo-
date the desires of its powerful neighbour,the Soviet Union.The Soviets main
tain this "friendly"  attitude by garrisoning  powerful military forces near
the Finnish border, and strongly encouraging Finland  to buy Soviet military
equipment. So even if Finland could detect  F-19 overflights in its northern
regions, it's unclear whether it would bother  informing its "friend" Russia
immediately.

GEOGRAPHY : This entire region is a harshly cold climate. Northern Norway is
a long,mountainous country with a harsh climate and "iron" (rocky) seacoast.
In this terrain a small group of determined defenders could stop an army for
years. The "open" areas  of Finland and Sweden  are deceptive. On the map it
may appear to be an open plain, perfect for attack. In reality it's a frigid
wilderness in the winter and a vast,marshy bog in the summer.

LEVEL OF CONFLICT : --------------------------------------------------------
COLD WAR : Because of the potential threat posed by the Northern Fleet's sh-
ips and aircraft to the shipping lanes in the Atlantic,NATO and Russian for-
ces are constantly sparring with each other, testing the other's responses +
jockeying for position should hostilities break out. Officially at peace,the
two sides wage a covert conflict of intelligence gathering and military pos-
turing that can turn deadly at any instant.

LIMITED WAR : If Russian or American foreign policy was conducted with grea-
ter hostilty, the North Cape would  make an ideal place for Western raids of
retaliations against the Soviets. Similarly,their air and sea defences could
get excessively "trigger happy" and shoot before asking questions.Even among
men of good faith,there`s always a temptation to send in a secret mission to
"take out" something that really bothers you.Israel and South Africa,for ex-
ample,have surrendered to this temptation from time to time.

CONVENTIONAL WAR : The baloon's gone up.NATO and the Warsaw Pact are offici-
ally shooting at each other in this part  of Europe (perhaps elsewhere too).
The Northern Fleet is making a sortie  into the Atlantic, Soviet troops have
crossed the border into Norway,Mainstays and MiGs are clouding the skies.Now
missions are no joke at all.Getting in and out with your skin intact will be
very,very tricky!

FRIENDLY BASES : -----------------------------------------------------------
The two Norwegian land bases here are civilian airfields,but both are closer
to the Russian border than the NATO bases at Banak and Bardu. It is easy and
wise to stage stealth missions through  either Lakselv or Kautokeino, rather
than flying longer distances from more rearward fields.Such staging could be
just a quick landing and refueling both inbound and outbound. In effect, the
fields can function as grounded refueling tankers.

KAUTOKEINO (WX11) : Located in the barren tundra of the Finnmarksvidda,Kaut-
okeino airfield is well suited  for operations across  the top of Finland to
Murmansk. The population is very small and the  entire area well defended by
tundra swamps and bogs in the summer,or sub-zero blizzards in the winter.

LAKSELV (WX34) : Located at the inland  end of  the Porsangen Fjord, Lakselv
town has an airfield ideally suited to operations into Russia.It is far eno-
ugh from the border to survive the first few days of fighting,but close eno-
ugh for easy flying.

CV KENNEDY AT SEA (WX67) : In the middle 1980s the Secretary of the Navy an-
nounced a new policy -a wartime policy of sending aircraft carriers deep in-
to the Norwegian Sea,to challenge Russias fleet near its home ports.Although
considered  suicidal by some, this policy is certainly  useful for launching
stealth missions.Here CV67,one of the conventional carriers with the US Atla
ntic Fleet,makes a quick dash to the North Cape to launch your mission.As al
ways,the carrier is accompanied by a screen of escorts,and is constantly la-
unching and recovering a CAP of F-18s.

NEUTRAL BASES : ------------------------------------------------------------
Available neutral  bases in this region  are all Swedish. Sweden is strictly
neutral in international politics,but economically closely tied to the West-
ern bloc.Given recent events and aggressive Russian moves, it's not unlikely
that a few clandestine stealth missions, or emergency landings, would be al-
lowed at northern Swedish airbases.

KIRUNA (WW28) : The northernmost airfield in Sweden, this base is located in
the nearly unpopulated foothills of the  Esrange mountains. Stealth missions
could operate easily from this area, with nobody but reindeer to observe the
events.

GALLIVARE (WW26) : Although this airfield is also far north in Sweden,Galli-
vare town is a junction of rails and roads.In the summer months it is also a
popular tourist area,with the Muddus National Park  a few miles to the west.
Stealth missions operating from this base must be very discreet.

LULEA (WW13) : This fairly populous  city is the main Swedish  military base
in the Northern Region.It is also a port on the Gulf of Bothnia,the northern
most arm of the Baltic sea.

THE LAND OF THE MIDNIGHT SUN : ---------------------------------------------
North Cape is a  realm of extremes. In summer the sun  shines throughout the
night,while in winter  it never rises above  the horizon. The most northerly
areas are realms of tundra and permafrost - ground that remains frozen thou-
ghout the year,save for the top few inches in the summer. Only moss + coarse
grass grows here, although it can turn brilliant  green on good summer days.
The majority of the region is taiga,vast pine forests that are home to rein-
deer,artic fox,+ rock ptarmigan.The southerly lowlands are a deep watershed,
full of small lakes,marshes and bogs.The White Sea coastline is almost enti-
rely marsh as the land blends gradually into sea.The interior of the Kola Pe
ninsula has the characteristic mountains of a  tundra-taiga borderland: low,
rolling,rocky and bare,with pockets of snow even in summer.The Norwegian co-
ast has more dramatic terrain.Here is the topmost end of the spine of mount-
ains  that divides Norway from  Sweden. Even here they are still steep, bare
rock with clinging patches of ice and snow.Amid this monotonous,desolute te-
rrain are impressive human works,especially the city of Murmansk with its sp
rawling military complexes.Hideously expensive to build and maintain through
the long,deep winter, this region is surely the  most valuable military real
estate in the world,judging by money invested per acre!

NORTHWESTERN RUSSIA : ------------------------------------------------------
Murmansk (XX11) : This major city  is Russia's  only year-round  port on the
Atlantic ocean. Its great piers + depots support not only a steady stream of
merchant shipping,but the powerful Red Banner Northern fleet.Murmansk is li-
terally "at the end of the line", in this case a long railway line that runs
southward 700 miles to Leningrad.Murmansk is also the nerve centre of Russi-
as powerful airforces,including both PVO air defence planes and Naval Aviat-
ion of the Northern fleet. Satellite airfields  surround the city, including
large bases at Kildenstroy (XX10) and Kilpyaur (XX00).The Northern fleet in-
cludes,roughly,one aircraft carrier,75 other major surface warships,one mar-
ine brigade,133 submarines,and 446 naval aircraft.The protection of its bas-
es is the duty of 12 Divisions of  army troops (about 300,000 men total) and
150 planes of Tactical  Aviation (airforce planes supporting the army) + the
PVO (airforce interceptors guarding the border).The great Severomorsk (XX31)
submarine pens are also just outside of Murmansk.This underground base`s the
homeport for the new Typhoon class of ballistic missile subs,as well as many
other diesel and nuclear undersea craft.

PECHENGA (WX91) : This town is Russia's forwardmost military base in the far
north. Just a few miles from the Norwegian border,Pechenga is the inevitably
staging point for any invasion into NATO territory. Although it has an airb-
ase and strong SAM defenses,the Polyarnyy airbase complex to the east (in WX
80) is somewhat larger.

MONCHEGORSK (XW18) & OLENEGORSK (XW19) : These  two towns, near  the base of
the Kola peninsula,are major airbases for long-range naval aviation bombers,
as well as providing fighter and SAM cover to the railroad link between Mur-
mansk and the south.

KANDALAKSHA (XW16) : This small city is the main population centre at the ba
se of the Kola peninsula.It is primarily a transportation hub,with raillines
and a naval port that  faces eastward, into the White Sea. South of the city
lies the Loukhi(XW04) air defense complex,including a large SAM battery that
covers this section of the Murmansk-Leningrad rail line.

KEM (XW21) : South of Kandalaksha,Kem is the next significant city along the
Murmansk-Leningrad line.It too is a small port facing onto the White Sea. It
is also the starting point for the Voknavolok railline that runs westward to
the Finnish border. This is a  purely military line, intended to support the
Russian military presence on the Finnish border.

ARKHANGEL'SK (XW71) : This city is Russia's largest port on the Atlantic.Al-
though closed by ice during the winter,it has much better rail and road con-
nections to the interior of Russia,and is almost totally invulnerable to en-
emy attack. In addition to large port  facilities, the city is surrounded by
military defenses,the most notable being the complexes at Severodvinsk(XW51)
and Kushkushara (XW84).In addition,units of the Northern Fleet patrol offsh-
ore in the White Sea.

SECRET BASES : Western  intelligence  operatives in this area  have secretly
created two hardfrozen airstrips suitable for landings,one at XW57,the other
at XX20.

AIR DEFENSES : The Kola peninsula is vital to the SovietUnion because of the
access it affords to NATO's  lines of communications, but its very proximity
also makes it particularly vulnerable to  NATO counterstrokes. Consequently,
the Kola Peninsula is likely to prove one of the most challenging anti-airc-
raft environments in the  world today. In clandestine  missions it may prove
impossible to penetrate + escape this area  without eliminating at least one
radar system.However,you get lucky - the systems often shut down for varying
periods of time due to maintenance difficulties in this most rigorous of cli
mates.

LONG RANGE SAMS : These are area defense  weapons that, along with fighters,
are your primary opposition. The older SA-2s and SA-5s  have been undergoing
continual upgrade to SA-10 and  SA-12 quality. The entire system is enhanced
by the LPAR early warning system at Kirovsk.

LIGHT SAMS : Soviet ground forces in this area are  outfitted with the usual
battlefield SAMs, including the older SA-9 and SA-13 IR missiles, as well as
the newer SA-8 and SA-11 radar guided missiles.Mobile infantry carrying SA-7
and SA-14 shoulder-launched IR SAMs are a  significant threat as well. Check
out your intelligence briefing (preflight) for "special event" areas showing
the latest enemy troop concentrations.

THE PVO AND NAVAL AVIATION : -----------------------------------------------
FIGHTERS : This region is defended partly by the  PVO units, with long-range
MiG-25 and MiG-31 interceptors using long-range radar-homing AAMs.Naval avi-
ation fighters operating from either carriers or land strips include the Yak
38 V/STOL jet and the new Su-27 multi-purpose fighter.During wartime shorter
ranged units may arrive,including MiG-29 and SU-27 fighters with short-range
IR missiles as well as long-range radar weapons.All these planes but the Yak
38 are worthy opponents.The Yak can only carry IR homing missiles (generally
AA-8 Aphids).It`s considerably slower+less flexible than the other fighters.

RECONNAISSANCE BOMBERS : Many long-range Tu-95D "Bears" are based in this a-
rea,to keep tabs on NATO naval activity in the North Atlantic. A nuisance in
peacetime, these planes pose a serious threat  in a war. Eliminating them is
always a high priority in NATO war plans. That would  blind the Russian high
command to activities in the Atlantic and Norwegian seas.

TRANSPORTS : Russia possesses numerous air transports for  its huge force of
airborne units.The most modern of these is the jet propelled An-72 "Coaler",
which is particularly suited  to fast, high priority missions like inserting
commando teams or transporting critical command personnel.

AEW & C AIRCRAFT : The Soviets routinely deploy Il-76 "Mainstay" aircraft in
this region. The 300+ mile radars on this plane may be  your most formidable
enemy.If you're spotted and can't discover how or by whom,chances are it's a
Mainstay.

THE RED BANNER NORTHERN : --------------------------------------------------
Russia's Northern Fleet offers both tempting targets + a significant threat.
Its modern  Sovremennyy-class  destroyers carry  SA-N-7  missiles, while the
numerous Krivak-class  frigates carry SA-N-4. The  larger Kiev-class carrier
has the powerful SA-N-6, a sea-going equivalent to the SA-10. These warships
are more than capable of defending themselves.Stationed off the northern co-
ast, they significantly extend the Soviet anti-aircraft umbrella.In addition
to these ships' SAMs,the Kiev carries a complement of Yak-38 "jump-jet" figh
ter aircraft.While less capable than ground-based fighters, the British Har-
riers in the Falklands  taught the world not  to underestimate the capabili-
ties of such planes.An upcoming addition to the northern fleet is a class of
huge  aircraft  carriers fitting out  in the Crimea. Tentatively  titled the
"Kremlin" class, these ships are  expected to  join the Northern Fleet soon.

CENTRAL EUROPE : -----------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION/POLITICS : Central Europe is where the full force of East +West
meet.Since World WarII Europe has been two hostile Blocs,with a few neutrals
balanced between.On one side are the communist East European nations,created
in the wake of Soviet armies at the end of WWII.On the other side are democ-
ratic Western European nations,created by the USA and Britain in the wake of
their armies during WWII.Since 1949 the West has been linked by NATO.In 1955
the East formalized an equivalent organization, the Warsaw Pact,dominated by
the USSR. From then to now the two  greatest military organizations on earth
have uneasily eyed each other along the German border.

MILITARY FORCES : The Warsaw Pact can deploy almost three million men, about
80,000 armored fighting vehicles,and 6,000 combat aircraft.Against this Jug-
gernaut, the Western powers can field around  two million men, 40,000 AFV's,
and 4,000 combat aircraft.The numerical imbalance is partially offset by the
higher quality of the Western troops and equipment,presumably along with the
traditional advantages of being the defender.Together,the two sides have al-
most ten thousand nuclear weapons for battlefield use in Europe. These range
from small, sub-kiloton shells designed to wipe out troop concentrations, up
to multi-megaton city busters.Artillery,planes,and missiles of all types and
ranges can deliver these weapons.At one time NATO felt it had to use nuclear
weapons to compensate for numerical inferiority. Today it has an alternative
plan: Air-land battle,2000. In this NATO uses superior technology, including
its stealth planes,to attack deep in the rear of the Warsaw Pact armies,des-
troying their logistical support.If this innovative strategy works NATO need
not use nuclear weapons to stem the Red tide.However,if this fails,NATO must
choose between a  nuclear holocaust and the conquest of Europe by the Soviet
Union.

GEOGRAPHY : The Central Front stretches 1000km through the middle of Germany
bordered on the north by the Baltic Sea,and on the south by the Alps.The in-
itial strategic  objective of a  Russian invasion would almost  certainly be
the Rhine river,only 150 km from the frontier (at the closest point).West Ge
rman terrain is mildly favourable to the defender,especially in the forested
and hilly southern half.The broad,flat North German Plain is the traditional
invasion route.But every few kilometers there is a new town,village or city.
Each could become a new defensive bastion.One often neglected geographic co-
nsideration is the terrain to the east of the frontier. With the development
of the "Air-land battle" this  region takes on a new significance. The North
German plain broadens vowards the east,encompassing most of East Germany and
Poland.It is crossed by a number of major rivers flowing northward, channel-
ing road and rail traffic into a variety of bridges.This combination of open
countryside and numerous "choke points" is well suited to air operations.

LEVEL OF CONFLICT : --------------------------------------------------------
COLD WAR : This is the situation of the last 40 years.The two sides maintain
a wary posture,generally trying to avoid overt provocations,probing each ot-
her to gain information,stir discontent in the enemy population,and gain ps-
ychological advantages.The stealth fighter,designed for clandestine penetra-
tion,is the perfect aircraft for the secret operations common in this situa-
tion.

LIMITED WAR : Now the conflict is  at the brink of  open warfare, but armies
have not yet crossed any borders. As military acts escalate, the opportunity
for stealthmissions increases as well.Military actions are political signals
that urge the other to back away in forceful terms. Unfortunately, sometimes
fighting just escalates.This technique was successful for America on Grenada
and against Libya,but it failed in Vietnam.Well,you're just a stealth pilot,
carrying out orders.

CONVENTIONAL WAR : This is it!Russian tanks pour over the West German border
while NATO forces scramble to stem the onrushing tide.On one side lies conv-
entional defeat,on the other the disaster of thermonuclear war.Air-land bat-
tle,2000 goes into effect.Stealth aircraft,airmobile raiding groups,and long
range smart munitions make the  dangerous crossing over  the front to hammer
Soviet rear echelons. If they can isolate the Russian  spearheads from their
base,they may give the politicians an opportunity to avert disaster.

FRIENDLY BASES : -----------------------------------------------------------
West Germany,Holland,and Denmark are studded with airfields that could serve
as bases for stealthraids into Eastern Europe.They form a gentle,north-south
crescent bulging west in the middle.Which is the most suitable startingpoint
for a particular airstrike depends mainly on the location of the target.How-
ever, the stealth fighter's unique characteristics will be most affective in
the areas only thinly  covered by radar  to the north  and south of the main
arena.Therefore,deep penetration raids`ll usually start from Denmark or Sou-
thern Germany. Shorter tactical strikes, however, must fly directly into the
mouth of the tiger.

JUTLAND PENINSULA - VANDEL (CC52) & LECK (CB59): These  far  northern  bases
make ideal jump-off points for raids out across the Baltic.Often it's easier
to deal with missileboats in the Baltic than the heavier SAMdefenses in East
Germany and Poland.

NORTHERN GERMANY (Hanover) - AHLHORN (CB37) & GUTERSLOH (CB53): These bases,
directly behind BAOR(British Army Of The Rhine),face across the flat,densely
populated North German Plain,the most likely axis of advance should the War-
saw Pact attack NATO. Therefore, they represent the most direct route to one
of the greatest concentrationq of hostiles in the world.

CENTRAL GERMANY(Westphalia) - RHEIN-MAIN(CB52) & RAMSTEIN(CB50): These bases
are the great,famous bases of American air power in Europe.Rhein-Main is one
of the largest  military  bases in the world, while Ramstein is headquarters
for the 4th Tactical Air Force.

SOUTHERN GERMANY(Bavaria) - NEUBERG(CA68),LEIPHEIM(CA57) & MEMMINGEN (CA65):
These bases are all Luftwaffe (air force of the Federal Republic of Germany)
but like many German bases,are entirely willing to host American circraft as
needed.Any of these bases makes an excellent jumpoff point for missions into
Czechoslovakia.

SIGHTSEEING FROM THE BALTIC TO BOHEMIA : -----------------------------------
Without doubt, the most impressive sights in this region are  the vast urban
metroplexes,from the northern ports of Hamburg(CB67) and Lubeck(CB77) to the
old cities of Leipzig(CB82) or Warsaw(DB95),or the industrial sprawl of Pra-
gue(DB30) and Krakow(DB90).Those northern areas not covered with cities,tow-
ns or villages are ditided into small plots of farmland. Much of the area is
watered by extensive river systems flowing northward.Bridges large and small
are common near cities.An especially impressive suspension bridge can be fo-
und on the southwestern outskirts of Hamburg(CB67).The southern part of this
region is dominated by low mountains that virtually surround the Czechoslov-
akian lowlands of Bohemia(to the west) and Moravia(to the east). The valleys
and passes amid the mountains provide numerous natural routes, and not c few
flying challenges.Although much of the highland areas were once forested, in
the last few decades  acid rain has  denuded many areas and  started rampant
erosion.The once green mountains are now more frequently brown,gray,and bla-
ck.The much higher Alps, capped by perpetual snow, are generally obscured by
haze to the southwest.

THE EASTERN BLOC : ---------------------------------------------------------
EAST GERMANY : During a limited or conventional war the main strength of the
Warsaw Pact forces will travel  through here, surging into West Germany. The
greates natural  barrier in East Germany is the Elbe River, running from the
Czechoslovakian mountains northward to Hamburg.Destroying these riverbridges
would cut off the Pact's forward troops from their supply lines.Covering the
Pact's forward areas are two main airdefense complexes,one in the north near
Wittstock(CB97) and Wittenburg(CB87),another in the south just east of Leip-
zig and Magdeburg,including the big radars at Mittenwalde(CB93) and Grossen-
haim(CB92).

POLAND : In a NATO-Pact confict Poland is the "rear area" through which Rus-
sian troops and supplies would flow toward the front lines.Many important he
adquarters and depots are situated in the central and western part of the na
tion.The Wista-Vistula river system divides Poland in half,from north to so-
uth.Destroying the road and rail bridges can seriously damage Pact operatio-
ns.Polish defense complexes include a powerful system west of Gdansk at Stu-
psk(DB48),and south of Lodz at"Radom(DB83).In addition,Warsaw(DB95) is a ma-
jor transportation hub, so active SAM batteries can be expected in that area
during wartime.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA : This Pact nation, seperated from Germany by the mountains +
the rugged highlands of the BohemianForest,is likely to play a secondary ro-
le in wartime. Czechoslovakian defenses are also somewhat lighter than those
of East Germany and Poland.Tabor(DA38) is the most significant installation.
Far to the east,guarding the entrance to Hungary and southern Pmland,is ano-
ther defense complex at Konmamo(DA87).

KALINGRAD : This region of Russia,named after the major seaport of Kalingrad
renamed from Konigsberg in 1945,at DB89,is the Soviet front line on the Bal-
tic. It includes a major OTH (over-the-horizon) radarstation at EB09,as well
as the Klaipeda airbase(EC02).

AIR DEFENSES : Since the Central Front forms the focal point of the war, the
anti-aircraft defenses on both sides are the most intensive in the world.The
Soviets are certain to deploy large quantkties of their most modern weapons,
SA-10s + SA-12s,for area defense.In some areas the older,less effective SA-5
long range systems may still be in place.Radar guided SA-8s + SA-11s are the
most commonly used for more local defenses,especially near important milita-
ry concentrations or objectives.A few are even sited near the larger SAM bat
teries to provide local defense.The shorter-ranged infrared SA-9s and espec-
ially SA-13s may appear instead if the radar-guided weapons are not availab-
le.At sea the @altic  missile boats  typically have  either SA-N-5 or SA-N-7
systems,although Krivaks and larger ships with the SA-N-4 can be expected in
wartime.The whole region is alive with lethal metal.The most dangerous areas
will undoubtedly be on or  near the front lines in West Germany, and perhaps
at any invasion sites in Denmark.Also beware of reserve troop concentrations
in East Germany or Poland. But these are relative assessments, not absolute.
Let down your guard anywhere and your aircraft will undoubtedly follow.

AIR FORCES : ---------------------------------------------------------------
The Soviet Air Force is the largest in the world,and one of the most modern.
It deploys a wide variety of interceptor, bomber, and support aircraft. Some
are obsolescent,but many can meet the best of the West. The Soviets know the
value of air superiority.They'll give high priority to that goal in any Euro
pean war.

FIGHTERS : As always,the primary foe is another pilot.With 6,000 combat air-
craft to chose from,you can bet that the Red AirForce`ll find a few to spare
for you.They'll also have the hot new models.If you're lucky,you'll only see
second-line MiG23s,but more likely you'll encounter quality dogfighters like
the MiG-29 and Su-27. In the rear areas you're more likely to see long-range
interceptors like the MiG-25 and MiG-31.

BOMBERS : The Russians have many  different bomber aircraft. One of the most
troublesome is the Tu-95 "Bear" modified to carry cruise missiles. Keeping a
number of these craft in orbit deep behind Russian lines gives them an unto-
uchable airborne nuclear force.Your job as an F-19 attacker is to prove that
this nuclear weapon can be hurt too.

AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING & CONTROL : The Soviet Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C was de-
signed for work in this kind of  environment. Flying "racetrack" orbits deep
behind friendly lines,its powerful radars can see NATO airoperations develop
and radio appropriate orders to various fighter squadrons.The effort to dev-
elop these planes has been long and costly; the sixe,weight + expense of the
electronic gear  is gigantic. Each plane is precious. Eliminating them would
cripple Soviet air operations. Pact appreciates this too, so getting to them
won't be an easy job.

TRANSPORTS : Thousands of air transports will shuttle back and forth on both
sides of the front line,carrying troops,raiding parties,munitions,staff off-
icers,etc. The new Russian  workhorse that flies anywhere and carries almost
anything is the An-72"Coaler".Its high speed and short-field capability make
it the natural choice for secret missions,and a natural target for your ste-
alth fighter.

NAVAL FORCES : -------------------------------------------------------------
The Russian Baltic fleet,headquartered at Baltiysk outside of Kalingrad,con-
trols 4 cruisers,16 destroyers,7 Krivak-class large frigates,22 missileboats
and other light warships,and 21 amphibious assault ships,as well as 45 subs.
It also controls the East German and Polish navies,which have numerous addi-
tional frigates and missile boats.Tjis force has two goals:to cover the nor-
thern flank of the Warsaw Pact from air attack, and to invade Denmark in the
event of war.Stealth missions will generally deal with the former,your prob-
lem being how to penetrate the  warship screen in the Baltic. Because of the
many confusing classes of Russian, Polish  and East German missile boats and
frigates,it's always wise to check the  data on a ship. The SA-N-5 is just a
first generation IR homer,and no serious threat. The SA-N-4 uses older pulse
radar gukdance,but the new SA-N-7 is a more serious problem.Fortunately very
few Baltic warships carry the powerful,long-ranged SA-N-10.

KEY TO USAF ORDNANCE SUMMARY : ---------------------------------------------
The M61A1 cannon is fixed in the nose and always available.
QTY              : The number of weapons of this type the aircraft can carry
                   in one of the bay positions (you have four).
WEAPON           : The name of the weapon.
MAX RANGE        : Maximum range at which the weapon can be launched / fired
                   most effectively. A 0km range means the weapon is a free-
                   fall/retarded bomb  that must be dropped onto the target.
MAX SPEED        : The speed at which the weapon reaches the target. This is
                   given in knots so you can compare it with your own flight
                   speed.GLIDES means the weapon 'flies' without power.There
                   fore your speed, at the time of launch, becomes the speed
                   of the weapon.RETARDED means the weapon is a retardedbomb
                   that falls away behind the craft,decelerating as it drops
                   Some retarded weapons even  open a parachute during their
                   descent,to stabilize the fall and line up the warhead(s).
                   FREE FALL means the weapon is a traditional freefall bomb
                   that arcs downward to the target.
GUIDANCE SYSTEM  : If the weapon has an onboard targeting system,it`s menti-
                   oned here for general intereqt.
ATTACK ALTITUDE  : The recommended altitude for the typical attackmethod.The
                   "500+" entry means any altitude above 500feet is fine.The
                   "500'c" entry means that a toss-bombing technique is used
                   where the bomb is launched while  the plane climbs to 500
                   feet.
ATTACK TECHNIQUES: This references the appropriate attack technique. Techni-
                   ques noted in second place (e.g. toss/level; level is the
                   one we mean here) are  alternate attack  methods that are
                   either more dangerous or more difficult to learn.See "How
                   to Fight" earlier and "Air-to-Ground Tactics" for more de
                   tails.

KEY TO AIR-TO-AIR MISSILES (AAMs) : ----------------------------------------
SYSVEM NAME     : The name of the missile system.
PLANE           : Type of plane which  can carry  the missile. If a specific
                  plane is listed, only those planes can carry that missile.
                  Aircraft listed are restricted to those commonly encounte-
                  red.ANY USA means any plane of the USAirForce,but not cur-
                  rent or former American allies.ANY WESTERN means planes of
                  a western-allied nation, including former  American allies
                  such as Iran,or neutrals such as Sweden.ANY USSR means any
                  plane of a USSR-allied nation,including such Soviet allies
                  as Libya,Finland,Iraq,East Germany,Czecholslovakia,Poland.
GUIDANCE SYSTEM : How the missile  finds its  target. SAPR means Semi-active
                  Pulse Radar.This requires that the launching plane contin-
                  ues to paint the target with radar until the missile hits.
                  ADR means Active Doppler Radar.The missile has its own ra-
                  dar set,allowing the plane to fire and forget.In addition,
                  the missile's doppler radar is only fooled by chaff if the
                  target plane generates a small doppler (by running perpen-
                  dicular to the missile's course).IR1 means Infra-Red(First
                  generation). Missile is a first generation infrared homer.
                  It chases the hot engine exhaust only,and is easily fooled
                  by jammers and flares.IR2 means Infra-Red (Second generat-
                  ion).The missile is a second generation infrared homer. It
                  aims at any hot part of a plane, including the nose, wings
                  and tail as well as the engineexhausts.It can recover from
                  jamming and continue seeking a target.
EFFECTIVE RANGE : Maximum range at which the missile can lock on to a target
MAXIMUM SPEED   : Launching speed of the missile. Mach 1 is about 660 knots.

KEY TO SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES (SAMs) : ------------------------------------
NAME            : The commonly used name of the system.
MOUNTING        : How the system operates when seen.Site means fixed missile
                  launchers are positioned around a central radar station in
                  a "star" pattern. Vehicles means the missile launchers and
                  radars are mounted on vehicles.Vehicles are usually parked
                  on open ground in an irregular pattern. Radars and missile
                  launchers are on  seperate vehicles, so they remain fairly
                  close together. Vehicles sometimes have both radars + mis-
                  siles.Although a battery usually has 2 to 4 vehicles,often
                  widely dispersed.Warship means the radar and missile laun-
                  cher are mounted on a warship.Infantry means the missile`s
                  man-packed,and therefore carried by ground military units,
                  including installation guards, as well as by well-equipped
                  terrorists.
SEARCH GUIDANCE : The type and quality of search  radar used by the missile.
                  Eyesight is a very poor search method.Doppler Radar measu-
                  res the change in range; it is most effective when you fly
                  toward or away from it,least effective when you arc around
                  it at a constant distance. Pulse Radar bounces signals off
                  a surface;it is most effective when you fly sideways to it
                  least affective when you fly straight at it.
SEARCH RANGE    : The theoretical maximum range of the search radar.However,
                  against your F-19 radar performance is greatly reduced.The
                  quality of the radar + local conditions determine its real
                  effective range.
FIRING GUIDANCE : The way the missile finds your aircraft. Pulse and doppler
                  radars have varying effectiveness depending on your flight
                  path in relation to the missile.BRPR means BeamRider pulse
                  radar;the missile uses pulse radar guidance,with the radar
                  receiver at the launching site.It cannot "burn through" ja
                  mming at close range.SAPR means SemiActive pulse radar;the
                  missile uses pulse radar guidance, with the radar receiver
                  in the missile. Therefore it may "burn through" jamming at
                  close range.SADR means Semi-Active doppler radar; the mis-
                  sile uses doppler  radar guidance, with the radar receiver
                  in the missile. It too can "burn through" jamming at close
                  range.SACGDR means SemiActive with CommandGuidance doppler
                  radar;the missile uses doppler radar guidance,with the ra-
                  dar receiver in the missile. It can "burn through" jamming
                  at close range. In addition it  has  command guidance that
                  permits multiple attacks should the first attack miss. IR1
                  means IR homing (first gen.);the missile uses infrared ho-
                  ming that seeks hot exhausts.It is very vulnerable to both
                  jamming and flares. IR2 means IR homing (second gen.); the
                  missile uses infrared homing  that seeks  any hot surface,
                  including nose,wing  edges,tail,etc. It has logic circuits
                  that help it recover from  jamming or flares. Visual means
                  the missile is guided by a controller on the ground,who mu
                  st watch your plane and react to your maneuvering.
FIRING RANGE    : Maximum range at which the missile is fired.
MAX SPEED       : Maximum speed in flight of the missile. Mach 1 is 660 kts.
MAX ALT         : Maximum altitude the missile can reach.
MANEUVERABILITY : The turning ability of the missile in flight.

AIR-TO-AIR ARMAMENT : ======================================================
F19 WEAPONRY : -------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : M61A1 20mm "Vulcan"
PURPOSE          : Very short range general purpose gun
QUANTITY         : 1 fixed internally
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 3 km
MAXIMUM RANGE    : 6 km
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Tracking camera/laser historical gunsight

NOTES : This six-barrel gatling-gun type cannon is the  standard internal ar
mament of most US fighters today,including the F4,F14,F15,F16 and F18.It can
fire 6000 rounds a minute,a high rate of fire that increases the chance that
a shell will be in the "same piece of sky" as the target aircraft.Of course,
this rate of fire also means that a wise pilot must fire in short bursts (o-
therwise he'll quickly exhaust all his ammunition).

GUIDANCE         : Second generation ("all aspect") infrared seeker
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 17 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3+
MANEUVERABILITY  : Excellent
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Air-to-Air "fire and forget"

NOTES : Almost every aspect of this missile has been redesigned and upgraded
numerous times.The "M" model is the latest,with a greatly improved allaspect
seekerhead,a new warhead and an improved rocket engine.Although an "N" model
exists,it represents rebuilds of early "B" and "E" models + is less reliable
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AIM-120A AMRAAM
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air  missile with active radar homing
QUANTITY ON RACK : 3
GUIDANCE         : Active radar homing (has its own radar in nose)
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 32 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 4
MANEUVERABILITY  : Very good
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Air-to-Air "fire and forget"

NOTES : This is the West's first radar-guided fire + forget missile.The AMR-
AAM(advanced medium range air-to-air missile) has its own internal guidance,
onboard TrackWhileScanning radar,and computerized target discrimination.Pre-
production + early production models are becoming available to Stealth units

ENEMY CANNONS : ============================================================
NAME             : M61A1 20mm "Vulcan"
PURPOSE          : Very short range general purpose gun
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 3 km
MAXIMUM RANGE    : 6 km
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Radar predicting gunsight

NOTES : This gun is carried  by  Iranian F4 Phantom and F14 Tomcat fighters,
which were purchased from the USA in the 1970s, when Iran was still an Amer-
ican ally.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : GSh-23 23mm Cannon
PURPOSE          : Very short range general purpose gun
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 3 km
MAXIMUM RANGE    : 6 km
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Radar predicting gunsight

NOTES : This is the standard aerial cannon of USSR built aircraft.It`s a tw-
in-barrel design that fires about 3000 rds/min.Range is equivalent to the US
weapon.The slow rate of fire (compared to the American M61) makes  it a less
effective weapon.A 6-barrel version with a rate of fire equivalent to the Am
erican weapon may arm the MiG-29 and/or Su-27.

ENEMY IR AAMS : ============================================================
NAME             : AIM-9H "Sidewinder"
PURPOSE          : Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 12 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3+
MANEUVERABILITY  : Excellent
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Locks onto tail exhaust,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : This was the most advanced model Sidewinder sold by America to Iran.
The missile is solid, reliable and easy to maintain. Admirable features that
unfortunately means it must be taken seriously by American planes flying ag-
ainst Iran.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-2 "Atoll"
PURPOSE          : Shopt range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
GUIDANCE         : First generation infrared seeker
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 14 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 2.5
MANEUVERABILITY  : Very good
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Locks onto tail exhaust,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : This early 1960s vintage IR missile is  now obsolete. However,it was
produced in vast quantities and sold throughout the world to Soviet clients.
As a result,it is still carried by aircraft of poorer nations,as well as the
second-line planes of larger and richer nations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-6 "Acrid" (IR)
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
GUIDANCE         : First generation infrared seeker
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 50 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 4
MANEUVERABILITY  : Poor
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Locks onto tail exhaust,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : Designed exclusively for the MiG25 interceptor,this missile is an IR
version of the powerful AA-6 radar homer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-7 "Apex" (IR)
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
GUIDANCE         : First generation infrared seeker
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 34 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3
MANEUVERABILITY  : Fair
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Locks onto tail exhaust,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : This Missile is an IR version of the AA-7 radar guided AAM.It is mo-
st commonly found on MiG-23s.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-8 "Aphid"
PURPOSE          : Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
GUIDANCE         : Early second generation infrared seeker
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 12 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3
MANEUVERABILITY  : Excellent
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : All-aspect lock on,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : This small,lightweight missile is a pure dogfighting missile. Altho-
ugh its IR seeker may be inferior to the AIM9M it`s considerably superior to
earlier Soviet designs.This missile is replacing the now obsolete AA2,and is
carried by just about every Soviet-built fighter,interceptor and combat hel-
icopter now in service.Soviet clients within Europe have the weapon,as do an
increcsing number of client states and customers around the world.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-10 "Alamo" (IR)
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
GUIDANCE         : Second generation infrared seeker
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : about 64 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3+
MANEUVERABILITY  : Good
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : All-aspect lock on,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : This missile is the IR  version of the AA-10. It may be the longest-
ranged second-generation IR missile in the Soviet inventory today.

ENEMY RADAR AAMS : =========================================================
NAME             : AIM-7E "Sparrow"
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile, semi-active radar homing
GUIDANCE         : Semi-active radar homing (radar guidance from plane)
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 44 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3.7
MANEUVERABILITY  : Very good
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft

NOTES : Nicknamed "The Great White Hope"  because of its  prominent exhaust-
plume,this missile was Americas standard radar AAM in the 1960s + 1970s. The
missile is not especially accurate,and depends on a close match with the fi-
ring aircraft's radar.Both the missile and radar demand regular and exacting
maintenance.Although Iranian F-4s have this weapon,all these drawbacks grea-
tly compromise its effective ness.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-6 "Acrid" (Radar)
PURPOSE          : Long range air-to-air missile,semi-active radar homing
GUIDANCE         : Semi-active radar homing (radar guidance from plane)
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 50 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 4
MANEUVERABILITY  : Poor
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft

NOTES : This huge missile is the standard  long-range armament of PVO MiG-25
interceptors, and is roughly equivalent (though technically inferior) to the
Phoenix AAM on the F-14.The missile  is matched  purely to  the MiG-25;other
aircraft cannot control it.MiG-25Rs sold to Soviet client states aren`t nor-
mally equipped with this weapon.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-7 "Apex" (Radar)
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile,semi-active radar homing
GUIDANCE         : Semi-active radar homing (radar guidance from plane)
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 34 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3
MANEUVERABILITY  : Poor
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft

NOTES : Was the standard USSR radar homing missile of the 1970s, the Russian
equivalent of the AIM7 "Sparrow".It requires a matching aircraft radar,found
in MiG-23s of the USSR + Warsaw Pact.Many MiG-23s sold to smaller Soviet cli
ents outside of Europe had inferior radars incapable of controlling this mis
sile.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-9 "Amos"
PURPOSE          : Long range air-to-air missile,semi-active radar homing
GUIDANCE         : Semi-active radar homing (radar guidance from plane)
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 82 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3.5
MANEUVERABILITY  : Fair
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft

NOTES : This new,large missile is a revision or redesign of the AA-6 "Acrid"
and is designed exclusively for the MiG31 interceptor.There are some reports
that the missile is an active radar homer (i.e.,has its own radar), allowing
fire and forget launching. There is even speculation  that the missile could
receive mid-course corrections from the launching aircraft or a ground radar
station,but it is unlikely that Russian computer electronics  are capable of
successfully implementing this yet.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-10 "Alamo"
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile,active radar homing
GUIDANCE         : Active radar homing"(has its own radar in nose)
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 64 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3+
MANEUVERABILITY  : Good
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Active radar homing independent of launching aircraft

NOTES : This new,medium-sized radar AAM is strongly believed to be an active
radar homer,that is,it carries its own onboard radar for "fire + forget use,
like the AIM-120 AMRAAM.It`s commonly found on the new MiG-29 and Su-27.

AIR-TO-GROUND ARMAMENT : ===================================================
CANNON : -------------------------------------------------------------------
M61A1 20mm Cannon   : 20mm cannon listed in  the air-to-air armament section
                      can be used against ground targets as well.

GUIDED MISSILES : ==========================================================
NAME                : Penguin-3 ASM
PURPOSE             : Medium-altitude infrared-homing anti-ship missile
QUANTITY PER BAY    : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS  : Grade B,Ships at sea
EFFECTIVE RANGE     : 32 km
MAXIMUM SPEED       : Mach 0.8
ATTACK TECHNIQUE    : Air-Ground fire+forget launch against any warship
MIN LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 500'
MAX LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 40,000'

NOTES : Designed by Norway, this modestly-sized + priced missile is aimed at
a point on the surface + flies there under its own inertial guidance.At this
pre-designated point the missile switches on infrared homer,seeking the heat
of a ship against the ocean background.The missile is not a sea-skimmer, and
is therefore easier to shoot down. However, the missiles guidance system are
entirely passive unlike the Harpoon,which broadcasts its presence with radar
signals.Although maximum range in highaltitude launch is supposedly 80km,the
range used here is appropriate to a lower  altitude attack. Supplies of this
weapon are limited because the USgovernment is reluctant to purchase weapons
from the same source that sold  important military technology to the USSR in
the year 1981.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                : AGM-84A "Harpoon"
PURPOSE             : Seas-kimming radar&inertial-guided anti-ship missile
QUANTITY PER BAY    : 1
OPTIMUM TARGETS     : Grade A,Ships at sea
EFFECTIVE RANGE     : 60 km
MAXIMUM SPEED       : Mach 0.8
ATTACK TECHNIQUE    : Air-Ground fire+forget launch against any warship
MIN LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 500'
MAX LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 40,000'

NOTES : The Harpoon is the standard antiship missile  of the American Navy +
Air Force.This weapon is more powerful,longer ranged and harder to stop than
the Penguin.It`s launched under inertial guidance with considerable computer
assistance,lying at sea-skimming altitudes to avoid detection.At a preprogr-
ammed point it turns on its radar,to find and home in on the target. Depend-
ing on the terminal guidance package  installed it will either pop up + dive
on the target,or fly straight in.Like most anti-shipping missiles,the remai-
ning rocket fuel is almost as destructive as the warhead itself.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                : AGM-88A HARM
PURPOSE             : High speed anti-radiation (Homes on radar) missile
QUANTITY PER BAY    : 1
OPTIMUM TARGETS     : Grade A,Ground radar stations
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS  : Grade B,Warship radars
EFFECTIVE RANGE     : 20 km
MAXIMUM SPEED       : Mach 2+
ATTACK TECHNIQUE    : Air-Ground fire+forget launch against any radar
MIN LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 500'
MAX LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 60,000'

NOTES : This is America's most advanced anti-radar missile.It locks and hom-
es on hostile radars even if they jump frequencies or switch off.The US Def-
ense Department has hinted that it can even home on radarset components that
are still warm,even if the set itself is turned off ! The missile also has a
"loiter" mode where it`s fired blind and circles,waiting for a hostile radar
to appear so it can attack it. The "loiter" attack mode  is not available to
HARMs carried on the F-19.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                : AGM-65D "Maverick"
PURPOSE             : Thermal-imaging air-to-ground guided missile
QUANTITY PER BAY    : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS  : Grade B, Bridges,bunkers,sites,oil facilities,ships
POOR TARGETS        : Grade C,Airbase hangars,ground planes,buildings,depots
EFFECTIVE RANGE     : 32 km
MAXIMUM SPEED       : Mach 1+
ATTACK TECHNIQUE    : Air-Ground fire-and-forget launch
MIN LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 500'
MAX LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 40,000'

NOTES : The Maverick is America's standard air-to-ground guided missile, and
has a wide variety of guidancesystems.The original design put a simple video
camera in the missiles nose.While the missile remained attached to the plane
the pilot used a miniature stick and screen to aim the bomb at the target be
low,locked it in,and released the weapon.Once in flight the bomb steered to-
ward the image locked into its computer brain.Later versions added zoom-len-
ses,PAVETACK lasers,and ultimately,in the "D" model, a FLIR (forward-looking
infrared) thermal imaging system that can "see" through clouds,smoke,and ni-
ght.The missile usually  carries a shaped-charge  warhead for maximum effect
against hardened targets impervious to normal bombing attacks. However, high
explosive warheads can be fitted instead for maximum destructive effect aga-
inst unarmored targets.

LASER-GUIDED BOMBS : =======================================================
NAME                   : GBU-12 "Paveway"
PURPOSE                : Laser-guided glide bmmb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Hangars,buildings,bridges, bunkers, depots,
                         missile sites, radar sites, oil facilities
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Ships
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Glide bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Toss bombing or level bombing
TOSS BOMBING ALTITUDE  : 500' and climb
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 2,000' and turn away

NOTES : The GBU-12 is one of the standard laser-guided bombs in the US armo-
ry.Large fighter-bombers like the F-111 favor heavier 1,000lb and 2,000lb mo
dels, but the F-19 must carry lighter weight munitions in its small bays.The
PaveTack guidance system is the most accurate way of placing a bomb on a tar
get(short of using a guided missile like the Maverick).The advantage of usi-
ng a bomb is that the weapon weight is almost entirely explosive,while guid-
ed missiles must, of necessity,use some of their weight for the rocket motor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : CBU-72 FAE
PURPOSE                : Laser-guided triple fuel-air explosive bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
OPTIMUM TARGETS        : Grade A,Buildings
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Submarine pens,hangars,bunkers,oilplatforms
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Ships
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Glide bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Toss bombing or level bombing
TOSS BOMBING ALTITUDE  : 500' and climb
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 2,000' and turn away

NOTES : This weapon contains a mixture of three heavier-than-air gases. When
the bomb lands,the gases are released into the air,forming an explosive mix-
ture.A delayed-action fuse ignites the mixture,which causes the contaminated
air to burn.As well as incinerating everything,the burning gas expands inst-
antly. In the open air this is sufficient to set  off mines and flatten soft
objects (such as men).However,in an enclosed space the effect is vastly mag-
nified,with the walls,floor and roof of the structure broken and blown apart
The result in underground  structures (submarine pens) is total destruction.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : Mk 20 "Rockeye" II
PURPOSE                : Laser-guided high-explosive cluster bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B, Grounded planes, buildings,depots, missile
                         sites,radar sites,oil facilities,ships
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Glide bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Toss bombing or level bombing
TOSS BOMBING ALTITUDE  : 500' and climb
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 2,000' and turn away

NOTES : This weapon marries a  laser-guided  glide-bomb  system with a Mk 20
Rockeye cluster munition.The laser guidance allows for earlier release + gre
ater bomblet release accuracy.With an area weapon like a cluster bomb the fo
rmer is more important,since it gives an increased safety margin to the laun
ching aircraft.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : Mk 20 "Rockeye
PURPOSE                : Retarded fragmentation cluster bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Grounded planes, buildings, depots, missile
                         sites,radar sites,oil facilities
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Ships
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Retarded bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Low-altitude level bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 500'

NOTES : This cluster bomb breaks open about 100' above the surface, spinning
out 247 shaped-charge bomblets that can destroy buildings, armored vehicles,
and people.The opening height  and pattern can be pre-set  for various types
of targets.The U.S. Navy discovered these bombs were effective against small
warships when a single cluster bomb  wrecked a Libyan Nanuchka-class missile
boat in 1986.Of course,not all warships are as vulnerable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : Durandal Bomb
PURPOSE                : Parachute-deployed runway-penetration bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
OPTIMUM TARGETS        : Grade A,Runways
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Bridges
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Retarded bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Low-altitude level bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 500'

NOTES : This is the standard antirunway weapon in the US arsenal,even though
it's French made.When the Durandal is released over target it deploys a para
chute.This causes it to float nose-down and roughly stationary over the run-
way surface.Then its rocket motor ignites,blasting the warhead straight down
through the concrete,where a delayed action fuse explodes it. This heaves up
large sections of runway surface, while smaller  shards fly hundreds of feet
through the air.The result is a thoroughly ruined surface + tons of wreckage
that requires both heavy equipment and considerable time to repair.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : ISC B-1 Minelets
PURPOSE                : Parachute-deployed minelet dispenser
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 1
OPTIMUM TARGETS        : Grade A,Runways
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Buildings,depots,SAM sites,oil facilities
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Retarded bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Low altitude level bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 500'

NOTES : This new weapon breaks  open at altitude  and dispenses a variety of
small anti-personnel, anti-vehicle and delayed fuse mines. Used on airfields
they prevent flight operations until cleared.They can also cause problems a-
round open-air structures such as refineries,oilwells etc.Clearing the mines
is complicated by the variety of types, as well as random delayed-fuse bombs
(i.e.,you'll never know when another will explode!).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : Mk 82-1 "Snakeye"
PURPOSE                : Retarded high-explosive ("iron") bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 3
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Grounded planes,buildings,depots,oil facil.
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Radar sites
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Retarded bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Low altitude level bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 500'

NOTES : Retarded bombs use parachutes as vanes to slow their descent, allow-
ing the plane to clear the area before they land + explode. As a result they
can be dropped from a lower altitude than free-fall bombs. However, they are
less accurate, making them unsuitable against small targets.For the most ac-
curate release,retarded bombs should be dropped in level flight. The Snakeye
is the standard vane-type retarder  unit for many US bombs, here attached to
the Mk 82 500 lb. high-explosive bomb.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : Mk 35 IN Cluster
PURPOSE                : Retarded incendiary cluster bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
OPTIMUM TARGETS        : Grade A,Grounded planes,depots,missile sites,oil f.
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Buildings
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Radar sites,ships
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Retarded bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Low-altitude level bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 500'

NOTES : This cluster bomb is similar to the Rockeye,but filled with 57 incen
diary bomblets.The cluster breaks apart in mid-air,spreading the bomblets o-
ver an area of several hundred yards.Then each bomblet spreads a burning li-
quid wherever it lands. The result is a raging fire that completely covers a
wide area.

FREE-FALL BOMBS : ==========================================================
NAME                   : MK 82-0 "Slick"
PURPOSE                : Free fall high explosive ("iron") bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 3
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Buildings,depots,oil facilities on land
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Hangars,grounded planes,missile sites,radar
                         sites,oil platforms,ships.
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Free-fall bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Level bombing or dive bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 3,000'
DIVE BOMBING ALTITUDE  : Dive from 8,000',release at 3,000'

NOTES : This weapon is the traditional 500 lb high explosive bomb, virtually
unchanged in concept since WWII.The effectiveness of this bomb depends almo-
st entirely on the skill of the bomber.The most important considerction when
using "iron" bombs is that  releases below 2000' don't give the bomb time to
arm in flight,causing "dud" hits.This occurred in the Falklands war of 1982,
when Argentine pilots repeatedly  hit British ships  with bombs dropped from
50' to 100'.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : MK 122 "Fireye"
PURPOSE                : Free fall incendiary ("fire") bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Grounded planes,buildings,depots,oil facil.
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C, Hangars,bunkers,missile sites,radar sites,
                         oil platforms, ships.
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Free-fall bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Level bombing or dive bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 3,000'
DIVE BOMBING ALTITUDE  : Dive from 8,000',release at 3,000'

NOTES : This weapon contains an incendiary gel that spreads a burning liquid
over a wide area. The liquid can flow into vents, grates,weapon slits, etc.,
makine it effective against vehicles and  fortifications as well as open-air
targets. Of course, the bomb must be placed on the target with some accuracy
to achieve this effect.Bombing skill`s extremely important with this weapon.

OTHER EQUIPMENT : ==========================================================
NAME               : 135mm/IR Camera
PURPOSE            : Visual+Infrared photographic  reconnaissance camera
QUANTITY PER BAY   : 1
TARGETS            : Any
ATTACK TECHNIQUE   : Level low-altitude photographic run
PHOTO RUN ALTITUDE : 200'

NOTES : This pallette contains a 135mm high resolution camera for use in vis
ible light,and a second camera for infrared thermal photography.Both photogr
aphs are taken simultaneously under pilot control.When this camera is deplo-
yed through the bomb bay,the F-19's tracking  camera is "frozen" into a pre-
programmed  position,allowing it to function as a viewer for the 135mm lens.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME               : 1900 lbs Fuel
PURPOSE            : Additional fuel for extended range flying
QUANTITY PER BAY   : 1
EFFECTIVE RANGE    : Improves flight range by 19% per tank

NOTES : This fuel container gives extra range with the mininum container wei
ght.It replaces the weapons mounting in one bay. The fuel can be transferred
into the main tanks by the flip of a switch because the F-19 turbofan engine
fuel lines run only to the main tanks.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME               : Special Airdropping Secret Equipment
QUANTITY PER BAY   : 1
ATTACK TECHNIQUE   : Airdrop from level flight or land at airstrip
AIRDROP ALTITUDE   : 500' to 1000'

NOTES : Airdropped equipment in the F19 uses a simple ripcord-and-chute des-
ign.The equipment package is released from the weapons bay,a long ripcord re
mains attached.Within a second the cord draws taught + pulls open the chute.

SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE SYSTEMS : ===========================================
RADAR RATINGS : Pulse radars are generally less effective than dopplerradars
Obsolescent radars of either type are greatly inferior to modern radars.As a
result,modern doppler radars are the most dangerous, while obsolescent pulse
radars are the least dangerous.Ranges are given in km.Note that a maximum fi
ring range is often less than the maximum search range,due to the limited fu
el carried by most missiles.
GUIDANCE SYSTEMS : Radar guided missiles, with/without command guidance, are
confused by your ECM jammer unless they are very close.If they are close,ch-
aff is needed instead.Infrared guided missiles  are confused by your IR jam-
mer unless very close,where flares are used instead.A decoy is effective ag-
ainst any type of missile.Visually guided missiles cannot be fooled, but are
usually slow reacting,allowing you to outmaneuver them fairly easily.Maximum
speed is a useful measure  of whether you can outrun a missile, and how much
reaction time you have if one is fired. Mach 1 or 2 missiles are fairly slow
and easier to deal with. Mach 3 or faster missiles  are much more formidable
opponents.Maximum altitude is also a useful measure, since in some cases you
can fly above the missile's ceiling.Maneuverability indicates how easy it is
to outmaneuver the missile.The less maneuverable the missile,the better your
chance of turning perpendicular to its course and outmaneuvering it.

RADAR-CONTROLLED SAMS : ====================================================
The standard long-range SAM is controlled by radar.First the search radar sc
ans the sky to find your plane.Searchradars are graphically portrayed in the
pre-flight briefing,and on your cockpit CRTmaps.When the search system finds
your plane,it will "hand off" the  prospective target to a  narrow beam fire
control radar,usually running on a different frequency.The "TRAK" warning li
ght in the cockpit alerts you whenever a narrow-beam tracking radar "paints"
your craft.Tracking continues while the missile is airborne.Beam Rider radar
guided missiles are the least flexible.They "ride" the controlling radars be
am.They can be easily jammed,have poor maneuverability,and cannot "turn aro-
und" for a second attack if they miss. Semi-Active radar guided missiles are
more flexible.They can burn through jamming as they approach the target, and
often have better maneuverability.However,like beam-riders,they cannot "turn
around" for a second attack if they miss. Command Guidance radar-guided mis-
siles are the most flexible.Like semi-active missiles, they can burn through
jamming at short distances + have good maneuverability. In addition,they can
be commanded to turn around and try again if they miss on the first pass.

NAME                  : SA-2 "Guideline"
PURPOSE               : Long-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar bunker with missile emplacements
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 200 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Obsolescent pulse radar "beam-rider"
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 125 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 3+
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 55,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very poor

NOTES : This very old system is used  by many third world  nations outfitted
with Soviet equipment.Although the radar systems have been upgraded over the
last two decades,they are still inferior to modern systems.The last time SA2
were used effectively was the air defense of North Vietnam in the early 70s.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-5 "Gammon"
PURPOSE               : Long-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar bunker with missile emplacements
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 350 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Obsolescent pulse radar "beam-rider"
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 150 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 3
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 95,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Poor

NOTES : The SA5 is the largest + longest ranged SAM in the world today.Howe-
ver,bigger is not always better. Missile accuracy at extreme ranges is poor,
its radar control system mediocre,and the huge missile has very poor maneuv-
erability.Still,the extreme range poses a formidable threat.In its 1986 exc-
hanges with Libya,the US Navy's first priority was disabling the SA-5 Gammon
batteries with HARM missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-10 "Grumble"
PURPOSE               : Long-range fixed-site or vehicular radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar bunker or armored vehicle with missile emplace
                        ments or armored vehicle missile launchers.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Phased-array doppler radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH Range  : 320 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern doppler radar and command guidance
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 125 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 3
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : Over 70,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This semi-mobile all-altitude defense system was originally designed
to defend the borders of the USSR from both cruise missiles and aircraft.How
ever,recent failures  to detect and engage  low-flying aircraft suggest this
system is less than perfect.The SA-10 is a new generation long range air def
ense weapon designed to replace the obsolgscent SA-5 Gammon.Because this wea
pon is new, details may be innaccurate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-4 "Ganef"
PURPOSE               : Medium-range fixed-site/vehicular  radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar bunker with missile emplacements, or radar and
                        launcher on tracked vehicles
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 100 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Obsolescent pulse radar & semi-active radar homing
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 70 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 75,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very poor

NOTES : The SA-4 was Russia's first mobile,battlefield SAM,designed to accom
pany large military formations as they maneuver on the battlefield.It opera-
tes in the rear areas of the front lines,attacking aircraft that IR SAMs fa-
il to hit.The SA-4 entered service in the 1960s. It is now obsolescent,found
only in 2nd and 3rd line Russian units.It has been sold extensively to Russ-
ian allies and client states.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-12 "Gladiator"
PURPOSE               : Medium/long-range site / vehicular radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Temporary site with radar  and missile launchers, or
                        dispersed radar and launcher vehicles
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Phased-array doppler radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 290 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern doppler radar and command guidance
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 150 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 3+
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : Over 70,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This very new system is believed to be a semi-mobile SAM designed to
accompany armies,deploying far rear.From that position the missile can prov-
ide a wide umbrella of defense  against both air raids  and missile attacks.
Because this weapon is quite new,the details may be innaccurate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-6 "Gainful"
PURPOSE               : Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar and launcher on tracked vehicles
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH Range  : 80 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Obsolescent pulse radar and command guidance
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2.8
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 60,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This medium ranged battlefield SAM is also obsolescent in the Russi-
an army, but extensively used by the first-line  forces of Soviet allies and
client states.It is designed to accompany combat troops,protecting them from
positions only a short distance behind the front lines. The missile was very
effective in the first few days of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War,but soon succum
bed to advanced ECM jammers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-8 "Gecko"
PURPOSE               : Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar and launcher on a single vehicle
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Modern pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 125 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern pulse radar,semi-active with video backup
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 65 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 25,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This shorter-ranged but higher quality successor to the SA-6 was the
standard "up front" radar SAM of the Soviet Army in the 1970s + early 1980s.
Now being replaced  by the SA-11, it is likely to appear among the armies of
Russia's allies and client states soon.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-11 "Gadfly"
PURPOSE               : Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar and launcher on a single vehicle
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Modern doppler radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 200 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern pulse radar,backup unknown
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 100 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 45,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This weapon is the "next generation"  battlefield radar SAM designed
to replace the SA-6 and SA-8.The weapon is very new, and details may well be
inaccurate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : MIM-23B "Hawk"
PURPOSE               : Medium-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar bunker or trailer with missile launcher empla-
                        cements or trailers
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Modern pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 175 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern pulse radar and command guidance
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 125 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 52,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : The HAWK has long been the standard SAM of the USA, with various mo-
dels exported to allies, including Iran. Lt.Colonel North's famous arms deal
to Iran included extra parts and missiles for HAWK batteries,then Irans most
powerful air defense system. This missile was adequate for the 1970s, but is
no longer "state of the art" against first-line 1980s aircraft.The US Army's
replacement,the MIM-104 "Patriot" has not been sold to any other nation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : "Rapier"
PURPOSE               : Short-range fixed-site visual/radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Combined radar+launcher pedestal,or tracked vehicle.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Modern pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 75 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Optical command guidance with semi-active pulse rad-
                        ar backup system.
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 65 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2+
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 24,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This is a British high-precision,high-speed SAM for general battlef-
ield defense (roughly equivalent to the SA-8).However it is greatly hampered
by its short range,and was not very effective in the Falklands for this rea-
son.Pedestal versions were sold to the Iranian air force for airbase defense
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-N-4
PURPOSE               : Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Integral to warship
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Depends on the ship,usually some type of pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Depends on the ship.Typically 100-200 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern pulse radar with video backup
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 25,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This missile is the naval version of the SA8 Gecko,used on some cru-
isers,frigates,newer missile boats (including the Nanuchka class),and amphi-
bious warfare ships. The twin missile launcher  pops up from an armored silo
when ready to fire. The missiles can be  fired against surface ships as well
as airplanes, but are ineffective against  modern anti-ship cruise missiles.
This is a serious drawback,since many cruisers have a longer range than this
SAM-System.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-N-6
PURPOSE               : Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Integral to warship
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Phased array doppler radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 300+ km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern doppler radar and command guidance
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 125 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 3
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : over 70,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Average

NOTES : This is the naval version of the SA10 Grumble long-range air-defense
SAM,mounted on the Kiev-class aircraft carriers and Kirov-class battlecruis-
ers.It is an excellent all-altitude weapon capable of reaching out long dis-
tances to intercept incoming airstrikes before they launch their own missil-
es,as well as planes that approach more closely.It is also designed to shoot
down incoming cruise missiles,should a hostile aircraft manage to launch one
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-N-7
PURPOSE               : Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Integral to warship
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Depends on ship,usually modern doppler radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Depends on the ship,50 to 200 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern pulse radar,backup unknown
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 100 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 45,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This is the naval equivalent of the SA11 Gadfly,found on Sovremennyy
class and later destroyers.It is a good self-defense weapon against air att-
acks that fly near or  over the ship, but lacks the range to  engage distant
planes launching anti ship cruisemissiles.This missile is not good enough to
shoot down anti-ship cruise missiles,but the Sovremennyys carry 30mm gatling
guns for that job.

SHORT RANGE IR & VISUAL SAMS : =============================================
Expensive,sophisticated short range SAMs rely on search radars, but the less
expensive designs use simple eyesight.Once acquired,the target may be track-
ed by eyesight,cameras or radar.If the missile is an IR homer,it is aimed a-
long the tracking line,and its infrared seeker turned on.When the seeker lo-
cks onto the target the missile is launched.From that point onward the miss-
ile steers itself,using its seeker.Infrared seekers home on heat sources."Fi
rst generation" seekers were easily confused by the sun,common distress fla-
res,even greenhouses or sun-heated rocks.More modern "second generation" se-
ekers have filters,improved technology and  computer logic, making them more
difficult to "fool" with  jammers or flares. Visually guided weapons require
that the controller guide the  missile to the target in sight. Early designs
such as the Tigercat and Seacat required the  controller to actually fly the
missile like a plane,later designs such as the Rapier requier the the contr-
oller just keep the target in his crosshairs - the missile automatically gu-
ides itself in whateter direction the crosshair sight indicates,visually gu-
ided systems cannot be jammed,have trouble tracking wildly maneuvering targ-
ets,or even finding a target in bad visibility.

NAME                  : SA-7B "Grail"
PURPOSE               : Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Carried by infantrymen, or in any light vehicle.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Infrared homing (first generation)
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 10 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 20,000'+
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : One of the first shoulder fired SAMs,this missile has good speed and
range but a very weak warhead.The IR seeker has been improved in the B model
but even more upgrades appeared in the SA-14.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : FIM-43A "Redeye"
PURPOSE               : Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Carried by infantrymen,or in any light vehicle.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Infrared homing (first generation)
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : No more that 7 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 10,000'+
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : Was America's first shoulder-fired SAM,and was never really very ef-
fective.Its IR seeker was very simple,the warhead small,and the range and sp
eed barely adequate.However,during the 1970s the US Army had nothing better,
and a few NATO allies were loyal enough to buy it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-14 & SA-16
PURPOSE               : Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Carried by infantrymen,or in any light vehicle.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Infrared homing (second generation all-aspect)
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : About 16 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5+
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 20,000'+
MANEUVERABILITY       : Excellent

NOTES : This is a completely upgraded version of the SA7,with greater speed,
range, and a much improved seeker. Even further improvements and refinements
will appear with the upcoming SA-16.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : FIM-92A "Stinger"
PURPOSE               : Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Carried by infantrymen,or in any light vehicle.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Infrared homing (second generation all-aspect)
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : About 10 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : About 20,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Excellent

NOTES : Entering production in 1981, this  was a much-needed replacement for
the Redeye.The Stinger is much more effective missile,largely because of its
excellent and quite intelligent IR seeker.The CIA has been supplying quanti-
ties of this missile to guerilla movements, who in turn have traded or given
this to groups hostile to America,including the Iranian Shi'ite militia.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-9B "Gaskin"
PURPOSE               : Short-range vehicle mounted infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar and launcher on same armored vehicle
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Pulse radar aiming and infrared (IR) homing
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 20,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This is an upgraded version of the SA-9 missile vehicle.The original
design did very poorly in the Bekaa Valley against Israeli aircraft in 1981.
The SA-9 is designed to  accompany front-line  combat units and provide low-
level defense against strike aircraft and helicopters. The missile itself is
fairly small and not especially destructive.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-13 "Gopher"
PURPOSE               : Short-range vehicle mounted infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar and launcher on same armored vehicle
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radars or eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Visual or 30-60 km pulse radar
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Pulse radar aiming and infrared (IR) homing
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 65 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 30,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This is an improved SA9 with a new launcher,better radar,and an imp-
roved missile.Unlike the SA-9, it can be linked with a seperate search radar
system,including other obsolescent systems from older radar-guided SAMs.A nu
mber of third world nations have received this with the SA9B missiles on the
new tracked launcher.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : "Tigercat"
PURPOSE               : Short-range fixed site visual SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Emplacements + controller position,trailer laucher
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Visual or obsolescent pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight or 65 km pulse radar
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Joystick (visual) command guidance
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 12,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This inexpensive land  version of the Seacat missile  is only useful
for protecting installations from direct air raids. It is very short ranged,
cannot reach high altitudes,and has a primitive "operator must fly the miss-
ile" control system.Missiles are heavy, and mounted on trailers that must be
deployed well to rear of any battlefield frontline.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-N-5
PURPOSE               : Short-range point defense naval SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Integral to warship
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Naval pulse radar of varying quality
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Varies with ship,50-150 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Infrared (IR) homing
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 20,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This is vhe naval version of the SA-7 Grail.Older frigates and miss-
ile boats including the very common  Osa class use this system. The missiles
are aimed visually,their IR locked on,and then fired.Larger launcher systems
have four launching tubes and an  operator position. The system is effective
only against aircraft that fly close to the boat or ship.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : "Seacat"
PURPOSE               : Short-range point defense naval SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Integral to"warship
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radar (on Vosper Mk 5 Frigates)
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 200 km (on Vosper Mk 5 Frigates)
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Joystick (visual) command guidance
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 12,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : The missile is the naval version of the Tigercat,with the same prim-
itive control system and short range.It is the anti-aircraft defense of Mark
5 frigates,built by Vosper/England for export. Iran bought a number of these
ships.The Vosper's search radar is the obsolescent AWS-1,whose maximum range
is 200 km.Its effective range against a stealth aircraft would be much less.

WARPLANES/KEY TO AIRCRAFT : ================================================
ROLES : A fighter plane specializes in air-to-air combat,where the objective
is destroying enemy aircraft.An interceptor is a fighter designed to fly lo-
ng distances + attack distant enemy aircraft.Many interceptors are poor dog-
fighters.A strike plane is designed to hit surface targets in enemy territo-
ry.Close support strikes are against enemy front-line troops,interdiction st
rikes are against military rear areas (headquarters,supply dumps, columns on
roads,etc.),while deep strikes attack enemy installations far behind the fr-
ont line (railroad yards,bridges,airbases,etc.). Strike aircraft designed to
function against warships are sometimes  termed attack aircraft. Bombers are
designed for knterdiction,deep strike,and/or naval attack,aswell as carrying
nuclear weapons and/or reconnaissance gear.Transports carry personnel and e-
quipment.They are not designed to fight,and almost never carry and armament.
AEW&C (Airborne Early Warning & Control) planes carry  powerful search radar
and communications gear, designed to watch friendly + hostile aircraft while
simultaneously controlling friendly air operations.

CREW : If a plane has a crew of one man,cockpit aids are important:the work-
load for one man in a jet warplane is quite high.

MISSION WEIGHT : This is the typical total  weight of the plane, with fuel +
weapons,at takeoff.If the plane can serve in both fighter + strike role, the
fighter (air-to-air) weight is given. In a strike role a plane often carries
15-35% additional weight.

ENGINES : The total thrust of the  engines (on afterburners if available) is
important.Airplanes with greater thrust than weight can fly "ballistically",
a useful advantage in aircombat.A high thrust/weight ratio is desired by all
fighter pilots.

RANGE : This is the combat radius  of the plane when  loaded for action, but
using only internal tanks (no extra fuel tanks).Often the figure is an appr-
oximation.

CEILING : Maximum altitude of the plane,using afterburners if available.

MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0' : Sea-level maximum  speed is often much less  than high
altitude maximum speed,especially in high-speed jets.

MAXIMUM SPEED AT 36,000': This altitude level is an importcnt benchmark bec-
ause above it Mach 1 is a constant 573 knots.Although this speed is importa-
nt,note that the optimum turning speed for most aircraft is Mach 0.75 - 0.90
(i.e.,550-650 knots,depending on the  plane and altitude); higher speeds are
only good for chasing opponents,escaping from them, or quick dashes into and
out of enemy airspace.

ARMAMENT: Often weapons pylons can  be fitted to carry multiple bombs/light-
weight missiles.Number of pylons need not limit the number of ordnance items

AIR-TO-AIR RADAR QUALITY : As a  stealth pilot, you are naturally interested
in the range and quality of enemy airborne search radar.

MANEUVERABILITY : This is a comparative rating of how well the plane can ma-
neuver in a dogfight.All aircraft are rated on the same standard: via superb
maneuverability of the F-16 Falcon.

NOTES : This all-purpose plane served the US Navy + Air Force as both a fig-
hter and strike fighter throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. In the USAF it
is now obsolescent, serving mainly for reconnaissance and electronic warfare
("Wild Weasel").However,hundreds were sold to western nations worldwide,inc-
luding Iran under the Shah.For air-to-air combat the plane can carry four AI
M-9 Sidewinders + four AIM-7 Sparrows.

NAME                  : F-14D Tomcat
DESIGNER/MANUFACTURER : Grumman, USA
ROLE                  : Fighter & interceptor
CREW                  : 2
MISSION WEIGHT        : 35 t
ENGINE(S)             : Originally 2 Pratt & Whitney TF30-412A turbofans for
                        41,800 lbs thrust,upgraded in D model to two General
                        Electric F110-400 turbofans for 54-58,000 lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 1280 km
CEILING               : over 56,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 800 kts with TF30,higher with F110
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1350 kts with TF30,higher with F110
ARMAMENT              : 6-barrel 20mm cannon,4 weapons pallets,2 pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Excellent range,high quality doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This heavy,longrange interceptor has extremely powerful avionics for
use with the AIM-54 Phoenix semi-active radar-homing missile,which has a 200
km effective range.The aircraft is the US Navy's long-range defender of car-
rier battle groups.Standard USN armament is 4 Phoenix + 4 Sidewinder missil-
es. The swinging wings are computer  controlled for maximum performance, but
their swing also shows the plane's energy state to the enemy. In 87 the Navy
began a program that upgraded the original TF30 engines with the newer, more
powerful F110s.About 80 TF30-engined F-14s were supplied to Iran, but engine
troubles,complexities in the avionics system,and the delicacy of the Phoenix
missiles have greatly reduced their militaryvalue.They are often used as ra-
dar-warning patrol aircraft.

NAME                  : F-15C Eagle
DESIGNER/MANUFACTURER : McDonnell Douglas, USA
ROLE                  : Fighter
CREW                  : 1
MISSION WEIGHT        : 22 t
ENGINE(S)             : 2 Pratt&Whitney F100-100 turbofans/47,660 lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 1200 km
CEILING               : 63,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 810 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1260 kts or greater
ARMAMENT              : 6-barrel 20mm cannon,4 missile ejectors, 4 pylons, 2
                        FAST pallet points (extra fuel)
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium range,high quality doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This large,powerful dogfighter is the dream plane of many USAFpilots
Although not as nimble as the lightweight F-16,it has longer ranged avionics
plus a brute size and power unmatched by any fighter until the new Su-27 ap-
peared.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : F-16C Falcon
DESIGNER/MANUFACTURER : General Dynamics, USA
ROLE                  : Fighter & strike fighter
CREW                  : 1
MISSION WEIGHT        : 540 km
ENGINE(S)             : 1 Pratt&Whitney F100-200  turbofan/23,830 lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 12.5 t
CEILING               : Over 50,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 800 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1190 kts
ARMAMENT              : 6-barrel 20mm cannon,7 weapon pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium range,high quality doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Excellent

NOTES : The latest production fighter added to the US Air Force, the F-16 is
the most maneuverable dogfighter in the world possibly excepting the MiG-29.
The inherently unstable airframe that gives this agility  would be unflyable
except for the computerized electronic controls,hence its nickname "Electric
Jet".Advanced air-ground avionics and anti-missile defenses are extras,maki-
ng the basic aircraft  relatively cheap. Many western nations have purchased
F-16s.However,until the AIM-120 AMRAAM it had no long-range AAM.

MISSION WEIGHT        : 18 t
ENGINE(S)             : 2 GeneralElectric F404400 turbofans/32,000lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 740 km
CEILING               : 50,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : Less than 660 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1050 kts
ARMAMENT              : 6-barrel 20mm cannon,9 weapons pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium range,high quality doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good to very good

NOTES : Although not as maneuverable as the F-16,this heavier multi-role fi-
ghter has numerous avionic and defensive  aids built in. These were required
by the US Navy,its main user,who needed an all-purpose fighter + attack bom-
ber able to fire a variety of sophisticated weapons.Like the F-16,it also is
sold to western nations.

NAME                  : A-6E Intruder
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : Grumman, USA
ROLE                  : Attack & interdiction bomber
CREW                  : 2
MISSION WEIGHT        : 13 t
ENGINE(S)             : 2 Pratt&Whitney J52-8A turbojets / 18,600 lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 870 km
CEILING               : 44,600'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 570 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 540 kts
ARMAMENT              : 5 weapons pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Poor,but superb air-to-ground weapons radars
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair to poor

NOTES : Designed at the end of the 1950s as a lowlevel attack bomber for use
in bad weather/at night,this plane remains an unqualified success.Avionics +
weapons have been rebuilt more than once to maintain the "state of the art",
with upgrades under development.Electronic warfare (EA-6 and EA-6B) + aerial
tanker (KA-6D) versions exist.

NAME                  : AV-8B Harrier II
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : British Aerospace,UK (original design) and McDonnell
                        Douglas,USA (American version)
ROLE                  : S/VTOL Fighter & strike fighter
CREW                  : 1
MISSION WEIGHT        : 15 t STOVL,10 t VTOL
ENGINE(S)             : One Rolls Royce Pegasus 11-21E for 22,000 lbs vecto-
                        red thrust (no afterburner)
RANGE                 : 240 km
CEILING               : 55,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 585 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 520 kts
ARMAMENT              : 1 * 25mm cannon,7 weapon pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Poor,target acquisition is usually visual
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : Originally designed as a strike fighter,the British-American corede-
sign greatly enhanced maneuverability. The avionics  are designed for ground
attack rather than air-to-air combat. Despite this, Harriers were successful
as interceptors and combat air patrol in the 1982 Falklands War. The Harrier
is the primary fighter of the US Marines,the British Royal Navy,and frontli-
ne squadrons of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in Germany.Usually it uses
short segments of roadway or a "skijump" deck for rolling takeoffs,and later
lands vertically,like a helicopter.

NAME                  : A-10A Thunderbolt II
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : Fairchild Republic,USA
ROLE                  : Close support aircraft
CREW                  : 1
MISSION WEIGHT        : 20 t
ENGINE(S)             : 2 GeneralElectric TF34100 turbofans/18,130lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 960 km
CEILING               : Under 40,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 370 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : Unknown,probably less than 370 kts
ARMAMENT              : 7-barrel 30mm cannon,11 weapon pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Poor,air-to-ground avionics quite basic
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This slow, heavily-armored  plane was designed  purely for frontline
ground attack with tank busting its speciality.This role (unglamorous to the
USAF), along with its peculiar  appearance, earns it the unofficial nickname
Warthog.Although intended for combat in Europe where low clouds and bad wea-
ther are frequent,the A-10 is a fair-weather day-only plane.The manafacturer
hopes to interest the USAF in a night-flying variant, currently without suc-
cess.Unless protected by good fighters (F-15s + F-16s), this plane is doomed
if sent into airspace  contested by USSR fighters. The USAF is now gradually
getting rid of the A-10.Numerous accidents may have had something to do with
this.

NAME                  : EF-111A Raven
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : General Dynamics,USA
ROLE                  : Electronic warfare escort
CREW                  : 2
MISSION WEIGHT        : 43.5 t
ENGINE(S)             : 2 Pratt & Whitney TF30-3 turbofans/37,000 lbs thrust
                        (with afterburners)
RANGE                 : 1,900 km
CEILING               : 54,700'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 700 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1020 kts
ARMAMENT              : ALQ-99E electronic warfare system,no other weapons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium-long range,high quality pulse & doppler
MANOUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : Specially built electronic warfare version of the  F-111 "Aardvaark"
strike and interdiction bomber.The original concept of the F-111 was a high-
speed bomber for deep strikes at high and/or low altitude,especially at nig-
ht or in bad weather.The EF-111 is popularly known as the "Electric Fox", or
"Spark Vark".It is designed to accompany deep strike and interdiction missi-
ons,providing electronic screening and jamming,it is the fastest,most power-
ful such craft in the world.

NAME                  : B-1B Bomber
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : Rockwell International,USA
ROLE                  : Strategic bomber
CREW                  : 4
MISSION WEIGHT        : 225 t with internal load only
ENGINE(S)             : 4 GeneralElectric F101102 turbofans/120,000 lbs
RANGE                 : 5,900 km
CEILING               : Unknown,probably under 50,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 530 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 727 kts
ARMAMENT              : 37.5 t capacity bomb bay,plus 29.5 t external mounts
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium range,high quality doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Poor

NOTES : This redesign of the B1A emphasizes low-level attack + minimal radar
signature.The aircraft is now seriously overloaded by the numerous revisions
+ often unreliable electronic defensive gear. Despite the usual carping from
the US press, in combat against first-line  Russian aircraft this bomber has
some hope of survival.The obsolescent B-52s it replaces would have no chance
whatsoever.

NAME                  : E-3C Sentry "AWACS"
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : Boeing,USA
ROLE                  : Airborne Early Warning & Control
CREW                  : 15 to 17
MISSION WEIGHT        : 162.5 t
ENGINE(S)             : 4 Pratt&Whitney TF33-100/100A turbofans/84,000 lbs
RANGE                 : 3,000 km (11 hours unrefueled endurance)
CEILING               : Over 29,000'
CRUISE SPEED          : Over 350 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED         : 460 kts
ARMAMENT              : Surveillance radar,communications,airtraffic control
                        and electronic defenses; weapons pylons may be added
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Excellent range and quality radars
MANEUVERABILITY       : Poor

NOTES : This 707 airliner frame holds the most sophisticated + effective air
borne radar in the world.No other nation has a plane of equivalent effective
ness.Flying "racetrack" circles behind friendly lines at 25-30,000',this AW-
ACS can watch and direct aircraft out to 300 miles range.Until the "C" model
upgrade,too many aircraft and limited computer power caused temporary "blind
spots".In wartime weapons pylons carrying AIM-9 Sidewinders or AIM-120 AMRA-
AMS could be added.In addition each Sentry carries various electronic defen-
ses and always has a fighter escort.

RUSSIAN-BUILT WARPLANES : ==================================================
NAME                  : MiG-21 Fishbed
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : Mikoyan-Gurevich,USSR
ROLE                  : Fighter
CREW                  : 1
MISSION WEIGHT        : 9 t
ENGINE(S)             : 1 Tumansky R-11F2S-300 turbofan/14,500 lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 630 km
CEILING               : 59,000' (often only 50,000')
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 700 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1220 kts
ARMAMENT              : 2 *  23mm cannon,4 weapons pylons,1 fuel tank pylon
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Very short range,low quality pulse radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This agile, maneuverable,easy-flying fighter was the premier dogfig-
hting plane of the 1960s and early 1970s.It has simple avionics + a standard
armament of 2 or 4 AA-2s (now often replaced by AA-8s),making it inexpensive
to buy,arm and maintain.However,it has little or no HUD,weak radars, and low
quality defenses,making it obsolete as a fighter. Unfortunately, its limited
carrying capacity makes it poor as a strike fighter.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : MiG-23 Flogger
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : Mikoyan-Gurevich,USSR
ROLE                  : Fighter
CREW                  : One
MISSION WEIGHT        : 16 t

CEILING               : 61,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 740 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1190 kts
ARMAMENT              : 2 * 23mm cannon,4 weapon pylons,1 fuel tank pylon
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Very poor,short range pulse radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This swing-wing fighter replacement for the MiG21 originally had few
avionics and a 22,485 lb. R-27 engine.This variant,incapable of firing soph-
isticated weapons and with serious  performance flaws, is often sold abroad.
The more advanced models,listed above, are mediocre performers. All commonly
carry AA-2 and/or AA-8 missiles,most USSR and East European versions use the
AA-7 radar homing missile also. With its MiG-27 brother, this plane has huge
production runs, making it the cheapest  fighter available today. This alone
makes it one of the world's most popular aircraft.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : MiG-27 Flogger (Physical appearance equivalent to Mi
                        G-23,but slimmer 'duck-nose')
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : Mikoyan-Gurevich,USSR
ROLE                  : Strike Fighter
CREW                  : 1
MISSION WEIGHT        : 22 t
ENGINE(S)             : 1 Tumansky R-29 turbofan/25,353 lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 400 km
CEILING               : 52,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 635 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 925 kts
ARMAMENT              : 1 * 6-barrel 23mm cannon,5 weapon pylons,2 bombracks
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Very poor,very short range pulse radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This is the ground-attack variant of the MiG-23.In Russian frontline
units it includes a laser  designator for laser-guided  munitions and simple
terrainavoidance radars for lowlevel attacks.Improved jammers and decoys are
added as well.Many sophisticated attack aids common on western strike fight-
ers are not present.Presumably the MiG-27s compensate for this with quantity
as huge production runs greatly lower its cost.

RANGE                 : 1,100 km
CEILING               : 80,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 570 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1860 kts
ARMAMENT              : 4 weapons pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium quality,medium range pulse radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Poor

NOTES : This plane was originally designed to defend  the distant borders of
the USSR from air attack, working with special ground radars to attack enemy
bombers with a special long-ranged AAM (the AA-6). It is extremely fast, but
quite unmaneuverable. A few are bought  by client states for status reasons,
but the reconnaissance version (MiG25R) is more popular - it's 88,000' ceil-
ing makes it immune to normal SAM or fighter interception.

MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1260 kts
ARMAMENT              : 1 multi-barrel cannon,6 weapons pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium quality and range doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good to excellent

NOTES : Originally designed to outfight the F-15,this plane is a modern,lig
htweight dogfighter with superlative agility. It has engine power in excess
of its weight. Common armament is AA10 "fire and forget" radar-homers along
with some AA-8 and/or AA-10 IR missiles.The degree of sophistication in the
avionics is unknown,but unlikely to match west  models. Considerable debate
exists regarding the relative superiority of this plane versus the F-16.

AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Superior quality and range doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This aircraft is a redesigned MiG-25. Although slightly slower,it is
improved in all other categories,especially low-altitude interceptions agai-
nst planes and cruise  missiles. The new AA-9 long-range missile is designed
for look-down attacks on low-level cruise missiles.It also has AA8s + AA10s.

CREW                  : 2
MISSION WEIGHT        : 43.5 t
ENGINE(S)             : 2 Tumansky R-29B turbofans/50,700 lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 300 to 1,800 km (varies with mission profile/load)
CEILING               : 57,400'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 765 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1400 kts
ARMAMENT              : 6-barrel 23mm cannon,8 weapon pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Nil,avionics designed purely for air-ground role
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This is the most advanced air-ground attack plane built by the USSR.
Externally it appears similar to the F111,including the side-by-side seating
in the cockpit.However,its armament and avionics are designed for front-line
and rear-area strikes, into the teeth of enemy air defenses. Western air and
ground commanders fear the Su-24 more than any other Soviet aircraft.The air
craft may carry a few AA-8s for self-defense,but it is not designed for air-
to-air combat.

MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 725 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1350 kts
ARMAMENT              : Probably a cannon,6 weapons pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Above average quality and range doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good to excellent

NOTES : This aircraft was designed to dedeat the F-14 and F-15 fighters.It`s
a large, powerful dogfighter whose usual armament  is probably four AA-8 and
four AA-10 missiles.In comparison to the MiG-29,the Su27 is a larger,heavier
plane.If its avionics and flight controls are truly modern, the Su-27 may be
the superior plane.However,in dogfighting maneuverability the MiG-29 and F16
probably have the edge.

AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Poor quality and range pulse radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : Originally known as the Yak-36MP,this vertical take-off fighter oper
ates from the Kiev-class aircraft carriers.These lack the equipment and deck
space for conventional jets. Initially thought to be a Russian equivalent of
the Harrier,the Yak38 is considerably inferior.It has a limited interception
ability and very limited strike capacity.However,until this plane the Russi-
an navy had nothing bigger than helicopters for its warships at sea.

AIR-TO-AIR RADAR QUALITY  : Fair,with excellent air-to-surface avionics
MANEUVERABILITY           : Very poor

NOTES : Many of these swing-wing bombers are in service with the Soviet nav-
al air arm,carrying longrange missiles to attack hostile warships up to 3000
km out to sea.The Backfire's exceptionally long range + high speed, plus its
powerful missiles make it a mortal threat to USN aircraft carriers.With aer-
ial refueling it has sufficient range to get within curise-missile-launch po
sition of the USA.As a gesture to arms control,the USSR has removed air ref-
ueling equipment from its Air Force Backfires.

AIR-TO-AIR RADAR QUALITY  : Very good long-range pulse radars
MANEUVERABILITY           : Terrible

NOTES : The Tu95 has been the worlds most sophisticated turbopropbomber for
over thirty years (it entered service in 1955). It is primarily used for lo
ng-range reconnaissance,electronic intelligence,electronic warfare(jamming)
anti-ship missiles,and cruise-missiles.The "D" model is a reconnaissance ve
rsion,the "H" model (on a slightly modified airframe) a cruise-missile car-
rier.(Believe it or not, this plane's design ancestry can be traced back to
the WW2 American Flying Fortress..)

ARMAMENT                  : Possibly twin 23mm tailcannon, 2-4 weapon pylons
AIR-TO-AIR RADAR QUALITY  : Excellent long-range doppler radars
MANEUVERABILITY           : Terrible
NOTES : The "Mainstay" is a conversion of the huge Il-76 Candid transport pl
ane to "AWACS" duties.Its purpose is to detect enemy aircraft  and low-flyi-
ng missiles,and act as a mobile,airborne command post that controls friendly
aircraft engaging such threats. The earlier Tu-126  "Moss" AEW&C with turbo-
props was a disastrous failure.Like many AEW&C planes, the Il-76 could carry
a few AAMs (AA-8s or AA-10s) for  self defense,as well as extensive jammers,
decoys,etc.

MANEUVERABILITY           : Terrible for a fighter,but good for a transport
NOTES : This is the latest general purpose medium air transport of the Sovi-
et Union.Its jet  engines and short-takeoff performance make in an outstand-
ing utility craft for transporting  all types of personnel and cargo between
remote airfields.

EVASIVE ACTION AGAINST MISSILES : ==========================================
JAMMERS : Jammers are so-called ECM-equipment (Electronic Counter Measures).
They try to electronically interfere incoming IR- and Radar-guided missiles.
They work just fine against IR1-classed missiles, but the IR2 type is guided
by a seeker with advanced computer logic, and once recognizing the seeker of
the jammer,actually homes on the jammer,instead of being confused by it.The-
refore,it's unwise and sometimes downright  dangerous to leave a jammer run-
ning when  second-generation IR  missiles are  getting close (not to mention
the jammer overheating and shutting off at an inconvenient time).

FLARES : Although called "flares", these are really small, finely tuned heat
decoys. A flare lures an IR missile toward it  (and away from you), but only
during the 2 to 3 seconds it burns.After that the flare dies and the missile
resumes seeking.Therefore,like chaff,the standard technique is to wait until
the missile is a couple of seconds away(the klaxon sounds),then drop a flare
while you turn away.

MANEUVERING : Maneuvering techniques against IR missiles are the same as th-
ose used against radar guided missiles.The only difference is that IR missi-
les tend to be smaller and more maneuverable. Second generation missiles are
often the most maneuverable,so you're best odf relying on decoy, jammer and/
or flares against them.Unlike radar guided SAMs,most IR SAMs are very maneu-
verable,with the ability to turn toward their target almost immediately aft-
er launch. As a result, flying low and close to a battery of maneuverable IR
SAMs is very dangerous!

WARNINGS & RESPONSES : Your first  warning of an IR missile attack can occur
at any time.A search or tracking radar may alert you,just like a radarguided
SAM attack.In fact,at that point you can't tell that an IR missile attack is
coming. However, when the missile is launched, the "I" missile warning light
goes on (rather  than the "R" light). In many cases your first warning of an
attack is the "I" missile warning light.This is because lots of cheap IRSAMs
have no search radar - just eyesight  searching. Your first warning is their
launch. If you know the missile is a first-generation homer, you can turn on
the IR jammer,change course and laugh it off. However,it pays to be wary.Ag-
ainst second generation  missiles the IR jcmmer may  still work - if you can
get outside its 45 degree field of view before it gets too close,or the jam-
mer overheats.The reduced airspeed due to using the jammer doesn't help,eit-
her.Otherwise, you'll have to  wait for the proximity  alarm klaxon. Many IR
missiles are fired from very short ranges,so short that the "I" light is al-
most immediately followed by the proximity alarm klaxon.When you hear the kl
axon and see the "I" light burning, your first act must be to drop a flare +
then dodge!

OUTMANEUVERING A MISSILE : -------------------------------------------------
Whether you're using jammers,decoys,or just plain guts, the basic principles
of outmaneuvering a missile remain the same.

EVADING THE MISSILE'S VIEW : SAMs can only home on targets within the acqui-
sition arc of their seeker.This arc is a bare 45 degrees ahea.If decoys,jam-
mers, or whatever temporarily  confuse a missile, you evade attack by moving
outside this 45 degree arc.Usually the quickest escape course is one perpen-
diculap to the missile's flight path.

TURNING INSIDE A MISSILE : When a missile  is close, you still have a chance
to outmaneuver him.Its turning arc is larger than yours.If the missile is tr
ying to fly up your tail,roll over onto a wingtip for a tight turn,then pull
back hard on the controlstick to tighten the turn further.Keep an eye on the
airspeed,since you can't stay long in this kind of a turn -soon the plane`ll
stall.But meanwhile,the missile is making a wider,faster turn that causes it
to zoom past harmlessly.

TURNING TOWARD A MISSILE : If a SAM approaches you  from the side, gradually
turn toward it,increasing the tightness of your turn as it comes closer. The
objective is to keep the missile's course at right angles (perpendicular) to
your own.This tactic works because the missile cannot turn with you. Instead
it gradually falls behind,zooming past your tail.

EVADING FRONTAL ATTACKS : If a SAM approaches you from the front, wait until
it's about  8 to 12 km away  (about 2/3rds of a grid square on  the tactical
display).Then make a quick 90 degree turn. This puts the missile facing your
side.Now roll over 180 degrees and turn toward the missile.Now you're set up
for a turning battle (see "Turning toward a Missile" above).

MISSILE MINIMUM RANGE : Large less-maneuverable missiles fire straight up wh
en first launched.This means that they can't begin homing until they're bey-
ond a certain distance (in range and altitude) from their launchers.As a re-
sult, circling right over a battery of low-maneuverability SAMs can actually
be very safe.

DOPPLER MISSILES : Enemy missiles with doppler guidancesystems are a special
danger.These missiles`ll not home on the chaff unless your course is perpen-
dicular (at right angles to) the missile. If the missile chases you from the
rear or attacks from straight ahead,chaff has no effect.Only three SAMs cur-
rently have doppler guidance:SA-10,SA-12,and SA-N-6.Only one AAM has doppler
guidance: the AA-10.

THE "DOPPLER CROSS" MISSILE EVASION: The F19 observes an enemy dopplerguided
SAM approaching, and until his course is  perpendicular (at right angles to)
the missile,Then the F-19 drops chaff or a decoy,and continues on a perpend-
icular course,keeping the missile at a constant range. Flying on a different
course can be disastrous, as the missile will "see" the doppler shift as you
change range.

SIERRA HOTEL     : Military expansion of the letters "SH",here an abbreviat-
                   ion for heated excrement.Curiously,the expression denotes
                   admiration and excitement.For example,"Sierra Hotel, look
                   at that guy smoke MiGs!".
SKUNK WORKS      : Quasi-official nickname of the Lockheed plant in Burbank,
                   California that designs and builds top-secret aircraft.

                   to weakness in a  certain male  organ rarely discussed in
                   polite company.The term is an especially derogatory + in-
                   sulting description of a fighter pilot (e,g."that Whiskey
                   Delta couldn't even find his own airbase,much less hit it
                   with a bomb.").
WING WEENIE      : Administrative staff off icer attached to a fighter unit,
                   but with no combat or  flying duties. A mildly derogatory
                   term.
ZERO-ZERO        : Nickname for  the zero-zero  type ejection seat. So named
                   because, in theory, a pilot can eject safely from a plane
                   with zero speed and zero altitude  (i.e.sitting on a run-
                   way).

HINTS,TIPS AND BUG REPORTS : ===============================================
In this game,the most commonly encountered SAMs are the SA14, SA10 and HAWK.
The SA14 is an IR SAM,and all you  have to do is stick the  IR jammer on! In
fact,sometimes you don't  even need to do that, as it often runs out of fuel
before it gets anywhere near you! The HAWK is also a bit of a loser.Just put
the ECM jammer on and it`ll fly blindly past. The SA10,however,is a bit more
dangerous.The best strategy is to dump a decoy,fly at right angles to the mi
ssile (use tactical map) and dump chaff if it gets close.And prcy...

Next,what weapons to choose... if you know that you are going to encounter a
lot of enemy aircraft,load up with Sidewinders.In fact,if you are on air-to-
air missions and the secondary target is a strike mission (not a recon miss-
ion),then take nothing but Sidewinders, unless you need extra fuel. Why take
no air-to-ground weapons? Because you have a very good gun! The gun can take
out just about anything, as long as you hit target in  the right place. When
strafing a ground target, it often helps to aim  slightly below target. This
definitely works when strafing SAM batteries.

Sidewinders are preferable to AMRAAMs most of the time,because you can carry
four Sidewinders in one bay,and only three AMRAAMs.And the Sidewinders actu-
ally seem to have the same range as an AMRAAM,over 35 kilometers! Never mind
that they should run out of fuel after 15-20 km, these are SuperSidewinders!
Against an aircraft flying towards you,you could probably get away with fir-
ing a Sidewinder at 40 km!

The gun also has a"longer range than the manual says.I've splashed MiGs that
were 18 km away,on numerous occasions.And it is VERY powerful! For instance,
I have destroyed the following targets with the gun... USS America (whoops),
Missile Boats,Oil Rigs,SAM Radars,Tank farms.I think just about anything can
be destroyed by the gun if your aim is true.

Dogfighting is EASY.First,the enemy doesn't use guns on you.Second,they har-
dly ever fire missiles when up close.And third,they have this great habit of
flying in straight lines (even Veterans).I don't know much about Elite enemy
pilots;I've only engaged them with AMRAAMs, and never got up close. But I do
know that Elite pilots seem to have a knack of avoiding Sidewinders that are
fired at long range (i.e. above 15 km).

What planes are friendly and what ones are hostile? Well,all Boeings are ci-
vilian airliners and the only other friendlies are the F18,so shoot anything
else flying into your path ...

Taking off is so easy I won't mention it. Landing is also surprisingly easy,
even on Realistic Landings you can come down very fast indeed and still come
out without a scratch.Carrier landings are tougher.If you don't hit the rear
quarter of the deck,then the arrestor wires won't catch you.If they do catch
you,you stop almost immediately,so you're ok! If you do miss them,then it IS
possible to stop just by using the brakes and shutting  down the engine, but
it will look very scary- the nosewheel will  hang over the edge of the deck!
Maybe even the main wheels too, so it'll look likg  you're hovering in front
of the carrier... this is because  the deck is a bit longer than it actually
is on screen.

Next is fuel.If you fly with the throttle around the half-way mark, you will
use fuel at a VERY  low rate. So low that you can  loiter for up to 1/2 hour
(real time) in any area, waiting for bad  guys to show  up (so you can shoot
them down!).Two disadvantages with  this throttle  setting are that you will
have to put down the flaps to stay in the air, and your airspeed`ll probably
be as low as 200 knots.Accelerated time is a good idea!

RADARS.I hate 'em! Damn things! Pulse radars aren't too worrying,but Doppler
ones are very dangerous - if  there are any near your flight path, take them
out with a Maverick,or you could risk going in and strafing the radar,but th
at means risking SAM launches against you.Missile boats are also best destr-
oyed if any are near your flight path. In mountainous areas, radars are less
of a problem;it's quite easy to zoom in and strafe one before it even reali-
qes you exist!

BUGS.The major one is that sometimes the plane flips upside down for no rea-
son! This can cause a crash if you are using autopilot at the time,as the du
mb autopilot tries  to correct by  rolling over and diving into the ground !
When the plane does this little party trick,it sometimes does an instant 180
degree turn as well! Another bug I've noticed is that when your plane is hea
vily damaged (8 out of the 9 damagelights were on),then selecting the damage
display (F6) locked up the game.Buv I only saw it do that once,because norm-
ally I'm so brilliant at the game that I don't get damaged (ego!). The final
bug I have had happen to me twice now;in Libya,for no apparent reason,it cra
shes out,displaying the  registers,exception type,etc. A little bit annoying
when I had spent half an hour sneaking around  mountains avoiding detection.
Oh well,at least it isn't as buggy as v1.01 (the version released on the con
tinent.That's Europe to you Americans!).
