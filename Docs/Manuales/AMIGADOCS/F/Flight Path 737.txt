PLEASE DISCONNECT ANY EXTRA DISC DRIVES.

FLIGHT INSTRUCTIONS
Take Off from the airstrip surrounded by high mountains.  When you are safely over the mountains, await the headings of the landing strip.  Set your course to the new heading and safely land the aircraft.

CONTROLS - The aircraft is MOUSE controlled.  There are TWO modes of MOUSE operation.

SELECT MODE - This allows the options on the scree to be selected by pointing the arrow at the option and pressing the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON (LMB) i.e. to lower the flaps, point the arrow at the FLAPS DOWN option and press LMB.  Apperance of arrow signifies that you are in SELECT mode.

FLIGHT MODE - This is used to control the aircraft.

FLYING INSTRUCTIONS - Go into the SELECT mode to start the aircraft engines by pointing the Mouse at IGNITION and pressing the LMB.  The engine will roar into life.  Ensure that the Brakes are OFF and the Flaps are DOWN.  Go into FLIGHT mode and start Taxiing for the Take Off by holding the LMB down and slowly moving the Mouse UP.  Note the RUN/HDG which shows the DIFFERENCE between Runway heading and the aircraft heading.  When it is ZERO, the aircraft is correctly aligned on the runway for Take Off.  Move the mouse Left or Right to reduce the difference to zero and keep it around zero until the aircraft is airborne.  Failure to do so will result in a crash.  Increase the speed to 180 Knots but not above 200 Knots to avoid damaging the flaps.  At a speed between 180-220 Knots, Lift the aircraft nose by moving the Mouse Back.  The aircraft will be airborn.  Once over 300 ft., you may retract the Undercarriage and put the Flaps up.  Retracting the U/C increases the speed by 5 Knots.  Once the flaps are up, you must not allow the speed to fall below 180 Knots, the STALL speed of the aircraft.

CLIMB - Having raised the U/C and Flaps, you may increase speed and climb above the mountains.  A Red high Ground Warning (GW) will flash as you approach the mountains.  It will go steady Blue when you have safely cleared the mountains.

CRUISE - During your short cruise, the Landing runway heading will flash.  Bank the aircraft to reduce the heading reading to zero.  You are now ready to start your descent.

DESCENT - With the ground warning light out and 25 miles to the Touchdown, move the Mouse UP to start your descent.  The aircraft speed will increase as you bring the aircraft nose down, so keep it under comtrol.  At 14 miles to go and at an altitude less than 200 ft., if your heading is within +-5, you will see the runway in the distance.

LANDING APPROACH - At 10 miles to touchdown, the H/L warning indicator will 
light up.  If it is white, you are too high for landing and must go in steeper descent.  If red, you are too low and will crash before reaching the runway.  A green light signifies correct rate of descent.  Before descending to a height of 300 ft., you must lower the U/C and put flaps down.  Lowering the U/C reduces the speed by 5 Knots and the flaps are damaged if the speed is more then 200 Knots.

LANDING - Keep the speed between 160 (Flaps down Stall speed) and 170 Knots.  Keeping the plane level the heading between +-5.  When the distance shows 0 and NOT before, bring the aircraft down to altitude 0.  As soon as you see Zero altitude, pull the mouse down to fly level and you have landed.  As you touch down on the runway, you will hear screeching sound of the tyres and a degree of juddering depending on the heaviness of the landing.  Rapidly bring the speed down tobelow 200 Knots.  You must stop before the end of the runway.  At the higher levels, you will have to apply the Reverse thrust to bring the plane speed down rapidly for a shorter runway.  You may make judicious use of brakes but their use may cause severe juddering and acute discomfort to your passengers.

SCORE - If you make any errors in your aircraft handling you will be told exactly where you went wrong together with advice on whether to proceed to the next level.  The faster you fly, the higher the score.

FUEL - You always have enough fuel for one attempt at landing on each flight.

ENGINE FIRE - Engine fire alarm is raised by the flashing of the FIRE icon.  As soon as the alarm is raised, activate the icon to extinguish the fire otherwise a serious loss of power may result.

FLIGHT NOTES - Level 4, 5 and 6 require use of REVERSE THRUST on landing.  The higher the level you select, the quicker you must climb from the moment of the lift off.  Use the rate of climb indicator and the best climb speed (420 Knots) to clear the mountains.  Move mouse slowly for maximum flight and speed control.  At level 4, the cross winds are stron.  Fly low to minimise theri effects.  Crusing height of 1500 Feet until a distance of 14 miles from the runway is recommended.  The secret of successful flying is to think ahead.  STAY CALM AND YOU WILL LIVE TO FLY AGAIN.
