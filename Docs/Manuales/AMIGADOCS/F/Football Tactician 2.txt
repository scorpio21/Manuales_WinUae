                      Football Tactician 2
                      ====================       TYPED BY SHARD - N&B
                                                


The  pre-requisite for fully appreciating FT2 is to be in charge of a club.
Without any human manager the game will merely run in automatic mode.

To  become a manager, you'll have to apply for a job, initially with one of
the smaller clubs.

You can manage any club whose class is equal or below your own rating.

As  all  human  managers  start with a rating of 3, most clubs in the lower
division are accessible straight away.

To manage better clubs you will have to win at least 4 matches on the trot.

The   game  will  run  perfectly  without  a  single  human  manager.   But
considering  that FT2 is capable of handling up to 46 human managers, there
is little point in that.

To apply for a job, select the ACTION MENU.  Then click on managers.

Now  choose  one  of  the  human  managers.  Say FRED.  Click on JOIN.  Now
select  the  club you would like to join.  If you are accepted, a logo will
appear and confirm your appointment.

Have fun and...  good luck!

Talking Birds

Please  refer to Manual.  The section entitled who's in charge will explain
the mechanics of it.


The File Menu.  
-------------

LAST  SEASON  will  load  the  fixtures  and results from the last complete
season.  On your disk, this file is recorded as fixt_00.dat

Once  LAST  SEASON  is  in memory, the current season is put on hold.  Only
friendly matches may now be played.

Many functions will be disabled:  save, new, kick-off, top scorers, etc are
no longer available.

The cursor will also change.

We are now in REVIEW MODE.

The  whole  idea  of  loading an old season whether from the LAST SEASON or
from  the LOAD SEASON boxes is to quickly view past results, maybe to check
how you did against your next opponents.

The obvious path to follow, in this mode, in to click on TABLES, then click
on SELECT ANY WEEK.  Full records will now be at your fingertips.

Another  useful  feature  is  to  load any logo in, click on it, and select
FIXTURE  LIST.   You  will  be  presented  with  the  full  history of that
particular team during the season under review.

Once in 'REVIEW MODE', the LAST SEASON box will now say RESUME.

You  have  to  click on RESUME if you want to exit REVIEW MODE and carry on
with the default mode.

The  next  box in this FILE MENU is SAVE.  If you want to save your records
click  on  this one at any time during the championship, except at the very
end  of  the  very  last  day,  when  it will instead appear as NEW SEASON.
You'll  have  to  click  on  NEW SEASON to save the ENTIRE championship for
posterity.  It will always be saved as FIXT_00.DAT.  All fixtures will then
be reset and a new season may commence with bank balances, skill levels and
squads left unchanged.

SAVE  does  a  complete save of all squad and club records, replay list and
results so far.

But the week pointer will remain as it is.

Whenever you click on SAVE, do make sure that your disk is NOT protected

The next entry is NEW.

This  is  an uncompromising feature.  Everything gets reset to the original
standard.   You  are  in  effect  overwriting your records with the default
files always held on disk.

Needless  to  say  full confirmation will be asked for and you will have to
answer with the keyboard only.

EDITOR , the next entry, gives you access to all 920 players.

The names can be changed but skills and valuations require a password.

LOAD SEASON is similar to LAST SEASON except that here you may choose which
particular  season  you  want  to  load:   0 is the one just gone.  You may
retrieve up to 21 seasons.

Once  this feature is active, you are in REVIEW MODE again, as confirmed by
the  rectangular  cursor.  A new box will now appear just underneath:  SAVE
AS.

The  season  you  have just loaded may be re-saved under any name from 1 to
20.   Make  sure  you  do not overwrite a season that you were particularly
proud of.

PROMOTIONS  is  only  active  during the early part of the season.  It will
re-arrange the two division as per entries shown under HONOURS.

As all master files will be changed use with care.

This covers all the options under the FILE menu.

The Action Menu.  
---------------

VIEW  CLUBS.  This will show all clubs in your division together with their
managers humans or otherwise.

MANAGERS  is  a list of 46 ready-made user names.  These are fully editable
and have individual ratings according to their achievements.

Money earned by these managers is also shown as well as their records.

SELECT  CLUB  is  one  of  the most used options in this game.  You have to
select  a  club  in  order  to examine its squad and make the selection and
strategic decisions that will win or lose a match.

REPLAY is one of many options UNIQUE to Football Tactician.

It gives access to the matches played last saturday in both divisions.

Ideal to analyse your last game and see what went right (or wrong) and also
to see how the other teams performed.

CLASSICS  is  another replay facility except that here only selected golden
matches are shown.  In order to store a famous match in the classic section
you need to call the archive routine further down.

KICK OFF gets the ball rolling!

All  matches will be played in turn.  Those involving no user-managers will
have  their  result  flashed for two seconds.  The others will be played in
full.  First the relevant logos will be fetched from memory, then the match
will  start  at  a speed defined by the option menu.  You'll have access to
the  two  logos  where  substitions,  marking, and change of tactics may be
made.   If  you  want to change the clock speed, press ENTER, - or + on the
keypad.

All  matches  will  be  played in a totally realistic way, whether they are
shown  or  not.   Computer  opponents  will  organise  their squads, change
tactics or make substitutions according to the run of the play.

KICK OFF may also be activated by clicking on the centre circle.

Equally, once all the week's events have been reported, KICK OFF will occur
automatically.

Friendlies  are  played  by getting two logos in the windows and hitting F.
If  any  of  the  two  logos  showing  is a user-manager, the match will be
reported  in full, otherwise only the result will show.  Even so, the match
will have been recorded .

To replay it, press R on the keyboard

ARCHIVE  shows the state of the three recording banks.  If you click on any
of the 36 matches, the mouse will jump to the permanent section where up to
five matches may be stored for good.

VIEW  REFS  will  list  all  88  referees in the league together with their
toughness record.  Nine is deadly.  One is a softy.

This covers all the options under the ACTION menu.

The TABLES Menu.  
----------------

TABLES  In STANDARD mode, this box may be clicked to reveal a full division
table except when the season hasn't started yet.

In  REVIEW  mode,  when the cursor is rectangular, this option is inactive,
but league tables are then called from the SELECT WEEK option further down.

FIXTURES Next week's fixtures are stored here.

RESULTS Last week's results are shown here.

TRANSFERS  This is a complete list of all the players on the transfer list.
Although  the  players  ratings  are shown the list does not reveal whether
they are injured, suspended or with a low morale.

Buying  a player with rating of 100 may result in its new rating jumping to
107 simply because his old morale was low.  To avoid buying a player with a
long  suspension  or some bad injury, you are recommended to check his club
logo first.

This  transfer  list changes constantly.  Computer players may put a player
on the transfer list and remove him a few weeks later.

Squad levels are not allowed to drop below 17.  You'll find that if a squad
is too depleted, a club will go into the transfer market automatically.

TOP  SCORERS This is where your players should show up if you're doing well
in the league.

SELECT  ANY  WEEK.   A  very  useful  option.  You may view any week in the
season.   If you choose a week already played, you will see the results and
the ful table for that particular week.

If you choose a week not played yet, only the fixtures will appear.

This feature is active in both STANDARD mode and REVIEW mode.

HONOURS  shows  the major winners from the last completed season.  It shows
at  a  glance  who will be promoted and relegated should you decide to call
the promotion routine.

THE CUPS All local and european cup entries are shown here.

EC mini-leagues now operational.

Cup draws vary from season to season.

EURO POOL Players may be bought from this pool.  Equally you may dispose of
your unwanted players by giving them a free transfer.

This covers all the options under the TABLES menu.

The OPTIONS Menu.  
-----------------

Most boxes under this menu are of the toggable type:  ie they merely switch
certain conditions on or off.

Default settings will be saved to disk automatically.

The NEWS option allows you to determine the amount of mid-week activity.

Between eight and twenty four events including possible transfers will take
place depending on the setting.

SPEED  The  speed  of  match action is either slow, in which case each ball
contest  takes  about two seconds, or normal, which lasts half a second, or
fast which lasts 1/50th of a second.

The  effective  duration of the action depends not only on this setting but
on  how  many  illustrations  appear  during  the  match.   Offside  flags,
penalties, etc..  take a while to be displayed and slow things down a bit.

You will find that intervening with the mouse during a match set to fast is
not  that  easy.   Press  - on the keypad (repeatedly if necessary) to slow
things down, then click on the logos.

HIGHLIGHTS  is  another  variable  affecting  the way a reported match will
look.

The  default mode is HIGHLIGHTS which will report all major events:  goals,
shots, fouls, corners, penalties, injuries and tactics changes.

When  set  to  FULL  COMMENTARY, the players names will be reported all the
time.   Home  players  will  be on the left Away players on the right.  The
player actually controlling the ball is shown in blue.

The  other  setting  is GOALS ONLY which will only report the goals scored,
who scored them and when.

TRANSFERS amongst computer teams may either be automatic or off.

You  should  remember that if automatic transfers are allowed, a great deal
of  player  movement  will  take place, particularly if you have chosen the
full weekly NEWS option.

To  reduce  excessive  player  migration,  you may either select BRIEF week
events or turn TRANSFERS off periodically.

Teams managed by user players will not embark on automatic transfers unless
you allow your squad to be unduly depleted.

This covers the option menu.

The LOGO Menu.  
--------------

The LOGO menu may be accessed both during the week and during a match.

Some  functions  will  be  active  all the time, others will be specific to
either of these possibilities.

SELECT gives you access to your squad (or to the opponent's squad!)

During  the week, all players can be reached and reshuffled (unless injured
or  suspended).   During  a match, only the first eleven may be reshuffled,
and up to two substitutes may be brought on.

Click on the player's name to activate a swap with another player.

Some  players  have  variable  roles  and  may be switched from midfield to
attack  or  midfield  to  defence.   Or  they  may be played as wingers, or
sweepers...

Click on these columns to change the players roles.

If  you  start  a match with two goalies, or none, the program will rectify
this anomaly automatically.

BUY  allows  you  to  view  the  transfer  list  and  buy  a  player, funds
permitting.

You can have up to 20 players in your squad.

APPROACH  allows  you to approach any player from any club.  There are some
costs involved.  And the player's market value will probably go up.

There  is  no  guarantee  that  the  player will join you.  You may have to
approach him several times.

STRATEGY.   You  have  a choice a eight different strategies, each one with
its own merit (and drawback).  Consult your manual.  The strategies are:

Normal,  off-side trap, high crosses, quick counters, through balls, steady
build-up, sweeper system and break rhythm.

Going  for  through  balls for instance is only of value if you have one or
two  real  attackers  up  front  (ATT) with an above-average speed.  On the
other hand, they may be caught offside a few times...

TACTICS  have a significant bearing on the way the match progresses.  Rough
playing will knock the opposition but land you a few yellow cards.  Falling
in  the  box  may  earn  the  odd  penalty,  but also a booking and loss of
possession.  Again, see your manual.

FORMATION is a non-accessible box.  It merely confirms the current set-up

NEXT  WEEK not only informs you of your next opponents, but clicking on it,
will load their logo and squad.

Access  to  the opponents' squad will be allowed at any time, but, in match
mode you will not be able to interfere with it.

SELL  allows  you  to put any of your players on the transfer list.  Expect
morale  to drop when you try to sell a player.  To remove a player from the
transfer list, you'll have to click on UNLIST.

INFO gives you historical information on your club.  FINANCIAL displays the
current  bank  balance and the various trading accounts.  You will still be
allowed to play if you go in the red, but purchases will be denied

FIXTURE LIST is a useful option showing the entire season at a glance, with
results  for  matches  played.  You can not only examine your own list, but
that of any club in your division.

In MATCH mode, some of the above options will be disabled , but one new one
will appear:  MARK OPPONENT.

Marking an opponent will severely reduce his performance, but it will be at
the expense of your overall rating.
