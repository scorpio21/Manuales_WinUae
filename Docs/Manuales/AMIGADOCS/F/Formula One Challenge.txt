  PLAYS A LARGE PART IN THE OUTCOME OF THE RACE.

  TYRE SELECTIONS DEPEND ON THE TWISTYNESS OF THE TRACK,WEATHER,RACE DISTANCE
  AND PITSTOPS ETC!

   II)ENGINE POWER: THIS WILL DETERMIND THE POWER OUTPUT OF YOUR ENGINE.EACH

  RAIN THEN INCREASE THE DOWNFORCE BY ONE.

  IF IN DRY CONDITIONS YOU WOULD CHOOSE THE MEDIUM SETTING WHEM IT IS RAINING 
  CHOOSE THE LARGE WING SETTING FOR MORE DOWNFORCE

  IF THE WEATHER IS REALLY BAD(HEAVY RAIN OR THUNDER STORM)THEN IDEALLY YOU 
  SHOULD INCREASE THE DOWNFORCE SETTINGS BY 1 OR 2.SO FROM MEDIUM WING IN THE
