3 - THE STORY:

You're at the wheel of the fabulous Ferrari F40 in a race against time!

You'll go tearing through four states in search of the quickest way to
accomplish your mission.  You will encounter problems with policemen who
don't appreciate the sight of a Ferrari F40 crossing their state at 200
miles per hour...

But, it's not that easy...

                                5

You must plan your route carefully from the map of each state displayed on
screen.  It will show highways you will speed on.  Beware, the shortest
routes aren't always the easiest as the sight and sound of a flashing light
will soon make you realize.

Your Ferrari features the latest radar, which assists you in detecting
police cars and road blocks.  They have been set up to stop you, therefore
keep an eye on the highway junctions as you may be forced to change your
direction!

4 - YOUR MISSION:

At the beginning of the game, your starting position and the first
destination will be displayed on the map.  You will have to consult the map
repeatedly for direction information.

When nearing a junction, your on board computer will display the highway
numbers and the direction arrows of the impending road.  The map represents
the highways of four states.  You can walk through fields, but watch out
for telephone poles and retaining posts!

The police will send cars and set up road blocks to stop you.  Avoid them
by doing some off-roading or by sneaking through barrier gaps.

At the beginning of each stage, the timer displays the time available for
this stage.

As soon as you start your engine, the countdown starts. You have to reach
the finish within the allocated time.  If it reaches zero, your Ferrari
explodes!

5 - YOUR FERRARI DASHBOARD:

Your F40 has been specially adapted for your mission...  It's dashboard
represents the following devices:
