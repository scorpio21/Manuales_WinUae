Playing the Game:
    
     You take the role of Learic and playing the game is a matter of moving
     through the Kindom collecting ingredients to make spells. You are then 
     able to mix these spells and use them against your opposing Wizard
     LEANORIC, but remember he is doing the same to destroy you.

HINTS:
      SELECTING A SPELL
      Press the fire button while moving the joystick up. A wand will appear
      above the spell book, move the joystick left or right to turn the pages
      of the spell book until you reach the spell you want.

      MIXING SPELLS
      Each Wizard has his own cauldren. This is where spells are mixed. In
      order to mix a spell you mest go to your cauldren, select the spell
      you wish to mix and press the fire button. If you have the ingredients
      for the spell this is denoted by the ingredient names showing black in
      the spell book. Your spell will be mixed. Once mixed, the spell name in
      the spell book will change color to black. To return to the game press
      fire whilst moving the joystick down.

      CASTING SPELLS
      Before casting a spell you must arm yourself with it! This is done by
      selecting the spell you require and pressing the fire button. If the
      spell is mixed then you will be armed with it. Pressing the fir button
      whilst moving the joystick down will return you to the game. You cannot
      arm yourself with a spell on the cauldren screen. Having armed yourself
      with a spell you can cast it by pressing the fire button. Some spells
      can only be cast once while others can be used a number of times. Most 
      spells act as necessary when cast, however some of the more destructive 
      ones such as lightning and fireball will need some control to become
      effective. It is up to you to find out how to control your spells.

      COLLECTING HERBS
      Stand in front of the herb and press the fire button whilst moving the 
      joystick forward. Sucessful picking of the herb will be shown in the
      spell book.
