The STORY:

The Government has selected you to be the pilot of THUNDER MASTER, the
ultimate weapon.

Conflicts and wars threaten to destroy the world. Unity must be restored in
order to avoid a nuclear holocost.

THUNDER MASTER, a four wheel drive vehicle equipped with a triple turbo V16
engine, will allow you to croww enemy territories and fight to destroy
mines, bunkers, tanks and helicopters.

This could very well be your last transmission. If you refuse there will be
no hope left.

The only units we have left which are still able to fight, have prepared
tanks of Omega-Kerosene for you along the way; there will be sufficient
fuel for you to reach our bases, however, will you be able to fill up while
in mission?

The weapons at your disposal are the most sophisticated ever conceived by
our Techni-Robots:

	- tetranuclear propulsion missions guided by undecodable oral
	  frequency.

	- magnetic sustentain MV module with a firepower of 117 GinaWatts per
	  second.

The future is in your hands. Fire and forget; never look back, you won't
have time; you are our last chance....

YOUR MISSION:

After the presentation, you will choose the fight that you will be engaged
in. Then you will define if you wish to fight with THUNDER MASTER only or
with THUNDER MASTER and the MV module, THUNDER CLOUD.

A map of the world will then appear and you will have to select the
location where you wish to fight among six different wars represented on
the screen by explosions.

The fight can begin now.

THUNDER MASTER leaves its base, led by its calculator (Pico-computer with a
T8006809080986 Transprocessor 128 bits INMOTOFEL at 4,77 GHz).

Along the way you will come across tanks which will try to destroy you,
barbed-wire fences, mines, rocks to stop you, bunkers on the sides of the
road, waiting for you to fire...

Along the way you will also see the road split in two; you will then have
to choose one of the two possibilities offered to you.

The MV module THUNDER CLOUD has its own reserve of Omega-Kerosene. It also
has an automatic procedure to fill up its tank from THUNDER MASTER while
flying, if necessary.

THUNDER MASTER can fill up with Omega-Kerosene from the blue and green
cisterns. However, ATTENTION! our TechniRobot research center has been
destroyed before the MV module was completed. Therefore, THUNDER CLOUD
EXPLODES WHEN IN CONTACT WITH BLUE CISTERNS, but can fill up from green
cisterns.

THUNDER MASTER is practically indestructible, but like all triple-turbo
vehichle, its fuel consumption is very high but it is not related to speed.
Therefore it is in your interest to go as fast as possible in order to be
able to fill up before you run out of Omega-Kerosene and not fall in your
enemies hands and become helpless. Each time THUNDER MASTER explodes, 10000
points will be deducted from your score and if your score reaches zero, the
game will be lost.

SCORE:

 - rock...............5000 points
 - blue cone..........5000 points
 - green cone.........5000 points
 - barbed wire........2000 points
 - bush...............2000 points
 - mine..............10000 points
 - helicopter........20000 points
 - bunker............30000 points
 - tank..............50000 points

If you safely reach your base, a bonus related to the number of cones you
have collected will be awarded to you. On the world map a white dove will
indicate the site of your victory.
