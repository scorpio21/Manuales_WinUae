Keyboard Keys are re-definable   Changing Gears   Press the fire button then push forward on the joystick to change gears up. Press the fire and pull down on the joystick to change gears down.   SAVING YOUR BEST LAP TIMES  ==========================
 In F1WCE you are able to save your best lap times onto disk.  To do this all you need is a blank formatted disk, this needs to be done  before loading F1WCE. When saving best lap times follow the on screen prompts.  F1WCE has been designed so that you are unable to save your best lap times to the original F1WCE disk.    If you have selected automatic gearbox your car changes gears up and down for   you depending on your revs. If you have selected a manual gearbox then press  the fire button to change gear. If you are accelerating and press the fire  button you will change up a gear. To change down a gear pull the joystick back  and press on the fire button. Practice should make you an expert at this.  After qualifying you are shown your grid position and then taken back into the  pits to make your changes to your car set-up.  PIT STOPS =========
 You can make a pit stop at anytime. The pits locations is shown on the  overhead view on each circuit.   To enter the pits simply drive under the pits awning and bring your car to a  halt.You will then see a side view of your car which can be changed during the  pit-stops. These areas are gearbox, wings, tyres and fuel. To move between  each area push left and right on the Joystick. To change the selection in an  area press up and down on the joystick. To leave the pits press the fire  Button.  Gearbox.  ========

There are two settings, auto and manual. With a manual gearbox you have to  change gears yourself by pressing up and down on the joystick.  
Settings ========  The settings are low, medium and high. High Wings give more downforce and are good for really twisty circuits such as Monaco.  Tyres   =====
 The three tyre types are hard, soft and wet.  
Fuel 
====
 You can increase your fuel load by pressing up and down. Having a high fuel   load might mean you can have fewer pit-stops during a long races but increases  the weight of your car therefore making it slower.   THE GLORY =========

After the end of the race you are shown all of the finishing positions and, if  you are racing in a Championship, the current season standings. Press the fire  button to continue past these screens.   HINTS AND TIPS  ==============

To become the FIA Formula One World Champion will take a lot of practice. This  is especially important when learning the layouts of each of the courses. With 16 circuits on the FIA calendar trying to memorise every dip, corner, chicane and straight is going to be hard work. Make good use of the on-screen circuit map so you dont get caught out!!   Sometimes you may be stuck in traffic trying to overtake slower cars. Here the  tatic is to bide your time. Try and get onto the inside line of the circuit to  out brake other cars going into the corner.    Timing Pit-stops is crucial. Very often the difference between winning and  being second place is a badly timed pit-stop. Keep one eye on your tyre wear  indicator, one eye on your position on the track, and one eye on the weather  conditions (if you have 3 eyes that is!).  If racing in Championship mode remember that it might be more important to get  a few points in the bag than risk staying out on old tyres trying to get first  place.   THE END.
