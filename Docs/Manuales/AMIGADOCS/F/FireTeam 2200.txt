TASK DESCRIPTION


Assault and Retreat

Engage enemy targets at will.
Move to objectives without stopping.


Probe

Engage enemy targets at will.
Move to objectives normally, but avoid all minefields.
If damaged, seek cover. Once under cover, do not move again until undamaged
by enemy fire for a full 30 seconds.


Defend

Engage enemy targets at will.
Do not move unless covered by smoke, and then only one location toward
objective.


Cover

Engage enemy targets at will, using smoke rounds if possible.
Move to objectives normally.
Infantry units with this task will not enter transport vehicles.


Strafe

Engage enemy targets at will.
Travel to objectives without stopping. If at objective 1, revise objectives,
making objective 2 the first objective, and objective 1 the second objective.
In this manner, move back and forth between objective 1 and objective 2.


Convoy

Engage enemy targets at will.
Attempt to use road movement at all times. Priority is to always move forward
into next road location. However, if at a movement objective, and new objective
perpendicular to current facing, go off-road toward new objective.
If unable to continue on road toward current objective, go off-road, and use
assault style movement until road movement can be used again.
If confused, change task to Assault, and radio status change to Commander.

Target in Urban Terrain                 -10%
Target in woods Terrain                 -30%
Target or Shooter in Light Smoke        -10%
Target or Shooter in Heavy Smoke        -30%

Individual unit commander with high rank are know to achieve higher hit
probabilities than junior officer. Higher ranking commander also have the
ability to reduce the hit probability of incoming fire while they are in
motion, due to their superior knowledge of tactical maneuvaring.

Other modifiers due to special equipment and/or unique terrain can affect hit
probability, but these situations have not been adequately documented by
Corporate Auditors and are therefore ommiited from this briefing.
