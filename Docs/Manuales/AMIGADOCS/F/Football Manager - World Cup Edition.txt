                     INSTRUCTIONS FOR FOOTRALL MANAGER
 
                           WORLD  CUP  EDITION
						(TYPED IN BY BOBBY ROBSON)

	The aim is to manage your team through to win the World Cup Fimal.
	Unlike previous Football Manager games there is no requirement to
        deal with anything other than team tactics, positioning and
        indinidual player managment.

	What makes this gane uniquely brilliant is the fact that you now
	have total control of each player in terms of instructing him on
	things like passing forwards, backwards, long kicks, short kicks
	etc.

	Another major factor is morale. This subtley affects your teams
	performance. So what you say to the newspaper press is important.
	If the reporters believe and support what you say, they will print
	positive information about your team and it will boost their morale.

	You can also affect your teams morale by what you say to them
	before and halfway through a game.

		
			HOW THE TEAM GROUPS AND LEAGUES WORK.

	A

	The World Cup is split into 2 parts:

	1	European
	2	South American
	3	Oceana/Israel
	4 	Asia
	5	North and Central America/Caribbean
	6	Africa
	
	Depending on which team you wish to be, you have to play in
	accordance with the qualifying systems of that region.
	Also, if you choose Italy or Argentina, you will automatically go
	straight through to the finals.

	
	B

	The Finals.
	
	These start with league grops and progress to knock-out
	competitions.



			THE GAME VIEW

	THERE ARE TWO GAME VIEWS, BALL ON-VIEW AND SCROLLING VIEW, WHICH
	YOU CAN CHANGE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AT ANY TIME DURING THE ACTION
	SEQUENCE BY USING FIRE,LEFT MOUSE OR RETURN KEY.



	HINTS AND TIPS

	1. Player types. Strikers are better,at scoring goals.
	Passers choose more intelligent passes. Runners can run faster.
	Sweeper	players are better at sweeping up opponents attacks.
	The more passing options you allow a player, the more likely he is
	to pass than run with the ball.  
					(Typis note: So that where I have
	been going Wrong.)


		Please read the instructions carefully. I hope you enjoy
	the game. I believe it is my best to date. Enjoy yourself. Good 
	luck. KEVIN TOMS.


	The game is controlled by the MOUSE.
