                          FAST BREAK - The Manual

FAST BREAK

Slammers vs. Jammers. Two of the fast-breakingest teams since the invention
of Lycra gym shorts. A legendary basketball rivalry up there with L.A. and
Boston.

This is Real Hoops: my six against yours, three-on-three on court, 24
seconds, six fouls you're gone. It's a fast-release outlet after a major
bound, two no-look passes, a quick pump fake, dribble drive, and
downtown with the Slamma Jamma. You're going to love this game. Dr.
James Naismith and his peach baskets would be proud.

How to Load Your Game

  1.  Plug in your joystick (or joysticks), if you're using one.
  2.  Kickstart your computer with Kickstart 1.2 (if that is necessary
      for your model).
  3.  Insert your Fast Break Game Disk, label side up, into the disk
      drive.
  4.  Turn on your computer and the game loads automatically.

After the title and credits screens, a Game Selection screen automatically
appears, on which you set up your game. (You can press Esc anytime to
return to this screen, but when you do, you wipe out your current game.)

Choose Your Controls

  1.  You can use either your joystick, numeric keypad, or mouse to play
      Fast Break. (But to make reading less cumbersome, this manual
      refers only to the joystick). No matter which weapon you use, you
      control only one player at a time - the one wearing the high-
      fashion black shoes. Here's how each control moves the black-shod
      player.

          Keypad                        Mouse and Joystick

0 (zero key) = Fire Button

     \___  _|_  ___/                          \ | /
     |_7_||_8_||_9_|                           \|/
      ___       ___                         ___   ___
   --|_4_|     |_6_|--
      ___  ___  ___                            /|\
     |_1_||_2_||_3_|                          / | \
     /      |      \


Important: The fire button equivalent for the mouse is the left mouse
button.

(Page 1)


  2.  One-Player Game:

    o You can use the joystick, keyboard, or mouse. The joystick can be
      plugged into either Port 1 or Port 2, but the mouse can only be
      plugged into Port 1.

    o If you plug the joystick into Port 1, you must press the J key while
      on the Game Selection screen to make it work.

    o If you plug the mouse into Port 1 after you've used the joystick in
      Port 1, you must press M while on the Game Selection screen to use
      the mouse.

    o If you play with the joystick in Port 2 while the mouse is plugged
      in Port 1 - and want to use the joystick - be sure to press F2 to
      disable the mouse. That way and accidental movement of the mouse
      won't interfere with your joystick play.

  3.  Two-Player Game:

    o There are three ways to play: joystick vs. joystick, mouse vs.
      joystick, and mouse vs. keyboard.

    o If you plug a joystick into Port 1, you must press J while on the
      Game Selection screen to use it.

    o If you plug a mouse into Port 1 - the only place it can go - press
      M while on the Game Selection screen to use it.

    o If you want to switch which controller controls which team, just
      press F3. Press again, and they switch back.

  4.  To change the player you control, press and release the fire button
      quickly; the shoes of another player will turn black, and now he's
      under your control. Press again: the third player's shoes turn
      black. And so on.

  5.  If you touch the ball with your player, he automatically picks it up.
      Move, and he dribbles.

  6.  You can press F1 to toggle the sound on and off, and F4 to turn off
      the shoe squeak.

How to Choose Time, Team and Type of Game

  1.  Move your joystick up or down to highlight (or select) each of the
      following bar menus on the Game Selection screen:

         TIME - Six Minute Quarters: Select the time for each quarter by
         pressing the fire button until you find the duration of your
         choice: 3,6,9, or 12 minutes.

(Page 2)


         TEAM - Jammers vs. Slammers: Pick your favorite team and
         opponent by pressing the fire button until you're satisfied
         with one of three options (-c- designates the computer team).

         o Jammers vs. Slammers (two players, no computer)

         o -c- Jammers vs. Slammers

         o Slammers vs. Jammers -c-

         (SPACE) To Start Game: Select a game mode by pressing the fire
         button until you find the one you like.

         o (SPACE) To Start Game

         o (SPACE) For Playmaker (Slammers - white)

         o (SPACE) For Playmaker (Jammers - cyan, a bright green-blue)

         o (SPACE) For Practice (work on your moves without defensive
           pressure)

         Note: The Practice mode is only available when you select the
         "two player" option.

  2.  If you select Start Game or Practice, press the space bar to reveal
      the Players screen - the last screen (we promise) before action
      starts. (If you choose Playmaker turn to page 6 to see how to design
      your own play.)

How to Choose Your Players

The Players screen contains a 6-man roster and 15-play Playbook for each
team. Every player is a first-rate hoopster, but only three per team can
play at a time. So you have to choose your starting line-up: one Center
(C), one Guard (G), and one Forward (F). At each position, you have two
players to choose from. To choose:

  1.  Move your joystick up or down to highlight one of your team's
      positions (C, G or F)

  2.  One player is already listed, press the fire button to list the
      second.

  3.  Make your choice and leave that player's name in the bar; then
      choose the other two spots.

O  Scouting Reports

How do you choose between the two players at each position? An important
question. You can't just put bodies out there. Basketball's a team game.
You need players with complementary skills, players who work well
together.

(Page 3)

To help you create the best player mix for your team and your playing
style, we've compiled brief Scouting Reports for each player. Highlight
any player, and a brief description of his strengths and weaknesses
automatically appears at the bottom of the Roster. Study these well.
The right team at the right time is a big advantage.

O Statistics

Fast Break automatically tracks each player's statistics for the current
game, and records them at the end of the Scouting Report:

        0/0      FG     Field Goals made/Field Goals attempted
                        (Field Goals = Shots)

        0        PT     Total Points Scored

        0        PF     Personal Fouls (Making contact in a non-contact
                        sport)
        
        0        ST     Steals (Taking the ball away from the other team)

        0        TO     Turnovers (Giving the ball to the other team
                        when you shouldn't)

At the end of each game, you can check and compare the game stats for both
teams. A screen will automatically appear which lists both starting squads.

        o Highlight a position (Guard, Forward or Center). You can see
          that player's game stats at the bottom of your half of the
          screen. Notice that you can also see the stats of the other
          team's player on the other half of the screen.

        o To see how the substitutes fared in the game, just press the
          fire button. All sic subs for both teams show up on screen.
          Check their stats in the same way.

        o You can only check the other team's stats at the end of a game,
          obviously, when the info won't give you a competitive
          advantage.

How to Select Pre-Set Plays

O Offensive Plays

Both the Slammers and Jammers keep 15 plays in their Playbooks, 14 pre-
designed offensive plays (drawings of which you'll find by viewing the
"PLAYBOOK.IFF" picture) and one that you can design yourself. You can
select up to four plays at the beginning of each game, then change your
selections during timeouts and between quarters.

(Page 4)


Of course you don't need plays: A couple of quick passes and a Tomahawk
slam work just fine. And nothing says you have to run a play once you
call it: If a lane to the basket is clear, go for it. But if you're the
kind of person who enjoys the raw beauty of a perfectly-executed Pick
N Roll, put them in your repertoire:

  1.  Move your joystick down to highlight the word (Playbook) beneath
      your Roster.

  2.  Press the fire button; a playlist instantly replaces the Roster.
      Move the joystick up or down to scroll through the 15 plays. Four
      selected plays are marked with an asterisk (*).

  3.  To change a selection: Highlight the play and press the fire button;
      the asterisk disappears. Highlight another play which has no
      asterisk, press the fire button, and the asterisk reappears. The
      play is yours.

  4.  To select less than four plays: Press the fire button to remove
      asterisks from unwanted plays.

  5.  Things to ponder while studying these diagrams on the back cover:

       o These only tell you where your players are going to move; theres's
         no guarantee that you can execute the play this way. That's up to
         your skill.

       o The numbers (1, 2, etc.) indicate the succession of players with
         dark shoes - and hence you control - during the play.

       o Dotted lines - suggested passes (but all passes are optional).

       o Calling plays is one of the coolest things about this game:
         check out the Strategy section in the back for tips.

O Defensive Plays

Each team can choose from five pre-set defensive plays:

       Fast Break        Your two computer-controlled men break towards
                         center court when the other team shoots,
                         counting on you to grab the rebound and make the
                         quick outlet pass.

       Man-2-Man (T)     T = Tight. Your two computer-controlled players
                         cover their assignments very closely.

       Man-2-Man (L)     L = Loose. Your two computer-controlled players
                         play off their man, giving them the shot, but
                         trying to prevent the drive.

       Trap              Your two computer-controlled players always
                         follow the ball handler.

       Dbl Team          Double Team. One of your computer-controlled men
                         always follows the ball handler, which allows
                         you to join or "double team" him.

(Page 5)


Playmaker - How to Design Your Own Play

  1. You're on the Game Selection screen. Move the joystick down to
     highlight (SPACE) to Start Game, then press the fire button until
     you find the Playmaker option for your team.

  2. Press the space bar to reveal the Playmaker screen: your players
     trot onto the court and take their positions. You'll notice that one
     player has solid black shoes - that's important.

  3. Read the Play Box: Move player to first of four locations. This
     means: you can design the black-shod player to make up to four
     moves during this particular play. How?

  4. Move black foot to the desired location and press the fire button.
     Do this three more times until the second player's shoes turn black.
     Designate his moves the same way.

  5. When the moves of all three players are set in this way, press the
     space bar to return to the Game Selection screen. Your play is
     automatically recorded as Number 15 in your Playbook.

     Note: a player doesn't have to make four moves in every play. If
     you want him to move just twice, for example, press the fire
     button three times after you make his second move. You don't want
     him to move at all? Press the button four times right where he
     stands.

Gameplay

After you choose your line-up and select plays, you're ready to play ball.
Press the space bar, and the Game Screen appears. Six guys, a ball, and
half of a basketball court. If the computer team has the ball, get ready
to play defense. If it's your ball, the boys are standing around at the
end of the court, waiting for you to make something happen.

O The Game Screen

  1. Watch the bottom of the screen to find out which team (and player)
     controls the ball. It also shows the quarter, the time remaining
     in the quarter, the time remaining on the 24-second clock, and the
     score.

  2. Only half of the court appears on the screen: Dribble the ball over
     center line to make the second half of the court - and your basket -
     appear on the screen.

  3. Watch the two Play-by-Play Boxes at the bottom of the screen -
     Jammer box on the left, Slammer box on the right. They automatically
     show which man has the ball and which man guards him. For example:

(Page 6)


      Jackson - G with the ball           ("Flash" Jackson, the Slammer
                                           guard, has the ball)

      "Mercury" - G covering the play     ("Mercury" Monroe, Jammer
                                           guard, guards him)

O Imbounding the Ball

  1. Check your Play Box to see if your team has possession of the ball.

  2. Move your black-footed player to pick up the loose ball, then take it
     over the end line beneath your basket.

  3. Face your man in the general direction of one of your other players.

  4. Press and release the fire button quickly, and he fires a perfect
     chest pass inbounds. You're off.

O Dribbling

  1. Touch the ball with your player and he automatically picks it up.

  2. Move in any direction, and he dribbles. And he won't stop dribbling
     until he passes, shoots or someone steals it.

  3. When you move the mouse, the player will continue to dribble in that
     direction until you press the Right Mouse Button (that's the
     equivalent of centering the joystick) or move the mouse in a new
     direction.

O Passing

  1. Face your ball handler in the general direction of a teammate: press
     and release the fire button quickly.

  2. Beware of all opponents; they love to steal passes. But you can't
     deliberately pass it to them.

O Shooting

  1. Shoot anytime you have the ball on your end of the court.

  2. Press the fire button and hold it down to make your shooter go up
     for a jump shot.

  3. Release the fire button to release the shot; release it at the top
     of the jump to make your shots.

  4. Beware blocked shots. Your opponents won't say: "In your face." But
     they think it.

     Important note: if you're cool, do a full 360, turn-around, double-
     pump jumper, How? Hey - cool isn't taught: you just do it.

(Page 7)


O Scoring

  1. Make a Field Goal from within the three-point line (the arc that
     extends beyond the top of the key) and you score two points.

  2. Make a Field Goal from beyond the three-point line, and yes, you get
     three points.

O Blocking Shots

  1. When a shooter goes up for his shot, press the fire button and hold
     it down to make your blinking defender go up with him.

  2. Some players block shots better than others because they have greater
     jumping ability.

O Free Throws

  1. There are no Free Throws.

  2. Free Throws are for wimps.

O Calling Offensive Plays

  1. Linger with the ball near the half-court line for a few seconds, or
     dribble the ball into the key then back toward the center line, and
     suddenly all action stops. An Offensive Play box appears at the top of
     the screen that reads: CALL OFFENSIVE PLAY.

  2. Press the fire button and keep it down. Now your Offensive Play Box
     lists four plays. For example:

                        Screen Hi L     /\
                                        ||

                        Screen Hi R     ==>

                                        .

                        Pick N Roll    <==

                        Reverse Cut     ||
                                        \/

  3. Move the joystick in the direction of the arrow beside the play
     you want; that play is now set. Release the fire button. (If you
     don't want to call a play, don't move the joystick, just release the
     button.)

  4. Your players continue to run the selected pattern until you shoot,
     call another play, or lose possession.

(Page 8)


O Calling Defensive Plays

  1. When the offensive team calls a play, play stops, and a Defensive
     Play box also appears. It reads CALL DEFENSIVE PLAY.

  2. After the offensive team calls its play, you can press the fire
     button. Keep it down. Now your Defensive Play box lists the five
     defensive formations available to you.

                        Fast Break      /\   
                                        ||

                        Man-2-Man (T)   ==>

                        Man-2-Man (L)   .

                        Trap           <==

                        Dbl Team        ||
                                        \/

  3. Move the joystick in the direction of the arrow beside the defense you
     want; that play is now set. Release the fire button and the defense is
     set.

O Rebounding

  1. Move your player - offensive or defensive - to the hoop as quickly
     as you can after a shot.

  2. As the shot comes off the rim, press the fire button and keep it down
     to make your player jump for the ball.

O Playing Defense

  1. To steal, guard the dribbler closely. If he faces you with the ball,
     touch him and you strip away the ball safely. But be careful: You
     could foul him if he's not facing you.

  2. To intercept passes, position your man between the passer and his
     target.

O Personal Fouls

  1. Two kinds of Personal Fouls are called in this game: Charging (when
     your ball handler runs over a defender) and Foul (when you hack a
     dribbler or shooter).

  2. Each man is permitted six personals before he's forced to ride the
     pines.

(Page 9)

O Fouling Out

  1. Guard closely, but cautiously - after a player's sixth personal foul,
     he's gone. To the locker room. Shower city.

  2. When a player fouls out, the second man in his position automatically
     takes his place.

O Violations

  1. Violations are infractions of the rules, instead of a player's body.
     Thus they result in Turnovers (the other team gets the ball),
     instead of Personal Fouls.

     Violations include:

     24 Second Rule - From the moment you gain possession of the ball,
     you have just 24 seconds to shoot the ball, or the other team gets it.
     If you shoot and miss, but grab the rebound, the 24 second clock
     (located at the bottom of the game screen) resets, and you have
     another 24 seconds to shoot.

     Half Court Violation - When you inbound the ball beneath the basket
     you're defending, you have just 10 seconds to dribble or pass the
     ball over the center line into your half of the court. The ten-
     second count begins the moment your player receives the inbound pass.

     Certain violations or turnovers don't exist in Fast Break. You can't
     dribble or pass the ball out of bounds; you can't dribble or pass
     the ball back across the center line once you've crossed it (Over
     and Back); and you can't double dribble.

O Substitutions

  1. Change players as often as you'd like, but only during a timeout (no
     matter who calls it) and between quarters (when the game automatically
     stops).

  2. From the Players screen, move the joystick up or down to highlight
     the player (or players) you want to remove; then press the fire
     button to replace him.

O Timeouts

  1. You get three per half, six for the game.

  2. You can only call time after an opponent's Field Goal, when you have
     the ball out of bounds.

  3. Press the space bar to call a timeout: the Timeout screen appears.

  4. Press the fire button, the Players screen appears, and you are
     automatically assessed for the timeout.

(Page 10)

STRATEGY

O Study your team's strength and weaknesses before picking a lineup.

O You have a much better chance to win if you choose the "right"
  combination of players and skills.

O Use slower players to imbound the ball so that you can pass it in to
  the faster ones.

O If you have a fast break, go for it. But you'll find that your team's
  shooting percentages tends to go up when you call set plays.

O Confuse the defense. Call a set play, then drive the lane for a slam
  dunk.

O Don't exhaust your favorite players by overplaying them. Substitute
  judiciously, or they'll be tired at the end of the game when you need
  them most.

O Practice. Use the Practice Mode to work on your fundamentals, to find
  out how effective different players are in different situations, and to
  experiment with the Playmaker plays to see which create the best
  openings for good shots.

O Offense: follow your shot. Defense: crash the boards.

O Study well the offensive diagrams, and think strategy. Fast Break can
  handle as much basketball strategy as you know or want to learn. To
  get you thinking like Pat Riley here's an example of player strategy for
  the Reverse Cut Play:

  1.  Your best ball handler - usually a guard - has the ball up top.

  2.  When the other two players make their cuts, pass it to the best
      three-point shooter (usually the forward) for the shot, not the
      center who can't hit the side of a barn door.
      (Consult PLAYBOOK.IFF picture to view diagram)

   street-ball player and jazz saxophonist.
