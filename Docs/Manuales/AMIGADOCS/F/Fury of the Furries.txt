THE DOX TO FURY OF THE FURRIES...LSD RELEASED ON THE 12/02/94

THE RETURN
----------
TINIES ARE PROBABLY THE MOST MISCHIEVIOUS CREATURES IN THE WHOLE
GALAXY.THEIR SENSE OF HUMOUR IS VERY STRANGE-IN SOME OF THEM IT IS
POSITIVELY HORRID. SO WHEN SOME REBEL TINIES HID A SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATORY
SHIP ON THEIR HOME PLANET 'SKLUMPH',DISASTER WAS NOT FAR OFF. THE FURRY
PILOTS SET OFF WITH THE INTENTION OF INVADING EARTH AND SETTING EVERYBODY
AGAINST EACH OTHER! LUCKILY THE IRREPAIRABLE HAD BEEN ONLY JUST AVOIDED.

NOW AT LAST THE SHIP IS ON ITS WAY BACK TO 'SKLUMPH' AND THE TIMIES ON
BOARD HAVE COME TO THEIR SENSES,BUT THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IS LOOKING
OMNIOUS...

AND INDEED, ON ARRIVING AT THE CONSTELLATION OF CREDALIS, THE REBEL SHIPS
ON BOARD COMPUTER SUDDENLY CHURNS OUT A FLOOD OF DATA;THINGS ARE AFOOT ON
'SKLUMPH'!!!

A NEW RULER
-----------
WHILE THE REBELS WHERE AWAY, THE KING OF THE TINIES HAD SUMMONED TOGETHER
ALL HIS WISE TINIES(THE ONLY TINIES CAPABLE OF STAYING SERIOUS FOR MORE
THAN AN HOUR) BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BRING AN END TO THE DISORDER, THE OLDEST
AND WISEST TINY HAD A SOLUTION;A MACHINE WHICH COULD TRANSFORM THE FLUFFY
CREATURES INTO SOCIABLE BEINGS. THE INTIAL ATTEMPTS WERE SUCCESFUL, AND SO
THE PROCESS OF TRANFORMING THE TINIES ONE BY ONE BEGAN.

NOT EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY WITH THIS,THOUGH. THOSE TINIES WHO HAD THE BLACKEST
SENSE OF HUMOUR decided to resist undergoing transformation and they set
off to find the machine. one of these tinies,probably the wickedest,decided
to use the expedition to seize control and metamorphose his followers into
hideous stupid monsters,drunl with power, the wicked one had the king taken
prisoner and then proclaimed himself the new sovereighn of 'sklumph'....

(sorry guyz that was my sense of humour coming in there..i'll just go back
to CAPITALS now...)

THE WICKED ONE IS A CERTIFIED PARANOIAC. HE SEES ENEMIES EVERYWHERE AND TO
PROTECT HIMSELF FROM THEM HE HAS HAD A HUGE MACHINE BUILT TO METAMORPHOSE
ALL WHO OPPOSE HIM...

THESE DAYS THERE ARE VERY FEW TINIES LEFT, MOST HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO THE
STATUS OF MINDLESS BEINGS OR AGGRESIVE BEASTS ROAMING AROUND 'SKLUMPH', THE
KING A PRISONER IN HIS OWN CASTLE,CAN DO NOTHING FOR HIS SUBJECTS, THE
WICKED ONE, SPRAWLED ON A STOLEN THRONE,CHASES NASTY THOUGHTS ROUND HIS
HEAD.

THE MISSION
-----------
THE TINIES MUST NOW RETURN TO 'SKLUMPH' TO END THE TYRANTS REIGN. TO HELP
THEM ON THEIR QUEST ARE THREE MAGIC RINGS WHICH WERE WROUGHT IN OLDEN TIMES
BY A MAGICIAN, THESE RINGS HAVE HIDDEN POWERS,EACH OF THE LITTLE CREATURES
IS NORMALLY ONE COLOUR -RED . GREEN . RED OR BLUE, BUT SOMETIMES IN CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES THEY CAN CHANGE COLOUR, AND HERE THE RINGS HELP!. WEARING THE
3 RINGS ON A FINGER, A TINY CAN TAKE ON ANY OF THESE COLOURS TOGETHER WITH
ITS ACCOMPANYING POWERS!.

BUT BE CAREFUL, THE WICKED ONE KNOWS WELL THE INHERENT ABILITIES OF HIS
FELLOW CREATURES AND, TO PROTECT HIMSELF, HE HAS FEILDS OF COLOUR PUT ALL
OVER THE PLACE. THESE ARE ENERGY RAYS WHICH PREVENT THE TINIES USING THE
POWER OF THE RINGS. IT IS UP TO YOU AND NO OTHER GUIDE THE TINY WITH THE
RINGS TO COMPLETE HIS QUEST,SAVE THE KING OF THE TINIES AND OVERTHROW THE
WICKED ONE...    OVER TO YOU!!!

THE QUEST
---------
YOUR GOAL IS TO REACH THE CASTLE AND DELIVER THE KING FROM THE USURPERS
CLUTCHES,FIRST OF ALL YOU MUST MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH THE EIGHT REGIONS OF
'SKLUMPH' TO LEAVE EACH SCREEN YOU MUST FIND THE WAY OUT,ALWAYS MARKED
'EXIT'.

TINIES MOVEMENTS
----------------
YOU CAN MOVE A TINY USING A JOYSTICK OR A KEYBOARD.
JOYSTICK...RIGHT OR LEFT..KEYS RIGH OR LEFT ARROW KEY; TINY MOVES SIDEWAYS
(IN THE AIR OR ON THE GROUND).

JOYSTICK UP/UP ARROW; TINY JUMPS WITH EACH JUMP HE GAINS MOMENTUM AND
REACHES A MAXIMUM HEIGHT AFTER THREE JUMPS, HE CAN'T JUMP UNLESS HE IS IN
CONTACT WITH THE GROUND AT THE START OF A JUMP )

TO JUMP DIAGONALLY THE TINY REQUUIRES ON THE JOYSTICK UP AND RIGHT OR UP
AND LEFT AT THE SAME TIME...ON KEYS ITS UP THEN LEFT OR RIGHT KEY...

FIREBUTTON/SPACE BAR TINY USES THE POWER CORRESPONDING TO HIS COLOUR.

PLEASE NOTE; ON THE AMIGA THE SPACE BAR IS REPLACED BY THE SHIFT KEY.

JOYSTICK DOWN/DOWN ARROW; IF HE IS ON A SOLID SURFACE. THE TINY UNDERGOES A
TRANSFORMATION.PRESS ONCE AND THE TINY DISINTEGRATES. NOW YOU CAN CHOOSE
HIS COLOUR BY PUSHING THE JOYSTICK LEFT OR RIGHT OR PRESSING THE LEFT OR
RIGHT ARROW(CURSOR TO THICKOS). THE TINY IS REFORMED BY PUSHING THE
JOYSTICK UP/PRESSING THE UP ARROW.

ALL THE TINIES CAN WALK AND RUN ON SOLID SURFACES,SWIM ALONG THE SURFACE OF
WATER(NB THEY CANNOT GET OUT OF THE WATER UNLESS THE BANK IS LEVEL WITH THE
SURFACE OF THE WATER)

THEY CAN ALSO PUSH OBJECTS,PLACE THE TINY NEXT TO THE OBJECT AND WALK HIM
IN THE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO MOVE THE OBJECT, IF THAT OBJECT CAN BE
MOVED IF WILL BE.IF THE OBJECT FALLS INTO THE WATER OR SAND. THE LEVEL
RISES.

EACH COLOUR PROVIDES TINIES WITH SPECIFIC ABILITIES AND POWERS
--------------------------------------------------------------
YELLOW.

WHEN THE TINY IS YELLOW HE CAN THROW FIREBALLS. FIRE BUTTON /SPACE BAR
(SHIFT ON THE AMIGA AS BEFORE?). THE FIREBALLS FIRED ARE OF VARIED
INTENSITIES; THE LONGER YOU HOLD DOWN THE FIREBUTTON/SPACE BAR(SHIFT?) THE
MORE POWERFUL THEY ARE.

YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE TINIES POSITION WHEN HE IS PREPARING TO FIRE,BUT HE
CAN CONTINUE IN THE DIRECTION HE IS GOING.

A YELLOW TINY CAN GO THROUGH FLAMES!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTHORS NOTE HERE; (HEHEHE THATS ME) EARLIER ON IN THIS MANUAL IT STATED
NB; AMIGA OWNERS USE SHIFT INSTEAD OF SPACEBAR..I'D TRY BOTH TO FIND OUT AS
REGARDS FIRING THINGS...COZ IT DONT SAY HERE...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
BLUE POWER

WHEN THE TINY IS BLUE HE CAN DIVE UNDER WATER (JOYSTICK DOWN/DOWN ARROW)
WHILE IN THE WATER. HE CAN ALSO SPIT AIR BUBBLES TO ATTACK ENEMIES OR MAKE
MAKE WATER LEVELS RISE IN NARROW SPACES. FIRE BUTTON/SPACEBAR (SHIFT?)

                   -----------------------------------
GREEN POWER

WHEN THE TINY IS GREEN HE CAN THROW OUT A LINE AND HOOK HIMSELF ONTO ANY
OBJECT OR PART OF THE SURROUNDINGS ON WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO WALK (THE
GROUND,BRANCHES,ROCKS,PLATFORMS ECT) AND ALSO ONTO MOST FLYING ENEMIES.

FIREBUTTON/SPACEBAR (WHILE THE LINE IS IN THE AIR) HOOKS THE LINE ONTO
AN OBJECT IF IT IS LESS THAN HALF OF THE SCREEN AWAY FROM THE TINY.

FIREBUTTON AND ANY DIRECTION/SPACEBAR AND ANY DIRECTION ARROW;HOOKS THE
LINE DIAGONALLY. IF THERE IS NO OBJECT TO HOOK ONTO IN A DIAGONAL POSITION,
THE LINE GOES FOR AN OBJECT IN THE VERTICAL POSITION.

FIREBUTTON AND ANY DIRECTION/SPACE BAR AND ANY DIRECTIONAL ARROW WHEN THE
LINE IS ALREADY HOOKED MAKES THE LINE LONGER/SHORTER.

ONCE THE LINE IS HOOKED,THE TINY WILL BECOME UNHOOKED IF;
- THE LINE IS CUT BY AN ENEMY OR BY AN OBJECT
- THE FIREBUTTON/SPACEBAR IS RELEASED
- HE KNOCKS AN OBJECT AS HE PASSES
- YOU SWITCH OFF YOUR MACHINE (HEHEHEHE)

THE TINY CAN ALSO PULL SOME OBJECTS TOWARDS HIM BY THROWING THE LINE INTO
THEM AND THEN WALKING AWAY FROM THEM.
                   -----------------------------------

RED POWER

WHEN THE TINY IS RED HE GETS SO HUNGRY HE CAN EAT CERTAIN BITS  OF THE
SURROUNDINGS.

THE BITS TO THE CORESPONDING MOVEMENT/KEY..(RIGHT EATS RIGHT ECT)

TELEPORTS
---------
TELEPORTS ARE MARKED BY LITTLE SPARKLING STARS,ANYTHING THAT GOES THROUGH
THEM IS INSTANTLY TELEPORTED TO ANOTHER PLACE(WHICH IS NOT INDICATED) BUT
IS ALWAYS THE SAME FOR EACH TELETRIP. THE TINY CAN PUSH OBJECTS AND EVEN
ENEMIES THROUGH SO THAT THEY ARE TELEPORTED AWAY.

COLOUR FEILDS
-------------
WHEN THE TINY GOES THROUGH ONE OF THESE,HE LOSES THE POWER THAT CORRESPONDS
TO THE COLOUR OF THE FEILD,TO REGAIN THIS POWER HE MUST GO BACK THROUGH THE
FEILD,EACH SUBSEQUENT PASSAGE THROUGH THE FEILD ACTIVATES OR DE-ACTIVATES
