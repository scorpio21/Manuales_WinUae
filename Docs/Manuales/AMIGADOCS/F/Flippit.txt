     FLIPPIT INSTRUCTIONS
     ====================


1. Introduction to FLIPPIT
--------------------------

Flippit is an entertaining series of graphics puzzles designed to stimulate the mind. There are over 100 levels of play, each with interesting and colourful graphics. Flippit presents a challenge to all ages as it doesn't set limits on how long you play or how many moves you take to solve the puzzle.

The principle of the game is to match the pattern. Some are very easy, some hard, some seemingly impossible. Hardness tends to increase with level number, and you will build up an intuitive playing method to help you with harder levels as you play. Watch out for the odd tricky one!!


2. Getting Started
------------------

FLIPPIT comes ready to run for your computer. These instructions primarily describe the AMIGA version. Mouse action also refers to Atari and MAC versions, with some minor variations. Your package may have an extra sheet of instructions for your computer.

Auto-starting computers will self-start the game. If your computer needs you to type in the name of the game, follow the extra instructions for your computer. The game will be ready to start level 1.


3. How to play
--------------

Before you start playing, you will see the FLIPPIT "between level" screen. Just click in the middle of the screen to get started. This screen will be explained a bit further on. (See RANDOMIZER and LOW SCORES).

Using the mouse, click on the tile to flip. The basic rule is that the one you click on ALWAYS flips over. The tricky part is that each tile has a set of "rules" to follow. These rules consist of flipping other tiles over in a pattern. Generally, the patterns are symmetrical or follow lines up, down, left, right, etc.

Sometimes the odd tricky level may have one or two exceptions to the rule. Some levels have easy solutions, easy to find, but you just can't see it!!

Your moves are counted, one move per click. Those who complete the puzzle in the least moves get to record their name on the "Low Scores" table. You are also timed on how long it takes you. If you make the same number of moves as someone else but do it quicker, you beat them! ATARI has a fast flip option on the right button.

For those who want to reset the level and start again, click anywhere on the smaller grid. There is a BIG penalty for this - 32 moves! Also, after 40 moves you can exit the level by clicking on the non-smiling face that will appear on the top left. ATARI can exit level at any time. Music can be switched on and off by clicking on the musical note.

If you like to see some different images for the level you are on, click on the "new images" button at the top of the screen.


RANDOMIZER
----------

When you have completed all the preset levels, the game will switch to "randomizer" mode. Random levels are created by making a new pattern using the rules from an existing level, ensuring they can be solved. ATARI scrambles the next level, and does not stay locked. AMIGA stays randomizing levels until you click on RANDOMIZER on the "between level" screen. Click on the PREVIOUS LEVEL box on ATARI to replay the same level. Enter randomizer at any time by clicking on it.


LOW SCORES
----------

On the "between levels" screen, click on the LOW SCORES box and you will enter the scores screen. Move the mouse up and down. Level numbers will scroll past. The level highlighted indicates which level you will jump to when you press the right mouse button. Press the left button to exit.


NAME ENTRY SCREEN
-----------------

When you get the lowest moves in the lowest time, this screen appears. Just click in your name. If you want a space in the name, just click OUTSIDE the main box. Click END to exit, RUB to delete last letter.

Remember that for the scores to be saved on the disk, don't write protect it.

Levels were designed and tested to ensure they were solvabl, and to give everyone a wide range of puzzles.
