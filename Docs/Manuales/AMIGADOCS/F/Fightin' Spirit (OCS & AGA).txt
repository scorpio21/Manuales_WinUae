LOADING INSTRUCTIONS AND INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------

ECS Version (A500) - Take a blank formatted disk, insert disk 1 and reset. Hold the left mouse
button pressed and when prompted insert the blank formatted disk. At the end of the writing the
computer will reset. To complete the installation activate the appropiate icon in the freshly

AGA Version (A1200) - From Workbench insert disk 1 and activate the appropriate icon.

BEGINNING TO PLAY
-----------------

Press the fire button or a key. You'll see on the screen the following options: STORY MODE,
VS BATTLE, TOURNAMENT, TEAM MATCH, HALL OF FAME, OPTIONS, CREDITS.

To make your choice move up or down the joystick and press the fire button on the illuminated

THE GAME MODES
--------------
STORY MODE

The Supreme Warriors Tournament begins! Checking on this option you will join the tournament,
selecting one of the characters of the game, to fight and defeat Jenshi Yamamoto, the boss of the
Hikawa secret organization. Will you be able to complete this difficult task?

VS BATTLE
---------

Some of your friends say that they are stronger than you? This is the right chance to show them
that no one can defeat you!

TOURNAMENT
----------

We thought to give you the chance to organize a tournament with some of your friends, to find
out which one is the strongest. We also thought that it is improbable that you can invite
more than seven persons at the same time (for reasonable space problems), so we opted for eight
partecipants with a maximum number of eight human players. This means that if you will play
with five human players, the computer will control the other three characters. By the way, if you
will have a birthday party and you want to play with a lot of friends you can divide them into two
combats sessions and organize a final match between the two winners, using the VS BATTLE
mode.

TEAM MATCH
----------

This is a little bit strange game mode. You can choose to fight against the computer or your
friend, the number of characters of your team (you can select the game character three times at
the maximum) and of your enemy's team, if the computer control it.

THE GAME OPTIONS

GAME TYPE - Normal/Death Match
Different from the standard game mode you can also decide to play with the DEATH MATCH

When you hit your opponent this pointer moves towards him, increasing your energy and
decreasing his one. To defeat him you have to bring his energy to zero.

BLOOD - On/Off
For those violence lovers tomatoes juice fans, this is the chance to see amazing blood
splashes on screen flying everywhere and staying on the floor... Or if you prefer, for those
peaceful lovers the chance to eliminate the blood.

Don't you want to be stunned under the opponent's hits? Ok, you can eliminate this variable.
