		  FOOTBALL MANAGER 2

                  THE NEW GAME
                  Football Manager 2 is not just an improvement on Football 
                  Manager 1 - it is a complete re-write.
                  FM2 contains many improvements on FM1 yet still contains the 
                  basic ingredients that made FM1 one of the biggest selling 
                  home computer games ever.
                  I have completely redesigned the graphics match action and the 
                  tactics of team selection. Your tram now plays to the style 
                  and formation that you select and you can actually watch and 
                  assess the performance of your individual players. There is 
                  skillful passing, tackling, crosses, lobs into the net, diving 
                  goalkeeper saves, close marking, close passing play, 
                  kick-and-rsuh - in fact an infinite variety of action.
                  Tactical changes include man to man marking, choice of 
                  formations and substitutions. 
                  Other enhancements include League Cup matches, full 92 team 
                  league, Sponsorship, Success points, Goal scorer display, 
                  Enhanced transfer marker, training etc.
                  There is an endless variety of technique of playing this game 
                  and I'm sure you will enjoy developing your own Football 
                  Management style.
                  I have worked very hard over many months to provide you with a 
                  very entertaining game. I hope you have many, many hours of 
                  enjoyment from Footnall Manager 2. 
                  QUICK START TO PLAYING
                  To get the best out of the game you will need to study the 
                  following instructions carefully but to help you get into the 
                  game quickly I have identified some of the instructions 
                  between the words **NOTE** and **NOTE END**. Reading what is 
                  enclosed by these will give you the basic guide to playing 
                  Football Manager 2. 
                  CONTROLS
                  The whole game is controlled using joystick type movement as 
                  follows:
                  [UP] - Joystick Up / Q
                  [DOWN] - Joystick Down / S
                  [LEFT] - Joystick Left / I
                  [RIGHT] - Joystick Right / P
                  [FIRE] - Fire Button / Return
                  The use of Joystick or Keyboard is dependent on the computer 
                  on which the game is played.
                  The game use UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to select items using the 
                  displayed pointer. FIRE is used to confirm a selection. 
                  ****************************** NOTE 
                  ******************************
                  TEAM SELECTION CONTROLS
                  Team selection is carried out over three screens depicting 
                  defence, midfield and attack as follows:-
                  1. The reserve pool slot is at the top of the screen. Pressing 
                  FIRE when pointing to this slot will produce the FIRE TO QUIT 
                  message.
                  2. When FIRE TO QUIT is displayed - 
                  a) UP/DOWN will scroll through your reserve players and 
                  pressing FIRE again will select one.
                  b) LEFT/RIGHT will move to the next right or left screen if 
                  possible, it is also used to place your goalie in position 
                  i.e.:- move your cursor from the player selection area down 
                  twice and depending on which end your goalie is move 
                  left/right.
                  c) FIRE again will end team selection if 11 players have been 
                  picked.
                  3. Moving the pointer to an empty slot and pressing FIRE will 
                  transfer the reserve player displayed at the top of the screen 
                  to that slot.
                  4. Pressing FIRE on a slot that contains a player selected 
                  will transfer him back to the reserves.
                  5. When team selection ends you will be allowed to select two 
                  substitutes by scrolling UP/DOWN through your reserves and 
                  pressing FIRE to select.
                  6. At half-time you will be able to alter your team and bring 
                  on substitutes.
                  7. Note that display slots are placed over the actual areas of 
                  the pitch that each individual player will cover in your team 
                  formation.

                  ******************************
                  PLAYING GUIDE
                  At the start of the game you will be able to choose your team. 

                  Sponsorship
                  At the start of each season you will be offered sponsorship. 
                  The maximum is 50.000 per division (i.e. Division 1 = 
                  200.000). If you reject a sponsor the chances of another offer 
                  depend on your managerial rating (MR). A MR of 100 will give 
                  you a 75% chance of another offer whilst a MR of 50 will give 
                  you a 50% chance. If your MR is 25% or less you will get no 
                  more offers.
                  Then choose your skill level: start at 1 until you gain 
                  experience and playing skill. The highrer levels help you to 
                  maintain a challenge in playing the game. 
                  Management Record
                  This is a record of your achievements. Success points are 
                  earned from your final league position at the end of a season 
                  and from Cup match success. Your Managerial rating is an 
                  average of your success points per season and is out of 100. 
                  Load/Save Game
                  Before each match you will have the chance to save or load the 
                  game. This allows you to stop the game and continue another 
                  time and will allow you to work your way up the league. 
                  Save/Load instructions are given in the machine instructions. 
                  The Match
                  (see Team Selection Controls for details of how to pick the 
                  team). 
                  1. Team Display
                  This is shown in three sections for your Defence, Midfield and 
                  Attack. Each team is shown with the players in their playing 
                  positions. The four paired slots on each screen show the 
                  man-to-amn marking of players. That is players in slots 
                  horizontally next to each other on a screen will mark each 
                  other during the match action.
                  The slot at the top of the screen contains your reserve 
                  players and can be rolled through to select them. 
                  2. Playing Skill
                  (see Player attributes) 
                  ****************************** NOTE 
                  ******************************
                  The skill of individual players affects the match action 
                  significantly. In the man-to-man marking, players with the 
                  higher skill will tackle more effectively and dribble the ball 
                  more successfully past opponents of lesser skill.
                  For each half of the match, all of the players in the twelve 
                  marking zones are compared with their opposing players and, 
                  with a random factor thrown in, the highest value player will 
                  start a new playing action sequence in possession of the ball. 
                  If the difference between the two players is close, no action 
                  sequence will occur. Thus you can influence the whereabouts of 
                  the start of attacks and the likely number of them by the way 
                  you match the skill of your players up against the opponents 
                  with the man-to-man marking.
                  N.B. If the marking players are close in skill they will 
                  probably neutralise each other. If the skills are 
                  significantly different, the highest will probably win and 
                  start an attack with the ball at his feet. A player marking 
                  free space will probably start an attack from there, as the 
                  game treats him as marking a skill rating 2 player.
                  Players playing out of position, e.g. a Defender playing in 
                  Midfield will play as if they have a skill rating of only 2. 
                  ****************************** NOTE END 
                  ******************************
                  The goalkeeper's skill is a measure of his ability to save 
                  shots. 
                  3. Formation
                  There are twelve possible zones in which you can place your 
                  outfield players. These are depicted by the four playing slots 
                  for outfield players on each of the three team selection 
                  screens. Thus you can play in many formations i.e. 4-3-3, 
                  4-4-2, 4-2-4 etc. Since your team will play in the positions 
                  you choose you can decide to play defensively, attacking, with 
                  wingers, down the middle or however you wish. 
                  ****************************** NOTE 
                  ******************************
                  The tem selection slots are directly over the area of the 
                  pitch which the player in that slot will play when the action 
                  starts. Any player in the horizontally adjacent slot will mark 
                  him during play and will play in the same zone. Players will 
                  also cover areas of the pitch next to their own if there is no 
                  player covering that area. Note that this zoning of players 
                  allows you to spot the performance of individual players 
                  because you can identify them by their position. 
                  ****************************** NOTE END 
                  ******************************
                  4. Opponents
                  The skill of your opponent's players will depend on who you 
                  are playing against. If you progress through the cup you will 
                  play more skillful teams as you advance. Top league teams will 
                  also be stronger opponents than lowly teams. 
                  5. Fitness
                  Playing in a match will affect each player's fitness. They 
                  will pick up knocks during play and may be injured. 
                  6. Full Team
                  You must pick eleven players before you will be allowed to end 
                  team selection. You will then be required to pick two 
                  substitutes. The substitutes may be brought on and the team 
                  formation changed at half time. 
                  7. Playing Styles
                  During the Extra Training part of the game, you can modify the 
                  playing style of your team. The effect of this is visible 
                  during the match action. Thus your team will use close or long 
                  passing, or high passes as you have selected. Note that 
                  different opponents will also use varying styles. 
                  8. The Action
                  Each half of the match will consist of several action 
                  sequences. (See Playing Skill for details of how each sequence 
                  starts). Each sequence continues until either the ball is out 
                  of play, a goal is scored or the goalkeeper saves a shot. 
                  The match action allows you to see the result of your actions. 
                  The skill of players you have selected and how you have 
                  positioned them will visibly affect what happens! 
                  9. The Home Team
                  The Home Team will always start the match playing from left to 
                  right. 
                  10. Half Time
                  At Half Time you can bring on substitutes and alter your team 
                  formation. This can be very useful, I'll give you an exemple: 
                  In one match I noticed that my team was doing badly in 
                  midfield and I was one down at half time. I moved one 
                  midfielder over to mark the opponent's most successful 
                  midfield player and moved another out to the wing to give some 
                  width to the midfield play. I also moved an attacker out onto 
                  the wing. The extra width in midfield allowed my team to get 
                  round their strong midfield players and my attacking winger's 
                  crosses brought 4 goals in the second half and my team won 
                  4-1. 
                  MATCH RESULTS
                  After your match either:
                  a) The other league results and league table will be shown.
                  b) The result of your cup match shown. 
                  INJURY REPORT
                  This displays a list of your injured players. Players with a 
                  fitness value less than 50% are injured and unfit to play. 
                  Players will accumulate knocks when playing in matches, and 
                  possible sustain long term injuries. Players will recover 
                  their fitness gradually when rested from match play. 
                  FINANCE
                  This shows the profitability of your club. If your club has a 
                  negative bank balance, you will be sacked.
                  Gate receeipts are dependent on who was playing at home. If 
                  you are successful as a team your home receipts will rise. Cup 
                  success also produces high gate receipts.
                  Player Buy/Sell is a total of your Transfer Market trading.
                  Player wages are dependent on the skill of your players and 
                  the number of them. In other words a lot of highly skilled 
                  players will cost a lot in wages.
                  Overheads are a record of the fixes costs that are incurred by 
                  your club.
                  Profit is measured weekly.
                  All financial values are higher as you rise up the Divisions. 
                  SELL PLAYERS
                  All of your players are listed during the sell player routine 
                  so you can check your squad. You will be able to sell a player 
                  if you wish and an offer up to his displayed value will be 
                  made for him if you do. 
                  If you reject the offer you will have to wait to the following 
                  week to try again. Remember you are paying wages for all 
                  players in your squad even if they are not picked to play. 
                  Also if you have less than thirteen players you cannot make up 
                  a team and matches will be forfeited. 
                  BUY PLAYER
                  Up to three players will be for sale. You may bid for any of 
                  them. The higher your bid, the more chance of purchase. You 
                  may even be able to buy them for less than their value. The 
                  SQUAD TOO BIG message means you must sell a player before any 
                  more will be offered for sale. 
                  EXTRA TRAINING
                  This feature allows you to modify the way your players pass 
                  the ball. It is an advanced feature and is best left unaltered 
                  until you have got used to the gameplay and watched a lot of 
                  matches.
                  Passing Height allows you to increase/decrease to height of 
                  passes. Basically high passes will produce a Kick and Rush 
                  style which can help to, say, bypass a weak midfield. Low 
                  passing will lead to closer play.
                  Passing Length allows you to increase/decrease the length of 
                  passes. Short passing will suit a highly skilled team that 
                  dribbles well. Long passing may suit a side with wingers.
                  The tips on Passing Height and Length above are just a guide 
                  and you will be able to develop your own technique to suit 
                  your team and style of play. You will see the effect of your 
                  passing style on the pitch.
                  If you get the PERFECTED message it means that you have 
                  reached the maximum or minimum length or height and more of 
                  the same extra training will not have an added effect. 
                  THE SEASON
                  You will play all of the other teams in your division once and 
                  play through the Cups as far as you progress. Promotion and 
                  Relegation at the end of season is three up three down. 
                  SUCCESS
                  The aim of the game is to be as successful as possible and try 
                  and win the Treble of League and Two Cups. However the game is 
                  designed to be enjoyable enough for you to play as long as you 
                  like.

                  Skill
                  In the ranges 3 to 9. This affects his play during the match. 
                  A player out of position e.g. a defender in attack of a 
                  midfield player playing in goal will play with a skill value 
                  of 2. 
                  Fitness
                  Out of 100. This is reduced by playing in a match as the 
                  player receives knocks or injuries. A player who is rested in 
                  the reserves will recover some of his fitness. A player with a 
                  fintess value of less than 50 is too badly injured to play. 
                  Position
                  G, D, M, A. As follows:
                  G - Goalkeeper
                  D - Defender
                  M - Midfield Player
                  A - Attacker
                  These are the players correct playing positions. Note a player 
                  playing out of position is less effective (see Skill above). 
                  Playing positions are easy to identify on the team selection 
                  screen. The goalkeeper's slot is over the goal. Defender's 
                  slots are on the same screen as your goalkeeper. Midfield 
                  players slots are shown against the middle pitch backdrop. 
                  Value
                  30.000 to 360.000. This is directly affected by the player's 
                  skill and the division you are playing in. It will affect his
