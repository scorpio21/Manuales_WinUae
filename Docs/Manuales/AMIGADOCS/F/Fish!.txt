   Memo from
   Rear-Admiral Sir Playfair Panchax VC DSO FRT


   The Seven Deadly Fins is the most dangerous group of inter-
   dimensional anarchists around. They live up to their name in
   every respect. There are seven of them, they are deadly and
   have been seen with fins. This septic septet will stop at
   nothing to destroy all forms of life as we know it.

   Their motives are profit, strategic advantage and, most of all,
   fun. They have committed some of the biggest crimes of the
   century and wiped out entire civilizations, sometimes by
   accident.

   At Mission HQ we have assembled a team of crack inter-
   dimensional espionage operatives in an attempt to overcome
   this hideous force. We have succeeded in many cases in
   thwarting the enemy, but so far, the Fins have escaped capture.

   Several operatives have been caught by the Fins and never seen
   again.

   We have one small chance. Operatives can be trained in a
   technique known as warping and can beat the Seven Deadly
   Fins at their own game. It is through this process that the
   Fins carry out their crimes. It may be deduced why this
   technique is important.

   This dossier contains instructions on warping for trainee
   operatives and all the information currently available on the
   Seven Deadly Fins. If further details are required, contact
   Training Section through the usual channels.

   WARPING - THE FACTS

   So you are a trainee inter-dimensional espionage operative.
   You're in the big league now. Would you like to learn about
   warping? Would you like to know that warping is a fun, fast
   and extremely exciting method of travelling through the
   dimensions? Well, it isn't. Warping pushes operatives through
   extreme mental stresses.

   Does warping hurt? Yes, it hurts! But that is whay you're here
   for isn't it? THe following are first time experiences by other
   inter-dimensioanl espionage operatives. They should give you
   an idea of what you are letting yourself in for:

      It's just like being in a car crash except you're the car.

                                             Micky Blowtorch *1

      Warping is just like being at the centre of the sun. Your
      flesh burns away. It really hurts. What I hate most about
      warping is that the pain never stops.

                                                  Alice Shad *2



   *1 Micky Blowtorch is a highly regarded operative who worked
   in the Slad Province. He has written a book on his early
   warping experiences. Blowtorch M.G. [2067] "Warping Along
   With Blowtorch", Random Publishing, Plin City.

   *2 Alice Shad has since been retired from active service and now
   works in out contracts departement.

      It reminded me of the day I got my first hammer. It was a
      present from my father. I was so proud of that hammer. I
      take it everywhere with me.
      My problem was using it. The only nail I could hit on the
      head was my fingernail. It was through this experience that
      I gained my ability to withstand pain.

                                          Jimmy "Rocket" Panchax!

   So there you have it, as it were, from the horse's mouth. And
   why not? These people know. They are adults. They don't cry.
   They don't like to admit they're hurt. Warping is not fun.
   Warping is not glamorous. Mind you, nothing is glamorous,
   what I meant was glamorous - warping is not glamorous.
   Warping is a job and we're here to make sure that it's a job
   well done!

   The following section answers some of the more common
   questions put forward by trainee inter-dimensional espionage
   operatives. Take careful note and remember "A shared fish has
   no bones." *2

   WHAT IS A WARP?

   A warp is a "convenient method of transferring the mind of a
   person from this dimension into the body of a living thing in
   this or any other dimension". So writes Professor Ivan Funn
   of the University of Mind in his book, "Warps 'n' All." *3

   Warps are generated here at Mission HQ by the Espionage
   Support Team (EST). In their book, Warping Broadens The


   *1 Jimmy Panchax is the well travelled son of the current head of
   Mission HQ, Rear-Admiral Sir Playfair Panchax VC DSO FRT.
   "Rocket" earned his nickname by completing seven missions in
   six days.

   Heard. Anchovy, Ling and Lumpsucker, New York.

   Monkfish, London.


                                 1.4

==========================================================================


   Mind *1. Professors Basking and Thresher suggest that warps
   could be created using special secret technique. The book
   never reveals these methods however so we have had to
   employ both Basking and Thresher on a large retainer to aid us
   in defeating the Fins.

   It is these highly secret techniques we use when creating a
   custom warp for you. You don't need to know what they are,
   just that they work. However, since they require a vast amount
   of energy it can take a long period of time for us to prepare and
   generate these "holes". The motto is "Be prepared. Prepared to
   wait".


   HOW DO I RECOGNIZE A WARP WHEN I

   SEE ONE?

   Warps appear as a hole in the fabric of a dimension you are
   in. It is convenient to have a warp appear on an object, for
   example, a wall. This is because the brain has great problems
   viewing objects whish have more than three dimensions. A
   warp appearing in the middle of a room, for example, is
   sufficient to drive any untrained being mad. But you are not
   untrained or at least you won't be when you have completed
   your training. That isn't to say that you won't also be mad,
   but that's your problem.

   [Whether or not you think you're already mad fill out form
   61/97/883 and return it to Mission HQ at once.]


   WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I WARP?


   Warping is relatively simple to accomplish. You enter the
   hole. It hurts. You end up somewhere else. As someone else.
   You are now in Host-Parasite Mode or, as we prefer to call it:
   HPM, because it sounds far more technical.

   The Mind. Mackerel and Monkfish, London.


                                 1.5

==========================================================================


   WILL IT MAKE ME GO BLIND?

   To quote a doctor on that very subject: "As far as we have been
   able to ascertain it has no effect on the optical organs
   whatsoever. Out of the vast number of subjects so far studied
   only one has developed optical deficiency. Could you pass
   me my glasses?" *1

   HOW DO I AVOID BECOMING A WARP
   JUNKIE?

   In the early days we lost a few of our better operatives because
   they warped too far. Micky Blowtorch for example. A brilliant
   man with a brilliant mind, but he just took his warping too
   far. In the end we lost him. He gave up on life and went to
   lie in a forest.

   It has been said that "Warping fever takes over the mind and
   makes you want to warp further away from your starting
   point." *2 This can lead to certain problems. For example, the
   operative forgets his starting point or worse still, prefers the
   place warped to and stays there.

   Here at Mission HQ, our group of resident psychologists have
   worked on this problem for quite some time and the results of
   their research has culminated in what is now known as
   Voluntary Vacation Mode, or "VVM" for short. This is a short
   period of intense vacation using limited warping techniques so
   that operatives can relax.

   VMM is explained in greater detail later in this document.

                                 1.6

==========================================================================


   WHERE IS MY NEXT MEAL COMING FROM?

   While in HPM, the parasite - that's you - can survive on
   nourishment absorbed by the host. This unique and somewhat
   novel form of feeding means that we here at Mission HQ don't
   incur feeding costs for any of our operatives.

   To paraphase: You and your host can look after yourselves
   while the crew here at Mission HQ pop down the pub for a pie
   and a pint.

   WHAT LIFE INSURANCE COVER CAN I GET?

   Being an inter-dimensional espionage operative is a
   commitment for life. You must stand up for all that is decent,
   honest, good and, or course, true. This means that "when the
   going gets hard then the going gets tough." *1 You are in
   command

   You will meet with dangers and, perhaps, beat ep strangers.
   And that's just on a good day. You will have to think fast on
   your feet, nay, on someone else's feet. You will, on many
   occasions, laugh with Death staring you in the face.
   Sometimes with Death so close that you have to turn your
   head away. In fact, sometimes you'll meet Death, go for a
   coffee, perhaps hit a few bars, grab a late night curry, that sort
   of thing. You know the scenario.

   Ands you want life insurance? Get away! There isn't a company
   outside of Mission HQ that would touch you with a barge
   pole. It's like committing yourself to a life of perpetual stunt
   work. "Playing with the special effects of life." *2 is how one
   operative described it.

                                 1.7

==========================================================================


   IS THERE A DOCTOR TO HAND?

   The medical facilities here at Mission HQ are second to none.
   We use the Deep Cold Storage Method, DCSM, to slow down
   the body's metabolism. This gives our medical consultants
   plenty of time for coffee breaks. (Union rules 67/4/98 -
   67/4/102).

   While in warp mode you are given a complete manicure. We
   also ensure that your teeth are given the once over to keep
   them in pristine condition. Remember "Clean teeth and a
   healthy mind stop you catching nasty diseases while you're
   away." *1

   CAN I VISIT THE TOILET NOW?

   Of course you may. It's second on the left just past the nuclear
   induction centre. Just follow your nose.

                  Department of Inter Dimensional Espionage

                             HOST PARASITE MODE

   In HPM, Host-Parasite Mode, you take over the body of a
   creature from the dimension you've warped to. Be careful out
   there, the last thing you want to do is go killing anyone. One
   of the more dangerous things that can happen during warp is
   entering HPM when the host is in the middle of a dangerous
   activity.

   The following list contains examples of dangerous activites:

      operating machinery
      driving a vehicle
      sky-diving
      mountain climbing
      hang-gliding
      watching soft-drink commercials
      eating a curry
      visiting the tax inspector
      reproduction of any kind
      feeding a baby or other animal

   One other place where HPM can cause real problems to Inter-
   Dimensional Espionage Operatives is if the Host is
   undergoing psychoanalysis at the time. More than none of our
   operatives have been assigned to mental institutions.

   If the Host is under the influence of certain truth drugs, then
   the operative, as parasite, will speak the truth. Beings who
   believe themselves to be Inter-Dimensional Espionage
   Operatives are not understood in such backwaters where three
   dimensions are considered the norm.


                                 1.9

==========================================================================


   PLEASE NOTE

   Certain drugs used in the treatment of delusion, can also
   prevent exit from HPM. *1

   URGENT WARNING

   Avoid warping anywhere with less than three dimensions. It
   has been found that operatives cannotwork in such simplistic
   conditions.

   In the early experiments where we tried sending operatives to
   the smaller dimensions, they found themselves being used as
   tools of primitive mathematicians experimenting with the so-
   called Drunkyard's Walk Theory. *2


   *1 Refer to "Leaving Warps" elsewhere in this document.

   *2 Stewart I. The Problems of Mathematics.

   refer also to:

      Kac M. Random Walk and the theory of Brownian Motion.
      In 1921 G. Polyo apparently solved this in three dimensions.

               Department of Inter-Dimensional Espionage

                              LEAVING WARPS

   You can exit from a warp in one of several ways.

   The simplest, providing you are not under the influence of
   certsain drugs, *1 is to sleep.

   Another method utilises the Coles Effect. *2 The Coles Effect,
   to summarise, states that under extreme audio-visual
   conditions HPM breaks down completely. You leave the warp
   involuntarily. *3 Examples of such conditions are:

      Lights flashing at certain frequencies.
      Repetitive sounds.
      Extremely bright lights.
      Loud and heavy bangs.

   SPECIAL NOTE

   Warps are nested

   This means that it is possible to enter a warp from within a
   awrp. When you leave the second warp you will be returned to
   the previous warp. This can be the cause of certain problems.
   Those operatives who are in Voluntary Vacation Mode (VVM)
   can find that under certain extreme occasions VVM can be
   suspended allowing the operative to carry out an important
   operation.

==========================================================================


   O.K. you wise guys, some of you may think it possible to
   leave the Primary dimension (here) by warping backwards out
   of it.

   We've tried many times. It can't be done. Anyway, there are far
   more important things to do.

   PRACTICAL USES OF THIS KNOWLEDGE

   This information can be used in two ways:

   1  You never know, the going can get difficult. And
      when the going gets hard you may have to leave a
      warp quickly. To paraphase: "That was close." *1

   2  These techniques can be applied to members of the
      Seven Deadly Fins to expel them from a particular
      dimension.

   VOLUNTARY VACATION MODE

   After a certain number of successful missions each operative is
   put into Voluntaey Vacation Mode (VVM). Thw word
   voluntary is, perhaps, misleading since the vacation is pre-
   calculated by the psychology staff here at Mission HQ.

   VVM uses specially created warps. These warps are guaranteed
   to provide complete relaxation to our operatives.

   Remember, as one of our operatives you have a choice from
   our comprehensive brochure, provided you have "clocked up"
   the correct number of Anti-Stress Points or ASPs.

   ASPS may be calculated using the following equation:


             "PS: This little bit in quotes is here by WYATT EARP.
              It would be impossible to put that equation on here.
              Ignore these three lines when entering a password"


   Where P = the number of Anti-Stress Points and n = the
   number of missions completed since last VVM.

   [The more astute mathematical minds amongst you may have
   observed that the equation can be simplified. The co-efficients
   of the transcendental number "e" can be reduced yielding simply
   "e" on the top line of the equation.

   The reasons for not doing so are twofold:-

   1)    We at Mission HQ hope to confuse the enemy with
         this dastardly ploy.


                                 1.13

==========================================================================


   2)    It encourages the reverse application of Stirling's
         approximation which would yield an even more
         complicated and confusing equation.]

   Here is a small selection from the current collection of VVM's
   available to our operatives:

   3 pts:

         Gardener
         Ticket Clerk
         Car Park Attendant

   9 pts:

         Weljelar of Nan.
         Television Repair Person
         Occupational Therapist

   25 pts:

         A King of one of the lesser kingdoms of Swatt
         A programmer for Magnetic Scrolls Ltd.
         A piano player in one of the brothels at Hans. (There
         is a small chance of being shot).

   50 pts:

         A gaseous being of Pnying.
         A thermal printer.
         A weighted book.

   100 pts plud:

         A goldfish - the ultimate award for long service.

                                  - AN EXTRACT

   To give you some idea about looking after your host here is a
   short extract from the book "Warping Along With Blowtorch" *1
   in which Micky, ace inter-dimensional expionage operative,
   explains some of the finer points of warping.

   So there I was, in the thick of it. Things were tough. I was in
   a small cell, having been captured by the Fins. I decided to
   take a look:

   > LOOK
   Cell
   This is a small grey cell. The walls give
   off a faint flow, sufficient to see that
   you aren't in a dungeon and there is no
   phosphorescent moss. Some things are
   lurking in the corner of the room.

   Obviously a cell in which you could safely stash an inter-
   dimensional espionage operative. I knew I would have got the
   same description by entering "L", a recognized abbrebiation for
   look. Things were looking bad. I tried the following:

   > EXAMINE THINGS
   Things are looking bad.
   > SEARCH THINGS
   You find nothing of interest.

   Random Publishing, Plin City.


                                 2.1

==========================================================================


   But I might have. That's the point. Searching things could be
   very important. If an exit looks blocked, that might be the
   way togo. Of course, I could have tried any of the following:
   north, northeast, northwest, south, southeast, southwest, east,
   west, up or down. I could, if I wanted to, cut down the typing
   by using the abbreviations for these directions: N, NE, NW,
   S, SE, SW, E, W, U or D. But in this case, as there
   were no exist, I knew I would have got the response:

   > NORTH
   There is a wall in your way.

   I could have also specified a special way of going in a direction
   such as QUIETLY GO NORTH or CAREFULLY GO SOUTH
   or even WALK DOWN or SWIM NORTH.

   If I had wanted to find out if there were any exits I could have
   used the word EXIST and discovered the way out. However, as
   I knew I was surrounded by walls there was nothing I could do
   except wait it out:

   > WAIT
   Time passes.

   I tried again, using the abbreviation.

   > Z
   Time passes.
   "Hello? Blowtorch? Mickey?" It was Panchax,
   he usually gets through in the end. "Stand
   by we're going to open up a warp in your
   area." There is a loud bang and a small
   warp appears in the wall before you.

   I thought I would check out the warp, make sure that it wasn't
   a cunning trap put there by The Fins. They are capable of
   anything you know.


                                 2.2

==========================================================================


   > LOOK AT THE WARP
   The small warp is attached to the wall in
   an alarming way. It appears to lead out of
   here.

   This is more like it. An escape provided by those nice people
   at Mission HQ. It's time to get out of here and zap to pastures
   new. Just as well because before I had the opportunity to do
   anything the Fins appeared.

   "You're not going to get away from us that
   quickly, Blowtorch." It's Drake Tracker,
   the one known as "Chainsaw" to his friends
   and worse to his enemies. He doesn't look
   friendly but appears to be about to enjoy
   himself.

   I had several ways of getting out of this place. I could ENTER
   THE WARP, ENTER THE SMALL WARP, or even GO
   THROUGH THE WARP. I took the short cut:

   > GO WARP
   You enter the warp and your mind is
   wrenched from your body. There is a
   scream, probably yours. There is a sucking
   sound and it seems you have taken the body
   of a small stick insect. You have escaped
   the clutches of Drake Tracker.

   That was close. If you've never travelled through a warp it's a
   real experience. Come to think of it if you have travelled
   through a warp it's still a real experience. How could I describe
   it. I know. It's just like being in a car crash except you're the
   car. All of them. Now if that isn't a quotable quote, nothing
   is. Still, where was I?


                                 2.3

==========================================================================


   On a Twig
   You are in a tree a long way above the
   ground and it's a good job you aren't too
   heavy. This twig doesn't look strong
   enough to support much weight. A succulent
   green leaf lies close by while above you
   is a dead leaf. You can climb down the
   twig from here.

   There you have it, a case of out of the fireplace and into the
   briar. But warping is like that, these things happen when you
   start playing with the special effects of life. Still, what was I
   to do now? I felt a little peckish so I tried:

   > EAT LEAF
   Which one? The green leaf of the dead
   leaf?
   > THE GREEN LEAF
   Yummy! That was delicious.

   So it looks like I've staved off my hunger. However, now
   there was only one leaf, the dead one, so I could type:

   > EAT LEAF
   Bleahh. The dead leaf tastest aweful but you
   eat it all up.

   I could have used, with hindsight, a sentence such as EAT
   ALL THE LEAVES EXCEPT THE BROWN LEAF if I
   hadwanted to, but in this case it would have involved more
   work.

   > EXAMINE THE TREE
   The oak tree is big and sturdy. Beneath it
   you spy an old tree stump.

   This looked interesting. So I tried the following:


                                 2.4

==========================================================================


   > EXAMINE THE TREE STUMP UNDER THE TREE
   The tree stump is dead and dangerous.

   Oh well, that wasn't going to get me anywhere. I might as
   well get out of here.

   > CLIMB DOWN
   Tree Truck
   This is the trunk of an old oak tree. A
   mature and somewhat incongruous habitat
   for a stick insect at the best of times.
   You notice a glowing hole in the side of
   the oak.
   > ENTER THE GLOWING HOLD
   You enter the glowing hole and the body of
   the stick insect falls away. There is an
   extreme amount of pain but just before it
   starts to become fun, the pain goes away.
   You come to in the body of a man.
   Your Office
   Compared to yourold office this isn't
   much of an improvement. You wonder whether
   it was worth accepting the partnership
   when you still have the same chair, the
   same filing cabinet, the same desk and
   still no phone.
   > SIT DOWN
   You are now sitting on the chair.
   > STAND UP
   You are now on your feet.
   > STAND ON THE CHAIR
   You are now standing on the chair.

   This was interesting. But it wasn't getting me anywhere. I had
   to get out of the room. So I tried:

   > OUT
   You get off the chair first.


                                 2.5

==========================================================================


   White Passage
   With chipped white paint on the walls and
   rising damp, this passage is in a very bad
   way. It has a small door at its northwest
   end a white one to the southwest.
   > CLOSE DOOR
   The white door is now closed.
   > OPEN SMALL DOOR
   The small door is now open.
   > IN
   SHOP
   This shop is very unusual in that not much
   is for sale. An eager assistant is
   beavering away behind the counter but he
   doesn't appear to be achieving very much.
   There is a small statuette in the corner.

   Now this was much more exciting. A place I could relate to. A
   place where I could spend some money. If I had any. It was
   time to find out what I had. To do this I used the Inventory
   command. I decided to use the abbreviation:

   > I
   You are carrying a credit card and pair of
   pliers.
   You are wearing a black jump-suit and a tie.

   The credit card would do. The statuette could be mine. But first
   I would take off my tie.

   > REMOVE TIE
   You take off the tie.

   That's better, I can carry out a business transaction now.

   > LOOK AT THE SMALL STATUETTE
   The statuette looks most unusual. It's as
   wide as it is long and as short as it is


                                 2.6

==========================================================================


   narrow. It seems to invoke that certain
   something which brings out the shallowest
   reviews from art critics.

   That's all I could see. Perhaps the assistant knew more.

   > ASK ASSISTANT ABOUT STATUETTE
   The assistant stops what he is going and
   says: "Doesn't it bring out the essential
   you, sir? Doesn't it say 'buy me, buy me'?
   And I suppose sir would like the price? A
   mere snip at 1001 clams.

   An offer I couldn't refuse. I though it was such good value I
   just had to buy it. Good job I had my credit card, I don't like to
   carry a lot of clams around in cash.

   > BUY STATUETTE WITH CREDIT CARD
   The assistant examines your credit card
   and looks at you in a stuffy way. "What,
   MASTERCARP?" he exclaims. "I'm sorry, sir,
   we only take FISA. Perhaps sir would like
   to go through the archway and ask Mr.
   Prendergast, next door!"

   I could try and walk off with it. But I would have to try
   something tricky. How about:

   > TIE THE TIE TO THE STATUETTE
   The tie is now tied to the statuette.
   "What do you think you're doing?" shouts
   the assistant untying your tie from the
   statuette and returning it to you. "Go on,
   get out of my shop. Now!"

   There was only one thing for it.


                                 2.7

==========================================================================


   > GO ARCHYWAY
   Prendergast's Room
   A mess of wires and papers fills this
   room. Right in the centre is a large
   table. So old and decrepit it's amazing
   that it is still standing. On the table is
   a small statuette and a jar of pickles.
   Mr Prenergast is sitting by the table
   wearing a dressing gown and smoking a
   pipe.

   I though I would try something random first. Then it dawned
   on me:

   > HOLD THE CREDIT CARD WITH THE PLIERS OVER
   THE JAR OF PICKLES.
   "You seem a man of many skills" says Mr.
   Prendergast. "Here, have this." Mr.
   Prendergast hands you his business card.

   Interesting, I admit, but slightly odd. I decided to read the
   business card.

   > READ IT
   The business card reads: PRENDERGAST. Man
   of many skills.

   This wasn't getting me anywhere and I wanted Prendergast's
   statuette.

   Good job I had a cunning plan to get it. I would invite
   Prendergast to the cinema and while he went upstairs to change
   into his outdoor clothes I would be able to nick the statuette.

   There are several ways of inviting people to places. For
   example: PRENDERGAST, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
   TO THE CINEMA? or ASK PRENDERGAST TO THE
   CINEMA. I chose the more complex but much nicer looking:


                                 2.8

==========================================================================


   > SAY TO PRENDERGAST "DO YOU WANT TO GO TO
   THE CINEMA?"
   Mr Prendergast says "That sounds like a
   good idea, I haven't seen a move for
   several years. The last time I went to the
   cinema I saw Close Encounters of the Fish
   Kind. Greatr fun that was. All flashing
   lights and loud noises." Prendergast
   suddenly shouts "Bang!" and switches the
   lights on and off rapidly. It's a shame he
   did that as the flashing lights and the
   bang happen at just the right frequency to
   break the host-parasite interface. You are
   suddenly sucked through the swirling
   dimensions.

   It was too late. This was to be one mission where I just
   couldn't get anything done. It was useless to try any of the
   housekeeping commands such as PN, which would have listed
   the current PRONOUNS or SCORE which would have told me
   how badly I was doing.

   The problem was how to explain my situation to Panchax. I
   had warped out. Not the best thing I could habe done under the
   circumstances. But then again, that was my problem, not
   yours.

                Department of Inter-Dimensional Espionage

                             CYPHERIC HINTS

   This section of the dossier is intended for those inter-
   dimensional espionage operatives who become stuck in
   a particular warp. The boys in the back room have come up with
   some solutions to problems.

   Because of the potential dangers to our operatives these hints
   have been carefully encoded so that, should they fall into the
   wrong hands, or for that matter, Fins then very little
   information will be gained from them.

   If you are really stuck then scan through the list of questions
   until you find one which resembles your problem. Then type:

   > HINT

   You will get the response:

   Please enter hint:

   You should now type in the letters between "<" and ">". You
   don't have to type the spaces, and indeed it is better without
   themm. The hint will then be decoded. If you have not typed in
   the correct letters you will get the response:

   Sorry, try that one again.

   A "+" sign after the answer means there's more to come.
   Please enter the next hint.

   The first hint is usually a gentle nudge in the right direction.
   The last hint may be the complete solution to your problem.


                                 3.1

==========================================================================

That's it! No Cypheric Hints for you! Just play the game - the problems the
hints are directed towards are easy to solve anyway.
