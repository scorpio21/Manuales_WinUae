AIM OF THE GAME  
Fred is looking forward to the Bedrock Super Bowl, till Wilma reminds him  
that he has to paint the living room which he promised.  
No painting , no bowling.  
To paint the room you must dip your brush into the paint and paint away.  
To paint the higher parts of the wall you use the ladder. During the process  
of painting the room peebles draws pictures on the wall you have just painted  
you must grab peebles and put her back in her little pen. When Fred puts  
peebles back in the pen you lose control of your elusive paintbrush!  
 
THE NEXT DAY  
Fred and Barney set off for the Bowling Final but run into trouble when they  
lose a wheel on fred's car. You then must quickly find a suitable replacement  
to fit on, so you can get to the Bowling Final on time.  
 
THE BOWLING ALLEY  
Fred and Barney make it in time to the Bedrock Super Bowl and it's Fred with  
histwinkle toes against no-nonsense, butter fingers Barney.  
May the best man win.  
 
THE RESCUE  
Fred and Barney return home to find Wilma very distressed as Peebles has  
escaped from her pen and disappeared.  
Fred eventually finds her perched high up on a stone girder, above the new  
building site, totally unaware of the dangers around her.  
It's Fred Flinstone to the rescue but with such a bewildering array of girders  
and ladders, will he be able to get to her in time?
