ABOUT THIS MANUAL

This manual was written to be used with the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, and
MS-DOS compatible versions of FEDERATION.  To avoid listing three separate
keys for each command, we have simply labelled each key and referred to it
by its label in the text.  For example, when describing the Navigation
System, we refer to the Lock Course key, which in the 5 key (numeric
keypad) on the Atari and the RETURN key on the Amiga and the IBM
compatibles.

Loading instructions, the list of keys, and other machine specific
instructions are in the center of this manual, beginning page 5.

We hope you enjoy FEDERATION.

                                THE STORY

History of the Federation

In the early 21st century, Earth was dying.

	Pollution had devastated the environment.  Energy-hungry
industrialized nations had drained the world's oil reserves dry. 
Unemployment and poverty were rampant.  Crime turned cities into battle
zones.  The "greenhouse" effect turned farms into arid wasteland and
created widespread famine.

	Most of the problems could be traced to one inescapable conclusion:
there were more pople on the planet than the ecosystem could support.  When
fusion power research inadvertantly created the faster-than-light Lambert
Drive, several nations seized on the idea of financing one-way trips to the
stars to solve the crisis.  Vast numbers of colonists fled the planet to
build a new life.

	At first, the colonies were heavily dependent on Earth.  Each
colony relied on the home planet for virtually all of the goods necessary
to survive until they could create industries of their own.  Just as in
Europe's Age of Colonization, a healthy trade developed: raw materials
fromthe colonies were sent to Earth, processed goods were shipped back.

	Unfortunately, something else from the past appeared as well -
piracy.  The first space freighters were unarmed; there simply weren't that
many ships, and no one had thought armaments necessary.  Then, as more and
more ships plied the space lanes, someone mounted a mining laser to the
front of a small scout, and the star pirate was born.

	The nations that started colonies now has new problems.  The space
navies needed to protect their interstellar trade would have a huge
territory to patrol.  The expense of maintaining such large fleets would
soon become too much for already strained economies.  One by one, the
declared themselves out of the space business.  The colonies, granted
independence by governments unable to maintain them, had to find their own
way.

	For the colonies, this was a death sentence.  Their only hope was
to find some way to rebuild the trade.  Private pilots began to make the
voyage to Earth, to fill the gap.  These Free Traders helped the colonies
to survive, and enough cargo made it through for them to prosper.  Several
Traders grew wealthy, enough to hire other pilots to take the risks.  The
most successful, and daring, of the Traders was Simon MacPherson.

	MacPherson flew his heavily armored ship to Barbary, the planetary
base of the most notorious of the pirates, Lawrence Barnett, to make a
deal.  Barnett, better known as the Laser Bandit, agreed to fly protection
for MacPherson's convoys.  As word spred of the deal, independent pilots
began to contact the Bandit for similar service.  Most armed escorts were
hired, and Barnett was able to form the FEDERATION OF FREE TRADERS.

The Federation Today

The Federation has evolved from a small group of freighter escorts to an
extensive (though loosely bound) interstellar police force, performing a
wide range of activities to make space travel safer.  Individual pilots
have a great deal of independence.  Although any pilot over the rank of
Cadet may

				1

choose to wear the Federation crest, there is no uniform, and only cadets
are required to carry an ID card.  The chain that links the Federation,
however, is GALNET.  Pilots get orders, file reports, receive promotions,
and are even paid through this central communications web.

	For all the Federation's informality, there is a rigidly enforced
rank structure.  The Missions Office gives assignments solely on this
basis: high-paying (read: more dangerous) missions go to high-ranked
pilots; cadets get whatever is left.  Promotions are given on the basis of
number and difficulty of missions completed and number of hostile ships
destroyed.  The Promotion Board will send you a notice via GalNet when you
have earned a promotion.

	The Federation's ranks are:

		Cadet		Chief
		Initiate	Commander
		Rookie		Wing Commander
		Pilot		Admiral

	There is only one active Admiral at any given time; he is the
ultimate head of the Federation.  Currently, the Laser Bandit is Admiral,
although rumor has it that he is grooming a replacement.

Your Background

In the years since the Federation was formed, space has grown only slightly
less dangerous.  When you were very young, your father, a Free Trader, was
killed when a computer "accident" caused the destruction of the space
station where he was based.  Pirates were believed to be responsible,
although Federation investigators could not prove it.  All that you have
left to remember him by is an old but still functional Hartley Mark I.

	The Hartley Mk I was one of the earliest starships widely available
for use as a small trading vessel.  Although quite old, it is a very
reliable and common ship.  It is equipped with a Class 3 Ion Drive, which
is capable of .05C (15,200 km/s) in real space and a 78 light year jump in
Hyperspace, although limited fuel capacity (50 metric tons) prevents a jump
of larger than 50 light years.

	The ship is armed with standard forward-firing 1 MegaWatt Lasers
and two Lima Missiles, with another pair of hard points for mounting a
tertiary weapon system.  The shileds are Class 1 - minimally effective. 
One emergency escape pod is attached.

	The ship's computer is a Fedcomp Series 472 "EDI", considered
state-of-the-art at the time it was build, and is completely adequate for
your needs. Its main function is communications; it also maintains a small
ship recognition library.  Additional computers are used for navigation and
damage control.

	Finally, the ship has an ample 100 ton cargo capacity, which is
fairly large among single-man vessels.

	In FEDERATION, you have no set objective to achieve.  You possess
the means to attain any goal you wish to pursue, from amassing a trader's
fortune to becoming Admiral of the Federation.  The decision is yours.

FLYING THE SHIP

Controls

The Hartley Mk I is equipped with attitudinal thrusters under each wing and
on the top and bottom of the ship's nose.  These thrusters are controlled
by the joystick, and operate in the following manner:

              /\                                      /\
   \|/   /\  /  \  /\                            /\  /  \  /\   \|/
  __||__/  \/    \/  \__||__              __||__/  \/    \/  \__||__

         a. Joystick left                       b. Joystick right

    ________________________               _______________________
\|//                        |             /                       |
  /_________________________|            /________________________|
                                        /|\
         c. Joystick up                      d. Joystick down

Push the joystick left to activate the left wing thruster; the ship rotates
counter-clockwise.  Push right for the right wing thruster; the ship
rotates clockwise.  Push up for the top nose thruster; the ship rotates
forward (dives). Push down for the bottom nose thruster; the ship rotates
back (climbs).

Use the Accelerate and Decelerate keys to alter your speed.  The Time Skip
key can be used to reduce your travel time at sublight speeds.  Time Skip
is not available when hostile forces are present, or while docking.  The
distance you travel during a Time Skip is, of cours, relative to your speed
when it is used.

Radar

The radar screen at the bottom center of your control panel is the most
important piced of equipment you use to fly the ship.  It shows a
three-dimensional view of the space around you.  Your location is the white
dot in the center of the display.

The "V" represents the area directly in front of your ship.  Objects on the
radar screen appear as a glowing dot with a colored "stalk" attached.  if
the glowing dot is at the top of the stalk, the object is above you' if it
is at the bottom, the object is below.  The stalk's length indicates how
much the object is above or below you.  Its color indicates the type of
object.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Zoom  001 ----------------Magnification factor

This figure shows a typical radar display.  Your loaction is the center of
the display, at the bottom of the V.  Ship 1 is directly in front of you,
and would be visible if he were in range.  Ship 2 if off to your right and
above you.  Ship 3 is directly to your left, and a long way below you.  The
space station is almost directly behind you.  "Zoom 001" shows the largest
area of any magnification factor.

If you want to intercept an object (for example, to dock with a space
station), rotate your ship left or right to move its stalk into the V, then
rotate up or down until it is flat (just a dot.)  The ship will then be
directly in front of you.  If the object disappears from your radar, use
the Zoom Radar Out key to enlarge the area your radar is scanning.  When
the ship moves into the lowest section of the V, press the Zoom Radar In
key to get a better view of its location relative to you.  There are eight
levels of magnification.

When a hostile ship comes within range of your ship, a siren will sound,
and your status lights will change to Red Alert.  This range is the area of
magnification level 5.

Weapons and Combat

Although piracy has been on the decline since the organization of the
Federation, it is still a serious problem throughout the universe. 
Fortunately, your ship is equipped to deal with this threat.

WEAPON SYSTEMS

Your ship can carry up to three weapon systems, designated as Primary,
Secondary and Tertiary.  The primary weapon is built into the body of the
ship, and cannot be changed, although it may be upgraded.  Thus, you may
not replace your lasers with, for example, plasma guns, but you may upgrade
it to a 5 megawatt system.

Secondary and tertiary systems are built onto hard points on the hull of
the ship, and can be changed or added at will.  Your ship starts with a
Lima missile launcher as the secondary system; the hard points for the
tertiary system have not been used.  The only restriction to adding or
replacing weaponry is that you are not allowed two systems of the same
type.  Thus, you could not add a second laser system, or attach two fusion
guns.

* Numbers in body of table represent damage caused by weapon relative to
the 1 megawatt laser.  For example, a 3 giga-erg plasma projector will
cause 24 times as much damage as the 1 megawatt laser.

Lasers - Lasers fire continuous beams of amplified light at targets.  When
activated, a gauge in the lower right corner of the screen shows the charge
remaining in the laser's storage capacitors.  Each tap of the joystick
button drains 4% from the capacitors.  Holding the button down drains them
rapidly, but energy is continually diverted from the engines to recharge
them.  More powerful lasers recharge faster and do more damage with each
blast.

Missiles - Missiles are purchased in pairs, and each comes with its own
non-reusable launcher.  Missiles can only be fired when the pilot has
achieved missile-lock.  When the missile is locked onto a target and fired,
it will home in on the target using an onboard radar system.  If it misses
on the first pass, it will continue to return to the target until it hits,
or runs out of fuel.  Once a missile is used, it must be replaced.  More
expensive missiles do greater damage and are more resistant to the
Electronic Counter-Measures (ECM) systems built into every ship.  ECM, or
"jamming" is used to confuse the homing signal of the missile.

Plasma Projectors and Fusion Guns - These energy weapons fire gas that is
ionized and energized; plasma projectors fire in pulses and fusion guns
fire a cloud of the gas.  In fusion guns, the gas actually proceeds to
fusion.  Fusion guns cause more damage than plasma projectors, but are very
difficult to aim and use.  Like lasers, both have storage capacitors which
bleed power from the engines.  Each plasma pulse drains the capacitors by
20%.  Fusion guns require a full charge to be fired.

Gauss Guns - Gauss guns use magnetic force to accelerate small pieces of
metal to a high velocity and fire it at enemy targets.  Once the Gauss gun
is installed, metallic scrap, sold in 1 metric ton blocks, must be
purchased as ammunition.  Each tap of the button fires 10 kg of metal; thus
a ton of scrap is 100 shots.  More powerful Gauss guns accelerate the metal
to higher speeds and cause more damage.

Sand Dispensers - Sand dispensers are a defensive system.  They release a
cloud of abrasive particles into the path of enemy targets, reducing the
effectiveness of lasers, fusion guns, and plasma projectors, disrupting
missile fire and drones and interfering with the flight of enemy ships. 
Once the dispenser is purchased, sand canisters must be purchased as
ammunition; each holds 100 cubic meters of sand.

Drones - Drones are an advanced type of missile.  Instead of relying solely
on radar signals to home in on targets, drone are equipped with several
detection systems and an onboard computer to select and home in on targets.
 To use a drone, just press the joystick button when the system is armed. 
If there are no hostile ships in range, the dron will simply fly along

				9

side your ship, waiting.  When a hostile appears, the dron will
automatically home in on it.  Drones have special safeguards built in to
prevent them from attacking friendly or unidentified ships.

USING YOUR WEAPONS

To activate a weapon, press the Arm Primary Weapon, Arm Secondary Weapon,
or Arm Tertiary Weapon key.  The gunsight on your viewscreen will change to
reflect the active system.  The weapon status will show the code for the
type of weapon that is active, and a three digit status of the weapon.  All
weapons are fired with the joystick button.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE ESCAPE POD

Your ship is also equipped with an escape pod.  Activate the pod with the
Arm Pod key.  when your ship is about to be destroyed, eject by pressing
the Abandon Ship key.  The ship will self-destruct when you are at a safe
distance, and the pod will take you to the nearest space station, where you
will receive an identically equipped ship.  Any cargo you were carrying is
lost.

DOCKING AT SPACE STATIONS

Each system has a Federation-maintained space station, which carries a full
stock of supplies for starships and interstellar travellers, as well as
extensive trading facilities.  However, because of the piracy problem, all
stations are built with anti-detection equipment.  Ships must make an
approach to the system's inhabited planet before the station will be
revealed.

To find the main planet, look for the direction indicator in the lower left
corner of the viewscreen.  This is a white cross-hair with one or two
arrows on it.  If it is not on the screen, rotate the ship up or down with
your joystick until it appears.  When you see it, rotate the ship left or
right until there is only one arrow, either up or down, the rotate the ship
up or down until the indicator changes to a glowing diamond.  You are now
on course to the planet.

If the planet appears as a very small circle on screen, you can reach it
most rapidly by accelerating your shipt to its top speed, then using the
navigation computer (see page 15) to lock on a course for the system you
are in, and making a short hop through Hyperspace.  You use no fuel in this
way, and you will jump across the system quickly.  When the planet is close
enough that you can see the terminator separating the light and dark side
(the planet will appear to have two colors), use the Time Skip key instead
of Hyperspace to move even closer.  Soon the planet will be too large to
fit completely on your viewscreen.  When this happens, reduce your speed to
20, and continue to Time Skip until you see the following message:

		GO TO STATION FOR IMMIGRATION CONTROL

				10

The station should now be visible on your radar screen; it has a white
stalk that is three lines wide.  If it's not visible, use the Zoom Radar
Out key until you do see it.  Center it in the V by rotating the ship left
or right, then rotate up or down until the stalk is flat.  Accelerate to
top speed to get to it as quickly as possible.  When you can see it on your
viewscreen, press the Dock key to turn on the docking computer.  To bypass
the docking sequence, press the Dock Instantly key.

LANDING ON PLANETS

You may want to land on a planet to get better prices in trading, or to
fulfill a mission.

You must dock with a space station before you can land on a planet.  Space
stations function as Customs and Immigration Control for the planets they
orbit, and you will not receive clearance to land until you dock.

Once you have docked and completed any business you may have on the
station, you may leave the station by pressing the Launch key.  The
station's massive Docking Bay doors will open and Station Control will
launch you with a speed of 20.  Use the direction indicator to set course
for the planet just as before, and Time Skip to make your approach.  Be
certain you are on course before each press of the Time Skip key!  If you
are off course when you enter the planet's atmosphere, you will burn up on
re-entry!  When you enter the atmosphere, the screen will turn red with
heat.

If your re-entry is successful, the viewscreen will show a projection of
your ship flying through the atmosphere.

1. Roll indicator: Shows how much the ship is turning.

2. Pitch meter: Shows angle of climb or descent.  The line in the center of
   the screen is flat level.  If the indicator is above the line, the ship
   is climbing; if the indicator is below the line, the ship is descending.

3. Altitude indicator: Shows how far the ship is above ground level.

4. Ship

5. Gunsight: Aims lasers.

6. Direction indicator: See Docking at Space Stations.

7. Range: Shows distance to the runway.

				11

Use the direction indicator to guide you to the runway.

Some planets have laser installations on the ground that may try to shoot
at your.  You may avoid their fire by flying very high until you get to the
runway, but the final descent will have to be very steep; you run a good
risk of not being able to pull up in time to avoid making a crater.  If you
fly low, the laswers may be able to destroy you.  You can use your lasers
to knock them out of commission, but be sure to pull up before you crash
into the ground.

As you close in on the runway, start nosing your ship down until you are
flying just above the surface.  Watch out for mountains.  When you reach
the runway, you must touch down in a very shallow dive.  If your descent is
too sharp, you will plow into the ground.  When you touch down correctly,
Ground Control will complete the landing automatically.  If you miss the
runway, pull up to climb out of the atmosphere and try again.

When you have finished your business on the surface, use the Launch key to
leave the planet base.  Ground Control will launch you into the air.  Pull
up sharply on the joystick to climb through the atmosphere and into space.

THE SHIP'S COMPUTER

Your ship's computer is the most important tool you have.  Through it, you
can communicate to the rest of the Universe, trade on the open market,
re-equip your ship, and study your potential adversaries.  To use the
ship's computer, press the Activate Ship's Computer key.

E - ENTER TRADING LEVEL

Type E to enter the trading level.  Here you may buy and sell on the
commodities market, or purchase supplies or equipment for your ship.  The
trading level is only available at space stations or planetary bases.

				12

Commodities Trading - Remember, you are a member of the Federation of Free
Traders.  As a member of the Federation, you are entitled to full access to
the GalNet Commodities Exchange.  A wide range of goods is available for
you to buy and sell, as you attempt to make a profit.

The trading level is completely menu driven, and operates at three levels. 
The top level lets you choose from six broad categories of products:
Metals/Rare Earths, Arms, Agricultural Products, Manufactured Goods,
Drugs/Medicines, or Luxury Goods.  (You may also choose Equip Starship: see
Fitting Your Ship, below).  Simply press the number of the category you
wish to select or Q to leave the trading level.

The next level shows the goods available in the selected category, and
their current prices.  These prices fluctuate as the quantities available
rise and fall.  Remember the Law of Supply and Demand: as more goods become
available, the price drops; but when the product becomes scarce, the price
rises.  Press the number of the specific product you want to buy or sell. 
Press Q to go back to the top menu.

The lowest level displays the current trading price, the amount of cargo
space aboard your ship, your bank balance, the amount of theproduct in
stock, and the amount you have in your cargo hold.  Any transactions you
choose to make are carried out by representatives of the Office of
Interstellar Trade, who charge a 1% handing fee for moving the cargo to and
from your hold.

Press B to buy and S to sell.  The game then asks the amount you wish to
buy or sell.  The money is automatically deducted or credited to your
account.  If you don't have enough money to make the purchase, or if there
is not enough stock for you to buy or sell, an error message appears. 
Press Q to go back to the previous menu.

Fitting Your Ship - You may upgrade your ship in several ways: adding new
and better weapons, replacing the engines with a more powerful drive
system, beefing up your shields, or attaching extra fuel pods or repair
droids.  Press 7 at the top trading level menu to enter GalNet Central
Stores.

Press 1 to see the weaponry available, 2 for engines and shields, and 3 for
miscellaneous equipment.  The Weaponry and Engineering sub-,menus let you
choose a type of weapon or drive, or shields, then select the specific
system.  When you add or change a weapon, you are asked if you wish to
replace the Secondary or Tertiary system (see Weapon Systems, page 4).

When you replace an existing system on your ship, the shipyard gives you a
trade-in credit for your old system.  This credit is about 60% of the price
of the system, after depreciation, labor, handling charges and taxes are
deducted.

T - TRANSMIT MESSAGE

Press T to make a direct communications link ("phone call") to another
GalNet user.  The following prompt will appear:

		Enter user to transmit to

Contacting the Federation - When you see the prompt, type FOFT to contact
the Federation.  If you have not received a mission, the Federation selects
one for you.  If you have a mission in progress, and have not yet reached
your destination system, you are reminded of your active mission.  After
you have reached your destination system and have successfully completed
your mission, report to the Federation to receive payment.

Note: You may only contact the Federation when you are docked at a space
station, or when you have landed on a planet.

Contacting Other Ships - Not all trade is conducted in the Trading level. 
When you encounter another ship in space, press the Communications Mode
key.  Center the ship in the cursor to learn their GalNet code (the code
appears on the left side of the screen and EDI keeps trackof it).  Use the
ship's computer to log into GalNet, then press T.  At the prompt, press
<return> and EDI fills in the number for you.  If the alien does not wish
to speak to you, this message appears:

		Connection Refused.

Otherwise, when you see:

		Direct Connection Made

start the conversation by tying in a message then pressing <return>.

Start with small talk, then try to turn the conversation to trade.  Perhaps
he has something he wants to sell.  You may have picked up something from
another trader that you'd like to sell.  Once you find something to trade,
haggle over the price to get the best deal.  Remember two things: 1) There
are as many con artists in the Universe as honest traders, and 2) Items
traded between ships in this manner are contraband and cannot be sold on
the Trading level.

When you decide to end the conversation, type LOGOFF.

P - PRINT MESSAGE

Type P to view any mail sent to your account.

R - READ BULLETIN BOARD

Press R to view any messages posted to GalNet's "Bulletin Board."

I - SHOW INVENTORY

Press I to see your ship's manifest.  The first page shows information
regarding the configuration of your ship (fuel, tankage, shields, weaponry,
and engines), your current rank, points, and bank balance.  The following
pages report the amounts of various commodities stored in your cargo bay.

Q - QUIT

Press Q to disconnect from GALNET.  The time you were connected is
displayed, and you return to EDI's main level.

SHIPS - THE SHIP RECOGNITION LIBRARY

EDI maintains a database with simulations of all known ships.  Type SHIPS
at EDI's main level to view these.

				14

QUIT - Leaving EDI

When you have finished with EDI, return to the main level and type QUIT.

THE NAVIGATION COMPUTER

The Navigation Computer is used to set courses for Hyperspace Travel.  You
may travel to any owrld in the current galaxy, or to a neighboring galaxy,
provided you have the jump capability and the fuel.  You may also examine
the characteristics of inhabited worlds in your galaxy with the Library,
and you may perform a Short Range Scan of the planets in your current
location.  To enter the navigation computer, press the Activate Navigation
Computer key.  Press the Exit Navigation key to leave.

Setting Courses

When you activate the Navigation Computer, a view of your current galaxy
appears.  The red cross-hair indicates your current location; a white
cross-hair indicates your current destination.  If you have received a
mission from the Federation, you may press the Mission Destination key to
move the white cross-hair to your destination.

When the galactic view appears, some stars may overlap others.  To see
these, you may rotate the galaxy in three dimensions using the joystick. 
You may also zoom in and out using the Zoom In and Zoom Out keys.

To lock in a course, press the Lock Course key.  You should see a message
indicated that the course has been locked in.  If nothing happens, the star
is either farther than your fuel supply will stretch or outside your
engine's range.  You may have to make several small jumps to reach your
destination.

If you wish to jump to a new galaxy, lock in a course to any star, then
press the Galactic Jump key.  You must have a drive capable of a 100
light-year jump to generate enough energy for a Galactic jump.

Once you lock in a course, leave the Navigation Computer by pressing the
Exit Navigation key, then press the Hyperspace key to fly to your
destination.

Navigation Library

Your Navigaton Computer maintains an extensive library of data regarding
the inhabited planets of the universe.  To access this data, select a
planet with the white cross-hair, then press the Navigation Library key
when you are at the Navigation Computer's main level.

The right half of the scrren will show a diagram of orbits and relative
positions of all planets in the system.  The main inhabited world in the
system will be indicated by a flashing ring.  The left half of the screen
shows several statistics about this planet.

Press the Exit Library key to return to the main navigation level.

PLANETARY STATISTICS

These statistics include: the quality of the planet's starport, the
diameter of the planet (in 1000's of miles), its atmosphere, and the
percentage of its surface covered by water.  Four other statistics require
more explanation.

				15

Population - This is not the exact population, but a representation of the
magnitude of the population.  For example, Earth (1990 population:
approximately 5.5 billion) might be listed as having a population of
1,000,000,000 - indicating that the population is measurable in the
billions.  If the population of the United States (1990 pop.: approx. 240
million) packed up and moved to Mars, the population would be listed as
100,000,000.

Government Type - Athough every government in the Universe is unique, the
Federation rates them on a scale from 0 to 15.  The scale indicates levels
of government control over the citzenry.  Some examples: Level 0, showing
anarchy, might describe Lebanon.  Earth, 1990 would be level 1, showing no
central government, but a variety of competing regional governments.  The
United States might rate level 3 or 4, most Western European governments
about 5 or 6.  At the other end of the scale, The People's Republic of
China would rate about 12 or 13.

Tech Index - Tech index is a measure of the level of technology the planet
has achieved.  Some examples of these levels: primitive cannons become
available at level 2, airplanes appear at level 5, interstellar travel
indicates level 9, and the fusion gun shows up at level 15.  Level 0 is
very primitive.  Earth, 1990 is about level 8, and the FEDERATION average
is somewhere around 11 or 12.

Law Level - Law level is a rating similar to government type, but refers
solely to private ownership of weaponry.  At level 0, there are no
restrictions.  All firearms are prohibited at about level 7, and all
personal weapons, including knives or daggers, are outlawed at level 10.

Short Range Scan

Press the Short Range Scan key to display a map of the relative positions
of all the planets in the current star system.  Press the Exit Scan key to
return to the main navigation level.

DAMAGE CONTROL

Activate the Damage Control system with the Activate Damage Control key. 
Any damage that your ship suffers can be repaired by allocating repair
droids to the job.  You start with three droids, and you may purchase up to
six more.

Press your joystick button to activate the system selector, then move it up
or down until the damage system is selected.  Move the joystick right to
allocate droids, and left to remove them.  The more droids you allocate,
the faster repairs will be made.

MUSIC/SOUND EFFECTS

FEDERATION includes 20 different songs that you can play as background
music during your space adventures.  You may load or play a song at any
point except when you are in Hyperspace or using one of the computer
systems.  To load a song, press the Load Music key.  A menu appears, with
the > makring the currently selected song.  Use the Scroll Up and Scroll
Down keys to mark a song, the press <return> to load it.  The song plays
automatically when it has loaded.  To play a song over when it has ended,
or to restart the current song, press the Play Music key.  To interrupt
music and activate sound effects, press the Kill Music key.
