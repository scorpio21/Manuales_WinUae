          THE DOX TO FINAL CONFLICT BY (--SCOOTER--)(GENESIS)
          |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||


INTRODUCTION:

YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE HAS JUST BEGUN-DIPLOMATIC ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE POLITICAL
TENSION HAVE FAILED...AND WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED.ALL YOU CAN NOW IS HOPE AND
PRAY FOR A QUICK END AND FEW CASULTIES.YOUR ARMIES AND NAVYS ARE NOW READY..AND
IF IT SHOULD COME TO IT...SO ARE YOUR NUCLEAR MISSILES.

THE FINAL CONFLICT IS A SIMULATION OF POWER POLITICS AND GLOBAL WARFARE,SET IN
THE NEAR FUTURE.

AS PREMIER OF A COUNTRY OF YOUR CHOICE,YOU MUST USE DIPLOMACY,ARMED FORCES,
ESPIONAGE AND DECISION MAKING SKILLS TO TRY AND WIN THE WAR...BEFORE THE WORLD
IS DESTROYED OR YOU HAVE BEEN DEFEATED.

YOU COMMAND ALL MOVEMENT OF TANKS,INFANTRY AND NAVAL UNITS IN A BID TO DEFEAT
YOUR ENEMIES BY CONVENTIONAL MEANS. THE WORD `ENEMIES` IS USED CAREFULLY-AS
TIME PROGRESSES,THE REMAINING COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD TAKE SIDES.SENSELESS
KILLING WILL CAUSE NEUTRAL NATIONS TO TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST YOU,WHILE GOOD
DIPLOMATIC TACTICS COULD WIN YOU ALLIES. THERE IS ALSO THE OPTION SHOULD YOU
FEEL THE NEED TO RESORT TO IT,TO MAKE USE OF NUCLEAR MISSILES. THESE SHOULD BE
USES CAREFULLY,AS NUCLEAR WINTER CAN SET IN.

YOU ALSO NEED TO MANAGE THE RESOURCES OF YOUR COUNTRY,AND THOSE OF YOUR ALLIES.
WAR MAY BE RAGING,BUT YOUR PEOPLE STEEL NEED TO BE FED,AND YOU NEED TO DEPLOY
YOUR RESOURCES INTO MANUFACTURING FACTORIES,ENERGY SUPPLIY,FOOD AND ARMAMENTS.
SHOULD YOU GET THE BALANCE WRONG,YOUR ARMIES COULD FIND THEMSELVES STRANDED AND
HELPLESS,HOWEVER GOOD YOUR MILITARY TACTICS MIGHT BE.  GOOD LUCK!!

HIGHLIGHT AND CLICK MOUSE BUTTON TO SELECT.(IF YOU WISH TO RE-START THE GAME

COUNTRY COLOURS:      YELLOW     -     NEUTRAL
                      GREEN      -     ALLIES
                      RED        -     ENEMIES

THE GAME IS PLAYED FROM A MAP OF THE WORLD.THIS IS DIVIDED INTO 9 REGIONAL
MAPS,WHICH ARE HIGHLIGHTED WHEN YOU MOVE THE POINTER OVER THEM.CLICKING ON THE
WORLD MAP WILL EXPAND IT TO JUST A REGION.ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN
WILL APPEAR A FOUR ARROW ICON.THIS MAY BE USED FOR MOVING TO AN ADJACENT MAP
AND WORLD ICON-WHICH WILL RETURN YOU TO THE MAIN MAP.CLICKING ON A COUNTRY OR
SEA WILL SELECT IT AND THE ICONS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN WILL
CHANGE TO SHOW YOU THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THAT COUNTRY OR SEA.

AS EVENTS HAPPEN IN THE WORLD,YOU ARE INFORMEDOF THEM IN THE MESSAGE WINDOW AT
THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN-A `MESSAGE TONE`ALERTS YOU TO THIS.

AS THE POINTER IS MOVED OVER THE MAPS,THE NAME OF THE COUNTRY IT`S POINTING TO
THE (KNOWN) FORCES IN IT ARE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN. THE THREE LARGE ICONS ON
THE LEFT SHOW THE NUMBER OF INFANTRY,TANK AND MISSILE UNITS IN THAT COUNTRY.
THE TOP NUMBER IN THE TANK AND THE INFANTRY ICONS SHOW THE NUMBER OF YOUR UNITS
THE BOTTOM NUMBER IS THE ENEMY AND NEUTRAL UNITS(REPLACED BY A DASH IF THAT
INFO IS NOT AVAILABLE TO YOU).

ELEMENTS OF THE GAME:

TANK AND INFANTRY.

UNITS ARE USED FOR ATTACKING AND DEFENDING,ONCE UNITS ARE MOVED INTO AN
UNFRIENDLY COUNTRY THEY CANNOT BE MOVED UNTIL THE COUNTRY IS CAPTURED OR THEY
ARE DESTROYED.HOWEVER OTHER UNITS MAY BE MOVED IN TO JOIN THE COMBAT.
[NFANTRY] ARE STRONGER DEFENDING,[TANKS] ARE STRONGER ATTACKING.THEY CAN BE
MOVED ONLY TO AN ADJACENT COUNTRY `OR` TO A COUNTRY THAT IS SEPERATED BY ONE 
SEA AREA OCCUPIED BY FRIENDLY NAVAL UNITS.

NAVY.

UNITS CAN ONLY MOVE TO ADJACENT SEA AREAS.THEY ACT AS A BRIDGE FOR LAND
UNITS(SEE ABOVE) AND AT INTERVALS DO BATTLE WITH ENEMY NAVAL UNITS IN THE SAME
AREA.NEUTRAL NAVIES STAY OUT OF THE GAME UNTIL THE COUNTRY JOINS OR IS CAPTURED
BY ONE SIDE. THEN THEY MOVE INTO THE NEAREST SEA AS UNITS FOR THAT SIDE.

SPY.

UNITS ARE ALLOCATED TO FINDING PARTICULAR TARGETS IN ENEMY AND NEUTRAL
COUNTRIES.TO START OFF WITH YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE INFO ABOUT THE FORCES
AVAILABLE TO THE ENEMY,OR THE LOCATION OF TARGETS FOR YOUR MISSILES. THESE MUST
BE DISCOVERED BY YOUR SPIES. YOUR SPIES RUN THE RISK OF BEING CAPTURED,AND SOME
TARGETS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND THAN OTHERS,WITH A CORRESPONDING HIGHER RISK
OF CAPTURE.
NATURALLY THE MORE SPIES YOU HAVE ALLOCATED TO A TARGET THE GREATER THE CHANCE
OF FINDING IT.[NOTE] THAT YOU NEVER KNOW HOW MANY OF A PARTICULAR TARGET TYPE
REMAIN UNDISCOVERED BY YOUR SPIES.ONCE A TARGET HAS BEEN DISCOVERED,IT LOCATION
IS THEN KNOWN UNTIL IT IS DESTROYED,EVEN IF IT NO LONGER HAS SPIES ALLOCATED
TO IT.
THIS ALSO MEANS THAT IF ONE OF YOUR COUNTRIES IS CAPTURED BY THE ENEMY,YOU CAN
AUTOMATICALLY TARGET MISSILES AT IT.THE EXCEPTION IS TROOP(LAND BASED)UNITS
WHICH MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE SPY UNIT ALLOCATED AT ALL TIMES ONCE THEY ARE
FOUND,OTHERWISE THEY REVERT TO BEING UNKNOWN AGAIN.(THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE
THE ONLY TARGET THAT IS NOT IN A FIXED LOCATION).`TROOPS` INCLUDES THE NUMBER
OF INFANTRY,TANK,MISSILE UNITS IN A COUNTRY,BUT NOT THE LOCATION OF THE LAUNCH
SITES.IF YOU HAVE YOUR TROOPS IN AN UNFRIENDLY COUNTRY THEN YOU WILL
AUTOMATICALLY KNOW THE LOCATION AND STRENGTH OF ENEMY TROOPS(SINCE THEY ARE
TRYING TO KILL YOU).

MISSILES.

UNITS ARE USED TO STRIKE AT TARGETS IN AN ENEMY COUNTRY. TARGETS ARE DEFENDED
ACCORDING TO THEIR IMPORTANCE,SO THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A MISSILE STRIKE
WILL COMPLETELY DESTROY THE TARGET.NATURALLY THE MORE MISSILES YOU USE,THE
GREATER THE CHANCE OF SUCCESS. THE TARGET LOCATION MUST BE KNOWN BEFORE IT CAN
BE TARGETTED BY MISSILES (SEE [SPIES] ABOVE).

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE TARGETS THAT CAN BE ATTACKED:(AN ASTERICK INDICATES THAT
IT IS NOT NECCESSARY TO SPY OUT THE TARGET FIRST)

         *CITY                    REDUCES POPULATION
         *POWER STATIONS          REDUCES ENERGY
         *MINES                   REDUCES MINERALS
         *AGRICULTURAL            REDUCES FOOD LEVEL
          TROOPS                  DESTROYS INFANTRY AND TANK UNITS
          LAUNCH SITE             NEEDED TO LAUNCH MISSILES,ALSO DESTROYS
                                  MISSILE UNITS
          TANK FACTORY            NEEDED TO BUILD TANK UNITS
          MISSILE FACTORY         NEEDED TO BUILD MISSILES
         *SHIPYARD                NEEDED TO BUILD NAVIES

ALL NUCLEAR ATTACKS MAY ALSO DO INCIDENTAL DAMAGE TO `SOFT` TARGETS-POPULATION,
FOOD LEVEL,INFANTRY.THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE DONE DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF TARGET
BEING AIMED AT.IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT ATTACKS ON TROOP UNITS HIT `ALL`
UNITS EQUALLY-EVEN YOURS.BE CAREFUL OF LAUNCHING A STRIKE ON A COUNTRY THEN
INVADING IT BEFORE THE STRIKE HAS HIT!!.

NEUTRAL COUNTRIES MAY BE NUKED,BUT IF SO THEY AUTOMATICALLY JOIN THE OTHER
SIDE,AND YOUR STANDING WITH OTHER NEUTRAL CONTRIES GO DOWN.THE COMPUTER NEVER
NUKES NEUTRAL COUNTRIES FOR THIS REASON.WHEN THE ENEMY TRIES TO NUKE YOU,YOU
OPTIONALL TAKE OVER THE TASK OF DEFENDING THE TARGET IN AN ARCADE SEQUENCE.FOR
A COUNTRY TO LAUNCH MISSILES,IT MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE FUNCTIONING LAUNCH SITE.

DIPLOMACY.

UNITS ARE USED TO TRY ANS SWAY  NEUTRAL COUNTRIES TO JOIN YOUR SIDE.EVERY
NEUTRAL COUNTRY HAS A SYMPATHY RATING BETWEEN +/-64,RANDOMLY GENERATED AT THE
START OF THE GAME.IF THIS RATING GOES OVER 64 THE COUNTRY JOINS YOUR SIDE.IF IT
GOES BELOW MINUS 64 IT JOINS THE ENEMY.BY ALLOCATING DIPLOMACY UNITS TO A
COUNTRY YOU CAN IMPROVE YOUR STANDING OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.YOUR STANDING WILL
ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY OTHER THINGS THAT YOU(AND THE COMPUTER)DO-ATTACKING OR
NUKING OTHER NEUTRALS,BEING CAUGHT OUT SPYING ON IT ECT...

BUILDING UNITS.

THE INFANTRY,TANK,MISSILE,NAVY AND SPY UNITS MAY BE REPLENISHED BY BUILDING.
EACH COUNTRY HAS A NUMBER OF POPULATION,ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES THAT MAY
BE ALLOCATED TO BUILDING.EACH TYPE OF UNIT HAS A DIFFERENT `PRICE` AND TAKE A
CERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME TO BUILD. ONCE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO
BUILDING,THEY MAY NOT BE USED FOR ANYTHING ELSE UNTIL THAT BUILD IS
COMPLETE,WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED FOR FURTHER BUILDING.
WHEN NAVAL UNITS ARE BUILT,THEY AUTOMATICALLY APPEAR IN THE NEAREST SEA TO THE
COUNTRY THAT BUILT IT/THEM..MISSILE AND NAVY UNITS MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE
FACTORY OF THE APPROPRIATE TYPE IN THE COUNTRY.

FOOD AND STARVATION:

EACH COUNTRY HAS A FOOD LEVEL WHICH DICTATES THE NUMBER OF INFANTRY AND TANK
UNITS IT CAN COMFORTABLY CONTAIN.IF IT CONTAINS MORE THAN THIS LEVEL THEN(AFTER
A SMALL DELAY)UNITS WILL START DYING OFF UNTIL THE TOTAL IS WITHIN THE FOOD
LEVEL AGAIN.HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE DELAY,IT IS POSSIBLE TO MOVE A LARGE FORCE
THROUGH A COUNTRY WITH A LOW FOOD LEVEL WITHOUT HARM-IF YOUR QUICK AND LUCKY!!.

INVADING AN ENEMY COUNTRY WILL OFTEN PUSH THE NUMBER OF UNITS OVER THE FOOD
LIMIT,RESULTING IN STARVATION.THIS IS THE PRICE OF WAR.FOOD LEVELS ARE ALSO
VULNERABLE TO NUCLEAR ATTACK.
