INTRODUCTION

   Congratulations! You have just purchased First Shapes, an exciting Early
Education skill builder that incorporates synthesized speech to increase
childrens' ability to learn important beginning concepts about shapes and
form. First Shapes is the initial title in First Bytes Building Blocks for
Learning Series.

				1

   Meet Ted E. Bear. He's a charming, delightful fellow, a talking computer
friend who will introduce who will introduce the children who meet him to
the world of geometric shapes. As he takes them through First Shapes, the
children will play in a rich learning environment in which they use
geometric shapes to build toys and help Ted E. Bear identify missing shapes
and play learning games. Each activity is designed to increase their
readiness for mathematics, reading, writing, and problem solving.

   Because of the speech capabilities of Ted E. Bear, children will be able
to participate in First Shapes activities without knowing how to read
instructions. They will find the program easy and fun to use. Their lack of
dependence on a grown up reader will increase their self-confidence as an
independent learner. As an added feature, the grown up helper will be able
to put words into Ted's mouth so that he makes comments designed for each
special child working in First Shapes.

   This Handbook is a guide for you the Helper. It will give you an
overview of the educational objectives of First Shapes, an introduction to
each learning module, and enrichment activities that you can use with your
child to reinforce and expand on the concepts learned in First Shapes.

GETTING STARTED

   After reading this Handbook, play with First Shapes yourself. Look at
each learning module with your child's skills and interests in mind.

   Select the Helper's Choice icon "H" in the upper left hand corner of the
Main Menu. Enter your child's name to create a Toy Box to save toys. If no
name is entered, the toys made will be stored in Ted E. Bear's Toy Box. Use
the other Helper options to individualize the learning activities for your
child.

   Help your child get started by giving an introduction to the Main Menu.
Assist when necessary, but encourage your child's independent decision
making.

WHAT CAN YOUR CHILD LEARN BY USING FIRST SHAPES?

   FIRST SHAPES will help your child be able to....

    1. Identify five basic shapes: the square, rectangle, circle, oval, and
       triangle.

    2. Recognize and use words to identify and compare shapes and sizes.

    3. Select a missing part to complete a whole object.

    4. Use shapes to creatively build objects.

    5. Match two shapes that are the same, recalling both the visual object
       and its location.

    6. Solve problems independently.

				4

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR YOUR CHILD TO LEARN ABOUT GEOMETRIC SHAPES?

   Learning to identify and use shapes will....

   Increase a child's readiness to begin reading and writing. Everything in
a child's world has its own shape, including the letters in the alphabet.
All letters are relationships between size and shape. By recognizing and
using shapes in two different, but equally important ways, the child begins
to relate shape to shape, size to size, and size to shape. Visually, shapes
can be identified and manipulated on the computer screen within the Toy Box
environment. Manually, a child should play with actual shape blocks away
from the computer touching, manipulating, and becoming familiar with their
characteristics. Both experiences allow the child to easily identify each
shape in new situations and see relationships between shape and line. This
ability to visually and manually identify and use shapes, transfers to the
child's successful activities in recognizing letters and words as well as
using a pencil to make them. The speech component of First Shapes
additionally gives the child the ability to hear and later recall the names
of each shape.

				5

   Increase a child's understanding and interest in mathematics.
Experiences with shape recognition and comparison can help a child form and
recognize number symbols as well as the letter symbols previously
mentioned. In a larger sense working with and learning about geometric
shapes, even at an early age, increases a child's appreciation of form,
part to whole relationships, and structure and variety in the world around
him. Too often mathematics means only rote learning of basic facts. It is
important that the child has the opportunity to develop mathematical
concepts through his own experiences. For example, building toys with
shapes helps a child draw conclusions about how shapes fit together and can
be used to construct a whole object. In a creative atmosphere, First Shapes
allows a child to learn mathematical ideas, and solve problems that use
those ideas.

   Increase a child's confidence in problem solving and independent
decision making. The learning environment created in First Shapes uses the
vehicle of basic geometric shapes to allow a child to make choices and
evaluate decisions. When building toys, the child decides what shape to
select for each part of the toy. After the toy is completed, the young toy
maker becomes a judge of his/her own work. Any toy can either thrown out,
put in the Toy Box, or started over. It is up to each child to make these
decisions. The learning environment is carefully built to allow a child to
progress comfortably from simply learning to identify shapes to experiences
that put the child in charge of how those shapes can be used.

LEARNING MODULES

SHAPES

   This learning module is the natural first step into First Shapes. It is
designed for the child who is just beginning to recognize shapes and needs
some practice and play before going on to larger projects. Each of the five
shapes are presented one at a time. When the child or Helper clicks on Ted
E. Bear, the name of the shape displayed is said at the word appears on the
screen. By selecting the "Bigger" or "Smaller" boxes the same shape can
change in size. Helpers and children can use this module to practice
identifying shapes and talking about what they look like. "What do you
see?" How many sides does a square have?" "How many corners do you see?"
Let's see how many square shapes we can find in this room?"

				7

THE TOY FACTORY

   In this module, the child uses the now familiar shapes to build toys to
store in a private Toy Box. Each child can choose shapes to construct
variations of many different toys. "What shapes would you like for the
robot's arms?"  "What shape should the robot's head be?" Many different
robots could be constructed depending on the choice made. After the toy is
finished, the toy maker becomes a critic, able to decide if the toy should
be stored in the Toy Box. Each toy is given a name and the child is able to
view exactly how it was built. In addition, each toy can be printed out and
displayed for everyone to see.

THE TOY BOX

   Each child has their own Toy Box for storing toys made in the Toy
Factory. By selecting this module, the toy maker can open the Toy Box and
look at each toy. If the child decides a toy should leave the Toy Box, it
can be taken out to make room for other toys. The toy maker can also use
the "Print" Box to make a paper copy of each toy.

				8

THE TOY FAIR

   Each child can visit the Toy Fair with Ted E. Bear and help him win
arcade games and take a balloon ride. By finding the shape Ted E. Bear is
looking for, every child is a winner. Selecting the largest circle, the
pointed shape, the smallest triangle, and many other specified shapes, the
learner will be able to identify qualified shapes, compare objects, and
become familiar with descriptive vocabulary words.

MAKE-A-MATCH GAME

   The Make-A-Match Game is designed to help children compare shapes and
objects deciding if they are the same or different. In turning over Ted E.
Bear cards the child tries to make shape and toy matches until all the
cards are face up. To accomplish this, the child must not only recognize "a
match" but also recall each object's location in order to find it again.
There are three levels of difficulty to allow for each child's learning
rate. A child can also choose to play "By Myself," "With a Friend," or
against Ted E. Bear. Ted E. Bear call be "Silly," "Smart," or "Very Smart."

FOR THE HELPER....THE HELPER'S CHOICE

   First Shapes allows you, the Helper, to "tailor make" the program for
the child using it. By clicking on the "H" for HELPER on the Main Menu, a
number of program controls are at your command. You can change the speech
controls, insert the learner's name, set your own reinforcement messages,
and make learning modules active or inactive.

   Your role as a Helper is very important in determining the learning
impact of a program like First Shapes. After you help your children get
started, it is important to encourage their independent use of the program.
However, also use the learning activities as an opportunity for you to play
and work together. For example, you can ask leading questions that
encourage the building of concepts. "How did you know that was the biggest
circle?" "How is a triangle different from the square?" Most important,
your encouragement and praise will make a large contribution toward each
child's enjoyment of learning new things and self confidence in solving
problems. Provide ample opportunities for toy makers to share their work
with family and friends.

EXTRA LEARNING ACTIVITIES

   * Draw pictures on paper than consist of geometric shapes like a circle
     sun, a triangular roof, or a rectangular boat. Challenge your child to
     find the shapes you specify and color them. Then let the children draw
     their own pictures and ask you to find the shapes.

   * Make masks with construction paper by cutting out shapes for the
     facial features. Make a triangle monster for a circle bear face!

   * Play a "find the shape" game in many different locations including
     your child's bedroom, the grocery store, the park, and the kitchen.

   * Make shapes on paper by tracing objects around the house. Trace around
     a glass and make a circle or use the bottom of the cereal box to make
     a rectangle.

				11

   * Use objects like straws, pencils, or toothpicks to construct shapes.
     This will help you ask your child important questions that they can
     find answers to by their own experience. How many sides does a
     triangle have? How many corners? Is each side the same size? Are all
     the sides of a rectangle the same? Which sides are longer? How is a
     rectangle different than a square?

   * Look at patterns that are made from shapes. Good examples to use are
     quilts and stained glass windows. Let you child make a pattern by
     repeating shapes in a set order.

   * Take children to the art museum and look for shapes in the paintings
     and sculptures. They will see how artists use shape in their work and
     it will increase their interest in starting their own projects.

   * Demonstrate to your child how some shapes are "flat like the ones used
     in First Shapes while others are not. Introduce shapes like boxes, and
     balls, and cubes that have volume.

   * Folding paper, napkins, or cloth is a good way to demonstrate how
     shapes relate to each other. What happens when you fold a rectangle in
     half? Is it still a rectangle? Can you fold a square and make a
     triangle?

				12

   * Children enjoy making their bodies into shapes. Challenge your child
     to become a rectangle or to make a circle shape only using arms. It's
     also exciting to make letter shapes bringing in friends and other
     family members to help out. Who's going to dot the i?

   * Help your child learn about "open" and "closed" shapes. All of the 5
     shapes used in First Shapes are closed shapes. They start and stop at
     the same point. There are many more closed shapes that can be made.
     Have your child start drawing a line on paper and move the pencil
     until the point is back to where it started. This is a "closed" shape.
     Now try drawing an "open" shape. To extend this activity, look at the
     letters of the alphabet. Some are closed shapes like the letter O.
     Others are open shapes like the letter C. Some are a combination of
     both.

   * To reinforce each of the five shapes presented in First Shapes, help
     your child find examples of these shapes in their environment. For
     example, a watermelon, a rubber band, an egg, or some rugs on the
     floor, are ovals. Windows, flags and books can be rectangles.
     Handkerchiefs, some boxes, and checkerboards are squares. There are
     unlimited possibilities, when you look at objects like signs,
     buildings, toys and trees.

				13

   * Encourage your child to play with puzzles that use primary shapes to
     build a whole picture.

   * Use stencils to trace shapes on construction paper. Cut them out and
     use them to build pictures.

   * Playing with all types of blocks is very important. Besides giving
     your child ample time to sort shapes and build with them. spend time
     sitting with your child playing and talking about the shapes and
     building projects. A child's ability to verbalize their thoughts, ask
     questions, and respond to the discovery enhancing questions you can
     ask, helps them form concepts and increases their understanding.
