THE STORY.
----------
IN TINY VILLAGE OF ANCIENT JAPAN,LORD AKIRA AND HIS YOUNG SAMURAI WERE
COLLECTING TAXES FROM THE LOCAL PEASANTS WHEN THE DEMON KING ASCENDE FROM THE
MOUNTAIN.
THE VILLAGE WAS DESTROYED,ALL THE INHABITANTS MURDERED, BUT THE DEMON KING PAID
SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE WARRIOR LORD. FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER, THE YOUNG SAMURAI
WAS ALONE WITH THE DOMON LORDS FINAL WORDS.`TELL THEM ABOUT ME,TELL THEM I AM
READY TO TAKE EVERYTHING BACK THAT IS MINE BY RIGHT.TELL THEM THEIR TRUE MASTER
HAS RETURNED....`. ON THE COLD MORNING,THE YOUNG SAMURAI SWORE REVENGE FOR HIS
FALLEN MASTER.

FOR YEARS THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THE HILLS FOUGHT THE DEMON AS BEST THEY
COULD,UNTIL THE WIZARD-MAGE ARRIVED FROM THE SEA AND CHALLENGED THE DEMON. THEY
FOUGHT HARD AND LONG ATOP THE DEMON KINGS MOUNTAIN,LIGHTNING AND FIRE KEEPING
THE NIGHT AGLOW,UNTIL THE DEMON,FEARING DEFEAT,ESCAPED IN TIME,HURLING HIMSELF
FAR INTO THE FUTURE WHERE PEOPLE HAD FORGOTTEN THE MAGIC AND WHERE HE NEED FEAR
NO OPPOSSITION...

THE GOOD PEOPLE WERE SAFE,BUT FOR THE YOUNG SAMURAI THERE WAS NO REST,FOR HIS
SOUL COULD NOT BE AT REST UNTIL HE AVENGED HIS MURDERED LORD. SO HE BEGGED THE
MAGE THAT HE MIGHT FOLLOW THE DEMON INTO THE FUTURE TO BRING THE DEMON KING
BACK SO THAT HE COULD BE DESTROYED AT THE FOOT OF HIS OWN MOUNTAIN THRONE...
THIS WAS HOW IT BEGAN.

NOTE: IF YOU HAVE A 1MEG OR MORE MACHINE THE GAME WILL RUN WITH ENHANCED
FEATURES.

NOTE; THE SHEER SIZE OF THE FIRST SAMURAI`S MAP MEANS THAT IT IS BROCKEN DOWN
INTO A FEW CAREFULLY COMPRESSED BITE SIZED CHUNKS WHICH ARE STORED ON DISK
2.FOR THIS REASON,THE FIRST SAMURAI DISK 2 SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COMPUTERS
INTERNAL DRIVE FOR THE DURATION OF PLAY. THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO REPLACE IT
WITH THE FIRST SAMUARI DISK ONE,UNLESS OF COURSE,YOU WISH TO REVIEW THE SCENE
SETTING SEQUENCE.

                        --------------------------

THE JAPAN OF THE 24TH CENTURY IS FAR REMOVED FROM THE COUNTRY WE KNOW TODAY,THE
DEMON KING HAS RAVAGED THE COUNTRYSIDE AND CITIES AND NOW HIS MINIONS INHABIT
THE RUINS.

OUR HEROS MISSION UNFOLDS THROUGH 4 SECTIONS OF THE TORTOUS COUNTRYSIDE OF
FUTURISTIC JAPAN AND CONTINUES WITH A THRILLING HIGH SPEED JOURNEY ON A SUBWAY
TRAIN.THE TRAOINS DESTINATION IS THE DERILICT SUBURBS OF THE DEMON KINGS CITY
BENEATH WHICH HIS SUBTERRANEAN HORDES ROAM IN THE COMPLEX SEWER NETWORK. BEYOND
THE GRIME LIES A NEAR ALL-CONSUMING BATTLE THROUGH THE CLASSIER SIDE OF TOWN
BEFORE THE BASE OF THE DEMON KINGS CITY SKYSCRAPER IS REACHED.

THE COUNTRYSIDE OF FUTURISTIC JAPAN LOOKS SERENE BUT HIDES MANY DANGERS SUCH AS
BATS AND RATS,FIERY PITS AND FALLING ROCK(SOME OF THEM LESS OBVIOUS THAN
OTHERS).

SLUGGING OT OUT ON(AND IN) A SPEEDING SUBWAY TRAIN IN A SCENE VAGUELY
REMINISCENT OF WESTERNS OF OLD.

THE ROUGH SIDE OF TOWN IS HOME TO MANY A RUCK-AND PLENTY OF RUNNING AND JUMPING
ACROSS ROOFTOPS TOO.

BENEATH THE STREETS,STRANGE CREATURES ROAM THE SEWERS AND DEADLY WATER
FOUNTAINS GUSH.

THE INHABITANTS OF THE BRIGHTER SIDE OF TOWN ARE NO BETTER THAN THEIR
NEIGHBOURS.

THEY ARE MANY AND VARIED AND EACH HAS ITS OWN CHARACTERISTICS AND
STRENGTHS.NOTE THAT AN ADVERSARY WHICH HAS BEEN HIT WILL FLASH BUT THAT DOES
NOT MEAN IT ILL DIE AS NOT ALL MINIONS CAN BE KILLED. POINTS ARE GIVEN FOR EACH
KILL.

THE STATUS PANEL.
-----------------
THE PHYSICAL ENERGY IS THAT OF THE HERO AND IS REPRESENTED BY AN ARM. THE
SHORTER THE ARM THE WEAKER THE HERO. WHEN THE HERO`S PHYSICAL STRENGTH RUNS
OUT, HE DIES(UNLESS HE POSSESSES THE MAGIC SWORD) -SEE MAGIC SWORD.

PHYSICAL STRENGTH IS LOST WHENEVER THE HERO IS HIT BY ONE OF THE DEMON KINGS
MINIONS.THE HERO BEGINS HIS QUEST AT A MAXIMUM.

MYSTICAL TERMS.
---------------
THE BELL.....IS THE MOST POWERFUL MYSTICAL OBJECT.USE IT WHEN NO OTHER COURSE
OF ACTION CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU FACE.

ADDITIONAL WEAPONARY.
---------------------
THERE`S NO DOUBTING THE HERO`S UNARMED COMBAT SKILLS - HE`S A LEAN,MEAN
FIGHTING MACHINE. BUT OCCASIONALLY HE MAY NEED A LITTLE HELPING HAND IN THE
FORM OF AN ADDITIONAL WEAPON. THESE MAY BE FOUND DURING SAMURAIS JOURNEY. BUT
SOME TYPES MAY ONLY BE COLLECTED IF THE SAMURAI HAS SUFFICIENT MAGICAL ENERGY.
ONLY ONE WEAPON CAN BE HELD AT A TIME;IT IS SHOWN ON THE PANEL BELOW THE
BATTLEFIELD. IF THE HERO IS HOLDING A WEAPON WHEN HE PICKS UP ANOTHETR, THE OLD
WEAPON IS LOST. ADDITIONAL WEAPONARY IS ACTIVATED BY PRESSING THE JOYSTICK
FIREBUTTON WHILE THE HERO STANDS STILL.
WHEN THE PLAYER HAS SUFFICIENT MAGICAL ENERGY A MAGICAL ITEM WILL APPEAR AS A
SPARKLING STAR.WALKING OVER THE ITEM WILL REVEAL ITS TRUE FORM BUT THE PLAYER
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT IT.

DAGGER.
-------
THROW OUT A DEADLY DAGGER.BETTER STILL.COLLECT A MAXIMUM OF THREE DAGGERS AND
YOU CAN HAVE THREE ON THE GO AT ONCE.

ON THE GO AT ONCE. BEAR IN MIND THAT A SEEKER WILL DISAPPEAR WHEN IT RUNS OUT
OF HIT POWER.

AXE.
----
THROW A SINGLE AXE. THERE CAN BE NO MORE.

MAGIC.
------
THE SAMURAI IS NOT ADEPT IN THE WAYS OF MAGIC.FORTUNATELY FOR HIM,THE WIZARD
MAGE IS HIGHLY SKILLED IN THE MYSTICAL ARTS AND MAY BE SUMMONED THROUGH TIME TO
AID THE SAMURAI.
NOTE; THE WIZARD-MAGE OCCASIONALLY MAKES A FLEETING APPEARENCE IN TIMES OOF
TROUBLE.WHEN HE APPEARS,YOU KNOW ITS TIME TO SUMMON HIM.

SPECIAL ITEMS.
--------------
THE WIZARD-MAGE IS POWERFUL BUT SOMETIMES THE PROBLEMS PRESENTED ARE NOT
SOLUABLE WITHOUT A HELPING HAND. ON EACH LEVEL THE HERO NEEDS TO COLLECT
SPECIAL ITEMS.WHEN A SPECIAL ITEM IS COLLECTED,THE WIZARD MAGE APPEARS TO TAKE
IT FROM THE HERO.WHEN THE MOVEMENT COMES,THE WIZARD MAGE WILL USE THE SPECIAL
ITEMS ON A LEVEL - JUST MOST OF THEM.
THE MYSTICAL ENERGY IS THAT OF THE HERO`S MAGIC SWORD(SEE MAGIC SWORD) THE
ENERGY OF EVERY CREATURE KILLED IS ABSORBED BY THE MAGIC SWORD AND SHOWN AS
THIS BAR,THE GREATER THE BAR,THE GREATER THE QUANTITY OF MYSTICAL ENERGY
STORED.THE MYSTICAL ENERGY IS USED TO CHARGEPOTS. THE HERO BEGINS HIS QUEST
WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF MYSTICAL ENERGY,WHICH IS INCREASED BY DEFEATING THE
DEMON KINGS MINIONS IN BATTLE.

REGENERATION POTS.
------------------
REGENERATION  POTS ARE DOTTED ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE IN OPPORTUNE PLACES. A
CHARGED REGENERATION POT MARKS THE POSITION ON THE LANDSCAPE TO WHERE THE HERO
IS RETURNED WHEN HE IS RE-INCARNATED FOLLOWING THE LOSS OF A LIFE, OR WHEN HE
USES A TRANSPORT OPTION.

A POT IS CHARGED BY POSITIONING THE SAMURAI OVER IT AND CROUCHING DOWN. THE
MYSTICAL ENERGY ACCUMALATED DURING PLAY WILL THEN FLOW INTO THE REGENRATION
POT. ONLY ONE POT CAN BE ACTIVE AT ANY ONE TIME,BUT THE HERO CAN RE-ACTIVATE A
PREVIOUSLY CHARGED POT AND SO DETERMINE A RESTART FOR THE HERO.

POTIONS.
--------
PICK UP A POTION AND THE HERO IS TRANSPORTED TO THE LAST RE-GENERATION POT.

THE MAGIC SWORD.
----------------
THE HERO BEGINS HIS QUEST WITH-OUT HIS MAGIC SWORD.THE MAGIC SWORD IS ONLY
GIVEN TO THE HERO WHEN HE COLLECTS SUFFICIENT MYSTICAL ENERGY. NOT ONLY DOES
THE MAGIC SWORD EFFECTIVELY EXTEND THE FIRST SAMURAIS REACH,IT ALSO SPARES HIM
INSTANT DEATH. WHEN THE HERO`S PHYSICAL ENERGY REACHES ZERO,THE MAGICAL SWORD
IS LOST BUT THE HERO LIVES ON,HIS MYSTICAL ENERGY CONVERTED TO A SMALL PORTION
OF PHYSICAL ENERGY.

PLAYERS LIVES REMAINING.
------------------------
THE PLAYERS MISSION BEGINS WITH 5 RE-INCARNATIONS OF THE HERO. SEE IF YOU CAN

ADVICE....TRY STRIKING THE SCENERY - HIDDEN BONUSES MAY BE UNCOVERED,SUCH AS

A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE POSITION OF HIDDEN BONUSES.

SOME AREAS OF THE SCENERY ARE DESTRUCTIBLE - DONT BE AFRAID TO HIT OUT AT
ANYTHING THAT LOOKS REMOTELY FRAGILE.

THE CHEST HOLDS TREASURE. STRIKE THEM A COUPLE OF TIMES TO SCATTER THEIR
CONTENTS,SIMPLY WALK OVER THE TREASURE TO COLLECT.

THE BASKETS HOLD FOOD WHICH REPLEISHES PHYSICAL STRENGTH. TO COLLECT JUST DO AS
WITH THE TREASURE CHESTS..

BEWARE OF LAND MINES...YOU`LL REGONISE ONE HAVING TRODDEN ON ONE!

WATCH OUT FOR OPPOONENTS WHO DROP WEAPONS - YOU CAN PICK THEM UP!

FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS THE FLAMING PIT OR IN NEED OF SOME MEANS TO
REACH SEEMINGLY UNREACHABLE HEIGHTS? THE WIZARD MAGE WILL PROVE USEFUL.
