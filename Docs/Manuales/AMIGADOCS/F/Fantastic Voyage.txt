O                                  THE GAME
W 
    The Cold War rages.  American and Soviet scientists are struggling to
S develop and perfect a miniaturization technique which would allow them to
K shrink armies and easily transport them to any spot on the globe.
I Although the American scientists can miniaturize objects, the process is
D unperfected and anything miniaturized returns to its original size within
  an hour. However, Czechoslovakian scientist Jan Benes has the knowledge to
R perfect the miniaturization process.
O 
W   After defecting to the United States from behind the Iron Curtain, Benes
  suffers a brain injury when the East Bloc makes a final attempt on his
S life. The secret U.S. Organization which is developing the miniaturization
K technique, known as the CMDF (Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces),
I determine that the only hope for saving Benes' life is to enter his body
D and destroy a blood clot using a laser.  The CMDF can shrink men and
  equipment to microbe size and plan to miniaturize the experimental
R submarine Proteus along with a crew of doctors and scientists, inject them
O into Benes' blood stream at the base of the neck and hope that they can
W make their way to the brain for the operation.  Your mission is to pilot
  the Proteus through the body to the brain.  There you must use a laser to
S destroy the blood clot which threatens Benes' life.  You alone can insure
K the success of the American CMDF program.
I 
D   Fantastic Voyage is a science fiction game composed of 3 levels.  You
  must make your way through the body to the brain and remove the blood clot
R which threatens the life of your patient.  Along the way, you must find
O nine different pieces of a circuit board which you'll need to make your
W laser operate in the brain.
  
S   During your voyage you will encounter numerous obstacles.  The body sees
K you as a foreign invader, an intruder which must be destroyed.  You'll
I have your hands full defending yourself from the body's natural defenses.
D 
 
R                            LOADING INSTRUCTIONS
O 
W   Fantastic Voyage is played with a joystick plugged into the second
  joystick port.
S 
K   To avoid the possibility of infecting your Fantastic Voyage disks with a
I virus, always turn off your machine for a few seconds before loading the
D game.  If using an Amiga 1000, first insert a Kickstart disk, insert
  Fantastic Voyage Disk One in drive DF0:.  The introduction to the game
R will run automatically.
O 
W   During the Intro you can press the joystick fir button to begin playing
  the game.  Or, you can wait until the Intro is over and the game will load
S automatically.  Insert Disk Two in drive DF0: when prompted.
K 
I   Never remove disks from the drive unless asked to do so by the program.
D 
   In order to get maximum fun and excitement from Fantastic Voyage, we
R strongly recommend that you play the game in a darkened room with the
O contrast control of your monitor set to high.  Pump up the volume and turn
W out the lights!
  
S 
K                          THE CONFIGURATION SCREEN
I 
D   Here you can use the function keys to control various aspects of the
    game:
R 
O   F1 is used to start the game after you've made the following choices:
W   F2 selects the difficulty level (Beginner, Advanced or Pro).  The
       difficulty level determines how many hits the Proteus can suffer
S      before it is destroyed and you lose a "life."
K   F3 PAL/NTSC selects whether to play in NTSC mode (U.S & Canada) or in
I      PAL mode (Europe, etc...)
D   F4 Displays the High Score screen.
 
R 
O                                 THE PROTEUS
W 
    As the commander of the experimental Proteus submarine, you have awesome
S resources and a wide range of powerful weapons at your disposal.  But, you
K must locate and pick up both fuel and oxygen cannisters which have been
I injected into the body in order to keep your Proteus operating.  Running
D out of fuel or oxygen is fatal!  Gauges on the Proteus Control Panel will
  give constant readouts of your fuel and oxygen levels.  Keep an eye on
R them! The CMDF mission control personnel will monitor your progress and
O will inject special weapons into the body which you'll need to pick up to
W kill certain enemies.
  
S   The Proteus has been engineered to withstand the extreme stress of the
K miniaturization process and to some extent its shields can withstand
I attacks from adversaries inside the body.  The amount of energy remaining
D in the Proteus' shields can be seen on the gauge on the far right side of
  the Control Panel.  Each time you kill three enemies without missing, the
R energy level of your shields will be increased.  The Proteus Control Panel
O also displays the current score and the number of "lives" the Proteus has.
W The text readout window displays helpful messages from the CMDF Control
  Room.
S 
K   You can pilot the Proteus through the body in eight different
I directions. Just move the joystick in the direction you want to go. If
D you're holding down the fire button and move from left to right, the
  Proteus will move in the direction you're pushing the joystick, but the
R Proteus will continue facing (and firing) in the same direction.  To make
O a turn, let go of the fire button before changing directions.
W 
  
S                              KEYBOARD CONTROLS
K 
I   You can use the "P" key to pause the game at any time.  Press the "P"
D key again to continue your voyage.
  
R   The "S" key can be used to select either music or sound effects.  Please
O note that music during gameplay is only available if you have at least one
W Megabyte of Chip RAM in your Amiga.
  
S 
K                              THE CONTROL ROOM
I 
D The CMDF Control Room screen will appear before each of the three game
  levels.  Here in "Mission Control" you will be able to see the current
R location of the Proteus on a map of the body.  You can also examine the
O monitors to keep track of how many of the nine pieces of the laser circuit
W board you have collected.  Here you will also see a readout of your total
  score, the elapsed time and your CMDF rating.  You can scroll around in
S the Control Room by moving you joystick to the left and right.  You can
K leave the Control Room and proceed to the next level by pressing the
I joystick fire button.
D 
  
R                               TIPS AND TRICKS
O 
W   It is not always necessary to blast everything in sight to make your
  way through the mazes.  Try to find ways to sneak past the enemies.
S 
K   You must pick up all nine pieces of the laser gun circuitry before
I attempting to destroy the blood clot at the end of Level Three.
D   Special weapons are required to kill certain enemies.  Always pick up
  fuel, oxygen and weapon cannisters.
R   Remember that killing three enemies in succession without missing
O increases the energy in your shields.  Don't just fire randomly.
W 
  
S                                 GAME FACTS
K 
I   Much of what you will see inside the human body during the game is based
D upon scientific fact.  However, Fantastic Voyage is a mixture of fact and
  fantasy.  In Level One you will experience graphics based upon electron
R microscope photographs of the interiors of blood vessels and various blood
O cell types like leukocytes and erythrocytes.  But, you will also have to
W deal with cancer cells which crawl around and fire weapons.  You will also
  encounter other hazards which are purely fictional creations.
S   The backgrounds in the sub-atomic world of Level Two are based upon the
K tracks created in the bubble chambers of particle accelerators when they
I are subjected to beams of sub-atomic particles called neutrinos.  Other
D objects in Level Two, such as protons, gluons, quarks and other particles
  had to be artistic creations since no one has ever seen them!  Level
R Three's backgrounds are based upon electron microscope photographs of the
O brain's neural network.
W 
    Blah, blah, greets: SOD, Atrophy, Nuclear Assualt....
S   (What? you expect real greets on a DOC file???)
K 
I     If there is some text after this that advertises a certain bbs,
D   do us all a favor and do not call that bbs!!!
