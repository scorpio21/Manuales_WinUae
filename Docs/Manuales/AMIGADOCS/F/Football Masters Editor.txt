      SKID ROW ..GIVE YOU THE DOX TOO - FOOTBALL MASTERS EDITOR DISK -
      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

INTRODUCTION;-

THIS EDITOR HAS 2 FUNCTIONS,FIRSTLY,IT PROVIDES YOU WITH MORE CONTROL OVER HOW
THE COMPUTER SETS UP NEW DATA IN THE GAME AND SECONDLY IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO
ALTER MANY FEATURES OF MOST STATISTICS IN THE GAMES YOU SAVE AND THE WAY THE
COMPUTER CREATES NEW GAMES. IT IS VITAL YOU FULLY READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS AS
SOME ITEMS HAVE VERY IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN CHANGES.
IGNOREING SUCH CHANGES WILL CAUSE LONG TERM PROBLEMS.

YOU CAN EXPERIMENT MUCH MORE QUICKLY WITH THIS EDITOR OR CHEAT LIKE HELL IF YOU
MUST. THE POTENETIAL FOR EXPERIMENTING IS FANTASTIC YOU CAN TRY PLAYING WITH A
TEAM FULL OF PLAYERS WITH THE SAME SPECIAL ABILITY. BY DOING THIS YOU SHOULD
HOPEFULLY DISCOVER MORE QUICKLY THE VARIED EFFECTS THEY AND OTHER PLAYER
STATISTICS HAVE IN THE GAME.

FILE.
-----
LOAD ; WILL LOAD A SAVED DATA FILE FROM A DISK.

SAVE ; WILL INITIATE THE SAVE PROCEDURE. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS NOT AS STRAIGHT
FORWARD AS IN THE MAIN GAME. BEFORE SAVING INITIAL OR LOADED DATA THE COMPUTER
WILL CHECK THAT THE TEAM STRUCTURES ARE ACCEPTABLE TO THE FORMAT DEMANDED BY
THE MAIN PROGRAM. IF SOMETHING UNEXPECTED IS ALLOWED TO SLIP THROUGH THE THE
MAIN PROGRAM WILL CRASH OR LOCK UP. THEREFORE, BEFORE A SAVE IS ATTEMPTED 3
CHECKS ARE MADE ON ALL TEAMS. NOTE; THAT THESE 3 CHECKS WILL IGNORE MANAGED
TEAMS WHEN YOU HAVE LOADED YOUR OWN DATA FILES.

THE 1ST CHECK IS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY TEAM HAS 20 PLAYERS. 2ND THAT ALL
TEAMS HAVE 11 PLAYERS SELECTED AND 3RD THAT A GOALKEEPER IS INCLUDED IN THE
TEAM. IF ANY OF THE 3 CRITERIA ARE NOT MET BY ALL RELEVANT TEAMS A WARNING WILL
APPEAR. THE COMPUTER WILL ASK YOU IF YOU WANT TO CORRECT THESE ERRORS,IF YOU
ANSWER NO THEN THE SAVE WILL BE ABORTED AND YOU MUST MAKE THE ALTERATIONS
YOURSELF. TO SEE WHERE ANY PROBLEMS EXIST USE THE `SHOW GAPS`,YOU WILL FIND IT
IN THE PLAYER MENU.

IF YOU ALLOW THE COMPUTER TO MAKE THE ALTERATIONS THEN A TOTALLY RANDOM PLAYER
WILL FILL ANY GAPS. IF A GOALKEEPER IS MISSING THE COMPUTER WILL FIND THE FIRST
PLAYER WHO IS SET TO `TEAM` ON STATUS AND SET THEIR POSITION TO A `GOALKEEPER`.
IF THERE ARE LESS THAN 11 PLAYERS THEN THE COMPUTER WILL RANDOMLY SELECT ANY
PLAYER SET AS A RESERVE TO `TEAM`. THEREFORE, SOME DISTORTION TO THINGS YOU
HAVE CHANGED MAY OCCUR IN TEAMS.

PLEASE NOTE; THAT THE PROGRAM IS LIKELY TO SLOW DOWN IF YOU REMOVE FORWARDS
FROM `TEAM` STATUS IN ANY SQUAD.THIS IS BECAUSE THE GOALSCORER ROUTINE GIVES
PREFERENCE TO THESE TYPES OF PLAYERS AND IF NONE ARE AVAILABLE THE ROUTINE TO
DECIDE WHO SCORED A GOAL WILL TAKE A LITTLE LONGER.FURTHERMORE NOTE THAT THE 11
PLAYERS YOU INITIALLY SELECT TO HAVE A STATUS OF `TEAM` WILL ALWAYS APPEAR IN A
MANAGERS SQUAD CREATED WITH `NEWGAME`.

IF YOU MAKE ANY PLAYERS IN THE INITIAL DATA AS SUBSTITUES THEY WILL ALSO APPEAR
IN ANY NEWGAME SELECTED BY A MANAGER. THE SIDE EFFECT OF MAKING PLAYERS
SUBSTITUES IS THAT YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET MORE THAN 16 PLAYERS IN YOUR NEW
TEAM.

AFTER CHECKING THE TEAM STRUCTURES THE COMPUTER WILL THEN SEE IF ANY SURNAMES
HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE LIST CURRENTLY IN ITS MEMORY. IF THERE HAS BEEN ANY
ADDITIONS THEN SERIOUS CHANGES ARE NECESSARY TO ALL SAVED FILES. THE COMPUTER
WILL FIRST RE-SORT THE SURNAMES AND CREATE NEW PLAYER PREFERENCES,IT WILL THEN
SAVE THE CURRENT LOADED FILE. THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO LOAD ALL OTHER RELEVANT
DATA FILES TO BE AMENDED. A DIFFERENT PROCEDURE EXISTS FOR DIFFERENT MACHINES
AND DIFFERENT SET UPS,SO PLEASE REFER TO THE RELEVANT SECTION BELOW.

AMIGA WITH 2 DISK DRIVES OR HARD DISK.
--------------------------------------
BEFORE YOU SAVE MAKE SURE THAT THE CORRECT OPTION IS SET UP TO YOUR SYSTEM AND
THAT IF YOU HAVE 2 DRIVES,THE DATA DISK IS INSERTED IN DF1; IF THIS IS ALL SET
UP CORRECTLY THEN ALL YOUR FILES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY LOADED AND AMENDED.

AMIGA SINGLE DRIVE.
-------------------
AS YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO SAVE 1 FILE TO YOUR PROGRAM DISK ALL FILES ARE
UPDATED AUTOMATICALLY.

ALL FORMATS.
------------
THE INITIAL DATA FILE WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE LOADED, CONVERTED AND SAVED AFTER
YOU HAVE COMPLETED ALL THE OTHER FILES. THEN THE FILENAME YOU ORIGINALLLY
WORKED ON WILL BE RE-LOADED FOR ANY FURTHER CHANGES.

IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG AND THE PROGRAM CRASHES WHILE THIS PROCESS IS IN
OPERATION IT IS VITAL THAT YOU HAVE A BACK UP DISK TO GO BACK TO. ALL
PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN INTO THE PROGAM TO AVOID SUCH PROBLEMS BUT WE
ASUME YOU FOLLOW ANY ON SCREEN PROMPTS GIVEN BY THE COMPUTER.

FINALLY,NOTE THAT THERE IS A LIMIT OF 1500 SURNAMES FOR THE PROGRAM, INITIALLY
IN 1991/2 THE DATA SUPPLIED WITH THE GAME HAD 1255 SURNAMES SO YOU HAVE 245
SPARE. IF YOU EVER REACH THAT LIMIT YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO ENTER ANY MORE
NEW SURNAMES. IF THIS DOES HAPPEN AND YOU WANT A FILE WITH A BIGGER SPACE DROP
THE COMPANY A LINE.

AFTER ALL THE PLAYER CHECKS THE COMPUTER THEN LOOKS AT THE EUROPEAN TEAM NAME
FILE. IF ANY CHANGES HAVE OCCURED THAN ALL NECESSARY ALTERATIONS WILL BE SAVED
TO THE PROGRAM DISK. ONCE ALL THAT HAS BEEN DONE THE DATA FILE YOU HAVE
CURRENTLY LOADED WILL BE SAVED WITH ANY NEW FORMATS REQUIRED.

GET INIT
--------
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE MAIN PROGRAM IS VERY COMPLEX PROGRAM AND THIS EDITOR
EVEN MORE SO. WHEN YOU SELECT `GET INIT` THE PROGRAM WILL KNOW YOU INTEND TO
EDIT THE DATA THAT IS USED BY `NEW GAME` TO SET UP ALL THE NEW GAMES.

ie. YOU SWAP HALIFAX FROM DIVISION 4 WITH `ARESNAL` FROM DIVISION 1 FROM THAT
MOMENT ON(AFTER YOU`VE SAVED OF COURSE)WHENEVER A NEW GAME IS SELECTED
`ARSENAL` WILL BE A 4TH DIVISION CLUB AND `HALIFAX` A FIRT DIVISION CLUB.
YOU CAN ALSO MAKE THE COMPUTER THINK THAT `HALIFAX` WON THE F.A CUP AND THEY
QUALIFY FOR THE `CUP WINNERES CUP` EACH TIME A NEW GAME IS CREATED. THE SAME
APPLIES TO THE POLAYERS DETAILS THAT ARE SET UP IN EACH OF THE `94`
PROFESSIONAL LEAGUE TEAMS. IF YOU WANT TO TRANSFER/OR EDIT THE COMPLETE ENGLAND
SQUAD INTO `WEST-HAM` YOU CAN DO THAT.

YOU WILL NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU EDIT `INITIAL DATA` YOU WILL BE RESTRICTED FROM
ENTERING VARIOUS EDITING FEATURES. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO USE WITH
INITIAL DATA. eg NO MANAGERS ARE SET UP WHEN THE INITIAL DATA IS LOADED SO
THERE IS NO POINT ALLOWING YOU TO TRY AND FIDDLE WITH SOMETHING WHICH DOES NOT
EXIST.
WHEN EDITING A SAVED GAME YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO CERTAIN THINGS LIKE
CHANGING THE WINNERS OF CUP COMPETITIONS. ONCE A NEW GAME HAS BEGUN THIS IS
DICTATED BY THE STANDING AT THE END OF THE PREVIOUS SEASON.

LATER WE WILL REFER TO `LOADED` AND `INITIAL` DATA FILES. I AM SURE THAT IT IS
NOW CLEAR WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS. IF YOU DID NOT READ THE `GET INIT` SECTION
THEN PLEASE DO SO BEFORE PROGRESSING WITH THIS MANUAL.

TABLES.
-------
IDENTICAL TO THE GAME - FOOTBALL MASTERS -
(WHICH BY THE WAY I`M TYPING IN NEXT--SCOOTER)

TEAMS.
------
THIS ALLOWS YOU TO SELECT 2 TEAMS TO SWAP POSITIONS. IT IS MAINLY THERE FOR
WHEN THE NEXT SEASON ENDS AND VARIOUS TEAMS ARE RELEGATED AND PROMOTED. BUT IF
YOU WISH TO PLAY WITH A TEAM OUT OF IT`S NORMAL DIVISION THEN THIS IS WHERE YOU
CAN SET IT UP.

WHEN YOU ENTER THE SCREEN YOU ARE PRESENTED WITH THE STANDARD TEAM SELECTION
MENU MENU USED TO SELECT A TEAM WHEN STARTING A NEW GAME. A MESSAGE AT THE TOP
OF THE SCREEN WILL ALWAYS REMIND YOU WHAT STAGE YOU ARE AT ie `PLEASE PICK THE
1ST TEAM TO SWAP` ect...

IF YOU SWAP A NON-LEAGUE TEAM WITH A LEAGUE TEAM THEN THE PLAYERS NAMES AND
DETAILS OF THE LEAGUE TEAM WILL REMAIN BECAUSE NO RECORDS ARE KEPT OF
NON-LEAGUE TEAMS. AFTER EACH SWAP YOU WILL BE ASKED IF YOU WISH TO DO ANOTHER,
ANSWERING `NO` WILL EXIT. YOU WILL NOTICE THAT DIVISIONS 1 AND 2 ARE SORTED
ACCORDING TO THERE FINAL PLACES FROM THE PREVIOUS SEASON. THIS IS IMPORTANT
BECAUSE, `EUROPEAN``UEFA` AND `ZDS` CUP USE THE FINISHING ORDER TO DECIDE
QUALIFICATION TO THOSE COMPETITIONS. DIV 3 AND 4 ARE SORTED ALPHABETICALLY
PURELY FOR EASY REFERENCE,THE ORDER IS UNIMPORTANT.

EUROEDIT.
---------
IN THIS GAME EACH COUNTRY HAS 8 TEAMS REPRESENTING THE BEST OF THAT LEAGUE.WITH
EVERY NEW SEASON THE COMPUTER WILL RANDOMLY SELECT ONE CLUB TO REPRESENT EACH
COUNTRY IN THE EUROPEAN AND CUP WINNERS CUP. 2 ARE THE SELECTED FOR THE `UEFA`
CUP. IF IN A COUPLE OF YEARS NAPOLI ARE A NOTHING TEAM THEN THEY COULD BE
REPLACED BY GAZZA`S LAZIO OR `PLATTS` BARI. THE ORDER THEY ARE SHOWN IS NOT
IMPORTANT.

YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE COUNTRIES SELECT,A BIT LIKE TEAM SELECT,IS IN A FUNNY
ORDER. THE COUNTRIES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN ARE THOSE I CONSIDER TO BE
THE BEST HALF AND ON THE RIGHT THE POOR COUNTRIES. MATCHES AGAINST THE TEAMS
FROM THE COUNTRIES ON THE RIGHT SHOULD BE EASIER.

ONCE YOU PICK A COUNTRY YOU WILL SEE THE TEAMS THAT WE HAVE INCLUDED IN THE
GAME,TO ALTER ANY OF THEM JUST CLICK WITH THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON OVER THE
RELEVANT BOX AND YOU CAN TYPE THE NEW TEAMS NAME. IF YOU ATTEMPT TO LEAVE IUT
BLANK THE OLD TEAM NAME WILL BE RE-INSTATED. DO MAKE SURE YOU TYPE ALL NEW TEAM
NAMES IN `UPPER AND LOWER CASE`.

CUPWINS.
--------
HERE WE CAN ENTER LAST SEASONS CUP WINNERS, AS THE WINNERS OF THE `EUROPEAN
CUP` AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY FOR THAT CUP COMPETITION AGAIN YOU MUST CHANGE IT
HERE,ALSO THE ENGLISH `FA` CUP WINNERS ARE REQUIRED SO THE COMPUTER KNOWS WHICH
ENGLISH CLUB TO ENTER IN THE CUP WINNERS CUP. THE RUNNERS UP DETAILS TOGETHER
WITH THE `LEAGUE` CUP DETAILS ARE THERE JUST IN CASE AN UNUSUAL SEQUENCE OCCURS
AND ABOUT 12 UK CLUBS QUALIFY FOR EUROPE BY WINNING ALL LAST SEASONS CUPS
COMBINED WITH VARIOUS UNLIKELY LEAGUE POSITIONS, FOR A LAUGH, YOU CAN CHANGE IT
SO THAT THIS HAPPENS OR A 4TH DIVISION CLUB QUALIFIES FOR EUROPEAN CUP ect BY
MAKING THEM LAST SEASONS WINNERS OF THAT CUP.

ALL THE CLUBS APPEAR IN ALPHABETIC ORDER FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE. YOU CAN ENTER
NON-ENGLISH TEAMS AS WINNING THE `FA` CUP ECT. IF YOU SO DESIRE. NO CHECKS ARE
MADE BY THE PROGRAM FOR THIS TYPE OF ERROR.

TO CHANGE THE TEAM ENTERED FOR EACH CUP JUST CLICK ON THE FIRST BOX NEXT TO THE
CUP NAME TO JUMP BACK 10 RECORDS, THE 2ND BOX GOES BACK ONE RECORD AND THE
THIRS FORWARD ONE RECORD AND FINALLY THE FOURTH GOES FORWARD TEN RECORDS.
CLICKING RIGHT,AS EVER, EXITS THE SCREEN.

PLAYERS.
--------
WHEN YOU EDIT A TEAM YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO EXIT WITH A COMPLETE SQUAD OF 11
PLAYERS AND ITS PREFERENTIAL TO LEAVE A FORMATION OF `TEAM` STATUS PLAYERS
WHICH WOULD NORMALLY BE PLAYED. SUBSTITUTES SHOULD NOT BE SELECTED BUT IT IS
NOT IMPORTANT. WHEN EDITING THE `INTITIAL` DATA WHATEVER PLAYERS YOU SELECT TO
PLAY WILL ALWAYS APPEAR IN A BRAND NEW TEAM IN A NEW GAME. WHEN THE COMPUTER
SETS UP A NEW GAME IT RANDOMLY REMOVES UP TO 4 PLAYERS WHO ARE SET AS `RESERVE`
IN STATUS FROM EACH TEAM SELECTED BY A MANAGER.

YOU SHOULD NEVER LEAVE A TEAM WITHOUT A GOALKEEPER AND ALWAYS REPLACE ANYONE
YOU DELETE. IF YOU FAIL TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS WHEN YOU TRY TO SAVE THE DATA
IT WILL WARN YOU THAT `GAPS` HAVE BEEN FOUND AND ASK IF YOU WANT THE COMPUTER
TO AUTOMATICALLY CORRECT IT. ANSWERING YES WILL MEAN THAT SOME PLAYERS THAT YOU
ENTER MAY CHANGE POSITION AND ANY GAPS WILL BE FILLED BY RANDOM PLAYERS. MORE
DETAILS ON THIS CAN BE FOUND IN THE `SAVE` EXPLANATION UNDER THE `FILE MENU`.
WHEN EDITING URNAMES YOU SHOULD NTER THEM IN UPPER AND LOWER CASE OTHER WISE
THE SORT WILL NOT BE AS ACCURATE AS IT SHOULD BE.
(ie - Scooter..capital S..lowercase cooter)

EDIT.
-----
IF YOU SIMPLY WISH TO EDIT ANY OF THE PLAYER DETAILS YOU CAN DO IT HERE.IT USES
A SIMILAR SYSTEM TO THE `SELECT` MENU AS YOU SEE FROM THE DIAGRAM BELOW.

                               EDIT TEAM
                               ---------

HIGHLIGHTING A PLAYERS NAME WILL BRING INTO DISPLAY THE PLAYERS ATTRIBUTES..

ie.. E.THORSTVEDT..
POSITION GOALKEEPER
HEIGHT 6.3
AGE 36
GAMES 50/464 (CHANGE CAREER RECORD BY 10,-1,+10 RESPECTIVELY,THE SAME SYSTEM
APPLIES TO CAREER GOALS AND WAGES)ect...
YOU CAN THEN ALTER ANY AOR ALL OF THE PLAYERS ATTRIBUTES IN THIS WAY...

CHANING ANY OF THE REMAINING PLAYERS STATISTICS IS VERY SIMPLE. AS YOU WILL SEE
THE RIGHT MOST PART OF THE SCREEN WHERE ALL THE VALUES ARE SHOWN HAVE 3 EXTRA
VERTICAL BARS RUNNING DOWN FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. THIS SPLITS THE SCREEN INTO 4
SECTIONS. IN MOST CASES CLICKING THE LEFT MOST HALF OF THESE BARS NEXT TO THE
ATTRIBUTE WILL CHANGE IT IN THE DOWNWARD DIRECTION. THE RIGHT WILL INCREASE
SUCH VALUES. WHERE TEXT IS SHOWN AND NO FIGURES ARE SHOWN THE RANGE OF TITLES
WILL BE DISPLAYED THROUGH THERE ENTIREITY AND WRAP AROUND TO THE BEGINNING WHEN
A COMPLETE CIRCUIT HAS BEEN MADE.

CLICKING NEXT TO `OTHER` WHEN A TRAINEE IS POSSIBLE WILL MAKE THAT PLAYER A
TRAINEE OR REMOVE THAT ATTRIBUTE.

IN MOST CASES YOU CAN NOT DIRECTLY CHANGE THE VALUE,THIS IS DETERMINED,THIS IS
DETERMINED MAINLY BY VARIOUS SKILL VALUES AND AGE,HOWEVER, IF YOU BOUGHT A
PLAYER FROM A LOWER DIVISION OR GOT THEM ON A FREE TRANSFER CLICKING HERE WILL
INCREASE THEIR VALUE IF A PARTICULAR FLAG IS SET.

WITH `INITIAL` DATA IT IS ONLY NECESSARY THAT THE `CONTROL` OR `COURAGE` SKILL
IS SET TO ANY NUMBER ABOCE `0`. SO ALL THE PLAYER SKILLS WILL BE SHOWN AS
1,0,0,0,0,,0 RESPECTIVELY. CHANGING THE OTHER SKILLS WILL NOT MAKE ANY
DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER BECAUSE WHEN A NEW GAME IS CREATED ALL SKILL VALUES ARE
RANDOMLY DECIDED AND OVER WRITTEN. SAME GOES FOR THE SPECIAL ABILITY,WAGES,IN
FACT ANYTHING DISPLAYED BELOW THE SKILL FACTORS `EXCEPT` THE STATUS.

DO NOT TRY TO ENTER HUGE FIGURES ON CAREER GOALS OR GAMES RECORDS OR THE NUMBER
OF GAMES/GOALS SCORED. WE HAVE ALLOWED FOR THESE VALUES TO GOTO 2047,1023
RESPECTIVELY. IN A NORMAL GAME THESE VALUES SHOULD NEVER GET ANYWHERE NEAR
THESE LIMITS. IF YOU MAKE THEM TO HIGH FOR A YOUNG PLAYER IT WILL INCREASE THE
LIKELIHOOD THAT CORRUPTION WILL APPEAR LATER IN THE GAME.

IF YOU EVER CLICK ON THE SURNAME OR INITIAL EDIT FEATURE BY MISTAKE(LIKE I DID
MANY TIMES) MAKE SURE THE UNDERLINES ARE CLEAR(BEST WAY TO DO WITH IS PRESS
`ESCAPE`) AND THEN HIT RETRUN. THE SURNAME THAT WAS INITIALLY THERE WILL
-RE-APPEAR AS LONG AS NOTHING NEW WAS ENTERED.

TRANSFER.
---------
IF YOU WISH TO MOVE A PLAYER FROM ONE CLUB TO ANOTHER THEN YOU CAN DO IT HERE,
YOU MUST FIRST MAKE SURE THAT THE CLUB YOU ARE MOVING A PLAYER TO HAS A SPARE
SLOT. ie ONLY HAS 19 PLAYERS BECAUSE IF IT DOESNT THE TRANSFER WILL NOT
PROCEED,YOU WILL BE WARNED THAT THE TRANSFER WAS ABORTED.

DELETE.
-------
TO DELETE A PLAYER USE THIS ITEM. ONCE DELETED. A PLAYER CAN NOT BE RECOVERED.

REPLACE.
--------
THIS IS A BIT LIKE `DELETE` AS YOU CAN COMPLETELY OVER-WRITE ANOTHER PLAYER OR
A BLANK SLOT WITH NEW PLAYERS DETAILS. WHEN USING `INITIAL` DATA THE PROGRAM
WILL ONLY REQUEST ITEMS UP TO CAREER GOALS. WITH `LOADED` DATA YOU WILL BW
ASKED TO IMPUT WILL FINISH AT THE END OF ALL SKILL LEVELS.

AGE ALL.
--------
FOR USE AT THE END OF THE SEASON TO INCREASE ALL PLAYERS BY 1. IF A PLAYER GOES
TO 44 IT WILL WRAP AROUND TO THE AGE OF 17 AND THE CAREER RECORDS ARE SET TO
ZERO.

SHOW GAPS.
----------
THIS ITEM WILL DO A COMPLTETE SEARCH FOR ERRORS IN THE PLAYERS STATISTICS AND
REPORT WHAT TEAMS HAVE AN ERROR AND WHAT SORT OF PROBLEM EXISTS.eg `GILLINGHAM`
HAS A `GOALKEEPER ERROR` OR HALIFAX HAS MORE THAN 11 PLAYERS SELECTED. ect IF
ANYTHING APPEARS HERE WHEN YOU HAVE LOADED DATA THEN YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO
SAVE THE CURRENT GAME WITHOUT MAKING THOSE CHANGES.WITH INITIAL DATA ADDITIONAL
CHECKS ARE MADE AND IT WILL REPORT ANY ADVISEABLE CHANGES YOU SHOULD MAKE IN
THE SET UP OF THAT TEA FOR A SMOOTH RUNNING GAME.

LEVEL.
------
IT IS POSSIBLE TO CHANGE A DIFFICULTY LEVEL OF ANY GAME YOU SAVE.HOWEVER,THE
EFFECT OF DECREASING THE `LEVEL` WILL NOT TAKE FULL EFFECT FOR ABOUT 20
SEASONS.

THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THELEVELS OF DIFFICULTY EFFECT OTHER NON-MANAGED
TEAMS. WHEN YOU SELECT `EASY` THE COMPUTER DOES NOT CHECK ANY OF THESE TEAMS
FOR IMPROVEMENTS. THE TEAM PLAYERS ARE SELECTED ARE FAIRLY STATIC AND NO EFFORT
IS MADE TO MAKE THE COMPUTER CONTROLLED TEAMS BETTER THAN WHAT THE RANDOM
FIGURES CREATED.

ON THE HARD LEVEL ALL COMPUTERS ARE CONSTANTLY OPTIMISED WHEN ANY CHANGE OCCURS
TO THE SQUAD THE BEST POSSIBLE COMBINATION IS SELECTED BY THE COMPUTER ON
`MEDIUM` 1 IN 3 TEAMS ARE OPTIMISED THIS WAY. ON THESE HIGHER 2 LEVELS THERE
ARE OTHER SIDE EFFECTS THAT EFFECT THE QUALITY OF PLAYERS OFFERED ON FREE
TRANSFERS AND LOANS. THE SPEED AT WHICH MANAGER LEVELS ARE CORRECTED IS ALSO
INCREASED.

OPTIONS.
--------
THE SAME AS FOOTBALL MASTERS.WITH `INITIAL` DATA WHATEVER YOU SET THE OPTIONS
TO ARE THOSE THAT WILL DEFAULT IN ANY NEW GAME CREATED AND WHEN THE COMPUTER
INITIAL PRESENTS ITSELF WHEN EVERYTHING IS LOADED. HANDY IF YOU FIND IT
FRUSTATING TO SET 2ND DRIVE OR HARD DISK ON AN AMIGA WHEN A NEW GAME IS CREATED
OR WHEN YOU FIRST LOAD THE PROGRAM. THE SAME APPLIES TO ANY OF THE DEFAULTS
THAT WE HAVE SET ON THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM DISK WHICH DO NOT SUIT YOU.

YOU CAN ALSO ACCESS A COUPLE OF PRINTER OPTIONS BUT ON AMIGA DOING SO MAY
REQUEST THE INSERTION OF THE MAIN DISK EDITOR.

MANAGERS.
---------
ADD - HERE YOU CAN ADD A NEW MANAGER TO A SAVED GAME. IT FOLLOWS THE NORMAL
PROCEDURE FOR ADDING A NEW MANAGER AS IN A NEW GAME ROUTINE.

INFO - THIS SHOWS YOU ALL THE MANAGER DETAILS AND YOU CAN CHANGE THE MONEY AND
LEVEL AND NUMBER OF CONSECUTIVE WINS OR LOSSES BY A MANGER BY CLICKING ON THE
RELEVANT BOXES NEXT TO THE HEADINGS.
LEVEL AND CONSECUTIVE WINS,LOSES WILL GO UP AND DOWN BY 1 AND THE MONEY WILL GO
UP OR DOWN BY 100,000. CLICK THE LEFT SIDE TO REDUCE THE FIGURES AND CONVERSLY
WITH THE RIGHT.

NEW TEAM - IF A MANAGER IN THE GAME WISHES TO MANAGE A DIFFERENT TEAM THEN YOU
CAN SELECT ONE FROM HERE.

REMOVE - IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE A MANAGER FROM A GAME THEN THIS WILL DO IT FOR
YOU. ALL DATA IS LOST AS SOON AS YOU DO THIS TO A MANAGER SO DO MAKE SURE YOU
DELETE THE CORRECT MANAGER. WHEN YOU REMOVE A MANAGER THE COLOURS REPRESENTING
THE REMAINING MANAGERS MAY CHANGE.

AND THATS YER LOT...TYPED BY SCOOTER...ONCE MORE FOR SKID---ROW---No 1
