                           WELCOME TO FIREPOWER !

There are three modes of play in FIREPOWER, you have chosen:

                           JOYSTICK VS.  COMPUTER

In  this  mode of FIREPOWER your adversary is the computer.  One joystick is
required  (in the second joystick port).  In this mode the playing screen is
larger  than  in the two player modes and the STATUS WINDOW is located along
the  right  side.  After you read these instructions you will be prompted to
pick  your  tank.   There  are three tanks to choose from.  Each has its own
characteristics  and  specifications.   Make  your selection by pressing the
joystick  to  the left, right or center.  Press the firebutton while holding
your selection.

                                 GAME PLAY

The  goal  of  FIREPOWER  is  to find the enemy's flag and return it to your
base.   The  game  begins  with  your tank sitting in a garage at your base.
Drive  forward  and your tank will come out of the garage and become visible
(refer  to  JOYSTICK  CONTROLS  at the end of this document).  If you remain
stationary  at  any  location  for  too  long, the enemy will locate you and
attack  with  helicopters.   It  is possible for your tank to get stuck when
driving  through rubble or other projections from the ground.  Moving in the
reverse direction will usually solve this problem.

                             THE STATUS WINDOW

SCORE:  You  gain  points  by  destroying  your enemy's helicopters, men and
        fortresses.   You  also  gain  points  by  saving  your  own men and
        returning them to a First-Aid Station (marked with a red cross).

MEN:    The  number in this window indicates the number of your men you have
        on  board your tank.  You pick up your men by stopping when they run
        up  to  your  tank.   If the tank is moving, the men will be killed.
        After you have taken on the maximum amount of men, your own men will
        not attempt to run up to your tank.  You unload your men by stopping
        on the right hand side of the First-Aid Station.  Your men will then
        exit the tank and run into the Station.

FUEL:   Each tank starts with a full load of fuel.  The fuel load is consumed    
        as  the tank drives from place to place.  Additional fuel can be
        acquired  by  finding  and  destroying  your enemy's fuel depots, (A
        large  dome  connected  diagonally  to  a  smaller  dome),  also  by
        returning  to  your garage.  If your tank exhausts its fuel, it will
        explode  to  prevent  the  enemy  from taking abandoned tanks on the
        battlefield.

LIVES:  You  start with 5 lives, new lives can be obtained by rescuing 15 of
        your men.

RADAR:  In the center you will see a light brown dot representing your tank.
        All  enemy  vehicles  including helicopters and the enemy's flag are
        represented by light green dots.

                              JOYSTICK CONTROL

The  joystick  controls in FIREPOWER are absolute, so that if you are facing
up  and  you would like to drive to the left, all you need to do is push the
joystick  to  the  left  and  hold it there.  If you are facing left and you
would  like  to  back  up,  press  the  joystick  to the right (the opposite
direction).

                                 SOME HINTS

Keep  track  of  the direction of your home base, as you will have to return
there  with  your enemy's flag in order to win the game.  The gun turrets on
both  fortresses  only  have  eight positions.  The turrets can fire at a 45
degree  angle,  but  not  at  25  degrees.   Thus  they  are vulnerable to a
well-positioned  attack.   In  addition,  the  turrets are programmed not to
shoot in any direction that might damage other portions of its own fortress.
Thus,  if  your  tank is well positioned, the enemy turrets will not fire on
you  when  your  tank is in close proximity to other vulnerable parts of its
fortress.

Good luck, and capture the Flag!


                             JOYSTICK VS. MODEM

     In  this  mode  of  FIREPOWER your adversary is an other person using a
different  computer connected by a modem, either over the telephone line, or
in  the  same room.  One joystick is required (in the second joystick port).
The  mouse  is used to make special modem selections.  The playing screen is
divided  into two parts, one side for your viewing screen and the other side
for  the  modem  screen and controls.  The status window is at the bottom of
the screen.  In this mode the tank has been selected for you.

MEN:    The number  in this window indicates the number of your men you have
        aboard your tank.  You pick up your men by stopping when they run up
        to your tank.  If the tank is moving, the men will be killed.  After
        you  have  taken on the maximum amount of men, your own men will not
        attempt  to run up to your tank.  You unload your men by stopping in
        front of a First-Aid Station, on the right hand side.  Your men will
        then exit the tank and run into the Station.

MINES:  Mines  are  symbolized  on  the STATUS WINDOW  by a gray disk with a
        slash.   The  number indicates the number of mines remaining in your
        tank.   By bringing the tank to a complete stop, then simultaneously
        pressing  the fire button and pulling down on the joystick mines are
        dropped.   Beware,  the  mines  are proximity mines and will explode
        when  anything gets near them, including your tank.  You can acquire
        1 extra mine for each 5 of your own men you rescue.

FUEL:   Each tank starts with a full load of fuel. The fuel load is consumed
        as  the  tank  drives  from  place to place.  Additional fuel can be
        acquired  by  finding  and  destroying  your enemy's fuel depots, (A

        will explode to prevent the enemy from taking abandoned tanks on the
        battlefield.

RADAR:  Your radar is large black square in your status window.  You are the
        dot in the center, your enemy will show up as dots relatively around
        you.

                             JOYSTICK CONTROLS

     The  joystick  controls  in  FIREPOWER are absolute, so that if you are
facing  up  and  you  would like to drive to the left, all you need to do is
push the joystick to the left and hold it there.  If you are facing left and
you  would  like  to  back up, press the joystick to the right (the opposite
direction).

                           MODEM CONTROLS AND USE

      The  modem  mode  is  designed  for  use with Hayes 1200 and 2400 baud
compatible modems only, and is not guaranteed to work with modems other than
Hayes  compatible.   After you have finished reading these instructions, the
modem  mode  game  will automatically load in.  The left side of your screen
will  be  set  up for the tank, the right side is a simple terminal.  On the
bottom  of  the  right  side  is the control panel.  On it are the following
controls;

CALL:   Press  this  button after typing in the telephone number you want to
        call in the box marked with a "#".

START:  After  connection  has  been made, you will be in a simple terminal,
        thus,  may  talk using the keyboard if you like.  Pressing the START
        button  will  start the game on both sides.  The person that presses
        the  start  button  first takes control of the left Green tank.  The
        modem  screen will display the message "* STARTING GAME *", the game
        will  begin.   In  the  case that the other person presses the start
        button  first,  your  screen  will  reconfigure,  so that the simple
        terminal  is  on  the left and the game screen in on the right.  You
        may type messages to your friend WHILE playing the game.

H-UP:   This button will send the ATH0 command to your modem to hangup.

   It  is suggested that you play the one or two player games first, so that
you  get  a  feeling  for  FIREPOWER.   Consult  your Modems user manual for
detailed operations of the modem.


                                 SOME HINTS

     Be  careful that you do not explode your own mines while dropping them.
Keep  track  of the direction of your home your enemy's flag in order to win
the  game.   The  gun  turrets on both fortresses only have eight positions.
The turrets can fire at a 45 degree angle, but not at 25 degrees.  Thus they
are  vulnerable  to  an  odd  angled  attack.   In addition, the turrets are
programmed not to shoot in any direction that might damage other portions of
its  own fortress.  Thus, if your tank is well positioned, the enemy turrets
will  not  fire  on  you  when  your  tank  is  in  close proximity to other
vulnerable parts of its own fortress.
