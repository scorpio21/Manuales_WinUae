of the Gulf battle zone. Your mission is to seek out and destroy all
enemy installations, frigates, aircraft, tanks and gun emplacements.
 
As well as oil-cooled machines fire, the F1 Tornado is also well armed 
with Target Allocating Missiles capable of destroying sea level enemy
installations.
 
All weapon systems are controlled via the Head Up Computer Display.
 
Prepare for battle, you have only three chances to complete your 
mission ... Best of Luck ....
 
OPTIONS
~~~~~~~
The F1 Tornado is controlled via a joystick connected to the relevant
port on the 16bit machine.
 
The playing area is shown at the top of the screen, with the following 
pieces of information shown on the control panel from left to right at
the bottom of the screen:
 
SCORE: Gives details of current mission hit rate.
 
PLANE ICONS: Shows the number of aircraft remaining for the current 
mission.
 
DAMAGE METER: Direct hits inflict damage on the F1 Tornado. Maximum
damage results in loss of aircraft.
 
AIR SPEED INDICATOR: Shows present speed of aircraft.
 
RADAR SCREEN: Incoming enemy are logged on radar before they appear
in flight path. The Head Up computer uses this information to identify
possible hostile activities and targets.
 
HEIGHT: Gives height of F1 Tornado above sea level.
 
FUEL: Fuel remaining in main tanks is displayed for pilot information. 
 
 
FIGHTING PROCEDURE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main square cross hatches identifies the possible targets within the 
present range. The Head Up Computer automatically locates enemy aircraft
and locks on target, which is indicated by a square appearing on the
screen beside the selected aircraft. Pressing FIRE initiates the machine
guns to destroy the selected target.
 
Ground installations and helicopters are selected automatically by the
computer of Target Allocating Missile attack. A Head up Computer 
"lock on" is indicated by a circle appearing on the target. Pressing and
holding down the fire button initiates a Missile launch. As Target 
Allocating Missiles have their own engine propulsion units, fuel is 
lost when a missile is despatched.
 
During normal mission activities, icons appear which are collected by 
flying through the symbol as it passes through the F1's airspace:
 
X = repairs damage to the F1 Tornado.
F = re-fuels the aircraft's tanks.
 
Extra thrust can be developed from the engines by pressing the Space
Bar. This extra thrust is extremely costly in terms of fuel and should
only be used sparingly.
