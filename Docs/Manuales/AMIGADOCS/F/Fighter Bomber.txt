                                CREW BRIEFING
				-------------

INTRODUCTION
------------
An expectant hush fell over the briefing room as the powerful figure of
Major Lance 'Deadeye' Mulcahy took the stage. Glancing around the unusually
crowded room, he leant his enourmous, battle-scarred frame against the edge
of his lectern. With a tap on the microphone, and a nod to his staff
officers standing at the back, he began.

"Don't worry fellas, I ain't gonna sing." How many times had he said that,
he wondered, and at how many briefings. The War was a long time ago, but he
felt every minute of it.

"Ladies and gentlemen, and you flyers at the back there, welcome to
Ellsworth Air Force Base." A nod to his left, and a series of slides began
to appear on the screen behind him.

"This is the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing Competition; ten years
ago the awesome collection of firepower out there on the tarmac would have
been an unthinkable sight on a US Base. But in these days of detente, and
goodwill to all men, even the Russkies," he paused for the laugh befitting
a man of his seniority, "ha ha - only kidding comrades; where was I? Oh
yeah - in these days when the cold war is becoming a fadding memory, we of
all the free world can welcome pilots from all over to join and test their
capabilities against the best competition a defence budget can buy. This
doesn't mean we're gonna let them out again, though, eh boys? Ha ha."

The Soviet contingent merely smiled, content in the knowledge that in a few
hours they were going to get the chance to wipe the smile of this ageing
ace's face for good. The Major continued.

"Behind me you see an aviation legend - The Lancaster Bomber. Without that
baby the map of Europe might well be very different today. An enormous
beast it could deliver a payload of staggering weight and destructive
power. But it had one major problem - it was just too darn BIG. Little
Messerschmitts used to creep up behind it and blow it out of the air. So we
had to guard it, with other fighters like the Spitfire here, and the
Hurricane. This was the same with all those big guys - the Wellington, the
Stirling, our own B-17 and so on. Near the end of the war it became obvious
that what we wanted was both, all in one plane. So we had the Mosquito, and
later the F-100, and the British Lightning, that began to combine the speed
of a fighter with the pay-load capacity of a bomber, and all in a much
smaller package." Deadeye paused, for dramatic effect, and to smooth his
moustache for the ladies. Both worked - the audience was his.

"And now we have the bunch of death machines you see outside - the ultimate
in flying destruction, Multi-Role Combat Aircraft from all over, from the
Soviets' MiG 27 to our own F-15. And in a few hours you will see just what
those babies can do. They will fly against each other in mock battle, they
will take out strategic sited around this and neighbouring states - without
any warheads, I can assure you," he added for the benifit of a few
front-benchers who had begun to look worried about the idea of armed MiG
27s flying over the Mid-West.

"Oh, I don't know, Chief," came a voice from the back. "There's a few parts
of Montana I guess we wouldn't miss."

"OK Kowalski, very funny - now button it, or you're peeling potatos the
next week." One thing Major Mulcahy hated worse than a smart-ass flyer, it
was one who got a bigger laugh than himself. But he recovered.

"So, fellow officers, welcome guests, and members of the press, prepare
yourself for a display of combat flying that'll knock your socks off, and
may the best man win," he said, peering at the Curtis E LeMay Trophy that
stood in pride of place, waiting to be won by the top team of the day.

"As long as it's us, of course," he whispered quietly to himself.

Sitting at the rear of the briefing room was a lone pilot with a hard task
ahead of him. He knew the competition - every good pilot did - but this
didn't make it any easier. He had to prove to his superiors that he was the
best, that he was ready to go up against anything the enemy could throw at
him and come out on top. And this trophy was the best way to do it.

He had already had a look around the area before landing his jet, checking
out the four US states that would be the arena for this mock battle. Some
of the most spectacular scenery in the west was here - Mount Rushmore, the
famous monument to the four historic presidents, Devils Tower national
monument (how many times had he seen 'Close Encounters' - almost as many as
'Top Gun' he guessed), and the plains and towns and cities of the American
Mid-West, heartland to the world's leading nation.

He knew the mission he must accomplish in order to score maximum points, to
gain the title of Ace of Aces, and he knew it was goung to be tough - but
then, no-one ever said it war was easy.

In FIGHTER BOMBER, you are that pilot. But first you must ready yourself
with a series of training missions. Sure, you've flown those runs a hundred
times, but never was the prize this big, never was the competition that
hot.

You have your pick of the best of the world's technology, and also the
choice of combat enemies. This doesn't make life any easier, though - any
one of the pilots gathered at Ellsworth could take this trophy.

It's your job to see that they don't.

                          THE CURTIS E LeMAY TROPHY
			  -------------------------

The Curtis E LeMay Bombing Trophy, the prize every aspiring Bomber Squadron
hopes to gain, presented in honour of the retired Commander in Chief of
SAC.

Its first victor, in 1958, was the 92nd Bomb Wing of the USAF in a B-52D.
From 1977 to 1982, the USAF FB-11A stood victorious, while in more recent
years the trophy has been snatched twice by the British 617 and 27
Squadrons, both using the Tornado.

                               GETTING STARTED
			       ---------------

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------
Due to the depth and compexity of FIGHTER BOMBER, some versions may not
contain all of the features mentioned in this playing manual. We have
attempted to extract the maximum from each computer format but memory
limitations, graphics capabilty and data storage systems prevent us from
incorporating some of the more exotic features in certain formats.

We sincerely hope this in no way spoils your enjoyment of this product.

CONTROLS
--------
Please see the accompany material for keys and controls (SEE END OF DOC).

                             AIRCRAFT SELECTION
			     ------------------

FIGHTER BOMBER features seven different aircraft for you to fly. These are:

	The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Strike Eagle - USA
	The McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom	- USA
	The General Dynamics F-111F Aardavrk	- USA
	The Panavia Tornado IDS			- Britain
	The Panavia Tornado IDS			- Luftwaffe
	The Saab AJ37 Viggen			- Sweden
	The MIG-27 Flogger D			- USSR

Information on the ability of each of these machines can be found in the
Aircraft Data section of this manual.

These planes are displayed for selection as soon as the game is loaded. A
2D and 3D representation of the various aircraft in FIGHTER BOMBER are
available to you along with historical and technical information. We
suggest you take advantage of this information as later missions will
expect you to recognise instantly the kind of aircraft you are engaging.

Selection is made by pointing to the various control boxes on the selection
screen and 'clicking' on the appropriate box. When you have selected the
aircraft you intend to fly, click on 'SELECT'.

ENEMY AIRCRAFT SELECTION
------------------------
Uniquely, FIGHTER BOMBER allows you to select the kind of enemy aircraft
you will encounter in your various missions. Each enemy aircraft will
respond to you differently and you will soon learn which will present the
greatest challenge in the various theatres of engagement.

Again, we recommend that you study the 3D images of these aircraft.

FIGHTER BOMBER features seven different aircraft for you to fly against.
These are:

	The F-14 Tom-Cat	- USA
	The F-16 Falcon		- USA
	The F-5 Tiger		- USA
	The Mig-29 Fulcrum	- USSR
	The Su-27 Flanker	- USSR

	The Mig-31 Foxhound	- USSR

As before, make your selection by clicking on the appropriate icons.

PILOT'S LOG
-----------
Every time you fly, your progress is recorded and filed against your flight
log.

MISSION SELECTION
-----------------
For your first flight in FIGHTER BOMBER, we recommend that you select FREE
FLIGHT. This will allow you to familiarise yourself with the flight
controls and become proficient at some of the more complex manoeuvers you
will need to master.

FREE FLIGHT differs to every other stage of FIGHTER BOMBER in that it is
the only option that allows you to choose where you start from.

The start-point options available to you are as follows:

	IN HANGAR	Allows you to practice taxiing
	ON RUNWAY	Starts you on the runway at Ellsworth
	AT 30,000 FT	Allows practice of high altitude manoeuvers
	ABOVE BRIDGE	Allows you to practice bombing runs
	OVER CITY	Allows you to fly low over Rapid City
	BEHIND TANKER	Allows practice of mid-air refuelling
	LINED UP	Allows practice of landing procedure

Once you are accustomed to your controls and environemnt, then you can
attempt the first of the qualification missions.

                                THE MISSIONS
				------------

These missions are available in succession of competion.

COVERT		The covert mission include

		OPERATION 'SLEEPER'
		OPERATION 'FARM HOUSE'
		OPERATION 'BRIDGE END'

		OPERATION 'FINAL FRONTIER'

Once a mission has been completed, the mission briefing screen will appear
allowing you to examine your route flown and your mission report.

To continue onto the next mission, click on 'END', then select NEW MISSION
from the options given. The next mission will then be made available on the
missions menu.

                              MISSION BRIEFING
			      ----------------

This is where the actual missions will be presented to you in visual form.
You must fly each mission in order to progress through the game.

                               MISSION DESIGN
			       --------------

When (and if) you have managed to complete all of the missions in FIGHTER
BOMBER, the game certainly does not end there. FIGHTER BOMBER is unique in
that it allows you to design your own missions and exchange them with other
FIGHTER BOMBER pilots.

NOTE: While using the mission designer all operations that require on map
positioning are performed by pointing the cursor at the desired place and
selecting.

SELECT AIR BASE
---------------
Initially you will be required to select your home base. Do this by
pointing to one of the flashing diamonds and selecting. It is not
compulsory that you return to this base. You may, if you require, start at
one base, fly your mission, then land at any friendly base available,
whether military or civilian.

ADD TARGET
----------
Selecting this option will open a second window requesting you to choose
the kind of target you would like to place: ground forces, SAM site,
industrial, etc. Select your preference then position the appropriate
target.

REFUEL POINT
------------
Once you have selected where to have the refuelling tanker, a small
Altitude Selector window will open. Choose the refuelling altitude by
clicking on the UP or DOWN arrows. Select when ready.

DELECT LAST
-----------
Selecting this option will INSTANTLY remove the last target positioned.

RECONNAISSANCE
--------------
Selecting this option opens up a second window that allows you to view
target areas in order to aid area target identification. Target information
can also be obtained.

MISSION TEXT
------------
This is your opportunity to describe the mission designed. A one-page text
editor has been incorporated for this purpose.

DISK MENU
---------
This allows you to SAVE or LOAD a mission. Scroll through your missions
using the arrows.

TEST MISSION
------------
This allows you to test the mission you are designing. You fly the mission
as normal, firstly, ARMING your jet before flying the mission, then finally
entering the DE-BRIEFING section before being put into the designer.

END
---
This leaves the mission designer.

                                   ARMING
				   ------

After the mission had been presented to you, you must decide on the most
appropriate weaponry for you to carry into battle.

Weapons are selected by clicking over the weapon icon and dragging it to
the under-side view of the aircraft. Some of the weapons, e.g. the Maverick
AGM-65, can be carried in multiple ejector racks. Simplay drop the same
weapon twice at any of the available (flashing) pylons.

Alternatively, you can choose to autoarm your machine with a preset list of
weapons, that particularly suit your craft, simply by clicking the AUTO ARM
icon.

The weapons available to you are as follows:

1. 23/27 mm Cannon
------------------
Used for close-in combat, many aircraft of the late 60's and early 70's
were built without a cannon. The philosophy behind this being that with the
advent of sophisticated guided missiles, an aircraft would never get within
cannon range. The experience of the Vietnam war proved the fallacy of this.
Most modern FIGHTER BOMBERS are equipped with a cannon as either an
internal permanent fixture or as a centrally mounted pod, the latter option
taking up at least one external stores pylon.

2. Air-to-air missile (AAM)
---------------------------
Sidewinder - AIM-9L Bofors-Rb24 AA-8 Aphid
Type:		Close/Medium range AAM
Weight:		195 lb (88.5 kg)
Performance:	Accelerating to Mach 2.5 in 2.2 seconds
Range:		11 miles 17.7 km
Mission Time:	60 seconds max.
Warhead:	25 lb 11.4 kg blast/fragmentation with active laser IR
		proximity fuse.

The sidewinder AIM-9L is an air-to-air missile guided to the target by
locking on to the heat emitted by the enemies' jet pipes. Target
acquisition is achieved by activating the missile's seeker head and
listening to the missile through the pilot's headset. As the missile locks
on to the target, its distinctive growl rises in intensity to a singing
crescendo until the pilot lets the missile go. After release the missile
will follow the IR source. As it closes with the target, its laser
proximity fuse senses when it is close enough for the kill and explodes,
sending out hundreds of preformed rods into the enemy.

3. Air-to-surface missile (ASM)
-------------------------------
AGM-65A Maverick Bofors Rb-75
Type:		Air-to-surface missile
Weight:		635 lb (288 kg)
Performance:	Classified
Range:		Up to 25 miles after Mach 1.2 release at altitude
Warhead:	282 lb steel cased blast/fragmentation or 83 lb shaped
		charge.

The AGM-65 is a video-guided missile. The pilot selects the missile causing
its gyro to spin up to speed and light up a weapon ready indicator on his
panel. The image from the video camera situated in the nose of the missile
is swung round on to the target and the pilot engages lock mode. He then
uses either the video-display or his head-up gun sight to lock on to the
target and releases the weapon. After release the weapon remains locked on
to the video image of the target and intelligently tracks to it. In the
event of the image being interrupted the missile will follow its last known
trajectory.

4. AGM-88A HARM
---------------
Type:		Anti Radiation Missile
Weight:		796 lb (361 kg)
Performance:	Speed over Mach 2
Range:		About 11 miles 
Warhead:	Fragmentation with proximity fuse system.

The AGM-88A is a new kind of missile which has developed as a direct result
of the ever-increasing technology used in modern warfare. This missile uses
the very radiation emitted by a defending aircraft ECM pod to home in on.
The pilot, suspecting that an enemy is in the vicinity, can fire the
missile 'blind'. If the enemy emits and kind of electromagnetic radiation
the missile will immediately lock on.

5. Mk 13/18 Paveway II LGB
--------------------------
Type:		Laser-guided un-powered bomb
Weight:		1,030 lb (467.6 kg)
Performance:	Free fall
Range:		Dependent on release height
Warhead:	High explosive

The Laser Guided Bomb is a system designed to improve the accuracy of
conventional bombs. The target is illuminated with laser light, either by
the launch aircraft, a second aircraft, or even ground troops. A ring of
sensors around the nose of the bomb detect the reflected laser light and by
passing signals to the movable control surfaces of the bomb, keep it
aligned with the target. The system is cheap, effective and requires no
modification to the aircraft.

6. General Purpose Bomb
-----------------------
Type:		Un-guided un-powered bomb
Weight:		1,000 lb (454.6 kg)
Performance:	Free fall
Range:		Dependant on release height
Warhead:	High explosive

The accuracy of the General Purpose Free Fall Bomb has in the past been
solely dependent on the skill of the crew. With today's modern sircraft,
the computer takes over the release of the bomb calculating velocity,
altitude, wind-shear, etc. The pilot is told when to press the button and
the computer does the rest.

7. JP233 MWI - Airfield Denial Weapon
-------------------------------------
Type:		Submunition dispenser
Weight:		11,200 lb (5,080 kg) - FUCKING HEAVY MAN
Payload:	Various bomblets

JP233 is a series of submunition dispensers for parachute retarded
payloads which include pavement cratering bomblets and anti-personnel mines
with or without delay action fuses. Its main use is in denying enemy forces
of airfield access and hampering of subsequent repairs.

8. BOZ-100 ECM Pod - Chaff and IR Decoy dispenser
-------------------------------------------------
Type:		Electronic Counter Measure Decoy dispenser
Weight:		1,000 lb (454 kg)

The BOZ-100 ECM pod is slung from beneath one of the outer wing pylons and
enables the aircraft under attack from electronically-guided weapons to
defend itself. It does this in two ways. An IR guided missile locks on to
the strongest heat source it can fing (this is usually the enemy jet pipe)
and follows it to detonation. If an alternative (and more intense) heat
source, an IR decoy, is ejected from the rear of the aircraft it is
possible to fool the missile into following that.

A radar guided missile is locked on to the radar return of the enemy
aircraft. The Chaff dispenser eject a cloud of fine strips of meatl foil
into the air behind the defending aircraft creating a huge (and to the
incoming missile confusing) radar target.

9. Durandal - Runway Penetration Bomb
-------------------------------------
Type: 		Airfield denial
Weight:		430 lb (195 kg)
Warhead:	High explosive

The Durandal is a simple but effective method of cratering and thus
rendering useless enemy paved landing strips.

The weapon is released as low as 185 ft and is immediately retarded by a
parachute, causing it to point nose down. The rocket motor then fires the
warhead deep into the concrete, creating a crater of up to 2,000 sq ft.
(OUCH)

10. Rocket Pods
---------------
This weapon has been the mainstay of the ground attack arsenal for many
years. The pilot aims the aircraft at the ground target and fires a salvo
of high explosive shells direct in the line of sight. The weapon is
particularly effective against mobile armour.

11. ALARM - Air Launched anti-radiation missile
-----------------------------------------------
Weight:		390 lb
Performance:	Not released
Range:		Not released
Propulsion:	Two stage solid propellant motor
Warhead:	Not released

Alarm is the British equivalent of the US HARM missile (AND SO WORKS !!).
It is fired in the general direction of enemy position (e.g. SAM sites) and
climbs to around 40,000 ft, It then pitches nose down and falls slowly,
under a drogue parachute, while searchine for hostile radio/radar emmiters.
As soon as the enemy 'switches back on', the missile locks on to the target
and fires its secondary motor, homing in on the enemy position.

THE McDONNELL DOUGLAS F-15E STRIKE EAGLE - USA
---------------------------------------------
The United States Air Force
---------------------------
The McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle
---------------------------------------
Now in its second decade of service, the McDonnell Douglas F-15 is
undergoing a major development program adapting this highly versatile
fighter into an all-weather interdictor and strike aircraft to be
designated the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle.

It is a two-man aircraft, the pilot employing a wide angle HUD fed with IR
sensor information while the 'GIB' (Guy In Back!) will have head down CRTs
for radar, FLIR, digital map and threat warning displays.

By the clever use of conformal fuel packs known as FAST packs, the F-15E
can carry an extra 8,820 lb of fuel, enabling it to carry up to 24,250 lb
of ordanace on under wing plyons - a combat load comparable to that of the
F-111.

The F-15E
---------
Maximum Take Off Load		24,250 lb (11,000 kg)
Maximum Speed at altitude	Mach 2.5
Maximum Speed at sea Level	Undisclosed
Service Ceiling			65,000 ft
Maximum Range			3,450 miles (5,560 km)
Combat Radius (Full Load)	1,480 km
Take Off Distance (Clean)	900 ft

THE McDONNELL DOUGLAS F-4E PHANTOM - USA
----------------------------------------
The United States Air Force
---------------------------
The McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom
----------------------------------
The F-4E Phantom will surely rank as one of the classic fighters of all
time and is included in this simulator as a tribute to the aircraft which
above all others will always be remembered for getting the job done.

It is estimated that of the 5,173 Phantoms built, some 1,500 will still be
in use by the year 2000.

The F-4E, a result of the Vietnam experience, is the strike variant of the
aircraft and even by today's high-tech standards remains a formidable
weapon. Incorporating an M-61 gun under the nose, an extra fuel cell,
advanced avionics and fire control and new engines, the F-4E has been
updated to the point that it still maintains a position of importance in
many of the world air forces.

The F-4E
--------
Maximum Take Off Load		16,000 lb (7,257 kg)
Maximum Speed at altitude	Mach 2.27
Maximum Speed at sea Level	Mach 1.9 (910 mph), 464 km/h
Service Ceiling			60,000 ft
Maximum Range			2,660 miles (4,281 km)
Take Off Distance (Clean)	3,000 ft (914 m)

THE GENERAL DYNAMICS F-111F AARDVARK - USA
------------------------------------------
The United States Air Force
---------------------------
The General Dynamics F-111F
---------------------------
The United States Air Force is equipped with an aeroplane which when in
development was almost cancelled due to air-frame and avionic problems. The
same aircraft carried out the recent bombing of Libya and is now considered
to be one of the finest long range bombers. The aeroplane is the General
Dynamics F-111F.

The F-111F is powered by two Pratt and Whitney TF30-P-100 engines
developing 25,000 lb of thrust and making it by far the most powerful
version of the aircraft.

Its maximum speed (clean) at 35,000 ft is Mach 2.2 and is capable of
carrying a formidable punch in the form of 4,000 lb. Carried internally or
a 20mm M-61 multi-barrel gun. It also has six missile pylons.

The F-111F
----------
Maximum Take Off Load		31,500 lb (14,288 kg)
Maximum Speed at altitude	Mach 2.2
Maximum Speed at sea Level	Mach 1.2 (293 kts), 1,469 km/h, 913 mph
Service Ceiling			60,000 ft
Maximum Range			4,707 miles (2,925 km)
Combat Radius (Full Load)	1,480 km
Take Off Distance (Clean)	Under 3,000 ft

THE PANAVIA TORNADO IDS - BRITIAN
---------------------------------
The Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe
-------------------------------------
The Panavia Tornado IDS (Interdictor Strike Variant)
----------------------------------------------------
The British Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe are equipped with what
is generally acknowledged as the world's most effective Interdictor Strike
Aircraft - the Tornado IDS.

The most remarkable thing about the Tornado is its ability to fly at
tree-top height at 550 knots and deliver on to its target a laser-guided
bomb with virtual certainty of a hit. It does this thanks to a combination
of superb air-frame and power unit coupled with what is arguably the
world's most advanced avionics.

The 'hands off' flying of the Tornado is achieved by the use of a 'Terrain
Following Radar (TFR)' which scans an area in front of the aircraft
detecting any obstructions and flying the aircraft over them. It is
effective to an altitude of 50 ft!

The other remarkable aspect of the Tornado is its navigational system which
is capable of delivering the aircraft to within 20 ft of its target at a
range of several hundred miles without the pilot ever touching the control
column. It does this without any incoming information via satellite, ground
station, etc.

The Tornado-IDS
---------------
Maximum Take Off Load		19.840 lb (9,000 kg)
Maximum Speed at altitude	Mach 2.2
Maximum Speed at sea Level	Mach 1.2 (800 kts), 482 km/h, 921 mph
Service Ceiling			50,000 ft plus (15,240 m plus)
Maximum Range			Undisclosed
Combat Radius (Full Load)	863 miles (1,390 km)
Climb to 30,000 ft		Under 2 minutes
g limit				+ 7.5
Take Off Distance 		12,900 ft

THE SAAB AJ37 VIGGEN - SWEDEN
-----------------------------
The Royal Swedish Air Force
---------------------------
The SAAB AJ37 Viggen
--------------------
The Royal Swedish Air Board set the aviation world alight when plans for
the 'System 37' were announced in the early 1960's.

It was to be a standardised weapon system integrating many aspects of air
defence and attack. The central feature of 'System 37' was a manned
supersonic aircraft - the Saab Viggen.

The aeroplane is uniquely configured with a fixed 400 sq ft wing preceded
by a canard foreplane which gives the aircraft an excellent STOL (short
take off and landing) and turn radius.

The power plant of the Saab is a licence-built Pratt and Whitney two-shaft
turbo fan developing 25,970 ln of thrust enabling the aircraft to reach
32,800 ft from a standing start in just 100 seconds. As a weapon platform,
the Viggen is outstanding with a huge variety of stores capability.

The Saab Viggen AJ37
--------------------
Maximum Take Off Load		6,000 kg (External)
Maximum Speed at altitude	Mach 2 (1,146 kts), 2,124 km/h, 1,320 mph
Maximum Speed at sea Level	Mach 1.2 (793 kts), 1,470 km/h, 914 mph
Service Ceiling			60,000 ft (18,290 m)
Maximum Range			Undisclosed
Combat Radius (Full Load)	296 miles (276 km)
Climb to 32,810 ft		1 minute, 40 seconds
g limit				+ 12 (ultimate)
Take Off Distance (Clean)	400 m (1,312 ft)

THE MiG-27 FLOGGER-D - USSR
---------------------------
The Soviet Air Force
--------------------
The Mikoyan/Gurevich MiG-27 (Flogger D)
---------------------------------------
Entering service pre-1974 this single-seat tactical attack aircraft with
secondary reconnaissance capability is powered by a single Turmansky R-29B
afterburning turbofan rated at 17,640 lb dry and 25,350 lb with full
afterburner.

Generally derided by some aircraft writers as being under-powered and of
poor manoeuvrability, the Flogger shows neither of these failings when
observed at close hand. Its characteristic sloping nose has attracted the
nick-name 'Ducknose' amongst its pilots. The reason for the slope is to
allow the pilot maximum view of the ground in very low-level surface attack
missions.

Contained within the nose are the advanced (and secret) avionics. The
aircraft probably has some sort of TRF along with Interal Navigation System
which gives it a similar capability to Britian's Tornado. It is unlikely

dates back to the late 1960's. Upgraded avionics, however, will almost
certainly have been installed and this single seat aircraft would not be
taken lightly by any adversary.
