                        Full Metal Planete

Password stuff:
  There are several icons that you will need to recognize.  I will
describe what they look like since I can't draw the pictures. 
They are as follows:

	MEDAL - Looks like a three-banded ribbon w/ a star-shaped medal
                at the bottom.	
	BADGE - A rectangular badge w/ diagonal stipes about 1/3 of the
                way down.
	REAGLE - An eagle looking right w/ its wing folded across its
                 breast.
	LIGHTNING - A triangle w/ a crooked ray shooting through it.
                    (Okay, the name is not the greatest...)
	PLANET - A circle surrounded by 8 crosses.
	3STAREAGLE - An eagle atop three stars.

WHEW!

	The game is a simple one: land on this planet, pick up all the ore
that you can and lift off before the tides rise to cover the planet's
surface.  You will have up to three opponents trying to take your ore
and/or blast your equipment to dust.  The computer cheats pretty well...
	During each turn you have a number of action points with which you
can do the folowing:
  o	move transports to gather ore and bring it back to the freighter
  o	create new equipment or vehicles w/ the Weather Hen
  o	weaken the opposition using your destroyers to eliminate or
        capture opposing units
  o	threaten or hinder opposition movement by occupying strategic
        locations on the battlefield
  o	capture opposing Freighters, to increase your own unit numbers,
        gaining additional action points
  o 	blast off at the end of the game (turn 25) w/ as many loaded
        Freighters as you can
	
	The terrain types:
  o	land hexes are accesible only to land vehicles
  o	mountain hexes are accessible to all land vehicles except the Heap
  o 	sea hexes are accessible only towater vehicles;  land vehicles may
        also cross water if a Pontoon bridge has been placed in that hex

	The equipment:
  o	Barge - can carry 4 ore, 4 tanks, a Heap, a Pontoon, a Crab, a
                Weather Hen
  o     Crab  - can carry 2 ore, 2 tanks, a Heap, a Pontoon
  o     Tanks - can fire at range 2, range 3 from a mountain hex
  o	Heap  - can fire at range 3
  o     Attack Boat - can fire at range 2
  o     Freighter's Turrets - can fire at range 2
  o  	Weather Hen - can forecast tides (press M), can convert one ore to
	              a tank, a pontoon or a crab
  o	Pontoon - covers sea hexes and allows land vehicles to cross

	Destroying Enemy Units:
  	A unit is eliminated when it is hit by simultaneous fire from two
Destroyers belonging to the same player.  A Destroyer can fire twice per
turn.  Ore can be destroyed.  Look at the fire zones. 

	Capturing Enemy Units:
	Two destroyers belonging to the same player can capture an enemy
unit by moving into two hexes that adjoin the hex in which the target is
located.  Once captured, the unit belongs to the capturing player.
	A Freighter may be captured once all of its turrets have been
destroyed.  If an enemy Freighter is captured, all of its equipment
belongs to the capturer.
