	Deep within the caverns of the planet Cosnia, a lifeform's struggle
for freedom is being lost. Kreezers (the enslaved native of Cosnia) are
being captured by the ghoulish monsters who inhabit the planet's craters.
	There is only one hope..  One Kreezer formerly captured but not
free, must make his way through the dangerous caverns. On his way he must
free the five other Kreezers also captured.
	He has the ability - do you have the nerve?
	To aid him on his way ammunition for destroying various monsters
can be found scattered around the planet. There are also a variety of
different colored energy sweets which he will need to complete his escape.

	You cannot use a sweet until you have picked it up. The effect
generated will last until you use it up or pick up another object. Durig

than you normally can, evem if using a blue or green "sweet". In order to

mattresses to fall onto.
