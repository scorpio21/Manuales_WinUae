THE glorious GAME

 Blasted Big Bank! Your small, strggling circus is about to be seized
by a sinistescumbag, to whom you owe the sum of 10.000 smackeroos. Your
Big Top will be blacktop if you don't bag the bucks needed to banish
the barbarous banker from your beloved business. To make matters more
miserable, he's sent Fiendish Freddy to foil your fragile finances and
prevent your people from performing at their peak. Your objective is to
obliterate this financial obligation by perfectly performing the
precarious perils of the Big Top. Thus you will thrill the throng of
spectators while also earning the megabucks needed to expand your
arena.

THE magnificent MENU

 After the opening sequence, the carnival hawker and the Main Menu will
come on the screen. This menu allows you to choose Game or Practice
Mode. Practice Mode lets you practice any particular event as many
times as you like. Game Mode takes you through all six events
(in order) and will give a score to each player.

Practice Mode
 To select Practice Mode, use the joystick to move the pointer to the
bottom of the menu where it says PRACTICE and press the FIRE button.
The menu changes to a list of the six events. Now move the pointer
until it is over the event you want to practice and press the fire
button. If necessary, you'll be instructed to insert a different disk.
Once the event has loaded, the following message appears on the screen:


         PRESS "Q" TO QUIT
               OR,
      PRESS FIRE TO CONTINUE

Whenever the fire button is pressed you'll go to the beginning of the
event. Each event has three or four levels. You'll begin your practice
at the first level ad advance to the subsequent levels only as you
successfully complete each level. Whenever you "fail" at an event, or
make it through all of the event's levels, the "Quit or Continue"
message reappears. When you are finished practicing, press Q and you
will be returned to the hawker and the Main Menu.

Game Mode
 to select Game Mode, use the joystick to move the pointer to the
number of players that will be playing the game. There may be anywhere
from one to five players. Keep in mind that the $10,000 must be earned
by a single player, not accumulated from what several players earn.
Thus, in a multi-player game, you're trying to raise the money, but
you're also trying to earnn more than the other players. Once the
pointer is over the desired number of players, press the fire button.

 Next, each player will select an animal character to represent the
player in the game. Each of the five characters is displayed one at a
time. To scroll through the different characters, move the pointer over
the words "Next Beast" and press the fire button. When the beast that
you want appears, move the pointer to the words "Take this beast" and
press the fire button again. When each player has selected his/her
character, the ringmaster appears and the game begins.

 As each event begins, the character whose turn it is appears on the
screen along with the level he/she is performing and the message "Now
Appearing." The player then presses the fire button to begin the event.

 After all of the players have completed an event, the distinguished
panel of judges will come on the screen and "score" each player by
awarding him/her a certain amount of money. After the amount for the
event is given, the player will see what his/her total is at that
point. Once each player has been scored, the Ticket Tally appears and
shows the totals for all of the players.




THE explosive EVENTS

Phenomenal Feats of Diving Daring
(High Diving)

 To begin our Big Top O'Fun we bring you an act involving horrendous
heights and terrifying targets (especially Level 3). Only the studiest
of souls (and heads) will survive this stupendous spectacle.

 In this event you take on the persona of Horace the High Diver. First
Horace climbs up the ladder and moves out to the end of the end of the
diving platform. An arrow points to the level where Horace is standing.
In the upper left corner of the screen is the name of the pose that
Horace should perform first. In the lower left corner is a picture of
the diver's target.

 Press the fire button to begin Horace's dive. Once Horace is airborne,
begin to quickly move the joystick from side to side, but keep Horace
over the target. This gets Horace spinning around so that he can gain
enough momentum to go into a pose. Once he is going fast enough, a bell
rings and the name of the pose flashes, indicating it's time to go into
a pose.

 To perform a pose. move the joystick to the appropriate position and
then press the fire button. The joystick positions for each diving pose
are as follows:

	       Swan 
	 Recline | Pike
		\|/
	   Yoga-- --King Tut
		/|\
	  Ballet | Nose Pinch
	     Dive Bomb



 As each pose is done, another name of a pose appears in the upper left
corner. At this point you should again move your joystick from side to
side so that you prepare for the next pose. The more poses that are
correctly done, the more money you will make on your dive- that is, as
long as you hit your target! As your man reaches the target area, he
will automatically go into his entry pose.
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you notice Horace veering from the center of the target, move the
joystick in the direction he needs to go to steer him back on course.
Once he is again on track, go back to moving your joystick from side to
side and prepare for another pose.

 With each new level, Horace starts from higher up on the platform and
has more time to perform the dives. However, it's also easier to go off
course when your man is that high in the air.

Freddy's Role
 Once the bell rings indicating it's time to go into a pose, you must
immediately perform it. Failure to do so brings out Freddy with his
portable, industrial-size fan to blow you off course. With each level
Freddy appears sooner if you don't perform your poses as soon as the
bell rings.


Genuine Juggling Genius
(Juggling)

 It's time to welcome Jeffy-Joe the Juggler to the center ring. As a
boy he was bemoaned as "Butterfingers", but now, he's well known the
world over as the "Wee Wizard of Wonderful Juggling" (and he's
wealthy, too).

 The juggling event begins with Jeffy-Joe's obedient assistant catching
and then tossing items up into the air. Jeffy-Joe then moves his
unicycle to maneuver himself into position to catch and then juggle
each of the items. Your objective is to keep Jeffy-Joe juggling as many
items as possible until the time limit runs out. Drop five items and
Jeffy-Joe's juggling career will be just a memory. To maneuver
Jeffy-Joe, push the joystick in the direction you want to move. When
you want to catch an item, move Jeffy-Joe so that he is positioned to
catch the item in either his left or right hand. When you press the 
press the fire button, he will toss whatever is in his left hand and
put whatever was in his right hand into his left hand. He will always
throw things from HIS left hand (that's your right side), so you may
want to get into the habit of catching with his right hand and then
switching it to his left. Once you toss an item release the fire button
and prepare for the next one.

 If you pull back on the joystick, Jeffy-Joe brings both hands in to
catch something against his body. It doesn't matter how the items land
in your hands: you can't get hurt or penalized as long as you catch it
(i.e. you can catch a knife by the blade or a flaming stick by the
fiery end).

 In Level 3 and 4 a baby becomes one of the juggling objects. Your
objective is to safely return the little tot to its carriage. Doing so
removes one of the dropped items from your tally. The carrigage will
roll by as you juggle the baby. To put the baby in the carriage,
position Jeffy-Joe so that after he tosses up the baby, the baby falls
not into his hands, but straight down into the carriage. Both Jeffy-Joe
and the carriage must be exactly positioned for this to happen. Beware
of the tantrum that occurs if your baby misses the carriage.

Freddy's Role.
 Every now and then Freddy will distract your assistant and toss the
items out for him. Unfortunately you could live without Freddy's help -
REALLY. He's only tossing bombs and missiles. If one of these items
falls, it's "Kablooey"for you (and were not kidding either)!

 To handle Freddy's bombs, catch the bomb in either hand  and then
press the fire button while pushing upon the joystick. This maneuver
will toss the bomb back in Freddy's court. If he throws a missile into
your act, simply keep juggling it as you would any other item until
time runs out for that level.


BREATHTAKING BRAVADO FROM
HAZARDOUS HEIGHTS

(Trapeze)
May I direct your attention high above the center ring of our Big Top
O'Fun. It's time for yet another death-defying act of courage, bravery,
and scanty outfits that could come off at any time. It's our own Finola
of the Flying Fuller Family, and she's ready to swing her way across
out tent and into your lustful minds.

 As the event opens, Finola appears in the upper right corner of the
screen. In the lower right corner you'll notice a picture of Finola's
head. This represents the second chance that you'll should anything
happen to Finola on your first attempt. In the upper left corner you'll
see the  next bar swing in and out of view.

 Press the fire button to start Finola off the platform. Then move the
joystick in the direction that she should swing to get her momentum
going. As Finola swings forward you should push the joystick left. As
she swings backward, push the joystick right. To jump to the next bar,
wait until the bar is moving toward Finola as she swings forward. Then,
right when she is at the top of her swing, press the fire button.
She'll then perform a beautiful flip and, if timed correctly, grasp the
next bar. The process then begins again.

 In addition to just swinging from bar to bar, Finola encounters
several obstacles like paper targets and flaming hoops. Some of these
are even bobbing up and down. Again, you must time your swing so that
the hoop or target is low enough for Finola to go through.

Freddy's Role
 Where does he get those wonderful toys? In this event, Freddy is armed
with a large pair of scissors and a jet pack. He's able to fly freely
about the big top waiting for his opportunity. If you leave Finola on
one bar too long while she waits for the perfect time to jump, Freddy
comes along and "cuts" her act short.


DEADLY AND DANGEROUS DAGGERS
OF DEATH

(Knife Throw)
 Ah, your lovely assistant, Knancy Knife, is in a precarious position
now! You'll notice she's been blindfolded and tied to a rotating wheel,
which also has balloons placed in many strategic areas about her. Your
objective here is to break all of the balloons on the wheel before time
runs out for that level.

 In addition to the beautiful and scantily-clad Knancy, there is a row
of knives that represents how many tries you have to break the balloons
in each level. A clock showing your time limit appears in the upper
right corner. At the center of the wheel is your aiming knife.

 Use your joystick to move this knife around the wheel until it is over
an area where a balloon will come by. Press the fire button when you
want to throw the knife and it will fly from you to the wheel. Timing is
everything in this game, so you'll need to get a feel for how long it
takes the knife to hit the wheel.

 Take care not to hit Knancy. She's a real whiner and will surely let
you know if your aim is off. In addition, you'll be penalized two
throws whenever your dagger dents her.

Freddy's Role
 Freddy still has a stash of bombs left over from the Juggling Event,
so he's decided to put them to good use here. Periodically, he will
appear from the side, throw his smoke bomb and then scram before it
explodes. Unfortunately for you and Knancy, you have nowhere to run.
The bomb fills the screen with smoke and generally shakes things up a
bit. It will most likely throw off your timing and your aim, so try to
regain your senses as soon as you can. Besides, he's always got another
one where that came from.



TENSE TRACEL TECHNIQUES ON TIGHTROPE

(Tightrope)
 It's time to raise your gaze once again as our tightrope walker, Tony
Tiptoe, demonstrates his amazing ability to span spectacular distances
while perched at perilous heights. In other words, he's going to walk
across that really high wire!

 The event begins with Tony Tiptoe poised in the upper right corner of
the screen. The platform he must walk to is positioned in the lower
left corner. In the upper left corner is the "tilt-o-meter" view of
your man. This will clearly show which way Tony Tiptoe is leaning on
the rope.

 Begin the event by pushing your joystick staight ahead. As Tony goes
forward he will probably lose his balance and begin to lean to right
or left. Depending on the direction he leans, move your joystick right
or left to balance him again and continue moving him forward on the
rope. (For instance, if he leans left, move your joystick to the right
to straighten him and then move him forward again.) If Mr.Tiptoe leans
too far and is in danger of falling off, he will yell "Whoa" and his
balancing pole will turn red. If he remains in this dangerous position
for more than a second, he will lose his balance altogether and Freddy
will be on the scene in no time.

Freddy's Role
 For this event Freddy has reached deep into his bag of tricks and
pulled out some of his best. To begin with, if your man takes too long
to cross the wire, Freddy wheels out his cannon and stops the man
"dead" in his tracks. In other levels he can be seen flying about
trying to push you off or hurling circular saw blades at poor Tony.

 When Freddy throws blades at Tony Tiptoe, you can deflect them with
his ploe by hitting the fire button as the blade approaches him.
Failing to do so will leave Tony with a "spitting" pain.


COMBUSTIBLE CANNONS OF COLOSSAL
COURAGE

(Cannonball)
 And now for our fantastic and fiery finale! It's the fearless (and
somewhat frenzied) Fernando, the Human Cannonball. I direct your
attention to the far end of our Big lop where Fernando is pausing prior
to his last minute preparations (and possibly making a pass at his pert
apprentice).

 This event begins with your handsome human cannonball, Fernnnando,
taking his pre-flight bows. In the lower right corner are two
additional helmets, representing the two other chances you'll be given
in this event. (That's three chances in all.) In the lower left corner
is a small outline of the cannon.

 As his assistant, the lovely Lisa, loads the cannon with gunpowder,
the small outline fils with red to indicate how much gunpowder has been
placed in the cannon. Once she finishes putting in gun powder, our hero
dives in. Once he's in the cannon, a scale version of the tent appears
across the top of the screen. In the middle of this will be the target
that the little guy must hit.

 Depending on how much gunpowder the lustful Lisa has placed in the
cannon, you must decide how close or far the target shouldbe in order
for Fernando to hit it. As soon as this screen appears, use your
joystick to move the target closer (left) or farther (right) from the
cannon. This must be done quickly before...well, read what it says
under "Freddy's Role". Once your target is where you want it to be,
press the fire button.

 At this point, your alluring assistant lights the fuse. Once she
finishes, the opening of the cannon begins to rotate to the right side.
You must now decide the angle at which you want Fernando to be fired
out of the cannon in order to reach his target. When the cannon is at
the angle you want, press the fire button again. This will launch the
fearless Fernando.

 To see how Fernando progresses, follow his path along the scale
drawing that appears at the top of the screen. If your placement of the
target and angle at which he is shot are correct, he'll land on the
target. If your choices were off, Fernando's landing will be more than
a bit uncomfortable.

 Freddy's Role
 Once again, Freddy makes use of his jetpack so that he can fly about
the tent. This time, however, he's armed with one big cork and just
guess where he wants to stick it? Yes, if you waste too much time in
this event trying to dicide where to postion your target, Freddy will
make sure thatyour act creates a big bang.


A wonderful WIN OR A loathesome LOSS

 If any one player has accumulated $10.000 or more, then your big top
is saved from certain demise and it's curtains for Freddy. However, if
no one person raised the needed $10.000, Freddy will take up permanent
residence in the area and your circus will be nothing but a memory.
