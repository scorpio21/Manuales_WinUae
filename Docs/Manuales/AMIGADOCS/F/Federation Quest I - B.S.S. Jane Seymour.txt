How it works:

Match the outer ring and the inner ring using the number chart. Get the
number from the Table of Races and go to the listings of the places. Match
the number of the race with the line number under the place. This will give
you the correct code number to use.

  HOPE YOU HAVE AS MUCH FUN READING THIS AS WE HAD TYPING IT. THIS IS NO

Federation quest 1
B.S.S. JANE SEYMOUR

The first thing i heard was quiet 'pip...pip...' of the computers going
through their system checks. As my head cleared, i realised that, having
abandoned my wrecked ship in the middle of an asteroid belt, i had
managed to get the emergency craft back to earth orbit. I pulled the
tubes from my arm, and was about to sit up and take in the beauty of the
home planet for the first time in seventeen years when a synthetic voice
told me, in a typically inappropriate voice 'wake up. We've got a bit of an
emergency.' I blinked, and as my eyes slowly pulled into focus, i realised
that I wasn't going to see Earth just yet. Instead, i was looking at a fleet
of huge free floating Federation craft, all belonging to the Regal Fleet, so
called because they were all named after the various Queens of England.
'there's an SOS message for you.' I hit the key to get a hard copy, I hate
reading things off monitors, and read the message.

Message from Commander of the Regal Fleet Flagship, the Biological
Survey Ship B.S.S. JANE SEYMOUR

Date 8th July 2190

S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S.

The fleet of twenty craft, having been immersed in the radiation given off
by a Wolf-Raert Star going nova, now unable to progress on our journey any
further. All systems are now failing, and the only option appears to be to
join the other crew members in the Cyrogenics. I will do this as soon as I
have finished this message. A number of the alien specimens have escaped,
and are now roaming freely across the ship. Any crew member encountered
must not be trusted. If anyone gets this message in time, please help us.
By my calculations we have just one year and three months before the ship
loses so much power there won't be enough to keep the Stasis Chamber
functioning properly
End of Message...

'Date please BOB'
'October Sixth 2195'
'Distance from Earth?'
'Fourteen light years.'
'How far will the fuel on this ship get us?'
'Nine light years att most'
'And the Jane Seymour?'
'Not enough to reach Earth orbit. The ship at the far end of the fleet has
enough fuel, but due to the damage sustained in the accident, the only way
to board that ship is to go via the other nineteen ships, starting with the
B.S.S. Jane Seymour'
'Why?'
'Due to the configuration of the fleet, the design of the craft and their
transporting links, they are in a strict hierarchical order, and transport
to the flagship is only possible from the second ship in command, to that
one from the third in command and so on. In order  for the transport
mechanism to work, you will need to repair each of the ships to at least 80%
of full efficiency.'
'Can't we just steal some fuel?'
'No. The fuel is used in incompatible with this ship.'

So no choice. If I'm going to get to Earth, I'm going to have to board the
B.S.S. Jane Seymour, and attempt to get it into a working state, and from
there onto the next one, and so on. The alternative is that i can stay here
go back into Cyrogenics, and die in about nine years time. Not much of a
choice, really.

'any informations on the ship systems?'
'All are malfunctioning, and all have sustained heavy damage'
'Estimated chance of any crew being fully fit?'
'Five percent. Ninety five percent chance of mental deterioration, fifty
percent  likelihood of physical deterioration.'
'Brilliant. Anything else I should know?'
'Yes. The Energy flux decoupler is missing from the power room. It needs to
be found and replaced before the ship will function. Also the navigation
system on the Bridge is protected by an inhibit system. Inhibit lock is
needed in order to access navigational computers.'

'Lock on and land BOB.'
So all I need to do is repair all the ships systems, find the energy flux
decoupler, the inhibit lock, deal with the various aliens and a few crew
members who'll be a few cells short of a full battery, and then i can go
home. Not good, but my only chance.


PART 1: Repairing the Ships Systems

There are 20 ships in total in the game, and on each one a number of
objectives need to be achieved before access to the next is allowed. In
brief, you must repair all the ships systems up to 80% efficiency or above,
find and replace the energy flux decoupler and find the inhibit lock.
Once all these have been done, a message will prompt you to go to the bridge.

HOW TO REPAIR THE SHIPS SYSTEM

Due to the ship design, practically all malfunctions are because of a
deficiency in the liquid coolant. In all cases, repairs are carried out by
replacing the coolant fluid in that particular system room. So, in order to
carry out a repair, you:

a) First, make some receptacles.
b) Next, fill the receptacles with liquid coolant.
c) Finally, go to the room of the system you wish to repair and attempt a
   repair.

The first aim is achieved by finding and entering a Manufacturing Room,
which will create a new icon on the main screen. Click on it to enter the
Manufacturing screen.

You can make up to six receptacles at a time, of one to five litres capacity
each. Note, however, that making a receptacle uses the ships power, and the
larger the receptacle, the more power it requires to make it. On the other
hand, larger quantities of coolant increase your chance to repair a system
and consequently, it's easier to carry large quantities in fewer but larger
receptacles.  You must learn from experience the best sizes to make. At the
right of the screen is a zoomed view of the handset of the manufacturing
machine. Click on the size of receptacle required. The receptacle will be
made. Exit the screen when you have finished. You will then find the
receptacles  you have made on the floor of the room. Simply pick them up via
the inventory screen and you are ready to go.

The second part is achieved by entering a laboratory, which will again create
a new icon on the main screen. Click on it to enter the laboratory screen.
Here you can fill any receptacles that you are carrying. You can fill as many
as you have. Select the receptacle size from the handset at the right.
The lab computer will check the receptacles for flaws. The coolant is a
highly acidic and toxic substance and the receptacle must be flawless, and
if the computer finds a flaw in the receptacle it will reject it.
Otherwise it will fill it with liquid coolant. Simply keep selecting
receptacle sizes to fill, and click on exit when you have finished.

The final part is to carry out the repair. As mentioned, all the ship's
systems fall under the control of just four major systems:
Bio Control, Life Support, Computer and Communications. These are accessed
(and repaired) via the biological Control, Life Support, Bridge and 
Communications room respectively.
Entering one of these rooms will give a repair icon on the main screen.
Click on it to enter the repair screen.
To make a repair you will need a repair kit, and at least one litre of liquid
coolant. In most cases it will also help to have a coolant applicator, and
a robot with a repair capability, although neither are absolutely necessary.
Down the left of the screen, you are reminded of what repair aids in the
system's reservoir. At the right of the screen is one of your full
receptacles.
The reservoir can hold up to 5 litres of coolant, pump in any more and it
will overflow. Select the receptacle you wish to empty using the top left 
arrow. To empty its contents into the reservoir, use the top right button.
When you are happy with the amount of coolant in the reservoir, you can
attempt a repair. Click on the spanner icon to the bottom left of the screen.
The coolant will be pumped into the system and the message panel at the top
will show the result of your attempt.


PART 2:  THE SCREEN

1. The Main Screen

Once you begin a game, you will be presented with the main playing screen.
It's from this screen that most of the game will be played so it's worth
examining in detail.

               E F  K               L

 a) The name of the current location/room

 b) This is the main viewing screen, which will display every thing that
    the player sees while playing the game.

 c) The weapon reload bar. Various weapons have a reload, or recharge time,
    which is the amount of time between two successive shots. You cannot fire
    the weapon again until the reload bar reaches the bottom.

 d) Main stamina recorder. This is an indicator of your general health and
    stamina points, it will slowly turn into a skull.
    fortunately, there are various ways of healing lost stamina points:

          1. You gain some back naturally as you walk about.
          2. You can inject yourself with medical drugs when you find them.
          3. A robot with a medical cartridge can heal you.
          4. Eating food in the galley.

 e) The life trace recorder.

 f) Background radiation meter. The higher the bar, the higher the radiation
    If the bar is at maximum you'd better move, because you're in deep shit.

 g) Time elapsed since play began

 h) The hands display. These two boxes indicate any items that you might be
    holding in either of your hands. Weapons must be carried in your right,
    the left mouse button will change any item between your two hands, and
    the right mouse button will use the item in whichever hand the pointer
    is over.

 i) The movements icons. The four blue icons move you one square in that
    direction. The two green ones rotate you left or right by 90 degrees.
    The two grey buttons to either side of the backwards blue icon will
    display arrows when you are enter a lift or a square with a ladder in it.
    They will indicate that you can go up and/or down. Click on any of the
    arrows to move in that particular direction.

 j) The main message panel. Any information, for example a description of
    what happens when you carry out a particular action, will be carried in
    this window.

 k) Beating Heart. This will beat faster when you are involved in strenuous
    activity. Warning: you heal at a slower rate when you are in strenuous
    activity. When you slow down, the heart will return to its normal rate
    again. The heart also changes color to indicate how irradiated or
    poisoned you are becoming. Scarlet is healthy, and orange and yellow are
    increasingly unhealthy. If it gets too yellow you will die of radiation
    /poison.

 l) The function buttons. If they are blank then they currently hold no 
    function. If a button has a function at any particular point, then it
    will be labelled with an icon. The top six buttons are game control
    buttons, and the bottom six are robot buttons. Two functions are always
    available. The far left button takes you into the inventory screen.
    When you enter any location, should any additional option become
    available to you, then one of the six buttons will carry a new icon.
    more on this later.


2. THE INVENTORY SCREEN

Here everything that you carry, and anything that you have immediate access
to. There are windows for items held in each hand, your pack,belt,worn, lying
in the room and carried by robots. If you glide the mouse over the item, the
message panel tells you what it is and the serial number.

Each item has a designated weight, and obviously you will be limited in how
much you can carry at any one time. The number in the bottom right of the
message panel is the weight of the object that the mouse pointer is over.
for the room window it tells you the total weight of all the items there, if
you were to pick them all up. for other windows, there are two figures.
First there is the present weight total for that window, followed by the 
maximum weight for that window. Once a window reaches its maximum weight, 
you cannot carry any more in that window until you drop something from it.
You can only carry one thing in each of your hands.

To move items between windows, move the pointer over the item and click the
left mouse button. You will now be carrying that item with the mouse. You
can drop it into any box of any window by moving over the destination box
and click the left mouse again.

The message panel reminds you what you are holding at all times. Certain
larger items must be placed into the special larger boxes. The smaller items
will fit into either of the box sizes.

You can exchange two items by picking one up as described above, moving over
another item in any window and click the left mouse button. You will deposit
your carried item in the box, and the item that was in the box now becomes
the carried item. you cannot leave this screen if you are 'carrying' an item
with the mouse.

a) Robots

  If there are any robots with you in any location, their icons will appear
  on the six buttons at the top left. To access the robot windows, first
  click on the robot icon at the top left. If that robot is carrying anything
  then these items will appear in the three robot windows at the top right.
  The window marked by the gun is the robot current weapon. to the right of
  that are four boxes that hold any cartridges installed in the robot.
  Only cartridges can be put into the four boxes in the window, (more on
  cartridges, and programming the robot later), below that is the main
  carrying area of the robot which is handled like the players pack or belt.

  If you want to move items between two robots: select the first robot icon.
  Pick up the items from the robot windows and temporarily put them in
  another window, for example the room window, then select the destination
  robot icon and then move the items into the robot windows.
  You can use certain items from the inventory screen by clicking on the
  item with the right mouse button. The message panel reports any results of
  using the item.

b) Repair

  You can repair certain items that have broken from the inventory screen,
  by using the repair kit. Click on the repair kit with the right button,
  then click on the item you wish to repair.
  The message panel will indicate the result of the repair attempt. You can
  repair robots that are broken or malfunctioning by using the repair kit.
  Follow the procedure above, except click on the icon for the robot you
  wish to repair.

c) Computer

  This will appear whenever you have access to a computer droid or enter a
  terminal room. You will know you have access to the computer as one of
  the six buttons will become highlighted with the computer icon.
  Clicking on these icons changes the four icons to new functions which give
  access to new information.

 A. DECK PLANS

The deck plans are built up as you explore the ship. Areas you have not
visited will not appear on the plans. The deck plans will also show any
areas that robots under your control may have visited. On the plans, special
rooms are colored, the colors being explained in the key given at the top
of the screen. Any rooms not specifically color coded will appear green,
and corridors are brown. Robots under your control will appear as crosses.
Your own position will appear as a flashing black arrow. The arrow point the
way you are currently facing. The white bars on the map are doors.

The message area below shows your position, including the room number.
As you move the mouse pointer over the map, it will tell you what the room
is and its serial number, useful when you want to return to a room and can't
remember where it was.

There are three decks on the ship, the MAIN, LOWER, DORSAL. You can switch
between them by clicking on the upper icon button marked with an arrow.
The lower button exits the screen.

 B. STATUS SCREEN

This indicates the status of the ship's systems. Clicking the left mouse
button exits the screen. At the top left is a list of all the ship's systems.
The names in yellow major systems, and the names in white below the yellow
major system names, are the individual ship systems that exits in that major
system. e.g.the gallery, lighting, doors and radiation filters are all
controlled via the life support control room.
To the right of the names is a bar chart showing the current power level of
each system. The longer the green bar, the higher the power remaining.

Further to the right is a 'quick glance' display of the status of each system
either functional (it is working just fine), intermittent (it will work on
an intermittent basis), or malfunctional (it clearly warrants attention and
need to be repaired.)

Below the system list are some details for a particular system: The ships
computer scans the system and provides further details on a system at a time.
Information provided here is:
    
    THE SYSTEM NAME.

    PREDICTED EFFICIENCY.

The computer predicts how the system is behaving (stable, increasing in
power or decreasing in power). The following two statistics you have not
been properly briefed on, but you think that they are:

  PREDICTED SUCCESS INDEX

How successful a repair is likely to be..

  PREDICTED DOWNTIME INDEX

An indication of how long before the system is likely to malfunction.

At the bottom is a more visible indication of the status of the system
currently being examined. Bottom right of the screen is an indication of the
ship's total power. The longer the green bar, the higher the power.

 C. CREW ROSTER

You can examine the ship's crew roster and identify the crew members should
you meet them. Use the arrowed icons to cycle forwards or backwards through
the roster, and the center exit icon to exit the screen.

 D. ALIEN SCIENTIFIC DATA

You can examine the roster of the alien samples carried aboard the ship,
and perhaps glean ways of dealing with them if you meet them. Use the
arrowed icons to cycle forwards or backwards through the roster, and the
center exit icon to exit the screen.

 E. THE RECHARGING SCREEN

When you enter a recharging station, an icon will appear on the main screen
that will allow you to access the recharger. Clicking on it takes you to the
recharging screen. You can recharge any of three types, a robot, a pass or
miscellaneous item, each by clicking in their designated areas.
A robot can be recharged in increments of ten points up to the maximum level
for that particular robot. Passes are recharged one color at a time, and
any items in increments of one charge.
Each use of the recharger drains a bit of the ship's total power, so avoid
extensive and wasteful use of the rechagers. When you are recharging, the
icons are, from left to right:

RECHARGE:  Make a recharge of the currently selected item.

LEFT,RIGHT:  Cycle through all the robots/items/passes available to be
             recharged in this location, until you find the one you want
             to recharge.

EXIT:  Leave the screen.


PART 3: GENERAL INFORMATION

1. Structural Damage

During the course of the game you may happen across a damaged location,
shown by a huge hole in the floor. You will quickly find it unpassable. You
may also create damage yourself by various means if you are not careful! All
is not lost, you can repair the damage! Simply locate a plexsteel sprayer,
carry it to the hole and use it to fill in the hole with super hard plexsteel

2. Combat

When faced with an opponent, you may fight it if you have a weapon in your
right hand. If you move the mouse pointer over the 3-D window it will turn
into a crosshair. The size of the crosshair will vary according to the
weapon, some weapons are easier to hit your target with than others.
You must combat the jiggling of the crosshair (after all, we all get nervous
in a fight) and click the left mouse button when you think you have the
crosshair over the enemy. This constitutes an attack. If your weapon has
shots or charges, each click of the button uses up one of them. If the
weapon runs out of shots or charges then it is useless. Some weapons may be
thrown away. You will hit the enemy if any of the crosshair is over the
enemy, but a better hit will be made if the center of the crosshair hits
the enemy (this is very difficult on weapons with a tiny crosshair!).

3. DOORS

The doors aboard ship are a special energy field that is airtight and
prevents airborne viruses or contamination from spreading about the ship.
You can safely pass through this energy and into the location beyond, unless
the door is security coded. Grey doors are not encoded, so simply walk
through them. A color door indicates the level of security required.
To pass through you need to use a security door pass, and it will need to 
be of the correct color or above. From the lowest upwards, color coding
its red , orange, yellow, green, blue and white. Therefore a white pass will
open any door, but an orange pass will only open a orange or red door. 
Passes loose color as they are used, but may be recharged in a recharging
station. You can 'pre open' a door by using a security pass but not walking
through immediately. The door will remain 'open' until you next walk 
through. Security coded doors turn grey when opened with a pass, but will
return to their previous security color when you have passed through them.
Security doors are only encoded in one direction though, so if you had to 
use a pass to go through, you can always go back the other way without 
needing a pass. 


PART 4: PROGRAMMING THE ROBOTS.

Although your mission can be completed without relying on the robots, the
can be used to your advantage, and alone with their programming chips, 
provide a highly powerful tool. There are six types of robot that you may
meet, each has a built in function and may execute further functions by
use of plug in cartridges. 

BATTLE DROID.      
This has combat capability built in.

SENSOR DROID.
This has a life scanner built in. It will report the approach of any 
hostiles on a frequent basis.

MANITOR DROID. 
This has the ability to clean up spilled liquid coolant.

FIXIT DROID.
This has the ability to repair items or assist in repairing 'ships' systems.

RAT DROID.
This has no built in function. 

COMPUTER DROID. 
This allows you to access the ships computer without the need to be in a 
terminal room. 

When a robot is available for you to command it, its icon will appear on 
the main screen in the second row of 6 icon buttons. There is a blue light
below each robot icon, which reminds you of how you are controlling it, 
because there are two methods. Either the robot is here with you, or the
robot is under your command via a communicator, and could be anywhere on the
ship. 

The light is lit when the robot is here with you. Only tree robots can ever
appear in the main 3D view even though all 6 could be in any one location.
The other robots are there but not displayed, to avoid clogging up the main
3D display. 
Clicking on a robot icon on the main screen takes you into the robot 
screen.
The screen tells you, amongst other things, what type of robot you have, 
where it is, what mode of execution it is in, and its condition.

The robots have 4 modes of execution: 

STAY HERE
The robot will remain in this location awaiting instructions. 

FOLLOW ME.
The robot will follow the player everywhere he goes.
Note that robots in follow me mode never appear on the main screen 3D view.

PROGRAM
The robot is running a user defined program.

POWER DOWN 
The robot is turned of. 

In the center of the screen is a power bar. The higher the green bar, the
more energy the robot has. Above the power bar is the current weapon if 
any. Next, the main robot inventory window. The 3 windows echo the 3 robot
windows in the inventory screen. You can move items between the 3 windows
in the same way as you do in the inventory screen, but only cartridges 
can be plugged into the cartridges window. The box marked cartridges 
indicates which cartridges are plugged into this robot. 

Below this are 2 icon buttons, program and exit.

PROGRAM:  Enter the programming screen to write a program. 
EXIT:     Leave the robot screen. 

Along the bottom of the screen are 12 buttons which indicate the functions
which the robot can perform. 6 of these are always labelled for every robot
and the other are filled in as cartridges are plugged in to the robot.

ROBOT FUNCTIONS:

Robot functions can be accessed in direct mode or program mode. Some may
only be accessed by one of these methods. In direct mode simply click on
the icon from the robot screen and the function will be executed 
immediately. In program mode, click on the function icon from the 
programming screen and the function will be executed as part of a program.
The 6 standard icons are, from left to right: 

POWER ON/OFF
Toggles the robot on and of. You may not use any of the functions icons
when the robot is off, until you turn it on again.

FOLLOW ME:  
Puts the robot into follow me mode. 

STAY HERE:
Puts the robot into stay here mode. Clicking on either stay here or follow
me cancels the mode the robot was previously in. If the robot was 
executing a program, the program will be aborted.

GO TO (FOLLOWED BE A ROOM NO.)
Use the deck plans screen to learn the various room numbers. This will
instruct the robot to travel to this room or corridor by the quickest 
possible route, guided by its internal map. Certain obstacles such as 
enemies or structural damage may bar the robot completing this function.

PICK UP (PROGRAM MODE ONLY)
You are prompted for an item serial number, given on the inventory screen.
The robot will pick up and carry this item if it is available.

DROP ITEM Direct mode: 
You are prompted to click on an item in one of the 3 robot 
item windows. The item you click on be will be dropped in the present 
location of the robot. 

DROP ITEM. PROGRAM MODE:
You are prompted for an item serial number. The robot will drop this item
if it is carrying it. 

CARTRIDGES
You can plug up to 4 cartridges into a robot by putting cartridge items
into the cartridge window. The cartridges with their appropriate functions
are: 

REPAIR CARTRIDGE

REPAIR DIRECT MODE:   
You are prompted to click on an item in one of the 3 robot item windows.
The item you click on may be repaired. The result on the repair attempt 
is given in the message panel at the top of the screen. 

REPAIR (PROGRAM MODE) 
You are prompted for an item serial number. The robot will attempt to 
repair this item if it is available. 

COOLANT MANAGEMENT CARTRIDGE

MAKE RECEPTACLE.
You are prompted for a receptacle size. The robot will attempt to 
manufacture a receptacle of this size, so long as it is in a manufacture
room when it executes this function.

FILL RECEPTACLE. 
You are prompted for a receptacle size. The robot will attempt to fill a
receptacle of this size, so long as it is in a laboratory and a 
receptacle of the right size is available.

SELF DESTRUCT CARTRIDGE
You are prompted for a delay in seconds. After executing this function the
robot will explode after the given delay, killing everything near by. 
Including you.

MEDICAL CARTRIDGE
You will be healed some stamina point if you are with the robot. 

SCANNER CARTRIDGE
No function. It will perform a frequent life scan as if it were a sensor
droid.

ATTACK CARTRIDGE    

ATTACK. 
Toggles the robot in or out of combat mode. In combat mode, the robot 
must have a weapon to fight with. (Put a weapon in the robot weapon 
window). If it meets an enemy it will engage that enemy and fight it.

COMMUNICATIONS CARTRIDGE

REPORT.
Toggles the robot in in or out of report mode. In report mode, you must carry
a communicator. The robot report to you via the message panel on the main
screen, identifying itself by it's serial number (e.g. '3: arrived' indicates
that robot 3 has arrived at it's destination). The robot will report each 
stage of its program as it completes it, as well as error messages or any
problems it encounters.

PROGRAMMING SCREEN

Clicking on the program icon on the robot screen causes the center of the
screen to toggle to the programming screen.

At the right is the main program listing window. A program can can consist
of up to 10 instructions. To the left are four icons. below them is the 
exit icon that returns you to the robot screen. Along the bottom are the
functions available for this robot.
To enter a program line, simply click on the function icon and answer any
prompts using the keyboard. The appropriate program instruction will be
generated and will appear in the listing at the point where the blue
highlight line was. The blue will move down a line, ready for the next
instruction. For the toggle functions ComBat mode and Report Mode, the first
time you click on their icon, a Mode On line will be inserted in the program.
If you wish a Mode Off instruction, simply click on the icon again.
There are four special icons: 

INSERT
To insert a line into the program somewhere other than where the blue line
is, click on insert, then move the mouse over the listing and the blue bar
will move with the mouse. Position the blue line where you want to insert
an click the left button. Then click on the function icon you wish to insert.
The instruction will be inserted and the blue line will return to the bottom
of the program listing.

DELETE
To delete program line, click on delete, then move the mouse over the listing
and the blue bar will with the mouse. Position the blue line over the line
you wish to delete and click the left button. The line will be deleted.

CLEAR
Delete the entire program.

RUN
Execute the program. This puts the robot into programming mode as soon as you
exit the robot screen, the robot will begin to execute the program you have
just written. It will execute each instruction in the order you have written
them, completing one, before beginning the next.

NOTE
The robot performs no syntax checking on your program. It is up to you to 
write the program in a sensible order. If the robot attempts to execute an
instruction that is meaningless (e.g. Drop an item it doesn't have, or
manufacture receptacle when it is not in a manufacturing room, it will simply
ignore the instruction and continue to the next). If the robot is capable of
reporting back to you (see report function), it will report an error message.

When the robot comes to the end of the program it will go into stay here
mode and remain stationary. You can edit the robots program even while it is
executing it. You can halt the program at any time by turning the robot off
or putting it into stay here or follow me mode. If you put the robot back
into program mode it will begin to execute the program from line 1 again!
The program will remain in the robots memory until you click on the Clear
icon, so you can re execute the same program over and over again.
