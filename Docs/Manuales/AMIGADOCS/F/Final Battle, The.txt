           THE DOX FOR `FINAL BATTLE` TYPED IN BY SCOOTER-GENESIS
           ------------------------------------------------------


THE BEGINNING OF THE END:

THE FIRELIGHT FLICKERED AT THE DARK CABALISTIC SYMBOLS THAT COVERED THE WALLS
OF THE CHAMBER, A CORNER OF THE TABLE, WHICH WAS CLUTTERED WITH ALCHEMICAL
APPARATUS-POTS,TEST TUBES,A PESTLE AND MORTAR. CRUCIBLES FULL OF FOUL SMELLING
SLUDGE--HAD BEEN CLEARED AWAY TO LEAVE JUST ENOUGH ROOM FOR A MAN TO SET DOWN
HIS PLATE AND EAT. IN ONE OF THE TWO STIFF MAHOGANY CHAIRS BY FIRE, SAT AN OLD
MAN. BOWED OVER A CHESS SET. NICODEMUS CLEARED AWAY THE GREASY REMNANTS OF HIS
MEALS.

THE OLD MAN MOTIONED TOWARDS THE OTHER CHAIR.
`SIT` HE GROWLED.
NICODEMUS SAT.
`READ TO ME!`.

NICODEMUS WAITED. HE`D BEEN SUZARS SERVANT FOR DECADES--LONG ENOUGH TO BE BORED
SENSELESS BY THE OLD BUZZARDS CHEAP MELODRAMATIC MAGIC TRICKS AND MORE THAN
LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM IF HE DIDNT COMPLY. A MOMENT LATER
THE BOOK AS HE KNEW IT WOULD, MATERIALISED ON HIS LAP. A HISTORY OF ANAR.
NICODEMUS WATCHED IT FALL OPEN AT THE REQUIRED PAGE, THEN HE BEGAN TO READ.

OF THE LEGEND OF THESWORD.

AS RECOUNTED BY JERUB, SCRIBE AND CLERIC OF ANAR.

IT IS WRITTEN THAT MANY CENTURIES AGO, THE ANCIENT CORSARIANS FORGED A MAGICAL
SWORD AND SHEILD IN THE HOPE THAT THEIR COMBINED POWER WOULD PROTECT THE LAND
OF ANAR FROM EVIL. OTHER SOURCES CLAIM THAT AS THE METAL OF THESE MIGHTY
WEAPONS WAS FORGED AND BEATEN OUT, SIX CRYSTALS WERE FORMED, EACH OF WHICH
CONTAINED ONE OF OUR WORLDS VITAL POWERS:LAND.WARMTH.WATER,GOOD, UNIVERSE AND
LIFE,
ALL THIS WAS A LEGEND LIKE ANY OTHER, UNTIL THE MACHINATIONS OF A CERTAIN
WIZARD, ONE SUZAR,AND ALCHEMIST AND DABBLER IN THE BLACK ARTS,THREATENED TO
OVERTHROW THE PROSPERITY OF OUR WORLD. HIS STUDY OF MAGIC ENABLED HIM TO
TRANSFORM THE ENEMIES WHO FELL AGAINST HIM--AND THERE WERE MANY--INTO MUTANT
HUMANOIDS, A PITIFUL HALF HUMAN ARMY OF MINDLESS VIOLENT CREATURES, USING THIS
UNHOLY ARMY HE THREATENED TO OVERTHROW THE KING.

BUT IN HIS WISDOM, KING DARIUS SENT OUT A PARTY OF FIVE ADVENTURERS ON A QUEST
TO RECOVER THE LEGENDARY SWORD AND SHIELD. ALL ANAR IS FAMILIAR WITH THE
ADVENTURES OF THIS DETERMINED PARTY OF MEN, HOW THEY SUCCEEDED IN RECOVERING
THE ANCIENT ARTIFACTS, AND FINALLY OVERTHREW THE WIZARD BY CONFINING HIM IN THE
SMALLEST IMAGINABLE PRISON- A TINY TEARDROP, SO ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN.

`FOOLS` SHOUTED THE OLD MAN, HE JUMPED UP AND SENT THE CHESS SET SCATTERING
ACROSS THE CHAMBER WITH HIS FIST. NICODEMUS SNAPPED THE BOOK SHUT, THE VEINS ON
THE WIZARDS NECK WAS SWOLLEN WITH RAGE.
THESE IDIOTS CAN`T EVEN GET THEIR FACTS RIGHT. THOSE CRYSTALS ARE A MERE
NOTHING. THE SWORD AND THE SHIELD WEILD THE ULTIMATE POWER-WHOEVER POSSESSES
THEM CAN DO WHAT THEY LIKE. AS FOR THE TEARDROP, SUZAR SNEERED,~DID THEY REALLY
THINK` I THE GREAT SUZAR WHO HAS THE POWER OF THE WINDS AT HIS BECK ND CALL,WHO
CAN STRIKE DOWN ARMIES WITH ONE BLOW, WHO HAS SWEATED FOR YEARS TO BECOME A
MASTER OF THE BLACK ARTS, WOULD BE DEFEATED BY AN ELEMENTARY DEVICE LIKE THAT?.
THEY HAVE UNDER ESTIMATED YOUR POWERS MASTER, NICODEMUS FAWNED. HE FOREBORE TO
MENTION THAT IT HAD TAKEN THE WIZARD MONTHS TO GET OUT.
SUZAR SUDDENLY TALL AND YOUTHFUL UNABLE TO CONTAIN HIS RAGE. WAS STRIDING ABOUT
THE ROOM, THE FIRELIGHT GAVE HIS COAL BLACK EYES A SUPERNATURAL GLOW--AS IF
THEY WERE BURNING A HOLE IN HIS GAUNT ANGULAR FACE.

SO NICODEMUS. YOU`VE KNOWN ME FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT PLAN OF ACTION WOULD YOU
ADVISE?.

NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME. NICODEMUS WONDERED WHY HIS MASTER, BOTHERED ASKING. HE
WAS WEARY OF BEING USED AS A SOUNDING BOARD. WHATEVER HE SAID WOULD JUST BE THE
CUE FOR SUZAR TO RAM HIS OWN THEORIES DOWN HIS SERVANTS THROAT.

WELL MASTER, SINCE AS YOU SAY. THE CRYSTALS ARE OF NO SIGNIFICANCE, PERHAPS WE
SHOULD SEEK OUT THE ALL POWERED SWORD AND SHIELD AND USE THEM TO ENSURE THAT
GOOD KING DARIUS WILL NEVER SPEAK ILL OF THE GREAT WIZARD SUZAR AGAIN.

NOT BAD BOOMED THE WIZARD AT LAST. NICODEMUS BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF, BUT NOT
GOOD EITHER, NICODEMUS STIFFENED WITH A FLOURISH THE WIZARD FISHED INSIDE HIS
LONG BLACK CLOAK TO REVEAL, LIKE A COURT MAGICIAN PRODUCING A RABBIT FROM A
HAT, A HEAVY SWORD AND A COMPANION METAL SHIELD.

NICODEMUS GASPED. THE WORKMANSHIP WAS FINER THAN ANY HE`D EVER SEEN. POWER
SEEMED TO RADIATE FROM THE METAL LIKE AN INVISIBLE LIGHT. MORE THAN ANYTHING HE
WANTED TO TOUCH IT. "YOU ALREADY HAVE THEM" HE WHISPERED.

WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?. THAT I`D SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS IN A TEARDROP TWIDDLING MY
THUMBS?,I`VE PLANNED HUNDREDS OF YEARS FOR THIS MOMENT-YEARS IN WHICH
GENERATION UPON GENERATION OF PASTY FACED KINGS GREW FAT LIVING OFF MY LAND.
TOADYING TO THW ILL OF THE PEOPLE AND PUSSY FOOTING AROUND THE ISSUES OF POWER.
NOW MY TURN HAS COME. LETS SEE THE GOOD PEOPLE OF ANAR FIGHT AGAINST THE
CHILLING BLAST OF A WIZARDS INCOMPARABLE WRATH.

SUZAR WAS LOOKING AT HIM EXPECTANTLY, OBVIOUSLY ANOTHER QUESTION WAS REQUIRED.
NICODEMUS RACKED HIS BRAIN....BUT MASTER,PERMIT ME TO ENQUIRE.WHAT ABOUT THOSE
WHO ATTEMPTED TO DESTROY YOU?. HOW WILL YOU WREAK YOUR REVENGE?.

SUZARS LIP CURLED INTO A DEMONIC SMILE. I`M COMING TO THAT. HE GESTURED AT THE
FIREPLACE WHERE IN THE SMOKE IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE TO MAKE OUT THE IMAGE OF A
FOREST SCENE. NICODEMUS WATCHED AS A GROUP OF HUMANOIDS AMBUSHED A PARTY OF
ADVENTURERS--HE REGONISED THEM AS THE FOOLISH TRAVELLERS WHO HAD SUCCEEDED IN
TEMPORARILY TRAPPING SUZAR IN THE TEARDROP. THE HUMANOID ATTACK WAS
SWIFT,EFECIENT AND BLOODY NICODEMUS GAGGED AS THEY THREW THE DEAD INTO THE
PIT,THREE SURVIVORS,BRUISED AND BOUND IN CHAINS WERE BEING MARCHED IN THE
DIRECTION OF A RUINED FORTRESS. A DUNGEON SUZAR OFTEN USED. NICODEMUS FROWNED.
SOMETHING DIDNT FIT.

YOU LOOK PUZZLED,NICODEMUS,SUZAR WAS OBVIOUSLY ENJOYING HIMSELF.

BEGGING YOUR PARDON. MASTER.YOU HAVE THE SWORD AND THE SHIELD BUT EVEN IF THE
POWER OF THE CRYSTALS IS A FALLACY.SOME MEN MAY BELIEVE IN IT. THESE
ADVENTURERS WILL SURELY ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE AND THWART YOU AGAIN. WHY DID YOU LET
THEM LIVE?
BECAUSE MY DEAR NICODEMUS..SAID THE WIZARD,LICKING HIS THIN DRY LIPS AND
MOTIONING TO THE CHESS BOARD ON WHICH ALL THE PIECES WERE NOW BACK IN PLACE. "I
ENJOY A GOOD GAME".

THE FINAL BATTLE..THE LEGEND CONTINUES:

ITS BEEN SOME MONTH`S SINCE YOU AND YOUR 4 COLLEAGUES DISCOVERED THE WHERE
ABOUTS OF THE LEGENDARY SWORD AND SHIELD OF ANAR AND MANAGED TO IMPRISON THE
EVIL WIZARD SUZAR IN A TEAR DROP. NOW SUZAR HAS ESCAPED AND MURDERED ALL BUT
TWO OF YOUR FRIENDS AND MADE OFF WITH THE SWORD AND SHIELD. YOU AND THE OTHER
SURVIVORS WERE CAPTURED BY SUZAR`S HUMANOIDS AND DRAGGED OFF TOWARDS A DUNGEON.
YOU SUFFERED A BUMP ON THE HEAD AND EVRYTHING SUDDENLY WENT BLACK.

WHEN YOU WAKE UP,YOUR HEADS SORE AND THERES NO SIGN OF YOUR TWO COMPANIONS.
YOU`RE ALONE IN THE MIDLE OF A DANK,DARK RUBBLE STREWN CELL. A HUBMBLE STARTING
POINTFOR WHAT WILL BE THE MOST CRUCIAL BATTLE ANAR HAS EVER FOUGHT. THE
ULTIMATE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE POWERFUL BLACK ARTS AND THE WEAKENED FORCES
OF GOOD.
TO PREVENT SUZARS MAGIC SWALLOWING UP YOUR WORLD. YOU`LL HAVE TO FIND A WAY OUT
OF PRISON.RESCUE YOUR TWO COMPANIONS, AND SEEK OUT AND RECOVER THE 6 POWER
CRYSTALS WHICH ALONE HAVE THE POWER TO BRING SUZAR TO HIS KNEES.

THE FINAL BATTLE IS DIVIDED INTO TWO DISTINCT SECTIONS. PART 1 OF THE GAME YOU
TRAVEL THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE ADMIRING THE SCENERY AND SOLVING THE PUZZLES
ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN PACE. FROM THIS LANDSCAPE.PART 2. IS ACCESSED BY A ONE WAY
PASSAGE(ITS ONLY SAFE TO PASS THROUGH AT NIGHT) WHICH TAKES YOU DIRECTLY TO THE
FORTESS OF ANAR. THERE  YOU HAVE UNTIL DAWN TO ACHIEVE YOUR QUEST. DESTROY
