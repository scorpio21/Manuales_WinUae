				Fire-Brigade

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  *  Amiga 500, 1000, or 2000 with 1 Mb RAM
  *  AMIGADOS v.1.2 or greater.  Developed using AMIGADOS v.1.2
  *  both NTSC and PAL video standards are supported
  *  both port and connecting cable or modem required for network play
     between two machines - not required for play on one machine.

Fire-Brigade requires a full 1 Mb RAM to operate.  It consumes most of the
Amiga's memory and has a working memory environment of over 800K.  It may
not behave well if previous applications have fragmented the memory too
much.  So, we recommend you:

  *  disconnect all external disk drives
  *  remove all memory resident software from the system if using a hard
     disk
  *  run the game from a cold start (ie. turn your machine off, turn it
     back on again and re-boot

BACK-UP

Before you do anything, make a copy of the 'Master' disk.  Use this to run
the game, retaining the 'Master' disk as your back-up.  The 'Master' disk
is not copy protected and can be copied using the standard AMIGADOS
DISKCOPY routine to another floppy or hard disk.  When copying to a hard
disk, ensure that all game files and standard scenarios are located
together in the one directory.

RUNNING FIRE-BRIGADE

From a Floppy Disk Drive

1. Turn the machine on and insert your 'Fire-Brigade' auto-booting game
   disk (ie. your back-up copy of the original Master disk) in drive 0.
2. When the workbench appears, double-click on the Fire-Brigade disk icon 
   and then on the Fire-Brigade application icon (ie. the 'two tanks').
3. After 2-3 minutes the start-up screen will appear, followed by a blank
   screen with a menu bar at the top and a palette bar at the bottom.
4. Select New Game from the Game menu (or Restart if you wish to play a
   previously saved game).
5. When the select scenario file requester appears, select FIRE_BRIGADE 
   from the volume list.  When the list of scenarios (and system drawers)
   appears in the file display area, double-click on the desired scenario
   or click once on the scenario and select OPEN.
6. After 2 to 3 minutes the scenario will be loaded.  Refer to the Player
   Manual for instructions on how to play the game.

From a Hard Disk Drive

1. If working from the workbench, follow the same procedures as for floppy
   drives (points 1 - 6 above), except that when the file requester
   appears, first locate your game sub-directory by selecting the volume
   name of your hard disk from the volume list and then your sub-directory
   from the file list.  The list of scenarios will then appear.
2. If working from the CLI, make the sub-directory with the game the 
   current directory, using the standard AMIGADOS CD command.  Run the
   game by entering: FBMAIN > NIL:<Enter> and follow the above procedures.

Loading, Saving and Deleting a Game

Use the Inovatronics File I/O Requester to save onto or load from any
device or directory.  To save a game, select Save from the Game menu.  When
the File requester appears, use the volume and directory list to locate
your desired Save from the Game menu.  When t he File requester appears, use
the volume and directory list to locate your desired save destination. 
Type in a name for your saved game and click on the SAVE box.

Select Restart from the Game menu to load a previously saved game.  When
the file requester appears, locate the saved game using the volume and
drawer lists.  Double-click on it or click once and click on the OPEN box.

Select Delete from the Game menu, to delete a game from a directory or
disk.  When the file requester appears, use the above procedures to select
the desired game and press DELETE.  Select CANCEL to return to the game.

Please note saving and loading a Fire-Brigade game does take some time,
around 2 to 3 minutes from a floppy, less from a hard disk.

MENUS

Click the right mouse button to display the menu bar, or use the
Command/Amiga keys - see below - to directly select a menu item.  Note on
the Amiga there is an additional 'Special' menu, which contains the Sound
and Palette functions.

Sound

The \/ next to the Sound On function indicates that sound is on.  To turn
sound off, select Sound Off from the Special menu.

Palette (courtesy R J Mical)

To adjust the map and unit colours, select Palette from the Special menu.

When the palette box appears, click on the colour technique indicator to
change from 'Red Green Blue (RGB) to 'Hue Saturation Luminance' (HSL) or
vice versa.  Select a map or unit colour, by clicking ont he corresponding
colour square.  Move the colour control slides to adjust RGB/HSL settings. 
To copy one colour to another, click on the first colour, click COPY and
then click ont he second colour.  Use the same procedure with RANGE to
spread the colours between two colours.  Click on 'OK' to confirm or
'CANCEL' to revert.  When you Save or Quit the game, your colour
preferences will also be saved.

If you make a complete mess of it, re-set the User Palette by selecting
either Dave's Palette or Ben's Palette from the Special Menu.

Function and Command Keys

The function keys are a short hand method of selecting palette functions. 
Each function key corresponds to a palette function as below.  F10, with
right AMIGA key, will return the arrow cursor and refresh the Tactical and
Strategic maps.

(F1-F7 can access other commands with the AMIGA key depressed).

Command Key.  Whenever instructed by the Player Manual to use the Command
Key, use the right AMIGA key instead.  Eg. selecting 'N', while holding
down the right AMIGA key, will select New Game from the Game Menu.

On the Amiga version there is no Panic feature - right AMIGA P brings up
the Palette requester; no Unlocated Enemy function - right AMIGA U has no
effect; and no Configure function - right AMIGA C brings up the game
credits.  To reconfigure a game, save it, re-open it and do so then.

Dialogue Boxes

Because the Amiga screen parameters differ from the Macintosh, the
components of certain dialogue boxes have been repositioned.  Eg. in the
Combat Support box, the ground support function is located at the top right
rather than at the bottom left, as it appears in the player manual. 
Regardless of their location, these functions perform in the same way as
indicated in the manual.

Dragging/Point & Shoot

On the Amiga version, instead of dragging (ie. click, hold down, move and
release) you can point & shoot (ie. click, move and click again) to select
HQ objectives etc.  Whichever method, ensure you do not release the mouse
(drag) or click the second time (point & shoot) until the display has
refreshed with the details of the selected HQ/unit.

To cancel a selection using point & shoot, click-off on a non-objective
portion of the map.  If you move the cursor outside the map before clicking
off, the screen will continue to refresh - move the cursor back onto the
map and click again.

Directory Listing

The 'Master' disk contains the following files:
