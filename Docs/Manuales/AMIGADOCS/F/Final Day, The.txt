                              The Final Day 
 
 
Here are the Complete Instructions for The Final Day as supplied with my  
Original disk.

The object of this game is the termination of the intelligent RX-3000 
 computor which has taken over control of the EXPLORAN 1 base, thus posing a 
 tremendous danger. 
The only possible way to succeed lies in a secret code which once entered 
 into the system will pause the RX-3000 for ten hours. 
 Unfortunately the secret code is divided into 13 parts which have been 
 hidden in computor terminals in different sectors of EXPLORAN 1 . 
 It is your job to find the single parts, combine them in a logical and  
 distinct way and finally to transmit the secret code to the CPU of the 
 RX-3000. 
During the game you are John, the son of professor Warren . 
Watch out: EXPLORAN 1 is equipped with the most dangerous robot-guards !! 
But hurry !!    You just have 24 hours left... 
 
EXPLORAN 1 has been constructed with five sectors: 
 
 1. Sector: Storage sector and platform east 
 2. Sector: Engine sector 
 3. Sector: Scientific sector and platform west 
 4. Sector: Work sector 
 5. Sector: Main computor 
  
In order to find the different parts of the code you will have to check every 
 single terminal since even one missing part will make completion of the code 
 impossible. 
When you activate a terminal you will find the following menu: 
 
 
 
     1."SOLVE CODE" or "NO CODE AVAILABLE" 
     2."DISK OPERATION" 
     3."GAME STATUS" 
     4."ACTUAL ENEMIES" 
 
 
 
 
                          1. SOLVE CODE 
 
 
If the first line says "SOLVE CODE" the terminal contains a part of the  
 secret code. 
Choosing this option you will reach a special system which will search for 
 the hidden part of the code automatically. 
The part will not be displayed directly but instead you will be confronted 
 with a line of figures of which the last figure is missing. 
For instance: 1 2 3 4 5 ?? 
The lines always have a logical structure. 
Naturally in the example above the missing number is 6. 
But it's not always that easy. 
If you enter the correct answer the desired part of the code will be freed 
 from the terminal. 
If the terminal does not hold a part of the code the first line says ... 
 "NO CODE AVAILABLE". 
 
 
                           
                          2. DISK OPERATIONS 
 
 
With this option you can load and save up to ten different game 
 configurations. 
Every entry shows the level and the percentage of completion when the game 
 was saved. 
 
 
 
                          3. GAME STATUS 
  
 
This option enables you to see all data of the current game: 
 
   - The percentage of completion 
   - The list of the found parts of the code 
   - The amount of energy and oxygen 
 
 
 
                           
                          4. ACTUAL ENEMIES 
 
 
With this option you can take a look at the tecnical information on all 
 robots in this level. 
 
 
 
                               EXTRAS 
 
 
In some of the sectors you will find useful extras which will ease playing  
 the game and of which some are even necessary to finish the game: 
  
 
     1. Red card to open doors 
     2. Blue card to leave sector 
     3. Firepower 
     4. Control board 
     5. Shield 
     6. Oxygen mask 
     7. Magnetic card 
     8. Portable computor
