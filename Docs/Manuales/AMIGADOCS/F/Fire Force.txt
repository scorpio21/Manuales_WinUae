-====================================-     -========-    -==============-

WELCOME TO FIREFORCE. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO ENTER THE EXCITING WORLD OF AN
ELITE FORCES COMBAT HERO. YOU WILL UNDERTAKE A VARIETY OF MISSIONS
INCLUDING FIRE FIGHTS, UNDERCOVER RESCUE AND ASSASSINATIONS.

DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR. SPECIAL UNITS WERE FORMED OF HIGHLY TRAINED
MEN FOR UNCONVENTIONAL OPERATIONS BEHIND ENEMY LINES. THESE UNITS INCLUDED
THE `CHINDITS` THE `COMMANDOS` THE `US RANGERS` AND THE `OSS`. THE MEMBERS
OF THESE UNITS WERE SELECTED VOLUNTEERS FROM THE MILITARY SERVICES WHO,
AFTER THE MOST RIGOROUS TRAINING (WHICH ELIMANTED 50%) WERE INDUCTED INTO
THE SPECIAL FORCES.

THE VALUE AND NEED FOR SUCH HIGHLY TRAINED ELITE UNITS WAS WIDELY REGONISED
AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND MANY NATIONS INCORPORATED SUCH GROUPS INTO
THEIR ARMED FORCES, SUCH NAMES AS THE `SAS IN THE UK, THE NAVY SEALS AND
RANGERS IN THE USA (I THOUGHT RANGERS WERE FROM SCOTLAND HEHEHE) ARE WIDELY
KNOWN AND RESPECTED PARTICULARLY FOR THEIR FAMOUS ACTIONS AGAINST
TERRORISTS.

THE `US RANGERS` FEATURED IN FireForce WERE SET UP IN 1962 AND USED
EXTENSIVELY IN THE VIETNAM WAR IN THE MEKONG DELTA AND OTHER AREAS. THEIR
SPECIAL SPHERE IS AMPHIBIOUS INFILITRATION ALONG THE COASTS AND IN RVIERINE
AREAS,, PENETRATING INLAND TO CONDUCT SPECIAL OPERATIONS IN HOSTILE
TERRITORY. IN VIETNAM THEY OPERATED EXTENSIVELY BEHIND ENEMY LINES LAYING
AMBUSHES,UNDERTAKING RESCUE MISSIONS AND DEMOLITION OPERATIONS.

IN FireForce YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME ONE OF THESE INTREPID
FIGHTERS AND UNDERTAKE A NUMBER OF DANGEROUS MISSIONS. YOU MUST USE YOUR
KNOWLEDGE OF WEAONARY AND YOUR CO-ORDINATION SKILLS TO OVERCOME THE
TERRORISTS OR ENEMY FORCES RANGED AGAINST YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
