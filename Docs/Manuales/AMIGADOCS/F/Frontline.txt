        Welcome  to  Frontline.  This  file  tells  you  about  any
      specific details and changes to this Amiga version.

      STARTING FRONTLINE
      ------------------
        If you have a megabyte or more of memory, Workbench will be
      loaded, and Frontline  can  be  started  by  clicking  on the
      FRONT.PRG icon. If  you  only  have  512k,  Frontline will be
      booted directly after you have been  given the option to view
      this file, to  save  memory,  also  the  CLI  window  and the
      Workbench screen will also be closed to conserve memory.

      ADDITIONS TO ST VERSION
      -----------------------
        There have been some additions  to the version of Frontline
      on the ST. To  start,  during  the  leader and support weapon
      selection procedure, an extra  icon  (shaped  as a cross) has
      been added to allow the selection  for the current unit to be
      cancelled.
        The  sound  effects  are   sampled,  rather  than  computer
      generated - hopefully this gives a better atmosphere.
        'Hidden' Units have also  been  added,  this means the only
      enemy units you can see on the  map are those that are within
      the line-of-sight  of  your  units.  This  means  you  can be
      ambushed by a hidden enemy unit, but of course you can make a
      surprise attack yourself.

      LOADING & SAVING
      ----------------
        Before you start, it's a  good  idea  to format a couple of
      blank disks, so that you can save a scenario if you need to.
      The disks should be called  'FRONTSAVE' so that Frontline can
      find them when it saves a game,  a script file is provided on
      the Frontline disk for  this  purpose. Simply double-click on
      the FormatSaveDisk icon on the  Frontline disk and follow the
      instructions,  inserting  the  disk   to  be  formatted  when
      prompted. If your  machine  is  512k  and  the Frontline disk
      normally  boots  directly  into  the  game,  boot  with  your
      WorkBench disk and then insert  the  Frontline disk to access
      the utility (Note: There  will  not  be  enough memory to run
      Frontline if your machine  normally  boots  straight into the
      game).
        You can only save one game  per  disk, sorry that this is a
      bit cumbersome, but I didn't  have  time  to implement a more
      elegant save/load method. In  most  cases  however, you won't
      have to use the save option  as  the scenarios can usually be
      finished in a couple of hours. Also, users with 512k machines
      may not be able to save some of the larger scenarios.

      PRINTER SUPPORT
      ---------------
        You can print out the current status of your units with the
      Print Status option from the Units menu. If you boot from the
      Frontline disk, the printer is setup to use a generic printer
      attached to the  parallel  port.  You  will  have  to use the
      Preferences program that  comes  on  your  Workbench  disk to
      alter the configuration if required.

      HARD-DRIVES
      -----------
        Frontline can be quite happily  moved on a hard-drive. (The
      development of Frontline took place on a hard-drive and quite
      happily lives there.) You  must  however,  have  at least one
      megabyte of memory together with you  hard drive (as I'm sure
      99.9% of hard-drive owners have)  because of the large amount
      of memory a hard-drive eats.
        Transferring via Workbench is easiest:

      1) Create a drawer for Frontline  on the hard-drive, and drag
      over all the icons on the Frontline disk.

      2) Click on the HDInstall  icon  -  this  will copy ZRead and
      IconX from the Frontline  disk  to  the  C:  directory of the
      hard-drive. These programs are  used  by  the READ_ME.PRG and
      HDAssign icons. Once this is  done,  the   HDInstall icon can
      be deleted from the Hard-drive.

      3)  Frontline  gets  the  scenario   data  from  the  logical
      directory FRONTLINE: you can  either  insert  a  line in your
      startup-sequence as follows,  'ASSIGN  FRONTLINE: path' where
      path is the full pathname of the Directory where you have put
      Frontline. Alternatively,  run  the  HDAssign  program, which
      will set up everything for  you,  for that session. (You will
      have to re-run it everytime you reboot). Make sure you remove
      the Frontline disk before running this program, or it will not
      run correctly.
         This operation will allow for  future extra scenario disks
      if produced.

      THANK-YOUS
      ----------
        Ok, here goes, first  of  all  Alan  Lenton for writing the
      original version of Frontline on  the  ST,  and for giving me
      the job of converting it.  Thanks  to  Stuart Cupit for a few
      spot graphic effects and  the  Workbench  icon when my dismal
      artistic capabilities failed me.
        Thanks to Nico Francois for PowerPacker which allowed me to
      cram everything onto  one  disk.  (Well  worth  the Shareware
      fee!)
        Thank to you, the customer  for  buying  this game - I hope
      you enjoy it!

      A couple of words from Alan Lenton:

      CHANGES
      -------
         As a result of comments  from  the playtesters, one or two
      of the scenarios  have  had  the  forces  fighting the battle
      altered. In particular the  number  of  Allied  squads in the
      Cassino scenario has been reduced by about a third.

      PLAYING THE SCENARIOS
      ---------------------
         Some of the scenarios  are  more  difficult than others. I
      would suggest that the best order in which to play them is:
            Assault on Hill 193 (covers  infantry units and support
      weapons)
            Pegasus Bridge
            Stalingrad
            Clear the Convent (adds an artillery unit)
            Guadalcanal (adds off-map artillery)
            Cassino

      For the record, my favourite scenario  -  and that of most of
      the playtesters - is  Pegasus  Bridge.  None of the scenarios
      are impossible - but when you first start, you might find it
      easier to turn off the  timer  (see  the manual for details).
      Usually you will find it easier to play the defender.

         One brief note on off-map artillery - since it is possible
      to call down a barrage on  your  own head (very useful if you
      are in a bunker and the opposition is in the open!) you can't
      cancel a spotting round by clicking  on your own player. Find
      a piece of dead ground and direct the round to that!

      FURTHER SCENARIOS
      -----------------
         If the demand is great  enough,  then  I will produce some
      further scenarios for the game.  These  will probably only be
      available on Mail Order. To be notified of further scenarios,
      please complete and return the  registration card in the game
      box. Because of the fact that scenarios won't run without the
      main  program,  it  is  unlikely   that  the  scenarios  will
      available in the shops.

      LAST WORD
      ---------
         Frontline is deliberately NOT copy protected, since I find
      copy protection a pain, and I'm sure  you do as well. That is
      why you can copy the game onto hard disks. Please don't abuse
      the trust by giving copies to other people.

         I hope  you  enjoy  playing  Frontline.  I'd  be  happy to
      receive any comments, or suggestions for future scenarios.
      You can send them to me  c/o  CCS, 14 Langton Way, London SE3
      7TL.

            Have fun

INTRODUCTION
 
The Second World War is rightly considered to be the place and time 
when armoured forces came into their own. Sadly, the prominence 
achieved by armoured forces has allowed the contribution of the
infantry to be overlooked.
 
As early as the first month of the war, the vulnerability of tanks to
determined soldiers was demonstrated in no uncertain fashion. In the
suburbs of Warsaw, 4th Panzer Division lost 60 tanks in a single day!
 
Many of the battles in the Pacific were fought without the benefit of
tanks, and most of the fighting in the cities of Europe and Russia was
almost exclusively the preserve of the infantry. Frontline is a squad
level simulation of some of the aspects of these battles. The battles
chosen are drawn from different theatres of war, and, if there is a
demand, I will produce scenario disks for other battles.

In writing Frontline I have tried to produce a game which is playable,
doesn't cheat in favour of the computer, tried to give some idea of what
the battles were like, and helps give the player an understanding of
basic infantry tactics. These objectives are contradictory, and only the
player can judge whether the necessary compromises were correct!

Players of board games will recognise many ideas and techniques in
Frontline, but i have tried to make use of the strengths of the the computer,
and minimise its weaknesses vis a vis board games. Where there was
a clash between playability and simulation, I have usually come down
on the side of playability.

The most important factor affecting the performance of squads in
Frontline is morale. I think it was Napoleon who said that `in war the
spiritual is to the material as three is to one'. And he knew a thing or
two about waging war! Thus the concept of morale and leadership is
central to the game. Make sure that the squads in the key positions
have adequate leadership, and they will be able to hold against the
odds!

                                                              Alan Lenton

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0   SETTING UP

1.1   Choosing the Scenario

The initial screen allows you to select one of the following 6 scenarios:

   Assault on Hill 139 (Training)
   Clear the Convent (Training)
   Pegasus Bridge
   Stalingrad
   Guadalcanal
   Cassino

Select the GAME drop-down menu, click on SCENARIO, and
information about the first scenario will appear. There will be two icons:

-------
| \ \ |   
| / / |   Click to move to the next scenario.
-------

-------
|---- |  
| E \/|  Click to select the scenario currently displayed.
-------

Alternatively you can load a saved game; click on LOAD GAME and 
follow the instructions on the screen.

1.2  Choosing Your Side

Once the scenario has loaded you must choose your side. Click on
NEXT to switch between the two sides and SELECT to select your side.

For each side you will be given information about the units. There are
two types of unit - an infantry squad, consisting of five or ten men, or
an artillery piece and its crew.

For artillery units, you will be given the type of gun and its size.

If the unit is infantry the numbers next to the unit's name refer to its
firepower, range and morale - for instance, 4-5-7 means a firepower
4, a range 5 and morale 7.

You will also be told what support weapons each side has available,
with the firepower and range for each weapon (where appropriate) -
ie 5-11 means a firepower 5 and a range 11.

Finally you are told what leaders are available and the appropriate
combat modifier. Units with leaders do better in combat; the lower the
combat modifier, the more effective the leader. Leaders can only be
allocated to infantry squads - artillery pieces may or may not already
have an artillery leader.

1.3   Allocating Leaders

Once you have selected your side you can allocate leaders. Information
is shown about each squad. You can call up this information at any 
time - it is explained fully in the Information sections. You will be told
whether the unit starts the game off the map. If so, you are told on which
turn it appears.

-------
| \ \ | This icon will move you through the available squads. When the
| / / | chosen squad appears, click on the leader you wish to allocate. 
-------
        When you have finished allocating leaders, click. If you click
------- before you have finished you can change your mind, but you 
|---- | cannot re-allocate the leaders already assigned. Confirm that
| E \/| you are happy with your allocation, and you will proceed to the
------- next stage.

1.4   Allocating Support Weapons

The next screen allows you to allocate support weapons. You can only
allocate support weapons to infantry squads.

------- Use this icon to display the squad you wish to allocate to, then
| \ \ | click on the weapon you wish to give it. There are three types of 
| / / | machine gun - light, medium and heavy - but they all have the
------- same icon.

You are given information about the weapon you have selected - range
and firepower, ammunition available, and weight. See the section on
Support Weapons for more information. The important thing at this
stage is the weight; this affects the movement rate of the squad carrying
it. A full squad can carry up to five points; a half squad two. You can 
allocate more than one item to a squad, as long as it can carry the
weight.

------- 
|---- | Once you have finished click here. You can return to the
| E \/| allocations screen, but you cannot change allocations already
------- made.

Confirm the you have finished allocating and you will be presented
with the main game screen.

2.0   THE GAME

2.1   Making Decisions

In Frontline both you and the computer make decisions - where to
move your units, who to attack, whether to engage in combat.
                                                           
The computer resolves the decisions and calculates          
the outcome. This is called `rolling the dices', by analogy 
with board games.                                          
                                                               
If you have the DISPLAY option in the XTRAS pull-down menu
switched on, you roll the dice yourself. If this option is not selected, the
computer resolves the decisions and you will only be told the outcome.

If you choose to roll the dice yourself, the computer will show you how
it calculates the outcome.

The game uses the equivalent of two six-sided dice rolled 
simultaneously and added together. Thus, the highest number you can
roll is 12 and the lowest 2.

For all dice rolls, the lower number, the better the result.

The `raw' dice roll can be altered by various modifiers which are added
to it, to take account of the circumstances. Modifiers can be either
positive or negative. Since your aim is to roll low numbers it follows that
negative modifiers help you and positive modifiers hinder you.

For example, you wish to fire on an enemy unit occupying a crater,
providing a cover of +2. You have a leader of -1. You roll a 9 so the
result will be 9 + 2 - 1 = 10 (hands up those who had to reach for a
calculator!)

When you roll the dice, click the left mousebutton once to start, and
once to stop. Then click on CONTINUE and the computer will apply 
any modifiers to calculate the outcome.

2.2   The Screen/Terrain

The menu bar at the top of the screen and the icons at the botton will
be explained as the game progresses. Just above the icons is a box 
where information about the progress of the game appears - for
example, telling you it is your turn to move.

On the left hand side is a panel where information and selection icons
for your units will be displayed.

(Picture of the gamescreen here)

The main part of the screen is a `window' showing the part of the map
where the action takes place. At the start of all scenarios, the window
is placed at the top left hand corner of the map.

The picture gives an indication of the type of terrain; for more detailed
information, click on the map and you will be told what the terrain is.
The types of terrain found in the different scenarios are:


TERRAIN            HEIGHT         COVER         MOVEMENT
                                                 COSTS

Barbed Wire          0              0              5
Bridge            variable         +1              2
Clear                0              0              2 
Crater               0             +2              3
Deep Crater         -1             +1              3
Jungle              +3             +4              5
Rail Line            0              0              2
Ravine              -1             +1              3
Road                 0              0              2
Rubble              +1             +3              4
Sandbags            +1             +3              3
Slit Trench          0             +2              4
Stone Building      +2             +4              3
Swamp/Marsh          0              0              4
Trees               +2             +2              3
Water                0              0              8
Wreckage             1             +2              4 

Each of these aspects of the terrain is important for a different reason.

Height
The height of the terrain you are occupying compared to the
surrounding terrain affects how much of the area you can see. This is
known as `Line of Sight'. Obviously, to shoot at an enemy unit you must
be able to see it! Lines of sight are reciprocal - if you can see an enemy
unit, it can see (and shoot at!) you.

When looking at the height of terrain you must take into account the
`base' height and the "feature" height. For example, a crater has a
height of -1, but if the crater is on top of a hill with a height of 3, then
the actual height is 2.

------- (RYGAR: THIS IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW AN ICON THAT HAS ARROWS POINTING)
||\ /|| (       OUT IN ALL FOUR DIAGONAL DIRECTIONS, HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND!)
|  #  | You can check the Line of Sight for any unit by selecting the unit
||/ \|| and then clicking on this icon. All areas of the map the unit cannot 
------- see will be greyed out. This only works for the portion of the map 
        displayed on the screen.

So how are lines of sight calculated?

---------------------------------------------------------


Cover
Cover combines two factors; how much the terrain conceals the
occupying unit, and how much protection it offers. For example, a field
of wheat hides a unit very well - but doesn't provide much protection.
Conversely, a unit occupying a stone bunker will be fairly visible, but
several feet of concrete usually stops a bullet adequately!

These two factors are combined to provide the figure for cover. When
you fire on a unit, a modifier is added for the cover provided by the
terrain.

Movement Cost
Movement simply defines how easy it is to move through the different
types of terrain. Each unit has a number of movement points they can
use each turn. The movement cost of the terrain they are moving onto
is deducted for each move. Moving uphill costs an extra movement
point, and carrying unpacked support weapons also increases the cost.

When you move a unit you need to take into account the factors of
height, cover and movement cost before deciding which route to take.
Obviously, you will be able to move faster on clear ground, but it is more
likely you will be hit by enemy fire.

2.3   Your Forces

You scroll the map in the eight compass directions by clicking on the
arrows in the lower right hand corner.

Do this until you find your forces. Units are
represented by an icon on the map, the colour
depending on the nationality:

   British and Commonwealth        Blue
   German                          Grey
   German SS                       Black
   American                        Red
   Japanese                        Light Brown
   Soviet                          Red

------------

If you are not sure whether the unit belongs to your side or not, click
on it! If it belongs to the enemy, you will be told so. If it is your unit a
set of icons comes up in the box on the left of the screen. This is the
control panel, which you use to give orders to the selected unit.

A faster way to find your forces is to use the BRIEFING option in the
UNITS menu. This brings up a list of your units in the information panel.
If the unit's name is grey, it means it is either dead, off the map, or
broken, If it is yellow, it can still make an action that turn; and if white,
it is on the map but has finished its action for that turn.

Clicking on the unit's name if it is dead or off the map brings up
information about the unit. Otherwise, clicking on the name will centre
the map on the unit and bring up the control panel. If the unit is near
the edge of the map, the screen will scroll until the unit is as near to the
centre as possible.

Whenever you select a unit, either by clicking on it or by using the
BREIFING option, the colours of its icon are reversed.

3.0   THE CONTROL PANEL ICONS

When a unit is selected, the control panel appears in the box on the
left of the screen. Some of the icons in the control panel can only be
used by infantry squads, some only by artillery units. Depending on the
state of the game not all of the options will be available to the selected
unit, in which case the icon will be blank.

The icons in the control panel are fully explained in the relevant sections
of the manual, but briefly they are:

3.1   Instructing Your Units

Having found one of your units, there are are several things you can tell it
to do. If it is an infantry squad, it can move, fire at an enemy unit, go
into close combat (if it is adjacent to an enemy unit), use a support
weapon, or call down a barrage from an off-map artillery battery (if it
has a radio).

An artillery piece can turn the barrel of the gun to point in a different
direction, or fire on another unit.

Some of these actions take up a whole turn; but others, such as calling
down a barrage, allow you to give the unit further orders in the same
turn.

You do not have to give a unit all its orders   -----------------------------
for that turn before instructing another unit;  |                           |

The squad is either a full squad (ten men)      |                           |

explained in the section on Morale.             |             ------------- |

Morale is an indicator of how easily the squad will become broken, and
is explained fully in the Morale section.

The Leadership affects the damage the unit will do when attacking an
enemy unit. As in real life, the better the leader (ie the lower the
modifier) the more effective the unit will be.

The unit's firepower also affects their fighting ability; the higher the
firepower, the better the result in an attack.

Range limits how far the unit can actually fire.

If the squad is carrying support weapons, these will be listed.

Calibre is the size of the weapon. The higher the calibre, the higher the
firepower will be.

The range of the gun limits what it can fire at. Some artillery units have
both a maximum and a minimum range.

The rate of fire indicates how many shots it can have in each turn.

Ammunition refers to the number of shots the gun can make before
running out, and acquired targets are explained in the section on Firing
- Artillery

3.4   Movement - Infantry

----------
|Picture |

|diagonal| Infantry squads can be moved by clicking on this icon.
|arrows! |
----------

The background of the movement arrows in the bottom right hand
corner will change colour to red. Clicking on the arrows moves the
squad in any of the eight compass directions.

The movement points (M-P) available for the squad will be shown in
the information box under the map. Each time you move the squad, the
M-P will be reduced according to the terrain they are moving onto. If
the squad is moving uphill, the movement cost increases by one.
Information on terrain types is displayed in the top right of the screen.

----------
||_|_|_|_| Click on this icon to show the individual squares on the map,
||_|_|_|_| which helps you to calculate how far the unit can move in one
||_|_|_|_| turn. The computer knows that if you are moving diagonally, it
|| | | | | uses more M-P than moving horizontally or vertically! 
----------

If the squad is carrying unpacked support weapons, the movement cost
is increased by the weight of the unpacked weapon(s). If you wish to
move the unit more than a couple of squares before using the weapon,
you should pack the support weapon first; however, if you only wish to
move the unit a short distance it is not worth losing a turn to pack the
weapon, and another to unpack it. See the section on Support Weapons
for details of how to pack or unpack weapons.

You cannot move a squad into a location containing another unit.

-------- When you have moved the squad as far as you wish (or as far 
| ---- | as you can!) click on the END button to return to the control
| E  \/| panel. If your moves have reduced the squad's M-P to zero or
-------- one, you will automatically be returned to the panel.    

Having moved a squad, you can do no more with it that turn.

3.5   Movement - Artillery

Artillery units are stationery, but if you wish to fire the gun at an enemy
unit, you must make sure it is pointing in the right direction! The picture
underneath the unit icons shows which way the gun is pointing.

------------------- 
|  ----  |  ----  | Use these two icons to turn the gun 90 degrees anti-

map displayed on the screen.

3.6   Firing - Infantry

--------- If there is a unit in range, you can instruct your squad to fire at
|   |   | it by clicking this icon. A grid will come up over the map and you
| -- -- | can click on the target. If you change your mind, click on the
|   |   | firing unit and you will be returned to the control panel.
---------

---------
| |\ /| | To fire on another unit, the target must be in sight. Clicking on
|   #   | this icon will grey out any part of the map currently on the screen
| |/ \| | that the unit cannot see.
---------

As in real life, it is perfectly possible to fire on your own side!

If you have DISPLAY selected, a box appears giving the firing details.
At the top, the squad's firepower is shown. This is the inherent firepower
of the squad. If the squad is carrying a machine gun, it is possible to
add the firepower of the gun to the inherent firepower - see the section
on Support Weapons.

If the squad is firing at poing blank range - ie the target is an adjacent
square - the firepower is doubled. Any modifiers for leadership or
terrain are indicated - having a leader increases the likely damage the
unit does to its target, but the better the cover provided by the terrain
the enemy occupies, the less damage it will sustain.

Possible outcomes of firing or being fired upon are:

   - - - -  No Effect

     MC  -  Unit's morale is checked (you do not see the result of an
            enemy unit's morale check)

     L_KIA - Unit's leader is killed     
       
     KIA   - The unit is wiped out

     HALF  - The unit is reduced in size to a half squad (half squads
             won't reduce to quarter squads;they are either wiped out or they
             survive intact)           

3.7   Firing - Artillery

---------
|   |   | Clicking on this icon puts a grid over the map and allows you to
| -- -- | select your target - use the arrows to scroll the map until you
|   |   | find the target.
---------

There are two stages to firing an artillery unit. The first determines
whether you hit your target or not. You are shown the basic roll for the
weapon (which is different for each type of weapon) and any modifiers
that will affect the outcome - leadership, barrel size (the longer the
barrel the more accurate the weapon), and range (some types of gun
are particularly accurate at certain ranges - and some particularly
inaccurate!)

A modifier is also used for an acquired target. If the weapon has already
succeeded in hitting the target it has a better chance of hitting it a
second time, and is considered to have acquired a target. The target
refers to the square on the map, not the unit occupying it. So if you kill
a unit and another unit moves into the same square, the modifier still
applies. Acquired targets are carried over from turn to turn.

The information about the unit tells you whether it has an aquired
target or not; however, it does not tell you where the target is, it is up
to you to remember!

The modifier for size refers to the size of the target - obviously, the
bigger the target, the easier it is to hit.

The final result which you need to roll in order to hit the target is shown
in the red box at the top of the screen.

If you miss, you just have to try again. Some artillery can be fired more 
than once in a turn - this is shown as rate of fire in the information
about the unit.

If you hit, the dice are rolled again to calculate the damage, with
modifiers taken into account for leadership and terrain.

If while firing an artillery unit, you roll a number greater than or equal
to that shown for its jamming possibility, the weapon is damaged and
will need to be repaired on your next turn. Click on this icon and roll the
dice to try and fix it. The result will be:

    No effect at all, in which case you have to try and repair it again
    next turn

    Success, it which case it is usable next turn

    The weapon is irrepairable.

Attempting a repair uses up a whole turn.

3.8   Under Fire

If the computer fires on one of your units, you will be told that your unit
is under fire and the map will centre on the affected unit. The computer
will resolve the combat and tell you the outcome.

You won't be told who is firing on you - as in real life, you will have to
work it out for yourself.

The possible outcomes of enemy fire are:

    Your unit is wiped out completely

    Your unit is reduced to a half squad, and will lose any support
    weapons it can no longer carry (if the unit is an artillery unit it is
    assumed to have a five-man crew so won't reduce in size)

    You will need to check the morale of your unit (see the section on
    Morale)

    Or your unit will escape unscathed.

3.9   Support Weapons

--------- You may have allocated support weapons to an infantry squad,
|Picture| and clicking on this icon will bring up information about the
|of a   | weapon, and the weapon's icons which you use to control the
|gun    | support weapons.
---------

            Clicking on this icon doesn't actually fire the weapon; to do  
            that, exit the weapons icons and use the firebutton in the unit's
            control panel. 
           

----------- This icon instructs the squad to pack or set up the weapon.
|Picture  | Obviously a weapon can't be used while it is packed, but if it is

|gun taken| - the weapon's weight is added to the movement costs of the

--------- This icon fires the weapon separately from the squad's inherent
|   |   | firepower. All weapons except machine guns must be fired in
| -- -- | this manner. The range will be that of the weapon itself (mortars
|   |   | have a minimum range of 2).
---------

If the support weapon is fired first, the squad can then move, which it
cannot do if the weapon is added to the inherent firepower.

Alternatively, having used the support weapon on its own the squad
can then use its inherent firepower separtely - in effect getting two
shots in one turn. Again, the support weapon must be fired first. The
squad need not fire its inherent fier power at the same target as the
support weapon.

--------- 
|Picture| If a support weapon jams you will need to repair it before it can

|monkey | takes a full turn. Depending on the roll of the dice, the outcome

---------
          
      A successfull repair meaning the weapon can be used next turn     
 
      A failure in which case you have to try again next turn

      A complete disaster which puts the weapon right out of

Although radios are counted as support weapons, and you can get 
information on them using the support weapon's icon (and repair them
if they become damaged!) you don't actually use them with this icon.
See the next section for details of how you do use them.

3.10   Barrage

---------
|Picture| If the squad has a radio, it can call in a barrage from an off-map
|of a   | artillery battery using this icon. Information about the battery
|cannon!| available will be displayed - its calibre (the higher the calibre,
--------- the higher the firepower) and the number of salvoes available.

NOTE: the off-map artillery is separate from any artillery on the map.

Using an artillery battery involves three stages, and the current stage
is shown in the status. Each of these stages takes one turn - however,
you can go on and give the squad further instructions, such as moving
or fighting, in the same turn, as long as you can use the barrage first.

First you have to contact the battery by radio. The dice roll decides
whether you succeed in making contact. If you fail, you have to try again
on your next turn. If the radio breaks down, it must be repaired before
you can use it again.

If the unit is in contact with the artillery, you can select the target by
clicking on the map. A spotting round is sent in (there is no limit to the
number of spotting rounds available). Unfortunately there's no
guarantee the spotting round will land where you expect it - it can even
land out of sight, in which case you have to call down another on your
next turn.

A barrage will cover an area of nine squares, centred around the square
where the spotting round lands. It is a good idea to centre the map on
your intended target before calling in the spotting round - you have a
better chance of seeing where it lands.

It's also worth using the line of sight icon to check how much of the
surrounding terrain is visible.

If a spotting round lands on the same square as an enemy unit (or one
of your units!) the computer will resolve the decision and tell you the
result.

On your third turn, you can call down the barrage if you wish. You are
presented with four icons.



               -------- These two icons are either/or icons - one of them  
Cant see this! | _/\_ | is always selected and you toggle between the two.
SHIT!          |  \/  | They determine whether the barrage or the spotting
               -------- round is moved if you decide to change the target.

------
|\  /| This icon takes you back to stage 2, allowing you to select a new
| \/ | target for a spotting round. You should use this if the spotting
| /\ | round landed way off target. 
|/  \| 
------

------- This icon allows you to move the barrage or the spotting round
||\ /|| (whichever has been selected) by one square. If barrage is 
|  X  | selected it will move the target in the chosen direction, then bring
||/_\|| down a barrage; if the spotting round is selected it simply moves
------- the target.

-------
|     | This icon brings down the barrage on the current target - no
|  !  | matter whether the barrage icon or the spotting round icon are 
|     | selected, the barrage will commence!
|     |
-------

For each unit that the barrage hits - including your own - the computer
will resolve the conflict.

It is sometimes worth bringing down a barrage on your own head,
particularly if your unit is well protected but is surrounded by enemy
units in the open.

3.11   Close Combat

---------
|Picture| If an infantry squad is adjacent to an enemy unit, it can engage
|of a   | in close combat. In close combat, the defender is always given
|knife! | the first bash.
---------

Artillery units cannot initiate close combat but they can defend 
themselves if attacked, in which case they use their inherent firepower,
which is 2, and have five men.

In close combat, the firepower used to resolve each attack is the unit's
inherent firepower plus 1. As the troops are killed or wounded the
firepower is reduced proportionally. If the defending unit is broken, its
firepower is halved.

Support weapons cannot be used in close combat - you could use a
support weapon to 'soften up' the enemy before engaging in close
combat, but you can't bring it into play once the fight is in progress.

The information box on the left of the screen shows the result of each
attack - the dice rolled, the modifiers for leadership and close combat
(this redudces by one each round of the combat as the squads locate
the enemy dispositions, but will never go below -9) and the result.

Each round of close combat can result in either no effect, or a number
of the troops being killed. If the number of men remaining falls to five
or below, the unit becomes a half squad, with a consquent loss of
firepower and support weapons. If the number killed is greater than the
number remaining, the unit is wiped out.

In each round of the close combat, both you and the computer have
the option to attack or retreat - although artillery units cannot retreat,
they must fight or die!

If the defending unit retreats it will move out of the occupied square and
the attacker will move in. If the defending unit is completely surrounded
it has no choice but to surrender. If the attacking squad retreats, it will
not move but will simply stop attacking - but the defender is then able
to attack on its turn, if it wishes!

The close combat continues until one unit either retreats or is wiped
out.

3.12   Morale

A unit is broken when the troops are more concerned with their personal
survival than with achieving their objective. Rather than attacking, they
will (very sensibly) be running for cover.

If a unit is broken, it can do nothing that turn, except a single attempt
to rally the troops. Some units start the game cowering in a state of
panic and you must rally them before thay will be of any use!

-------- Clicking on this icon attempt to rally the troops. You must roll
| Dont | less or equal to their morale level. Modifiers are used for
| Know | leadership - a good leader stands more chance of bucking the
| This | troops up - and the fact that the unit is already broken, which
| Icon | makes it harder to persuade them to stand up and fight.
--------

If you successfully rally the squad, it can then proceed with the turn -
moving, fighting, or whatever. If you fail, it can do no more and you
must try again on your next turn.

If you roll an unmodified 2, the troops are rallied so successfully that
the unit's leadership is permanently improved by 1, but if you roll an
unmodified 12 the troops are not impressed by your hollow rhetoric and
the morale level is permanently reduced by 1!

On of the possible outcomes of being under fire is that the morale of
the troops will be checked to see if they break. This is handled in exactly
the same way as when you attempt to rally them, except that there may
be extra modifiers from the morale check result.

4.0   GAME PROGRESS

Depending upon which side you have chosen to play, either you or the
computer will get first turn. In all scenarios, the side that was displayed
first gets the first turn.

5.0   THE SCENARIOS

5.1   Introductory Scenarios

1.    The Assault on Hill 193

This special introductory scenario forms part of the operations covered
by the Cassino scenario. THis scnenario only uses a small number of
squads, and no artillery. It is designed to allow you to become familiar
with the way the game works.

It is the task of the Allied side to take out the bunker located on the hill
at the top of the map. From this bunker the Germans have a
commanding view of the operations in the town and, if they had a radio
would be ideally placed to direct artillery fire onto the Allied forces.

The nature of the terrain is such that the infantry can expect little
support from tanks, and so must take out the bunker on their own. To
do this they will need to take advantage of any cover available.

The German forces will need to deploy to cover as much of the hill as
possible, not just the bunker. The scenario shows the need for 'interval
troops' to protect strongpoints - try playing the game just using a squad
in the bunker if you don't believe it!

To win the Allies must eliminate ALL the German forces on the map.
The Germans win if the Allies fail.

2.     Clear the Convent

The second introductory scenario also comes from Cassino. It
introduces the use of on-map artillery pieces into the game - in this
case a 120mm mortar and crew.

To win the Allies must clear the map area of Germans - the Germans
win if the Allies fail.

5.2   Pegasus Bridge

On 6th June 1944 the Allies opened the much awaited Second Front
by invading Normandy. The operation was one of the largest seaborne
operations ever carried out. The task of securing the flanks of the
invasion and preventing the movement of enemy reinforcements was
allocated to the airborne divisions.

Part of the force began to clear out pill boxes on the eastern bank of
the canal, while the rest of the small force rushed the bridge. Once over
the bridge the German forces on the far side were dealt with rapidly,
and the crossing was secured.

The small force then held the bridge for the next two hours until linking
up with the main airborne force who had been dropped further east.

In honour of the men who took the bridge it was later renamed `Pegasus
Bridge' after the insignia of the airborne troops.

The scenario depicts the seizing of the bridge. The task of the Allies is
to take the bridge and clear the surrounding areo of German forces.
The aim of the Germans is to frustrate the Allies.

5.3   The End at Stalingrad

The Russian November offensive of 1943 smashed in the weak forces
holding the flanks of Army Group South. By the end of the month the
German Sixth Army in Stalingrad was firmly surrounded, and the
trapped men settled down to wait for relief to reach them.

The relief operations were entrusted to Manstein - one of Germany's
finest commanders - and he was given a motley force to accomplish
the task. By 12th December the relief forces were only 30 miles from
Stalingrad, but could make no further headway.

Hitler, however, refused to allow the Sixth Army to break out and so
the fate of the Sixth army was sealed... With Negligible supplies the
besieged fought on for another six weeks, until starving and out of
ammunition they could resist no longer.

On 31st January 1943, Paulus surrendered the German Sixth Army ay
Stalingrad in defiance of Hitler's orders to hold out to the end. In the
northern industrial sector the remnants of XI Corps refused to surrender
and continued to hold out.

They held out for a further two days, fighting in the rubble of the Tractor
Factory until 8:40 on 2nd February when they transmitted their last
message to the outside world. Half an hour later they were finally
overrun by the Russians, and the fighting at Stalingrad was over.

The scenario depicts the last of the fighting in the factory's fitting shop.
The aim of the Russians is to completely eliminate the German forces
- allowing the investing troops to be allocated to other operations. The
aim of the Germans is to delay   --------------------------------------------

5.4   Guadalcanal

In the Summer of 1942, the island of Guadalcanal suddenly assumed 
a major strategic importance, when it was found the Japanese were
building an airfield. From this position they could threaten the
US/Australia lines of communication.

The 1st Division of the US Marine Corps was hurriedly given the task
of taking the island. Given little time to prepare, the 19,000-strong
Division sailed.

The Marines landed and fought their way inland to the half built airfield,
securinng it within 36 hours. Menaced by the Japanese fleet, the US
transports and warships withdrew before unloading was complete.
Stretching their rations as best they could, strenghtening their defences
with captured weaponry, and fighting off both Japanese
counter-attacks and the problems of the intense heat and tropical
disease, the Marines completed building the airfield.

The Japanese were determined to re-take the island. Several
battalions under the command of Major-General Kiyotaki Kawaguchi
were landed, and on the nights of 12th and 13th September they

5.5   Cassino

The Allies landed in Italy in september 1943 but the advance soon
slowed and finally stalled in front of the Gustav Line. Stretching across
Italy, it was dominated by Monte Cassino, 1,700 ft high and blocking
the main road to Rome.

Showing a quality of generalship reminsicent of the First World War,
head-on attacks were launched on the Cassino massif. Bad weather
and the strong German opposition inflicted considerable losses on the
Allied forces.

Undeterred, higher command decided to continue the battering ram
attacks and brought up reinforcements in the form of the New Zealand
Corps. Battles continued to rage until the weather brought a halt to the
fightings.

Three weeks later the attack was renewed. The plan was for the 4th
Indian Division to ascend the Eastern slopes of Monastery Hill while
the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 4th Armoured Brigade entered
the town.

On 15th March more than 1,000 tons of bombs were dropped on the
narrow streets of Cassino, following by a 200,000 round barrage. The
town was reduced to rubble. Then generals were convinced that the
Germans had been wiped out.

They were wrong. Soldiers of
the German 1st Parachute
Division survived. Rubble and
huge craters stopped tanks
entering the town, and the
infantry were on their own.

They fought their way 250
yards into the town, but under
cover of night the Germans
brought in reserves. A week
later, on 23rd March the
disastrous assault was called 
off. Not until May did the Allies
take Cassino, and then only when the Germans withdrew. The way
was clears - at a cost of 105,000 casualties.

The scenario depicts the start of the assault on the town. The task of
the New Zealand forces is to clear the sector represented by the
map of German forces. The German aim is to survive...
