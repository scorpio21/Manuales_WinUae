FUZZBALL -THE STORY -
-------------------
ANOTHER DAY HAD COME AND GONE JUST AS SLOWLY AS THEY ALWAYS HAD. THE WIZARDS
APPRENTICE WAS GROWING MORE ANXIOUS BY THE DAY AND HIS OVER ENTHUSIASM HAD
LANDED HIM IN BIG TROUBLE ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. HE WAS FED UP.HIS MASTER
STILL HAD`NT NAMED THE DAY WHEN HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO BOAST OF JOINING THE RANKS
OF HIGH ORDER WIZARDS. THERE WAS STILL A LOT OF TEACHING TO DO.

THOUGH HIS HEART YEARNED FOR THE GOOD TIMES AHEAD AND THE EVOLUTION OF HIS
MAGICAL PROWESS,HIS YOUNG HEAD TOLD HIM TIME AND TIME AGAIN NOT TO BE EAGER
AND TO APPRECIATE THAT THE DRAWN OUT OUT TRAINING PROCESS WAS FOR HIS OWN 
GOOD. AFTER ALL HIS MOST COVETED POSSESSION WAS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE
DAY,EVENTUALLY, HE WILL HAVE THE POWER. HE WOULD HAVE SERVED HIS TIME WELL
AND BE AWARDED WITH HIS OWN MAGICAL STAFF,HIS OWN SNUG FITTING ELABORATE
ROBES AND HIS OWN NAIVE APPRENTICE JUST AS INTENT ON LEARNING THE WAYS OF
WIZARDRY AS HE WAS. DAYDREAMING OF THE FUTURE HELPED HIM THROUGH THE ARDOUS
SCHOOLING.

HOME TO THE YOUNG APPRENTICE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE ANCIENT MYSTICAL CASTLE HE
SHARED WITH HIS WISE OLD MENTOR.AS HE HAD GROWN,HE HAD ALWAYS TRIED TO SEE
THE SHEER SIZE OF THE CASTLE FROM GROUND LEVEL RIGHT TO THE VERY TOP. BUT HE
COULD NEVER SEE PAST THE VAST STONEWROK PIERCING THROUGH THE DARK AND SINISTER
CLOUDS ABOVE. THE CLOUDS WERE ALWAYS THERE. SWIRLING BLACK CLOUDS THAT HUNG
ABOVE THE CASTLE LIKE SOME GREAT RAMBLING CANOPY. FOREVER THROWING LIGHTNING
BOLTS AND LASHING TORRENTIAL RAIN DOWN UPON THE STONE MASS OF THE CASTLE.
THIS WAS HOW THE OLD WIZARD LIKED IT. THE ELECTRICAL STORMS HELPED FEED THE
MAGIC HE WAS MASTER OF,AND HIS MAGIC WAS PARTICULARLY POWERFUL AT TIMES OF
HIGH STORMS.

IT WAS ONE OF THESE PARTICULARARLY STORMY NIGHTS THAT THE APPRENTICE FOUND
HIMSELF ALONE IN ONE OF THE WIZARDS CHAMBERS. THE CHAMBER HAD A STRANGE
AURA ABOUT IT AND THE APPRENTICE COULD FEEL THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY GENERATED
WITHIN THE AIR BY THE HEAVY STORM BLOWING OUTSIDE.

THE MISCHEVIOUS APPRENTICE HAD COME TO THE CHAMBER TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE
BIG OLD CHEST,THE CONTENTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN A CLOSELY GUARDED BY THE WIZARD
FOR MANY YEARS. THE YOUNGSTER HAD BEEN COMING HERE FOR SOME TIME TO TOUCH AND
FEEL THE MYSTERIOUS CHEST. HE WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE WIZARD WOULD NOT SHOW OR
EVEN TELL HIM WHAT WAS INSIDE. HE WANTED TO KNOW IF ALL THE PICTURES HE HAD
BEEN PAINTING IN HIS MIND WERE AS VIVID IN REAL LIFE. THE APPRENTICE HAD
CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT THE GREAT OAK AND BRASS CHEST HOUSED A WEALTH OF
BEAUTIFUL TREASURES OF GOLD,RUBIES,DIAMONDS AND PEARLS.

HIS IMPETUOUS YOUTH HAD GOT THE BETTER OF HIM AND WHAT WAS INITIALLY INNOCENT
CURIOSITY HAD TURNED INTO A BURNING DESIRE TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS IN THE CHEST.
THE APPRENTICE SCANNED THE ROOM FOR ANY HINT OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP HIM
GAIN ENTRANCE TO THE MYSTERIOUS CHEST AND, AFTER TRYING NUMEROUS GADGETS AND
PROPS UNSUCCESFULLY IN THE LOCK,CAST HIS EYES ON THE WIZARDS GRAND SPELL BOOK
POSITIONING HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE OLD BOOK,HE BEGAN TO THUMB THROUGH THE
DUSTY PAGES. HE WAS AMAZED AT HOW MUCH HE STILL HAD TO LEARN. HE DID`NT REALLY
KNOW WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR,BUT HE WANTED ANY CLUE,ANY HINT OF A SPELL TO
HELP HIM.
HE THUMBED AND THUMBED THROUGH THE PAGES,PAUSING OCCASIONALLY TO BLOW DUST
FROM IN FRONT OF HIS FACE. HIS PACE QUICKENED WITH THE BEAT OF HIS HEART AS
HE BEGAN TO FEAR THE IMPENDING RETURN OF THE WIZARD.FASTER AND FASTER HE
LOOKED OVER THE PAGES UNTIL FINALLY SOMETHING CAUGHT HIS EYE. A SPELL TO OPEN
HE THOUGHT.THIS IS IT. HIS UNPREDICTABLE ENTHUSIASM HAD RETURNED AND HE BEGAN
TO READ OUT THE SPELL. A MAGIC GLOW APPEARED IN HIS HAND.HIS FACE LIT UP,THE
MAGIC WAS COMING. IF ONLY HE HAD READ OUT THE ENTIRE SPELL COMMAND FROM THE
BOOK AND NOT JUST WHAT HE THOUGHT ACCEPTABLE.

THE STORMS OUTSIDE WERE HIGH AND THE BOYS EYES LIT UP WITH THE EXCITEMENT AS
THE MAGIC BEGAN TO APPEAR IN HIS HAND. HE AIMED THE GLOWING ENERGY AT THE 
LOCK OF THE CHEST AND THEN LAUNCHED HIS CREATION AT THE TARGET.
THE CHEST BEGAN TO MAKE STRANGE NOISES AND RATTLED VIOLENTLY AROUND THE TABLE
IT WAS PLACED UPON,AS THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING RUMBLED AROUND THE CASTLE.

IN AN INSTANT, THE LID OF THE CHEST FLEW BACK AND HUNDREDS OF STRANGE BALLS
OF FLUFF BEGAN TO LEAP FROM IMPRISONMENT WITHIN THE CHEST.`WHAT COULD THEY BE`
AND MORE TO THE POINT `WHAT HAVE I DONE?`. ECHOED IN THE LADS HEAD AS FUZZBALL
AFTER FUZZBALL LEAPT TO THEIR FREEDOM AND BEGAN TO FILL THE CHAMBER. THE
STREAM OF FUZZBALLS SEEMED ENDLESS, AND AS THEY HIT THE FLOOR THEY BEGAN TO
GROW AND GROW.

AS THE FUZZBALLS GREW THE APPRENTICE TRIED TO IDENIFY THEM THROUGH HIS BLIND
PANIC. THE FUZZBALLS WERE ROUND AND LEERED MENACINGLY THROUGH HUGE ANGRY EYES
SOME HAD POINTED EARS,SOME HORNS,SOME EVEN RESEMBLED CIRCUS CLOWNS. THE
FUZZBALLS WERE BACK - AND THEY KNEW IT. THEY WERE CLUTCHING VARIOUS GEMS AND
VALUABLE FOOD TAKEN FROM THE CHEST AS THEY LAUNCHED THEIR MASS EXODUS. THESE
ITEMS WOULD HELP THEM SET UP FUZZBALL COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE GROUNDS OF THE
CASTLE.

THE APPRENTICE ON REALISING THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS,THEN TRIED TO REVERSE THE
D.I.Y SPELL HE HAD CREATED IN ORDER TO SEND THE FUZZBALLS BACK INTO THE CHEST
HIS INEXPERIENCE AND CONFUSION BROUGHT OUT ANOTHER SPELL,BUT SOMETHING WAS
NOT RIGHT,SOMETHING WAS DEFINATELY NOT RIGHT. THE MAGIC ENERGY DID NOT GO
WHERE IT WAS DIRECTED TO GO AND INSTEAD LOOMED BRIEFLY ABOVE THE APPRENTIVCE
BEFORE ENGULFING HIM IN A HUGE FLORESCENT BLUE FLASH OF LIGHT. THE VISION
HELD FOR SOME TIME AS A METORMORPHIS BEGAN TO APPEAR WITHIN THE MYSTIC LIGHT.
ARMS SEEMED TO BE SHRINKING BACK,LEGS RECEDING INTO NOTHING AND ALL THE TIME
BIG EYES WERE FORMING ON A BY NOW LARGE SPHERICAL OBJECT.

THE APPRENTICE, IN HIS HASTE TO REVERSE THE SPELL ABOUT WHICH HE KNEW NOTHING
HAD TURNED HIMSELF INTO A LARGE FUZZBALL.

THE FUZZBALLS THEN ROAMED FREE AND TOOK OVER THE VAST CORRIDORS,MAZES AND
CHAMBERS OF THE WIZARDS CASTLE. AS TIME PASSED THEY EVOLVED TO SUIT THEIR
PARTICULAR ENVIROMENT AND THE FUZZBALL COLONIES BECAME MORE DIVERSE AND
INCREASINGLY VICIOUS. AS FOR THE YOUNG APPRENTICE,HE GOT NO SYMPATHY FROM THE
OLD WIZARD WHO INSTEAD SENTENCED THE BOY TO REMAIN AS A BLUE FUZZBALL FOR HIS
PUNISHMENT. THE FUMING WIZARD LAID DOWN THE LAW,THE APPRENTICE COULD ONLY
RETURN TO HIS HUMAN FORM ONCE HE HAD COLLECTED AND RETURNED ALL THE FIENDISH
FUZZBALLS AND ALL THE JEWELS THEY TOOK WITH THEM,BACK TO THE STRANGE OLD
TREASURE CHEST FROM WHENCE THEY COME.

GENERAL GAMEPLAY TIPS.
----------------------
* THE FIRST ASPECT OF THE GAME YOU SHOULD MASTER IS THE `JOYSTICK CONTROLS`
* COLLECT ALL THE JEWELS AND FRUIT TO COMPLETE A LEVEL.
* BEFORE STARTING EACH LEVEL,`OBSERVE` THE SCENERY AND THE PLATFORM LAYOUT.
  ONE WRONG MOVE AND YOUR STRANDED.
* BLAST THE FIENDISH FLUFFIES UNTIL THEY SHRINK TO SIZE AND THEN KNOCK THEM
  OFF THE PLATFORMS TO SCORE POINTS.

BUT BEWARE,IF YOU ARE NOT QUICK ENOUGH THE FULUFFIES WILL REGROW INTO
NASTIER ENEMIES WHICH ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO KILL. THEY CHANGE COLOUR AND CARRY
HIGHER POINTS. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO VARY YOUR GAMEPLAY AS YOU MAY WISH TO LET
FLUFFIES REGROW INTO DIFFERENT COLOURS AND THEN KILL THEM TO ADD TO YOUR
SCORE.

THE ENEMY COLOUR AND SCORE PROGRESSION IS AS FOLLOWS:
* GREEN.....2000 POINTS
* PURPLE....4000 POINTS
* BLACK.....6000 POINTS
* RED.......FINAL COLOUR CHANGE,SO THESE EXPLODE WHEN DESTROYED AND CANNOT BE
  KNOCKED OFF THE PLATFORMS.

PLEASE NOTE: ONCE THE ENEMIES HAVE CHANGED TO PURPLE AND UPWARDS,THEY HAVE
THEIR OWN INTELLIGENCE AND WILL TURN AND TRACK YOU ONCE YOU LAND ON THEIR
PLATFORM.

BE SWIFT WITH YOUR THINKING AND GAMEPLAY AS `EACH LEVEL IS ON A TIME LIMIT`
TAKE TOO LONG AT YOR PERIL!!

THERE ARE HIDDEN BONUS SCREENS ON CERTAIN LEVELS OF THE GAME.THESE CAN BE
FOUND BY SHOOTING BLOCKS IN THE SCENERY.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IT MAY BE EASIER TO FIND A HIDDEN SCREEN AT
CERTAIN POINTS THAN TO COMPLETE THE ACTUAL LEVEL YOU ARE ON,AS THE SECRET
SCREEN WILL ALLOW YOU TO PROGRESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

FINALLY AN EXTRA LIFE WILL BE GIVEN EVERY 500,000 POINTS,BUT YOU CAN ONLY
CARRY A MAXIMUM OF 6 AT ANY ONE TIME.
