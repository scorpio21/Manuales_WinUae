1. Loading Flood
-----------------

I hope you're not a complete lamer and know how to start a game?



2. How to get started.
----------------------

After  a  short delay, the Flood music will start up and you will be shown a
short  animated  sequence.   After this, you will be shown the title screen.
At  any  time  after  the  animated  sequence has started, you can press the
firebutton on your joystick to bring up the zap to level window (see section
7.  ZAP TO LEVEL for details on how to use this feature).

Press the fire button to start the game on level 1.

You will now be asked to select which language you would like to use to play
Flood.   Use  your  joystick  to  move  the  Quiffy  pointer over either the
British,  German  French  or Italian Flag and press the fire button to selct
that language.

Lastly,  you  will  be asked to answer a question about the poster, which is
printed  on  the  other  side  of  this manual and type the answer using the
keyboard.    Press   RETURN   to  enter  the  answer.   You  are  given  two
opportunities  to  get the correct answer, after which you will have to load
Flood agian in order to haven further attempts.


3. Meet Quiffy.
---------------

Quiffy  is  a  slightly  overweighted  wee green Blobbie who lives in secret
caverns deep underground, feeding on the trash left behind by an ancient and
enigmatic  civilization.   Unfortunately,  these  caverns haven been overrun
with  nasty  creatures like the Psycho Teddies and Quiffy's distant cousins,
the Bulbous Headed Vong.

These unlovely creatures have waged a vicious war on Quiffy's kind and he is
now  in  the  unfortunate position of being the last surviving member of his
race.   Indeed,  you can see the luckless participants of this genocidal war
stretched throughout the interconnected caverns.

If  all  that  wasn't bad enough, the mysterious taps of wrath have suddenly
ended  their  years  of  arid  indifference and have started to cascade vast
quantities  of  water into the caverns.  Because Quiffy cannot breathe under
water, he has decided that enough is enough and has resolved to make his way
to the surface and escape the creeping doom of the flood.


4. What you have to do.
-----------------------

The  idea of Flood is very simple, within each level Quiffy must explore the
caverns that make up that level and collect all the trash that is not nailed
down. Once he has collected all the trash, then he can use the END OF LEVEL
TELEPORTER and proceed to the next level. In addition to the 36 normal
levels, Quiffy must also negotiate his way through a further 6 levels that
the devilish Vong have built, making 42 in all!

There  are  two types of teleporter which outwardly look identical:  the END
OF  LEVEL  TELEPORTER  and  the  IN  LEVEL  TELEPORTER.   The  END  OF LEVEL
TELEPORTER  takes  Quiffy  to  the  next level once he has collected all the
trash on the cuurent level.  The IN LEVEL TELEPORTER (which can be invisble)
are  linked  in  pairs  and just move you to the linked IN LEVEL TELEPORTER,
which will be at a different location within the current level.


5. The Statusbar.
-----------------

Oxygen:
This is a blue bar that shows how much oxygen Quiffy has left.  While Quiffy
is  underwater,  his  oxygen  is  slowly  used up.  One Quiffy has no oxygen
remaining, he will start to lose life and eventually die.

Score:
Well Well, this your score.

Trash:
This  is  a  count of how much trash Quiffy has to collect before he can use
the  END  OF  LEVEL TELEPORTER and get to the next level.  Some monsters are
real  litter louts, throwing trash all over the place, increasing the amount
of  stuff  that  Quiffy  will  have  to  clear  up,  while  others  are more
considerate and will eat any spare trash the see lying around.

Life Force:
This  brown  bar shows how healthy Quiffy is.  Once it has all been used up,
Quiify will slag down into a gooey mess and auto-inter himself.


6. Other Objects.
-----------------

Barrels     : Stops Creatures roaming too far.

Stout       : It's good for you! Give you an extra life.

Cocktail    : Be invincble for a short time.

Orange Can  : Creatures disappear but you are butterfingered.

Plunger     : Pauses the flood temporarily.

Hearts      : Increase your life force and your score

Mines       : Boom! You lose some life force.

Switch      : Discover hidden objects and secret passages.

Droplet     : Speed up the flood.

Balloons    : Jump on these for a slow ride up, but mind you don't burts
              them.

Parachute   : Jump on it for a slow ride down. Push the joystick up to slow
              your descent even further.


7. Zap to level.
----------------

While  playing a level, if youy see a ?, just walk Quiffy over it to get the
password  to  that level.  Not all of the levels have passwords and some ?'s
will be hidden.

At  the  start  of the game, a box comes up, prompting you for a four letter
password.   If  you  found  a  password to a specific level while playing an
earlier  game,  then  type in the password and press RETURN.  When you press
RETURN,  the  level  number corresponding to that password will be displayed
and  once you press the fire button on the joystick, you will start the game
at that level.


8. The hardware.
----------------

There  is  a  variety  of  life  threating hardware scattered throughout the
caverns,  presumably  left  over from the somewhat unpleasant war waged upon
Quiffy's  kind.   Due to the unfriendly disposition of the other denizens of
the  caverns  towards  Quiffy,  it's  usually  advisable  to  grab the first
dangerous  looking  piece  of kit that comes to hand and blast anything that
comes near!

Known dangerous hardware includes: Huge Flamethrowers,
                                   Grenades,
                                   Boomerangs,
                                   Shuriken,
                                   and delayed action Dynamite.

Remember, it doesn't always pay to shoot first!


9. Keyboard Commands.
---------------------

P       Pause, press fire the continue.

R       Restart the level and lose a life.

ESC     Quit

10. The Cast.
-------------

Note from Big R: In the manual there are pictures of each figure which I
                 can't reproduce here, so you only get the description.

Quiffy:
The  hungry hero.  Being a bit on the rotund side, he finds it quite hard to
swim  but, thanks to his strong legs, if he is standingon the ground when in
deep  water, he can leap clear of the surface.  Quiffy can climb walls, leap
long distances and can even hang upside-down.

The Ghost:
After  Quiffy  has  been  on  a  level  for  a short while, the Ghost of his
Chasting  aunt will enter that level and chase after him.  The Ghost follows
the exact route that Quiffy took and travels slightly faster than him if the
Ghost  touches  Quiffy,  then  it  will  drain  Quiffy's life force, quickly
killing  him.  Therefore you must complete a level as fast as you can before
you are caught up.

Bulbous Headed Vong:
Distant  cousin  of  Quiffy, these highly venomous and untidy creatures will
kill  Quiffy upon contact.  They also have an insatiable urge to throw trash
everywhere,  which will increase the amount of trash that Quiffy has to pick
up within a level before he has use the END OF LEVEL TELEPORTER.

Psycho Teddy:
These  teddies are mad, dangerous, hungry and they love to leap!  If there's
an  object  in their way they'll eat it thereby reducing the amount of trash
that  QUiffy has to pickup within a level before he can use the END OF LEVEL
TELEPORTER.

Sparkling Fungi:
Though  quite rare, the are not fun guys to meet!  They don't move (not very
exciting  are  they) but if Quiffy touches one, then it will instantly drain
all his life force away.

Beady Ball:
Born  at high velocity, the beady balls ricochet uncontrollably off anything
that they come into contact with.

Lumpy Wanderer:
These  horrible  orange  things  with  their wet rotating eyes like to float
around, following the walls and ceilings in search of prey.

Vacuous Gombo:
These mindless mutants have a staggeringly low intelligence and get great
fun from just pacing up and down wearing notheing but a stupid grin and
oversized stomping boots.

Space Hopper:
Quiffy can hitch a ride on this cheery bouncy chap.  Hold the joystick up to
leap higher and higher then press fire to dismount.

Plonkin Donkins:
Seldom  seen  because  they usually at home fast asleep.  Once awaken, their
bleary-eyed leaping about mainly just gets in the way.

Snails:
Although they are slow and quite pretty, Quiffy should be very carful not to
touch these ghasly gastropods.

Doctor Dusty:
They  love  to  throw  sticks of dynamite around and because they wear large
hard hats, they just don't care.

That's all Folks!!
