                LOOKING FOR LOVE! (In Several Wrong Places)


INTRODUCTION

 Not very long ago Leisure Suit Larry looked like a "confirmed
bachelor", he lived with his mother and really didn't get out much. It
wasn't until well after his 38th birthday that Larry realized that life
was passing him by.
After work each evening, when his married friends went home to their
wives and his divorced friends went home with someone else, Larry had
nowhere to go. He was restless and lonely.
He found himself staring at girls again, and reading cartoon ads with
titles like "The Insult that Made a Man out of Stan." He dreamed of
being a rock star (like Barry Manilow or Christopher Cross) and being
mauled by chicks who just couldn't keep their hands off of him.
Larry's mother didn't know what to do. She had watched Larry through
his birth, his childhood, his adulthood, and his second childhood. Now
Larry had reached what could only be called a "second puberty." He
walked around in a daze, spent hours in his room with the door closed
and the stereo blaring. He hid National Geographics under his bed, in
his bookcase and everywhere. So Mom did the only just and noble thing..

She kicked Larry out of the house and bought herself a singles condo in
South Florida.


 One month after Larry's mother threw him out he changed. Notice the
crisp white leisure suit, the genuine gold-lacquered chains, the
"steppin' out" elevator shoes and the "Saturday Night Fever" bouffant
haircut. Let there be no doubt, with all the changes Larry went
through, he was still a jerk. But now, he even looked the part. A trip
to Lost Wages was the turning point for Larry.
He arrived in the city looking for "action." His assault on the city
started at Lwfty's Lounge, a combination cocktail lounge/brothel. He
delighted the disco dames with a 360-degree move that has to be seen to
be believed. And, quite by accident, he found out what it was like to
find a perfectly wonderful woman worthy of more than just a one-night
stand. It was a jolting experience for Larry, and forever changed his
views on what he wanted from a woman.

 Today Leisure Suit Larry is a little older, a little wiser, and a
little more eager to settle down. Amazingly enough though, after all
that has happened, Larry is still a jerk.
However, there's still time for Larry to change. He can't be a jerk
forever....(Or can he???)


AN OVERVIEW

A Sierra 3-D Animated Adventure Game, simply stated, is an interactive
movie where you become the main character. In this game, the main
character is "Leisure Suit" Larry Laffer, a would-be man-about-town
with a receding hairline and no redeeming social values.
Each 3-D Animated Adventure Game has a goal, and as Larry, yours is a
very special one.
You see, Larry has been single for a long, long time. Life as a
swinging single has been unfulfilling (and unsuccessful). It's time to
find a long term relationship. Someone with whom to spend his declining
(and receding) years.
Leisure Suit Larry is looking for the holy grail of the singles bar
scene. Larry is looking for the girl of his dreams, his soul mate, his
long term relationship!


HOW TO INTERACT WITH THIS COMPUTER GAME

Identify your character onscreen (he's the balding nerd in the white
leisure suit). You can move Larry through use of a joystick, mouse, the
numeric keypad or direction keys on your computer. Check your reference
card for full details.
If Larry bumps into anything (barstool, girl, etc.) he will stop. You
must maneuver around the object. When Larry reaches the edge of any
screen, a new scene will be loaded from the floppy or hard disk. If
Larry reaches the edge of a screen and a new screen is not loaded, you
have reached a boundary of the adventure game world. An example of this
is to try to go left or down from the opening screen of the game.


2.HOW TO CONVERSE WITH THE GAME TEXT MESSAGES (from the computer)

Throughout your adventure, the computer will tell you about the
situation you are in than would normally meet the eye. This text comes
up in a message window on your computer screen. To clear a message from
the screen, press ENTER or the mouse or the joystick button.


TEXT ENTRY (your input to the game)
When you want to do something, such as "talk to the cute receptionist,"
or "get the handcuffs," type simple, complete English sentences. A
dialog bow will appear when you start to type. Press ENTER when your
instructions are complete. For more information, see your reference
card under the headings WINDOW and INTERACTING WITH THE GAME and TIP #4
under TIPS FOR NEW ADVENTURERS.


3.ACCESSING SPECIAL OPTIONS (Pull down menus)

Sierra 3-D Animated Adventures features an array of special options
designed to enhance your gaming experience. These options are available
by accessing the pull down menus at the top of the game screen. On most
machines, use the ESCAPE key and direction keys or the joystick or
mouse.


4.SAVING AND RESTORING A GAME IN PROGRESS

Every Sierra game product offers a special save and restore game
feature. Saving a game is much like putting a bookmark in a book. Your
position in the game, including your location, your possessions, and
your total point score, is saved to disk for future use. You may use
this option whenever you want to take a break from playing your game,
or whenever you are about to do something you think you might regret
later.

A wise adventurer saves his game often. The world of Leisure Suit Larry
is filled with potentially lethal situations. Whenever you get killed,
locked up in prison for life, or otherwise stopped in your quest, you
can restore your game to a past bookmarked point and proceed in your
adventure again. For more information on save and restore functions,
consult your reference card.


         SPECIAL TIPS FOR BEGINNING ADVENTURERS


1.LOOK AT EVERYTHING

Every time you reach a new screen in your game, type "Look at the
scene." Look at everything you can identify in each screen.
For instance, in a bathroom you would "Look at the room" then "Look
in the mirror," "Look at the sink," "Look at the toilet" and even "Look
in the toilet." (Yuck!)
The descriptions you get when you look at things can give you valuable
clues that will help you in the game and can sometimes be very funny
too!


2.KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR INVENTORY

Adding items to your inventory (collecting things you find as you play)
is a major part of any adventure game. You never know when a rope, a
shoe string or even a banana peel can come in handy.
When you find something that you think might be useful, type "GET
THE......" If you can;t get the item you are trying to get, the game
will tell you.
Sometimes, the game will allow you to pick up things that could be
detrimental to your progress. If, for example, all the characters in
the game begin running from you with their hands on their noses, you
may want to drop that rotting fish you found on the seashore.


3.PLAY WITH A FRIEND

When it comes to playing adventure games, more heads are better than
one. You may find it very helpful (and more fun) to play this game with
a friend.


4.A FEW CHOICE WORDS

This 3-D Animated Adventure Game understands a wide variety of verbs,
such as:

ASK       DRINK     HELP     LOAD       PUSH        SWING
BEAT      EAT       HIT      LOCK       READ        TAKE
BITE      ENTER     HOLD     LOOK       REST        TALK
BRIBE     ESCAPE    HUG      MOVE       RUN         TASTE
BURN      EXIT      JUMP     NAME       SEARCH      TELL
BUY       FACE      KICK     NORMAL     SEE         THANKS
CALL      FIX       KISS     OPEN       SNAKE       THROW
CARRY     FLIRT     KNOCK    ORDER      SHOUT       TOUCH

DANCE     HELLO     LIGHT    PUNCH      SPRAY       WINK
DIVE                LISTEN              STEAL


5.YOU'VE GOT TO BE OPEN-MINDED

If it's silly, rude, dirty or funny, Al Lowe (Programmer and Designer)
probably thought of it when he was designing this game. Some of the
puzzles in this game require deranged thinking to solve.
When confronted with a problem in the game, try anything and
everything. After all, no one ever got a social disease from their
keyboard, and you have your RESTORE GAME function if things really
backfire on you.


6.IF YOU STILL CAN'T FINISH

Feeling frustrated? Can't seem to finish what you start? Is your wife
making fun of you?
Even the best adventure gamers sometimes can't complete their tasks.

Help for your problem is available. Sierra has no less than three ways
to help you find relief.

   (209)683-4463.

   hints on how to play the game, and points out some of the fun things
   in the game that you may have missed. Call (800)344-7448 to order.
   Hint books are also available at better computer and software stores
   everywhere.

Don't be embarrassed, this kind of thing happens to all of us. (We
promise to be discreet.)


         WARNING

The following documentation is for beginning adventure game players
only. The contents include answers to some game puzzles and hints that
experienced adventurers may not wish to see. Continue reading only if
you are having difficulty getting started with your adventure game.


         WALK-THRU

Watch the opening sequence from beginning to end. It will bring you
"up to date" on what's happening in Leisure Suit Larry's life and give
you your first look at the adventure to come. Valuable clues to the
game may be hidden in the sequence. Watch it closely. When it repeats,

your character or the volume of your music. You may even want to turn
the sound off completely. As a last adjustment, pull down the ACTION

your liking.
