money they will offer. if results start to seteriorate then so will their
rating of you. each time you take money from the directors your rating will
decrease and thus you will have to produce good results to prove the
investment by the directors was worthwhile.

levels icon [shown as a graph]
-----------
the levels in the game are not just to allow you the user, to make it
harder. if the computer assess your team to be too strong for the division
then it will put you on a harder level.the setting at which the computer
decides on increasing your level is a generous one. and will allow you to
build up a good side without moving the level. this system makes for a more
competetive game. it would be very unintersting if your side was the 
equivalent of a division 2 team but you were in division4. the chances are
you would not lose a match.  if you are moved up a level and then your team
deteriorates then the computer will allow you change to an easier level.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

only mortage if really desperate.it is expensive to repay and takes a long
time. if you get into financial trouble, the directors will take some
action of their own ie a loan.

increase capacity icon [seated stadium]
each team has a capaity for their ground.this can be increased, however
the cost increases as you progress up the divisions. this is crucial to
your success in later divisions. if your capacity is to low when you get

playing tips
------------
check each week the buy and sell icon for staff and players

check your own squad each week make sure you do not make to many changes in
any 1 week as this unsettles the players. try and sell players over 29 as
their skills decrease rapidly as they grow older.(not true that one is it
wee gordan strachan)

goto next match icon every week

each week check your youth squad for any players who are not improving or
have reached their peak.

if you do not give players training they do not improve very quickly,
however. do not over-train as this causes injuries.

each week check you have assigned your scouts

your capacity should be as follows...

division 4    6,000 to  7,000
division 3   10,000 to 12,000
division 2   20,000 to 23,000
division 1   20,000 upwards

most important: to avoid the level change made by the computer, use the
chart below for the division you are in.then add your
defence,midfield,attack figures together, these are found on `next match
page` and refer to chart below. ie if your total was 141 and you were in
division 4 the computer will put you on level 2.

division 4.......107.....137.....167.....197
division 3.......137.....167.....197.....227
division 2.......167.....197.....227.....257
division 1.......197.....227.....257.....287
