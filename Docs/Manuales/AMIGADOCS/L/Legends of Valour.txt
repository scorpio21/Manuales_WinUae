                         ----- INTRODUCTION -----

 WELCOME TO MITTELDORF!

 You are about to embark on the greatest role-playing challenge of your
 life!

 You have arrived in the city of Mitteldorf, which occupies the slopes of
 a volcanic island called Wolfbrood. The opportuinities for a lively young
 adventurer to turn a coin and find glory seem endless.

 Somehow, you have to keep body and soul together while you search the
 streets of Mitteldorf for adventure, wealth, and fame. The city brims
 with life in its many taverns, inns, and shops, and the people are just
 begging to talk to you about their quaint customs, interesting folk
 rituals, and trading opportunities.

 Of Course, there are always going to be a few malcontents in any town.
 In Mitteldorf we call them the City Watch. Yes, this is a town of law and
 order, where decent family values are upheld, or else. The Watch doesn't
 hold with vagrants, n'er-do-wells, or foreigners, and you probably
 qualify three for three.

 Try to avoid upsetting the Watch. Also, try to avoid dying of thirst,
 starvation, large blunt instruments, vampire bites, or tax avoidance.
 It's pointless trying to warn you off gambling, brawling in the streets,
 and chasing off after treasure and glory,

 I supose? Thought so... I mean, you're an adventurer, why else would you
 be here, right?

 Now that you've arrived, this might be a good time yo check that you have
 all the equipment and essentials you need to enter Legends of Valour. In
 addition to this player's guide, the box your friendly retailer supplied
 you with should contain:

         * four disks
         * a data card
         * a map of the city

 Check out the letter; this is the starting point of your quest. You have
 come to Mitteldorf to track down your wandering cousin, Sven. This is his
 last letter, which arrived some time ago. The family is very worried, so
 someone has to find out what had happened. You, of course, were the one
 prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice of leaving the farm, and giving
 up a life of pig-rearing to come look for him. Your family will live you
 for it, if they ever see you again. Sven makes Mitteldorf sound to good
 to miss!

 And just who are you? Well, if you want to get esoteric and
 philisophical about things, maybe it's time we started playing.

 The Data Card tells you how to load Legends of Valour onto your computer,
 including hard drive installation. Do what you need to do, and we'll meet
 up at the "Getting Started" section on page 13 in, let's sy, twenty
 minutes, OK?

 _________________________________________________________________________

 Dear Cousin,

 Yep, it's me! Bet you thought I'd be swallowed up in the Wastes for good!
 Well, you lose that bet. I can't begin to tell you what a great life I
 have foudn here in Mitteldorf! When I left our village, I confess, I
 wasn't sure if I had done the right thing. You know what my father
 says - "There's no crop sown from wandering seed!"

 Well, I'll tell you now, I've seen more sights and done more things in
 three months than I would have seen in a lifetime back in Wheatdale! Tell
 your uncle he can give my share of the pig to my sisters - I'm gonna make
 it rich on my own!

 No word of a lie, Cousin, you can make money just walking the streets of
 this great city! I swear on my mother's grave, I never saw so many rich
 people, with their own boots and all!

 Mitteldorf was built on a dead volcano years ago. You can see the
 mountain just outside town - it's like living under an enormous storm
 cloud! The town has girt big walls, and buildings stacked on top of each
 other. I been staying in a place called the Boardins - can you believe
 it? I got my own bed and a change of linen every month! It is warm here,
 and there's plenty of good food. They serve a better rat on a stick here
 than your mother ever skewered!

 And the people, cousin! So many of them! Many merchants call here, for
 Mitteldorf is known as a rich trading town. The King's bodyguard keep a
 stern peace, and the Guilds crack a few heads likewise. You're a fool to
 get into trouble here! On my third day I was hauled off to prison for the
 night. All I did was peek through a window!

 And the women, cousin! They hurt your eyes just to look at them! They say
 the most beautiful was Queen Jocasta - She was married to Wilf, the
 King's brother. She lives back on the mainland now. She and King Farley
 never did see eye to eye, so they say. Oh, yes - I know everything going
 on here. No mistake!
 _________________________________________________________________________

            - Legends of Valour  (Page 3)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Tell my father and my sisters I'm well, but tell them I'm not coming
 home. Hilda will find herself a good husband to run the farm. I'm stayin
 here to make my fortune! There are a dozen ways to make money in
 Mitteldorf - I know, I have tried them all! But fear not, for I have met
 up with some fellows who say that we shall all be rich by Midsummer!

 How? I'll tell you! Beneath the City there are these caverns, hewn from
 the rock. They are cursed by fell night-creatures, who swarm like rats in
 a barn. They steal and murder, and everyone would have them slayed. Well,
 one merchant we heard of was robbed of a precious jewel, and my
 companions and I shall fethch it back to claim his reward! Fear not for
 my safety, for my companions are famous heroes, who have no fear of
 goblins or lizard men! Nor I! And see here, one of them sold me this
 book. T'was written by some old adventurer, and it tells of the creatures
 he says he battled. But I rekkon it's only fairy stories! Hobgoblins and
 spooks! Hah!

 Anyway, I thought I'd send the book to you, so you may have a souvenir of
 my success! Better than that, why don't you follow me! Leave the valley
 behind, and get rich! Find someplace to stay, then seek word of me. I
 often take an ale in The Snakes, watchin' the Roach races. I'll leave a
 message there. You can find work on the notice boards, and the Town
 Gazette too, while you find your feet. I swear, cousin, I'll never regret
 the day I came here. When the merchant's jewel has made me rich, I shall
 send money home, but I'll not come back. Rather, t'is you who should come
 join me!

 Well, I'm off now to wer my whistle before we go a hunting goblins! I've
 grown right partial to ox-blood this last week. Don't know why, I suspect
 I've got the taste for the finer things in life now!

 Your cousin,
    SVEN

 TROLL EATS TWO MORE PIT BULLS

 Citizens of Mitteldorf were shocked today as two more lovable friendly
 house pets were eaten in BROAD DAYLIGHT by a roaming denizen of the
 underworld. Ogreus Maximus, the common Troll.

 WHEN WILL THIS STOP? One would have thought that in a city filled with
 ADVENTURERS, MERCENARIES and FIGHTERS, this kind of public menace could
 be eliminated before it goes any further. Already, various bones found in
 caves around the town would suggest that this creature is capable of
 eating MORE THAN DOGS! Who knos what COULD BE NEXT?



 THIEVES GUILD STRIKES AGAIN

 UNSPECIFIED GOODS to the value of 200g were stolen last night from a
 sealed room in the Wetland Wynds area of town. Although guarded, the
 goods "just disappeared" shortly before midnight last night, prompting
 calls for a complete investigation into the Thieves Guild by the Palace.
 A Royal Spokesman said "Until we

 A-MAZE-ING

 THE NEW labyrinth underneath the market area is becoming almost too
 popular an attraction to the city residents. The Minotaur-stocked maze is
 designed to allow shoppers to leave their children in an exciting
 enviornment whilst they go about their business, and to give them the
 option to have the burden of parenthood removed from their shoulders
 forever. Unfortunately, the Minotaurs are proving to be rather more
 effective than planned. The latest census shows that children now make
 up only one tenth of the population, and the King has had to issue a
 special edict demanding that people have more children.



 VAGRANCY RATE UP IN CITY

 THE NUMBER of people arrested for vagrancy, suspicious behavior, begging
 and other minor offenses has increased by a factor of five ever since
 Gracious King farley was asked to take over the throne by his grateful
 subjects. Over six hundred people - almost two a day - were tried in the
 past year, compared with fifty people in the Year of the Goat. Of those
 six hundred, five hundred and eighty were found guilty and sentenced,
 with punishments ranging from 10g fines to three days in prison. A Palace
 spokesman said "This magnificent clearing of the streets is a necessary
 part of the King's modernization scheme, and is in keeping with the
 spirit of justice that prompted the King to take the throne from his
 unfortunate predecessor."



 WE'RE SICK OF WEREWOLVES!

 THERE HAS been a marked increase in the number of Lycanthropes wandering
 the streets at night, according to the Mitteldorf Residents' Watch. A
 spokesman, who preferred to remain nameless, said "Why does the Town
 Guard not arrest these beasts? What are they scared of?" Legend has it,
 that when the moon is in the right phase, werewolves continue their
 age-old search for the Spirit of Skoll, one of the first werewolves. They
 try to recruit as many people as possible for thsi by infecting them with
 lycanthropy. This is the reason that so many of the werewolves carry
 pocket spirit diviners. One place that is now virtually off-limits to the
 guard at night is the Dwarves Ghetto, in Nidavellir, where up to ninety
 percent of the population is reported to be sufereing from this bizarre
 condition.

 GUILD NEWS

 The MEN-AT-ARMS GUILD has been on a recruitment drive recently, having
 lost a number of their members in a series of mysterious accidents. The
 Men at Arms, based at the barracks in the Squatters Quarter, are looking
 for "strong lusty lads and lasses who don't mind a bit of banter,
 fighting, and dying in mysterious curcumstances" according to their
 Sergeant at Arms, Gort Wineskin. "Our entry requirments are quite simple,
 involving just a few easy tasks and a small amount of money. And just
 think - one day, you could become a Templar!

 The THIEVES GUILD, operating from its secret headquarters, has been
 incresingly active in the city (see front page) prompting calls for a
 restriction of its permits. Although unavailable fro direct comment,
 members of the guild are believedto regard these calls as 'merely an
 exaggerated response to the seasonal fluctuation' in robbing, burglary,
 mugging, and pick-pocketing. The landlord of the Snakes Inn (a tavern in
 the South of the city) believed by some to be connected in some way with
 the Guild, denied any knowledge of the Thieves' activities, and our
 intrepid reporter had it made extremely obvious to him that it was in
 his own best interests not to pry any further into the landlord's private
 affairs. The Post hopes that thsi increase will not spark off more of
 the inter-guild rivalries seen last year, just before Nasty King Wilf
 left the scene.

 The MERCENARIES GUILD is having its annual barbecue at its headquarters
 in Witches Meadow, near the Roach and Rider Casino, next week. The
 occasion promises to be a fine one, with an assortment of meats and
 plants, and many games and pastimes. All are welcome, so long as they
 bring lots of ale, food, and money.

 'Come and try throwing fireballs at your friends - you might like it!'
 is the message from the ANCIENT AND REVERED FELLOWSHIP OF THE ASEGEIR
 this week. The Fellowship is having an open day, in which members of the
 public can come an try out those difficult spells under expert
 supervision. The day promises to be filled with excitement and laughter
 (and a few surprises!), and the fellowship is hoping to spot potential
 talent from the crowds. The Fellowship is based in the Newtown
 territories, just by the castle wall. For further details, ask any Guild
 member.

 COURT NEWS

 KING WILF

 Nasty old King Wilf in in the news again this week, following new
 revelations about his love life, and his incredibly terrible fiscal
 policies. Palace spokesman refused to confirm or deny stories about the
 ex-King's close relationship with a hamster called Gerald, calling them
 'mere suppositions that might have a grain of truth if you known what I
 mean squire,' but surviving sevants of the ex-monarch have mentioned
 'funny squeaking sounds' in connection with the dposed king's night-time
 activities. On the taxation front, it was revealed by the Supreme King
 farley today that Wilf was planning an underwear tax. "This is just one
 more example of how this repressive King meant to fleece his loving
 population" the King said. "It was a good job that I stepped into the
 role of Supreme Protector when I did" he continued.

 RUMORS

 Rumors reach the Post of a very close relationship between our beloved
 King (Odin Preserve Him) and a certain member of the court, a Lady Olga
 Inbred. Neither party was available for comment, but a Palace spokesman
 told us that a statement would be available next week regarding the
 affair. Will this be the Big One for Farley? Watch this space for further
 details.

 JUSTICE DAY

 This year's Justice Day, when any of the populace involved in any sort of
 dispute can have the matter settled by the king in person, has been
 cancelled. "This is due to lack of public interest" said the palace, "and
 nothing at all to do with the King's regard for this custom."



 * GUILD NEWS continued

 The BROTHERHOOD OF LOKI seem to be having problems with their public
 relations staff at the moment. Rumors that twelve employees were turned
 into various amphibians for their 'stupid press releases' were vigorously
 denied by the dark Brotherhood district-based management.

 * THIEVES continued

 have evidence that the guild is stealing more than its quota, our hands
 are tied." The landlord of the Snakes, a public house in the Wetland
 Wynds, denied any knowledge of the thieves Guild. "Why does everybody
 come round 'ere for a quote?" he asked our reporter. Also found last
 night was the body of Bolvic 'Fingers' Knudsson, the well known dyslexic
 'replica manufacturer', long suspected to be an associate of the Guild.
 He had been stabbed eighteen times, then hung upside down from a rafter
 with a sack on his head. The town guard are treating the case as a
 suicide.

 HUNTING

 No. 4 - The Goblin

 By Erik the Wolf, famed adventurer and consultant to the Mitteldorf Small
 Creature Hunting Association. Your average goblin is a tricky little
 critter to hunt, mainly because he is so small and fast. Goblins tend to
 hunt in great packs, in dark dank tunnels and cellars under the city and
 so finding one on his own is a rarity. They have a very keen sense of
 smell to make up for their poor eyesight, and so any budding hunter
 should take care to disguise his body odor with a proprietary brand of
 masker, such as 'Erik's Finest rat Rater.' Once caught though, a goblin
 is easily dispatched with a mighty swipe to anywhere except his
 peculiarily hard head. For more details, see my publication, Monstrum
 Horrendum, Denizens of the under0City 'neath Mitteldrf, out now.

 MUD-IN-THE-EAR SHOCK

 Local Mud-in-the-Ear team, Set's Streakers, were accused on Thor's Day
 of using ringers for their match last week against the Dorf Dragons. the
 Dragons, having lost by a spectacular 35-6, put in a complaint against
 one of the Streakers, claiming that he was a "lot larger and a lot
 greener than most of the humans we know." Team captain, Grot Onetooth
 said in a press conference later that his team were "not mentioning the
 'tr' word, but we feel this matter should be investigated by the
 authorities." An adjudication is expected next month.



 BEER RACING

 The finals of the Mitteldorf all-comers Beer Race are to be held in the
 renowned Seahorse Tavern next week. There are five finalists, out of a
 total of seven hundred and twenty three entrants. They are: Ulric 'The
 Paunch' Torrson - the favorite, a winner of three out of the past six
 competitions. Helga 'Little Lady' Ormsdottir - the only female
 contestant. Harald "Big Boy' Bloodeye - a finalist three years on the
 trot. Harald 'Little Boy' Bloodeye - son of Big Boy - twelve years old
 bu already eighteen stone - one to watch for the future. Sven Forkbeard -
 big, blond, and stupid. This year's competition promises to be the
 closest one yet, with such strong fiend, so get down to the Seahorse,
 drink some ale and have an exciting evening. More power to your elbow!



 SURPRISE WIN FOR STOATS

 In a stunnign game of One-eyed Jack last night, Nidavellir Stoats tooks
 the coveted Dacre Trophy from the Wetland Unicrons with a score of 20-12.
 The Unicorns, having won their last seven games, were clear favorites to
 take the trophy for the third year running, but after a two hour match,
 the Stoats scored eight points in the last dig to consolidate their
 earlier two point lad. King Farley was present at the match, and
 presented the trophy to the Stoats, along with the 250g prize money. As
 a traditional in the dacre Trophy, the losers suffered the loss of their
 little fingers, though with such an experienced team as the unicorns,
 very few of them had little fingers to lose. The Stoats next match is a
 'friendly' one against the Newtown Furry Animals.

 WITH YOUR FEET?

 Word reaches this column of a strange game being played on the mainland
 which is spreading fast. It is called Footyballs, and has something to
 do with valls, feet, and kicking things. Sounds like a game for Trolls
 to me, if you see what I mean!



 BADGER IN THE BAG

 In only the third game in the season to feature a full knock-up, the
 Mitteldorf Monsters, currently second in the league, scored a maximum
 this Day of the Moon last against the Mountain Goats. Team coach Olaf
 Pizzlebrain called the result "a triumph for the lads, proving that we
 can match any bags on the island." Dejected Goats, who only won two games
 last season, promised that this season would turn to ther favor after
 'destroying' the Screaming.



 DWARF TOSSING

 The Mitteldorf Dwarf Tossing season starts again next month, but with
 some slightly altered rules. The number of Dwarves in a team is now
 limited to four, and the 'tossee' has to weigh a minimum of twelve
 stones. This is to prevent a repeat of last year's bending of the rules,
 when the 'lusty warrior to be tossed' specified in the rules turned out
 to be a six feet high balsa wood figure with an animation spell cast upon
 it. Captain of the Nidavellir Knights, Festiv Tenton, said 'this should
 make everything a lot fairer, and we certainly are hoping to be ready and
 fit on the day.'



 SERVICES

 The Men-AT-ARMS GUILD are currently offering basic weapons training
 in swordsmanship and axe handling at a very modest price - only 5g
 per week - very good value for you young bloods out there!

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ANCIENT AND REVERED FELLOWSHIP OF THE AESGEIR are still having a
 'special offer' month on their magical item identification service, with
 prices slashed to only 10g per item.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The BROTHERHOOD OF LOKI are also offering the identification service -
 prices vary per item, depending on whether they like your face or not!

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Train in all sorts of hand to hand combat and weapons theory with the
 MERCENARIES GUILD - only 10g. Healing is still being offered by the
 temples of FREYA,ODIN, AEGIR and SET at reasonable prices - good if
 you can't wait for Rusty to open.

                         ----- HOW TO PLAY -----

 GETTING STARTED

 Great, you're here already. OK, switch on, load up, and let's go!

 After the title sequence, you will presented with the following options:

         * PLAY
         * PLAY NEW GAME
         * DESIGN CHARACTER
         * QUIT

 LEGENDS OF VALOUR is entirely mouse-driven. It does not supprt joysticks.
 You can play from the keyboard, but the game only delivers its full
 potential under mouse control, some options just can't be accessed from
 the keyboard.

 When presented with a menu like this, just aim the pointer at your
 selection to highlight it and left-click 9which just means click the left
 mouse button).

 Note also that right-clicking normally clears any menu.

 As you might guess, the first two options actually pitch you onto the
 path to adventure in Mittledorf. But, since you're new in town, we'd
 better look at Character Generation first.

 CHARACTER GENERATION

 To answer the queston "Who am I?", this is where you start.

 Those of you familiar with role-playing games in their many forms will
 understand what goes on here. We are about to create a role-playing
 adventurer, the hero you will guide through the perils of Mitteldorf.
 Honestly, it's not a place to visit personally....

 When you select the DESIGN A CHARCTER option, you are presented with a
 screem something like this:

 On the left, there is a full-length picture of your character, and a
 close-up of your face. On the right, there is a stone slab with a picture
 of a face. Below this, are several button, and the 'raw data' about your
 character.

 Characters are defined by four statistics: Strength, Intelligence, Speed,
 and Health.

 Strength is a broad measure of your Character's physical power.
 Primarily, this helps you in combat. Intelligence defines your reasoning
 powers, which can help you in various ways duuring the game. Speed covers
 your agility, dexterity, amd reactions - this also affects combat, and
 some other areas of the game. health measures your physical robustness.

 These four statistics are randomly created for a new Character. If you
 generate a particularly feeble Character, you can left-click on Exit to
 start again. Don't get hung up on these statistics, though. there are
 plenty of ways to improve your hero during the game.

 You must now make some choices about your Character. First, click on the
 race buttons. Choose between human, elf, and dwarf. An elf is more likely
 to be Intelligent and Speedy, but they're a bit feeble in the health
 department. A dwarf gets
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 14)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 bonuses to his/her Strength and Health, but loses out on Speed. Human
 Characters are average on all counts.

 Next, choose whether your Character is male or female. Gender has no
 effect on your statistics, but will affect how you are treated by people
 you meet in Mitteldorf.

 Having broadly defined what you are, you can now perform radical surgery
 on the way you look using the Stone Tablet. By left-clicking on one of
 the facial features, you can change the way it appears on the Character
 portrait. Try changing the hair color first. For each option, there are
 several different styles, allowing you thousands of different looks.

 Once you have completed altering your facial features, click on the runes
 at the bottom of the stone tablet. You are asked if you are sure about
 this Character. Click on Yes to continue Character generation (or No
 to go back to start the process).

 The view changes to show your home village. Brings a lump to the throat,
 doesn't it? Across the message bar, you will be told your father's name
 and occupation, and you are then asked to type in your own name (maximum
 of 16 letters).

 This is also your chance to pick up some useful equipment. If you click
 on the various "buildings" in your village, you are told what each is.
 Most are shops, places where you can obtain goods for trade. You have a
 finite amount of money to spend, so take your time, and look for the best
 bargains.

 Left-click on a shop to enter it. You can now see your Character, the
 interior of the shop, and an item showing various goods for sale.
 Left-click on any item and you will see a more detailed picture of it,
 along with its name and price tag. If you want it, click on the Buy
 button. The item will be transferred to the picture of your Character and
 the price will be deducted from your cash.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 15)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 If you don't want that item, click on another, or on the Exit Shop
 button.

 You don't have to spend all (or any!) of your money. There may be better
 bargains in the great city of Mitteldorf. When you have finished
 equipping your Character, click on the horizon to end the Character
 Generation sequence and you return to the original option screen.

 You can create more than one Character before starting play. Up to 8
 Characters can be in existence at any time.

 It's important to remember that your role-playing Character is your most
 important asset in the game. Create one you are happy with, and then do
 everything you can to keep him or her alive.

 When you save the game, you save the Character alongside of it. In fact,
 the Character's name is the name of the save file. if you want to play
 with different Characters, they have to start at the beginning. No
 Character can just jump in half-way through! After all, these are the
 LEGENDS OF VALOUR we're talking about here, not the Legends of a football
 squad of guys, one of whom made it to the end....

 So look after your best Character... true heroes are hard to find. Word
 has it that's because most of them are dead.

 LOADING AND SAVING GAMES

 Having created your Character, you can now start the game for real. When
 the Start Options screen reappear, select PLAY NEW GAME. You are asked to
 select which Character you wish to use.

 When your return to play LEGENDS OF VALOUR again, you can load your last
 saved game by selecting the PLAY option. Follow the on-screen
 instructions. To play an earlier saved game, select PLAY and then select
 LOAD GAME from the system menu.

 As previously mentioned, you can have p to 8 characters and games saved.
 the Saved Game screen has eight Chronicles listed, one for each of up to
 eight Characters. Each "slot" on your saved game disk can be over-written
 - be careful!

 Just click on the Chronicle you wish to Save/Load. The game continues
 automatically.

 You can only save a game while your Character is in an inn, tavern, or
 hostel.

 The inns of Mitteldorf are where the LEGENDS OF VALOUR are first told.
 Your hero will, modestly, describe how he mopped up a few goblins and
 found some minor treaure. the story is picked up by the bards, and by the
 end of the night, the opposition was thirty trolls, you found a thousand
 groats and a magic sword, and the King aksed you to marry his first-born
 child. That's fame for you!

 OUT ON THE STREETS

 Having selected the PLAY NEW GAME option, you will find you have arrived
 at Mitteldorf's Main Gate. You are now faced with the main screen
 display. It'll look something like this:

 The Unique Magic Item boxes are empty. That's because you haven't found
 any. These displays will only be filled when you're lucky enough to find
 one of LEGENDS OF VALOUR'S three special magic items. That's when you
 know you're really arrived.

 The Examine icon allows you to inspect items you find. If there is an
 item displayed in the Floor window, click on Examine. You won't always
 find out very much, but it's worth a try.

 The Floor window shows items encountered as you wander round town. If
 your Character gets close enough to a portable
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 18)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 object, it will be displayed here. If you want to pick it up, left-click
 on the item and it is transferred to the Right Hand window if that is
 empty or tha backpack. Cash and Commodities automatically go into your
 Pockets (see below).

 The System icon allows you to save game, or load from previously saved
 positions, or alter one of the basic parameters of the game. See the
 section on Game Management.

 The Character Status display shows all the facets of your Character's
 state of mental and physical health. From the left, the seven bars show:

         * General Health
         * Energy
         * Combat Injuries
         * Appeal
         * Hunger
         * Thirst
         * Sleep

 In each case, the higher the bar, the better for your Character's
 well-being.

 Many of these status displays are interwoven. For example, when you get
 hungry, it's obvious that you'll become exhausted more quickly. You need
 more sleep if you are injured, and so on.

 See the "Doctor, Doctor" section to find out more about staying healthy
 in Mitteldorf.

 There is a Timer Bar under this display which has various functions.
 You'll find out about them later.

 The Movement Controls allow you to to move your Character around
 Mitteldorf. We'll discuss this more in a moment. However, one of these
 icons *Rank) accesses the Character Screen.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 19)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Click on this now to take a look. The Character Screen shows a portrait
 of your Character, which Rank he'she holds in various Guilds and Temples,
 and other specialinfromation which unfolds as the game progresses. It's
 worth checking this screen from time to time.

 There's more information about Guilds and Temples in later sections.

 The Action Display has several icons to access different actions.

 The first three are Combat options - Crsh, Thrust and Slash. Your
 Character uses whatever weapon he'she has to hand, or bare fists
 otherwise, against whatever opponent they face. Depending on your
 opponent, different combat styles may be more or less effective.
 Experiment.

 The second row of the Action Display also features three icons. The first
 of these accesses the Mitteldorf Map. This is a smaller version of the
 map you have been provided with, and lacks much of its detail. Most
 usefully, you can always find out where you are, since a flashing light
 will act as a "You Are Here" arrow.

 The map function can also be used in Mitteldorf's dungeons. However, in
 these locations it functions only as a "trail of breadcrumbs;" it only
 records the places you visit, showing you the way back to the entrance.
 Once you leave the dunegon, the map is lost, so make a copy before you
 leave the dungeon if this is a place you might want to visit again.

 The next two icons allow you to cast Magical and Priestly spells. We'll
 come to them again later.

 The final row features three more icons. Select the Rest icon to take
 five wherever you are situated. A Small Menu Will pop up, asking you to
 select 0,2,4,8 or 12 hours rest. Select the length of time you want,
 and catch some Zs.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 20)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 The Use icon will allow you to make use of whatever your Character has in
 his/her hand - assuming the object has a use....

 The Hail button allows you to attract the attention of passers-by. Use
 this to start a conversation with someone in the street. Do not use it
 to chat with Trolls.

 The Compass allows you to see which direction you are facing. You can
 also use it to change direction. You can click one of the compass points
 around the rim to select that direction, or drag the compass pointer
 around.

 Beside the Compass is the In Hand Display, which shows which (if any)
 item your Character has in hand. Above and below are two buttons,
 allowing you to Throw or Drop the item.

 The Backpack items display can hold up to six items of readily accessible
 gear. To swap an item between your hand and backpack, just click on it.

 The Pockets display shows the quantities of merchandise your Character is
 toting around. Mitteldorf is a trading town, and the six major
 commodities it likes to deal in are Gems (measured in ounces), spices
 (lbs), pigments (pints), ore (cwts), hide (by pelt) and tar (kegs). It
 doesn't necessarily mean you have several tons of merchandise in your
 pockets, some of your goods may consist of letters of credit, bills of
 lading, that kind of thing.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 21)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Immediately above this is your cash wealth in Groats. However, if you
 click on one of the commodity items and hold the mouse button down you
 can see how much of that commodity you possess instead.

 By all means speculate. Trading is a great way to meet people, and to
 come to greater understanding of their ways and customs. Try complaining
 to a Mitteldorf merchant that he charged you an unfair price for his
 goods, for example, and you'll find out why the symbol of the Merchantile
 Guild is a sock full of rocks.... There's more information on Trade in
 the section "Trading, Buying, and Selling".

 Finally, the main display shows your window on the outside world, and a
 small message display. This will be where you see what Mitteldorf people
 are like, and what they think of you.

 GAME MANAGEMENT

 Various game settings can be altered by left-clicking on the System icon.

 You can toggle Auto Combat on or off. With Auto Combat on, the computer
 controls your Character in combat, relieving you of the necessity of
 clicking on the Combat icons. This isn't going to make you Superman.

 You can also toggle Sound on and off which allows you to get rid of the
 music and sound effects.

 Click on About... to find out a few facts about LEGENDS OF VALOUR.

 The next three icons allow you to change viewing parameters, which can
 have an effect on how fast the game plays on a slower machine. The Floor
 icon allows you to toggle from texture-mapped to "plain" floors. The
 (middle) Horizon icon moves the viewing horizon nearer or further away.
 the nearer the horizon, the faster the game plays. Finally, the Window
 icon can be used to shrink the size of the viewing window.

 On the bottom row, there are icons for Saving and Loading the game (which
 we have already discussed). Remember, you can only save the game while
 your Character is in a tavern or hostel; elsewhere, this option is
 disabled.

 Finally, there is an option to Exit The Game if you have to ask what that
 does, you've done well to get this far....

 GETTING AROUND

 In the center of the main Screen is your immediate view of the sights of
 Mitteldorf. Through this window, you can see the wonders of the city in
 all their glory. Hey - you're a tourist, feel free to stop and gape. At
 regular intervals, you will also see large creatures with sharp
 implements. These are less scenic close-up, and should be evaded or
 pummelled senseless.

 Once you get tired of this immediate view, you might want to alter it, or
 "move along" as the City Watch like to put it.

 There are three ways of doing this. First, you can use the cursor keys.
 Press the up arrow to walk forwards, or the left/right arrows to turn.

 The second method is to use the mouse to select icons on the Movement
 Display. Left-click on your choosen icon. The icons on the Movement
 Display are as follows:

 As mentioned previously, you can also change direction by using the
 Compass Display.

 Finally, click the RMB (right mouse button) once to enter Hustle Mode.
 Now you're cooking! Moving the mouse left or right turns you in that
 direction. Now press, left-click, and you move forward.

 This is the fast way to get around town (short of getting a taxi, and
 Mitteldorf is notorious for not having enough of these...). Once you
 have mastered walking, you can speed things up even more by pressing the
 Space Bar as youmove. This works with whatever style of movement you're
 trying.

 Try to get the hang of moving around in Hustle Mode, because you can't
 expect to be respected in this town if you only change direction when
 you are standing still.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 24)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 OK. Now we've mastered walking, let's try something a little more
 advanced. This is called Walking Through Doors, and it's a must. Take a
 look arund, and find a door into an attractive and culturally
 edifying-looking building (or inn, as they are also known). Now aim your
 Character towards the door and walk. If it pens, revealing the patrons
 and folk pastimes within, you know you've made it. If nothing happens,
 you've walked into the door frame, which is not to be recommended for
 improving your street credibility.

 Of course, some doors are locked, which just goes to show that there's
 a lack of basic trust in this town. The Message Window will inform you
 that the door is locked. If you have the means to batter the door or pick
 the lock, this will be tried automatically. If the word "secure" appears
 in the Message Window, the door is magically barred. You need magic - or
 a key - to get through here.

 Use the same walk-up-and-see technique to climb or descend stairs. If the
 view chanes, you made it. If nothing happens, pretend you had something
 in your eye and try again.

 You may even find it possible to get through windows in more or less the
 same way. members of the Thieves' Guild get taught the art of sidling up
 to a window and opening it by hitting Enter. A Portal spell may also let
 you in. However, there is a school of though in Mitteldorf, mostly held
 by officers of the Watch, that law-abiding citizens always use doors, and
 that window-inspired entrances are a sign of nefarious intent. You can
 try pleading that you lost your keys, but these guys never listen.

 Fine. So, now we're walking round twn and through doors and everything.
 You will soon catch on that an awful low of the other citizens of
 Mitteldorf have mastered these same skills. By the time you've wandered
 around a bit, you will also have noticed that it seems to be getting
 darker. From the moment you set foot in downtown Mitteldorf, the hours
 and days start flying by....
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 25)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 This is probably a good time to find out what you need to do to stay
 alive. After all, from the moment you stepped through the gates of the
 city, you were faced with those age-old problems - what can I drink, how
 do I eat, and where do I sleep?

 Time passes rapidly in a strange city, and there are few cities stranger
 than Mitteldorf.

 As the clock ticks on, your Character will feel hungry, thirsty, and
 tired, as shown by the Character Status Display. As each of these bars
 falls, your Character will feel less and less like a Hero, and more like
 a quarterback whose offensive line is holding out for better terms.

 It is actually possible to starve to death, or to be so bone-tired that
 old crones beat you up in the streets. Look after yourself. Early to bed
 and early to rise keeps you healthy, wealthy, and out of the clutches of
 nasty things which wander the streets at night....

 "A visitor's Guide to Mitteldorf" has all the information a tourist could
 possibly need about where to stay and where to eat in Mitteldorf. Check
 out the sections on "Where to Stay" and "A Niht On The Town," and you too
 could survive more than your first couple of days in this fascinatin,
 historic town. It also has some stron tips for earning the currency
 you'll need to make it much beyond a week or two....

 _________________________________________________________________________

 CHATTING WITH THE NATIVES

 You don't have to live in Mitteldorf for long to come to love the native
 wit and good-humor of its citizens. Mitteldorfans love to exchange gossip
 and bante with starngers.

 In shops, inns, or other commercial establishments, you can converse with
 the owners or their patrons by selecting a response from a menu of
 suitable phrases. their replies are displayed in the Message Area.

 Elsewhere, the customary method for indicating your desire to communicate
 with a citizen in the street is to greet them with the greeting "Hey!".
 Left-click on the Mouth icon of the Action Display while facing the lucky
 citizen you have choosen to chat with. If they are attracted by your
 call, they approach you. You can now swap banter, selecting quips,
 questions and snappy one-liners from the menus presented.

 The standard Conversation Menu consists of the following:

         * Where...
         * What is...
         * Pick Pocket
         * Insult
         * Attack
         * Exit

 Selecting Where... and you bring up a list of places and/or objects.
 This list may be rather long, so move the mouse pointer to the top or
 bottom of the display to make it scroll. Click on an option to select
 that question. If the person has the vaguest idea of the answer, they
 will reply through the Message Area. For example, you could ask "Where
 am I?" Over 45% of Mitteldorf's citizens questioned in a recent poll
 where able to get that one right.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 17)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 What is... operates in a similar way. You can ask the time (don't ask a
 policeman...), or the date, or even "What is your name?" Mitteldorf
 has several famous citizens....

 Pick Pocket allows you to try a different conversational gambit, namely
 talking gibberish while rummaging through the pockets of your
 conversational partner, or "mark," as they are also known. You'll soon
 find out how successful you've been.

 Have we mentioned this may be illegal? See the section titled "Not
 Guilty, Your Honor" for the latest news about rules and how to break
 them.

 Insult allows you to sharpen your banter. Ah, what a rich language the
 people of Mitteldorf speak... and you're no slouch either! Of course,
 more often than not, these debates can decline into some ugly fistfights.
 if you want to bypass the debate and just slug the other guy from the
 outset, then click on Attack.

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 28)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 COMBAT ETIQUETTE

 Now that you are interfacing meaningfully one-on-one with the wise and
 patient people of Mitteldorf, it probably makes sense to acquaint
 yourself with self-defense. Or, as the good people of Mitteldorf call it,
 predictive response.

 Very few citizens of Mitteldorf resort to violence unprovoked. This has
 been conditioned in them through fear of picking a fistfight with a
 vampire. However, sometimes a fracas develops, often over simple
 misunderstandings about just who you were calling "goblin-ears," and
 you'd best know what to do about it.

 First off, it's a smart move to equip yourself with well-made armor and
 a variety of blunt and sharp objects. You really should have bought some
 armor back home in the village, shouldn't you? Perhaps the nice minotaur
 will wait while you go back and get some?

 Next, make sure you have your weapon in hand Click on any item in your
 backpack to transfer it to your right hand, and vice versa. Do this
 before you have to. You're not allowed to rummage through your lugage
 for a weapon once a fracas is in full swing.

 If you must provoke trouble by wandering the streets with a book in your
 hand, you ought to know that any non-combat item in your right hand when
 a fight breaks out is automatically dropped to the ground.

 How will you know when fistfights have started? Well, the person you are
 facing will stop insulting you for one thing. Secondly, your Character
 Status Display will flash, and various bars may start moving down,
 particularly the Combat Injury bar. Are you going to take this lying
 down?
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 29)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 OK. To fight back, click on one of the Combat Icons. Remember those? This
 would be a good time to memorize just where they are and what they look
 like:

 Crush is a downward blow, very effective with blunt weapons like maces or
 chair legs.... If you don't have a weapon in hand, this icon activates
 your left hook. Slash in a side-on attack, using the weapon's edge, so
 this is good for swords and stuff. Again, if you don't have a weapon,
 this is a right jab. Thrust is a point-first attack with a weapon, or a
 combination with your bare fists. Yeah, give 'em the ol' one-two.

 Click on the Combat icons as often as you like, in whatever combination
 you like. There's no "buffer;" the computer knows when you have completed
 your last blow, and looks for the next icon you click on.

 Ooops! Forgot to mention that you shouldn't experiment with this in the
 street. If the people of Mitteldorf see you prcticing, they'll assume
 you're no good at it, and someone will take this as an invitation to
 come over and splatter you all over the place.

 When you hit someone (or something...), you'll see some satisfying red
 'splats' on the screen. Now check out the Timer Box, under the Character
 Status Display. During a fight, this shows a red line, giving a rough
 indication of how healthy your opponent looks. It decreases as you wear
 him/her/it down.

 Weapons do more damage than bare fists. You can also put together
 combinations of blows against certain opponents, something like
 Slash-Slash-Crush, which are extremely effective. This is trial and
 error stuff.

 Finally, you can also throw things at your opponents. All kinds of
 objects can be thrown, from swords and axes to stones and
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 30)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 furniture. The heavier the item is, the less distance it can be thrown,
 but the more damage it does when it arrives.

 Let's suppose, though, that you've tried all this against an opponent who
 refuses to accept defeat. Worse, let's assume this miscreant is beating
 the life out of you. What can you do about it?

 Well, there's the short-term option and the long-term option. The
 short-term option is to initiate an alternative combat posture, namely
 runnin away. Press the Spacebar, and you'll turn 180 degrees. Now move
 away as rapidly as you can. Assuming you are faster then your opponent
 (and assuming it only has 2 two legs), you'll be able to retreat with no
 more than your pride devastated.

 The long-term option is to smarten up your combat abilities. The various
 warrior guilds around town offer rudimentary but effective training
 regime to sharpen up your fitness, skill, and fortitude. If the training
 doesn't kill you, it's a safe bet you're ready to go back out on the
 streets.

 _________________________________________________________________________

 THE LAST ONE STANDING IS THE WINNER

 OK - that's all the basics. You've learned about walking around, opening
 doors, talking to people, smacking them over the head... what more do you
 want?

 Now it's up to you. Read through the following entries from "A Visitor's
 Guide to Mitteldorf" for some hot tips on where to go for rest,
 relaxation, and riotous good times. But the most important thing to do is
 to explore. In Mitteldorf, you don't have to go looking for adventure,
 it'll come and find you....

 What's that? You want to know what you're supposed to be doing? Do you
 think this is one of those Kill-The-Sorcerer-And-Rescue-The-Princess
 role-playing games? The King hasn't even got a daughter, and the
 Sorcerer - well, you're better off not knowing too much about him.

 Look, just concentrate on staying alive, OK? If there is anything more to
 Mitteldorf than meets the eye, well, you're bound to run across it sooner
 or later....

                ----- A VISITOR'S GUIDE TO MITTELDORF ----

 FOR STARTERS...

 First things first. Money. You have got some, haven't you? You'll find
 that nothing - except a good beating from the Watch or an irate
 stall-keeper - smoothes the discourse of society like coin of the realm.

 The currency in Mitteldorf is the standard Groat, preferably one with his
 Impeccable Highness, King Farley featured on one side. None of your
 foreign brass here, thank you very much.

 Mitteldorf is awash with exciting ways to reduce the heavy burden of
 carrying too many groats around. Some light-fingered types might try to
 remove money that you pinched yourself not half and hour before. You can
 secure money in your lodgings. This is 100% safe. You have our word on
 it.

 Many of the more legitimate methods of parting a fool (ie, your
 Character) from his money are featured on the following pages. Note that
 there are wide discrepancies in prices in different parts of town and at
 differant times. Shops are open from about an hour after dawn to an hour
 before dusk (though they're closed on The Day of the Sun). The inns open
 from midday to midnight.

 How do you know what time it is? Well, you could try asking one of
 Mitteldorf's charming citizens. Or keep a track of the falling and rising
 of the sun. Better yet, buy an hourglass. My
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 34)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 cousin knows a man who knows someone with a consignment of time-pieces...
 very reasonable... it's an insurance sell-off....

 Each day in Mitteldorf is 24 hours long. If you ask the time, the citizen
 will probably give you a rough guide along the lines of Before Dawn,
 About Dawn, Early Morning, Mid-Morning, Noon, Mid-Afternoon, Evening,
 Midnight. The city operates on a seven-day cycle from Moon Day, through
 Tyr's Day, Wooden's Day, Thor's Day, Freya's Day, Satyr's Day to the Day
 of the Sun.

 You'll also notice the seasons change, with the days drawin shorter in
 the fall, and lengthening in the spring.

 LEGENDS OF VALOUR isn't unduly time-sensitive, but there are going to be
 occassions when the hour of the day matters. Like when a member of the
 Watch says "I'll give you five seconds to get out of here...." Once you
 enter a Guild, you'll soon become very keen on payday, for example.

 Nearly every building in the city is open to be explored. Each district
 has its own unique charm and Character. Once you've been mugged in The
 Ginnels, you'll never want to be mugged anywhere else.

 WHERE TO STAY

 One of the first things you need to look out for in Mitteldorf is
 somewhere to call home. You can curl up for a nap anywhere, but nothing
 recharges the old batteries like a lon night in warm, clean, uninfested
 sheets in a quiet room.

 Sleeping on the streets has two major disadvantages. First, the Town
 Watch will arrest you for Vagrancy. Second, members of the Thieves'
 Guild will mug you (although during certain religious festivals they swap
 jobs, the effect is the same).

 So, look out for one of Mitteldorf's friendly and welcoming hostels. You
 can recognize these by the sign they'll display somewhere outside.
 Several are marked on your map, and others may advertise their services
 from time to time.

 Among these we would recommend is the Travellers Inn, which is the
 closest to the Main Gate. Our least favorite is the Castle Dungeon, which
 serves a terrible breakfast and doesn't operate room service....

 When you enter a hostel, you'll see a reception area. Walk forward until
 you 'bump' into the desk, and the display changes to a picture of the
 landlord, a sin ivin the hostel's name and three icons. The landlord may
 also have some wisdom to pass onto you, which you can read and inwardly
 digest (if the message is followed by an arrow sin, use the cursor keys
 to read the rest of his welcoming speech).

 Click on Room and a floor plan of the hostel is displayed. Click on any
 room and the price of a week's rent is given, along with a dialo box
 offering you the chance to take the room or turn it down. If you take it,
 a week's rent is deducted from your cash (assuming you have enough...).
 Do not ask for credit, as a Hostel Owner often offends.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 36)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 The room is yours for as long as you're in credit. You can pay for more
 than a week's rent in advance, if you're filthy rich (some hope!).

 Anything you leave in the room is 100% secure. You betcha. On the other
 hand, if you get behind with the rent, the hostel keeper will seel your
 belongings, and it'll do you no good coming back later complaining about
 how there were 10,000 groats in there, and how you would have been back
 last Satyr's Day if the Watch hadn't framed you on an Excessive Snooping
 charge....

 To leave things in your room, walk up to the Basket you will find there.
 It will appear in the Floor window. Click on it, and two windows will
 appear, one showin Cash and Commodities, and the other items. Click on
 a Cash or Commodity window in your Pockets display to transfer stuff to
 the basket, or click on a window in the Basket display to pick stuff up.
 With items, click on an empty Basket window to switch an item from your
 riht hand to the Basket, or a full window to pick the item up.

 Click the RMB to exit.

 Restin in a Hostel Room refreshes a Character like no other form of rest
 can. To sleep, all you have to do is select the Sleep icon while in your
 Room, and then click on the number of hours you wish to pass in restful
 repose. This isn't an exact measure of time, though, and you may wake up
 a few hours before or after your choosen time. No hostel we know offers
 to ive you an early morning call....

 The second option in a Hostel is Feast. You wouldn't believe some of the
 delicacies you can buy cheaply in Mitteldorf's Hostels. If you have an
 eye for Cyclops Stew, or a mind to eat Zombie Brains, you'll find them at
 one or more of these fine establishments. Click on the Feast option and a
 selection of food and drink appears to whet your appetite. Click on a
 dish to find out what it is, and what it costs. You know have the option
 of enjoying that sumptuous dish, or giving it a miss....
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 37)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Eating will stave off Hunger, and Drinking quenches Thirst. As you know,
 not doing either of these has a bad effect on your health. So, click on
 the "Yes" button and enjoy your meal. Your Hunger or Thirst bar (on the
 Character Status Display) will go up, your cash will go down, and
 everyone will be happy for a few hours.

 Your final option at a Hostel Reception is to Exit. Your loss, pal.

 At any time while you are being tempted by a Hostel's facilities, you can
 exit a screen by clicking on the RMB.

 Mitteldorf has some fine residential establishments at very reasonable
 rates. Many are advertised in the Mitteldorf Post. Track one down, and
 enjoy a luxurious and relaxing night, far away from the Watch, Werewolves,
 and Winos....

 A NIGHT ON THE TOWN

 Mitteldorf prides itself on its hospitality. "Never let a (paying) guest
 go hungry" is the battle cry of every innkeeper in the city. If you're
 looking for fine food and convivial company, a tavern is the place to be!

 You'll find several excellent inns scattered the length and breadth of
 Mitteldorf. Each has a distinctive sign outside.

 As with a Hostel, when you enter an Inn, you will see a counter. 'Bump'
 into the counter to bring up the options screen. You'll meet your host,
 discover where you are (always useful, this...), and be offered several
 easy ways to reduce your cash balance.

 The first is Feast, which works just the same as it does in a Hostel. The
 menu may be very different however. Each inn has its distinctive
 specialities, particularly in the drinks department.

 Taverns are also great places to catch up on what's happening around the
 town. Click on Notice and you'll bring up a notice board with two items,
 General Info and Work Available. Click on either of these to see the
 notice (the RMB cancels the screen, as always).

 The General Info notices will steer you towards the various sights and
 activities in Mitteldorf. You can't afford not to check these regularly;
 all the best deals and action in the city ends up promoted on the notice
 boards. The Work Available notices provide opportunities to earn a crust
 doing low level, menial jobs for other people. Just follow the
 instructions.

 The third option in an inn is Gamble. Now, this is how a real Hero makes
 money! Card games, shell games, racing cockroaches... Mitteldorfans will
 gamble on just about anything.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 39)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Most games require you to gamble a groat at a time. In the shell game,
 select which cup you think the pea is under; if you guess correctly, you
 win 2 groats. Not fast enough for you? Try roach racing at the Hanged
 Man. The odds are on the notice board. If your long shot comes in, you
 might be able to afford to eat there....

 Different taverns run different games, and there are some variations
 according to the day of the week. Keep a few notes - you wouldn't want to
 miss a hot roach race, now, would you?

 TRADING, BUYING, AND SELLING

 One of the most memorable things about a stroll through the streets of
 Mitteldorf is the sound of its traders earning their daily bread. The
 merchant's street cries are famous. Who can forget "Touch that again
 and you die, kid!" or the poetry of "If this is counterfeit, pal, you'll
 need a wooden leg on your arm."

 There are wonderful shopping experiences to be had in every corner of
 Mitteldorf, from the surly brutality of the Custom House, to the bargain-
 hunter's paradise at Dirty Daglish's.

 Stroll in, look around, then 'bump' into the counter.

 The three options are Notice, which works identically to Notices in an
 inn, Trade, and Exit.

 If you click on Trade, you'll see a column of icons representing the six
 tradable Commodities (gems, spices, pigments, ore, hide and tar), and
 four more boxes, which may be empty, or may have an item displayed.

 If you click on an empty box, the storekeeper asks if you wish to sell
 an item. Answer Yes, and a display of the items you are carryin is shown.
 Click on any item, and you are offered a price for it. It's up to you
 whether you accept or not.

 Click on a box which contains an item, and the storekeeper will tell you
 its price. Again, you choose whether to deal or not.

 Of course, these places like to turn a small, reasonable profit, so you
 may find that an axe you sold for 7 groats yesterday has been marked up
 to 10 or more the day after ("yes, but look at the work we had to do to
 it, sir..."). Also, there's no guarantee that an item you sell to a shop
 will be there long. Mitteldorfans love to shop!

 If you click on one of the Commodities, the display shows the buyin and
 sellin prices, how much of that Commodity the shop has in stock, and how
 much you are carrying. There are
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 41)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 also buttons to Buy, Sell, and Deal. Click on the appropriate button to
 buy or sell Commodities in their appropriate units. When you have
 completed the transaction, click on Deal and the stock and cash changes
 hands.

 Remember, you can see what cash and Commodities you're carrying by
 looking at the Pockets display. The top window shows your cash wealth.
 However, if you click on one of the Commodity windows, you can see how
 much of that Commodity you possess instead, measured as follows:

                                   Gems     -     Ounces 
                                 Spices     -     Pounds
                               Pigments     -     Pints
                                    Ore     -     Carats
                                   Hide     -     Pelts
                                    Tar     -     Kegs
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 42)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 FINDERS, KEEPERS

 Of course, not everything in Mitteldorf has to be paid for. Just anything
 necessary.

 However, there are some real bargains to be had in dungeons and other out
 of the way retail establishments. While you are strolling around, if you
 see an item on the floor or on the table, stroll over. If the item
 appears in the Floor window, it may prove to be somethin you can borrow
 on an extended basis....

 Of course, not everything is a bargain. If paranoia ets the better of
 you, try examining the item first, by clickin on the Examine icon.
 Whatever you can tell about the object from a cursory and ill-informed
 look will be displayed in the Message Window.

 Certain items, however, can be given more than just a cautious prod with
 a sword-point. For example, a book is a book - what you need to know is
 what kind of book, riht? So, place the item in your Character's right
 hand and (repeat after me) click on it. So... minotaurs read those kinds
 of book, do they?

 Scrolls, potions (the label on the bottle) and some devices can be
 checked out in the same way. The information appears in the Messae
 Window.

 What if there is more than meets the eye? Well, you could have the item
 properly examined by the experts at a Magician's Guild, who will offer
 their considered wisdom on the item. They have a reputation for
 unscrupulous honesty. They say.

 Before all this is possible, however, you do have to pick the item up.
 Still, not everything can be covered in contact poison, right? Still
 interested? OK, click on the item in the Floor window and it will be
 transfered to the Right Hand window (if that is empty) or the Backpack.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 43)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 From now on, you can switch items between your hand and the backpack just
 by clicking on it, or by clicking on a vacant window in the backpack.
 At the same time, whatever you know about the item will be shown in the
 Message Window.

 You can drop or throw an item in your hand by clicking on the appropriate
 button. Or you can see if it has any hidden purpose ("what does this
 button do?") by clicking on the Use icon. Try not to do this kind of
 experiment in a public place, OK?

 MAKING A LIVING

 If your stay in Mitteldorf is likely to extend beyond a few hours or
 days, you'll have to find some work. It's physically impossible to carry
 enough groats to be able to just arrive in town with cash for food,
 lodgings, entertainment, and unsolicited contributions to muggers. And
 only millionaires and eight-foot tall barbarians from Mangle get credit.
 So, you need to make a few groats each day just to keep the werewolf
 from the door.

 As previously mentioned, there are all manner of odd jobs to be done.
 Keep an eye on the Notices in taverns and shops. Most of these involve
 running errands from one place to another.

 While you get used to moving around town, getting lost every block,
 it may be that by the time you complete the errand, that part of town
 has been redeveloped. Stick with it, you'll get better.

 Odd-jobs are OK, but you'll find better rewards await you in the service
 of one of the town's Guilds. These are important organizations, with
 plenty of influence and money which can filter down to guys at the bottom
 of the ladder. That's you.

 There are five Guilds: The Fellowship of the Asegeir and The Brotherhood
 of Loki are for magic-practitioners; then Men-At-Arms and Mercenary
 Guilds are full of very large gentlefolk who bench-press buildings, and
 the Guild of Thieves is an organization devoted to the ordered
 redistribution of wealth.

 Walk in, stroll up to the counter, and the following three options are
 given to you: Business, Service and Exit.

 Click on Business and you will be offered a place in the Guild, unless -
 for some inexplicable reason - they don't like the look of you. There is
 a little rivalry between some of the Guilds and Temples, so membership of
 one can bar you from joining another.

 If you agree to join, there is a very reasonable initial membership fee
 and a challenge to be faced. You can still back out, y'know.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 45)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 The Challenge will probably involve some trifiling errand and a time
 limit. You may be given some additional info or help to achieve this
 task.

 If you pass the challenge, you are accepted into the Guild with open
 arms. You can even try rising through the ranks a little. If a brother
 or sister of the Guild clicks on Business, they are offered the options
 of trying for the next rank or resigning.

 To be honest, the Guilds don't offer much in the way of a weekly wage.
 However, they're pretty hot on the bookkeeping, and every time you visit
 the Guild counter, your pay gets handed over with all arrears.

 More importantly, Guilds are an indespensable part of living in
 Mitteldorf. There are three kinds of people in this town. Kings (only
 one vacancy ever arises), Guild Members, and people to be ground under
 foot. We're talking about respect. Nobody ever writes Legends of Valour
 about people whose application forms for Guild membership were lost in
 the mail.

 To see how far up the ladder you have climbed, click on the Rank icon.
 This shows the current status in each of the Guilds you have joined.

 The further up the Guilds you climb, the more access you have to their
 Services. Each Guild offers various Services, which can range from
 evaluating the worth of an item found in a dungeon to training in the
 arts of window-entry. The Services vary from Guild to Guild, but there
 are always advertisements for them in the Mitteldorf Post. Members pay
 less for these services than non-Members.

 There are other benefots that come from Guild Membership, and from
 rising higher through the grades of a Guild. Fighting men get better at
 fighting, thieves improve their sleight-of-hand, that kind of thing.

 NO PAIN, NO GAIN

 One Guild it pays to keep on the right side of is the Mercenaries Guild.
 These are people who slice up other people for money. When they're off
 duty, therefore, they like to relax by slicing up other people for free.

 However, if you produce your Mercenaries Guild Gold Card at the critical
 moment (ie, while you still have fingers), you can be exempted from a lot
 of this pain and agony stuff.

 The Mercenaries hang out on the west side of town. A lot of them like to
 gample at the Roach & Rider Casino. They're the large gentlemen betting
 the long odds who seem to be able to get drunk, cause a commotion, and
 abuse the staff without getting thrown out by the bouncers. That's
 because the bouncers are all Mercenary Guild members too.

 Starting off at the lowest Rank, these are the grades you can rise to in
 the Mercenaries Guild:

         * Bodyguard's Apprentice
         * Hireling
         * Bounty Hunter
         * Mercenary
         * Guildmaster
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 47)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 The Men-At-Arms are a more sober-minded bunch, though they're as tough as
 old nails.

 They hang out in an office inside the large barracks area on the east
 side of town. If your face is on any wanted posters, this is a good place
 to avoid, because the posters are printed here....

 The Men-At-Arms are said to be in good standing with King Farley, and
 enjoy a more comfortable reputation around town than the Mercenaries. It
 seems a little unfair, since they're just as keen on cracking heads, but
 perhaps they do it with more style.

 The route to the top of the tree in the Men-At-Arms Guild runs something
 like this:

         * Grunt                                                      
         * Trooper                                                    
         * Weaponsmith                                               
         * Captain                                                  
         * Templar                                             

 Both Guilds offer excellent weapons training among their Services.
 This improves your ability to stay alive in a fight. The Warrior Guilds
 place a high value on that kind of thing.

 PICKING POCKETS

 Some say the simplest way of earning an honest coin is to steal it from
 someone else. However, odds are that someone else stole it from someone
 else in the first place, so this idea probably doesn't apply to
 Mitteldorf.

 Still, if all else fails, you can always earn a dishonest coin by
 pinching it. There are several ways to do this, but, in the end, they
 fall into one of two categories - licensed and unlicensed.

 After all you have read about how tough the law is in Mitteldorf, it may
 surprise you to know that there is a thriving Thieves' Guild in the city.
 They may operate under another name, but that's what they are. OK,
 nothing unusual about that. Several cities have a Thieves' Guild, a
 brotherhood meeting secretly in tiny, darkened rooms to plan great
 crimes.

 In Mitteldorf, though, they operate out of a great big building, and
 their letterhead proudly announces that the Guild has won "King Farley's
 Award For Export" three years out of the last four. Oh, they're still
 secret, but not so secret that they don't advertise. Check the
 noticeboard in the Twin Snakes Inn, down by the harbor.

 The key thing to remember about the Thieves' Guild is they exist to
 prevent robbery. Unlicensed robbery, that is. The Guild has a quota of
 items it is allowed to filch, and it doesn't allow non-members to muscle
 in on its share of the take.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 49)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 So, if you're going to make a career out of currency exchange, a place in
 the Thieves' Guild is a must. These are the various grades within the
 Guild:

         * Beggar
         * Pickpocket
         * Graverobber
         * Thief
         * Godfather

 The Guild's Training Service allows you to improve your skills at Picking
 Locks, Pockets, or easy targets. You also learn how to dodge, a useful
 combat skill. Finally, as a member of the Guild, you are made privy to
 the ancient secret of opening windows and climbing through them. Once
 you have this skill, if you 'bump' into a window and press Enter, you
 should be able to get into all kinds of interesting buildings....

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 50)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 THAT'S MAGIC!

 The two Magicians' Guilds in Mitteldorf are the Fellowship of the Asegeir
 and the Brotherhood of Loki.

 They operate in the same way as other Guilds. They offer Services most
 notably identifying magical items. Or you can apply for membership in the
 usual way - go in, pay an initiation fee, complete some errand to prove
 you're worthy, and they let you in on the Guild secret handshake.

 Moreover, as an initiate of a Magician's Guild, you are taught how to
 splat people before they can even think of calling you a degenerate
 halfling. As you achieve each Grade of your Guild you are taught more
 and more powerful Spells. These are stored in your Spell Book, which you
 access by clicking on the Magic Spells icon.

 All the spells you can learn are shown, although low-grade adepts are not
 able to cast them all.

 To cast a spell, click on its icon. Some Spells last for a period of
 time, which is shown by the Timer Bar. Casting a Spell uses Energy,
 although the amount decreases the higher up you rise through the Guild.

 These are the equivalent Grades in the Two Guilds:

                      ASEGEIR                   LOKI
                    ---------                 ------
                 Spellbrewer's Asst    -       Mystic
                       Scribe          -      Sorcerer
                    Spellcaster        -     Spellbinder
                       Wizard          -       Wizard
                   Wizard Master       -       Warlock
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 51)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 These are the Spells mages can learn:

 Portal - this lets youw alk through locked doors and windows. The Spell
 has a limited duration, but while it is active you can pass through
 locked doors, portcullises, windows, and all manner of other barriers....

 Fireball - Use this Spell to blast targets in front of you. For as long
 as the Spell endures, you can unleash fireballs from your fingers using
 the Spacebar.

 Create Food - This Spell creates Food. Your Right Hand must be empty
 before you start casting. Once the Food appears, you can eat it at once
 (click on the Use icon) or save it for later.

 Create Drink - This operates in much the same way.

 Warp - This Spell teleports you out od danger back to the Standing
 Stones.

 Heal - This restores your Health bar to maximum.

 Power - This increases the damage you can disk out in Combat. Some
 Monsters just won't fall over without it.

 Protection - This decreases the damage you take in Combat.

 BELIEVE!

 By now, you will have realised that Mitteldorf can take care of all your
 physical needs while robbing you blind. But did you know it could take
 care of your spiritual needs while robbing you blind? Read on!

 There are four major Temples in the city. These are the Temple of
 all-father Odin, which operates by Royal Appointment, the Temple of
 Freya, a women-only club; the Temple of Aegir, which goes in for a lot of
 meditation and incense, and the Temple of Set, an ancient snake god who
 has the blood-stained altars and sacrifices concession.

 Temples operate much like Guilds. You stroll in, night or day, 'bump' the
 counter and they offer you three options - Business, Service, or Exit.

 If you select Business, they offer you membership of their Order. Just
 like a Guild, there are fees and Challenges to be met. However, unlike
 joining a Guild, you don't just get your membership button and a discount
 voucher, you also get a Spell Book!

 Priest Spells work just like Magic Spells (although the Temples would
 never admit it), only you access them through the Priestly Magic icon.
 They are described on the following page.

 You can rise up through the ranks of a Temple just like in a Guild, by
 returning and selecting Business again. The higher you rise, the greater
 the magic you can cast. There are some other perks too.
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 53)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 The second option at a Temple is Service. Being responsible institutions,
 Temples run free health checks for all zitizens and tourists. The Healer
 will look you over, and recommend treatments for any ailments you may
 have, from dehydration (a visit to a tavern is cheaper!) through combat
 injuries to tomb rot, vampirism, and warts.

 These cures aren't cheap, but they're effective! And members can operate
 on a "severe injury discount" basis, which keeps the costs very
 reasonable.

 The Temples has their own hierarchies, which rise as follows:

                  ODIN                      Freya
                  -------------             ------------
                  * Neophyte                * Flirt
                  * Magus                   * Coquette
                  * Theurgist               * Temptress
                  * Spirit Exorcist         * Seducer
                  * High Priest             * High Priestess

                  Aegir                     Set
                  -------------             ------------
                  * Novice                  * Wriggler
                  * Theologian              * Hisser
                  * Divine Mediator         * Crusher
                  * Cleric                  * Striker
                  * High Priest             * Venom Master

 MIRACLES AND OTHER DAILY EVENTS

 Now that you're a Priest, you can expect to be pestered all day by people
 expecting you to perform miracles.

 Since this can put a severe strain on your social life, it's probably an
 idea to learn a few Spells which you can show off to the guys down at the
 Jug of Ale tavern.

 These are the Spells from the Priests' Spell Book:

 NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR

 Sooner or later, you are bound to make the acquaintance of the Town
 Guard. the fact is, Mitteldorf has a highly complex and detailed legal
 system, interpreted on the streets by goons with single-digit IQs.

 There are many offenses you can commit. There are also quite a few you
 can be arrested for whether you commit them or not.

 After that, the course of justice in Mitteldorf runs straight and true.
 You'll be run straight off to the Halls of Justice, and the court will
 believe that everything the arresting officer says is true.

 Good King Farley hears all cases in person. After you've been arrested
 for the tenth time in a week, you might start thinking that this would
 mean he'd spend about 72 hours a day in court. Well, the lawyers have
 got round this by removing all time-wasting procedures like juries,
 pleas, evidence - and lawyers. 

 Within about ten seconds your fate will be decided. Punishments rise
 from fines for minor misdemeanors to long-term accomodation in one of the
 city's five minus-five star prisons. If our illustrious Monarch and the
 lovely Queen Jocasta have had a fight, of course, sentences tend to be
 rather more severe than otherwise. Even the King can have a bad day.

 _________________________________________________________________________

 Here, to help you stay on the straight and narrow, is a list of the kind
 of offenses most commonly commited by Mitteldorf's citizens.

                   * Acting Suspiciously
                   * Vagrancy
                   * Excessive Snooping (1)
                   * Attempted Robbery (2)
                   * Beastly Behavior (3)
                   * Drunk & Disorderly
                   * Assaulting An Officer (4)
                   * Rent Arrears
                   * Gambling Debts
                   * Handling Stolen Goods (5)
                   * Threatening Behavior

 (1) This law was brought in after the introduction of the Window Tax.
     Since the window owner had paid the tax, it was decreed that only he
     had the right to look through it. So, in Mitteldorf, unlicensed
     viewing through other people's glass is an offense. The Thieves'
     Guild has a special license to allow them to avoid prosecution.
     So does the Guild of Glaziers.

 (2) The Thieves' Guild are very hot on prosecuting such cases. Attempted
     Robbery, indeed... why didn't you get away with it?

 (3) Such as turning into a beast.

 (4) Actually killing one isn't just a crime, it's blatant stupidity!

 (5) If you think about it, just about everything that exists belonged to
     someone else at some time, right?

 DOCTOR, DOCTOR

 Staying in Mitteldorf is not unhealthy. This needs to be made clear from
 the start. Most citizens manage to spend their whole lives without
 contracting vampirism or having their legs sawed off by trolls. On the
 other hand, most citizen's don't go wandering around dungeons looking for
 "adventure." So, because you are the foolhardy type, you'll need to know
 what to do when bits of your body aren't functioning properly, or aren't
 attached to the other bits.

 Hypochondriacs will be pleased to know that a large amount of the Main
 Screen Display is given over to measuring how sick they are. The
 Character Status Display measures seven key indicators - Health, Energy,
 Combat Injuries, Appeal, Hunger, Thirst, and Sleep.

 The higher those bars are, the better off your Character is. But what
 does it mean when they start to fall?

 Specifically, Health is an all-round measure of your physical state. If
 this falls, something is seriously wrong. If the cross turns green, then
 you have caught some unpleasant disease (or two...).

 Energy measures how much get-up-and-go your Chracter has. The lower this
 gets, the more likely you are to succumb to illness. Energy gets burned
 up if you spend every minute of the day fighting monsters and casting
 Spells.

 Combat Injuries really take it out of you. they need the attention of a
 healer and lots of rest.

 Appeal shows what impact you have on the rest of the population. A
 healthy, upstanding member of the community will have high Appeal. An
 infested low-life will have none. Guess which extreme you start nearest?

 Hunger, Thirst, and Sleep are measures which show when you need food,
 drink, or a decent night's sleep.

 _________________________________________________________________________

 To stay healthy, eat well, drink natural products, sleep in a hostel, and
 avoid the business end of people's wepaons. If you fail in any of those
 areas, you have four options.

 You could see the Town Surgeon. Check notice boards or the yellowing
 pages of the Mitteldrof Post for details. She's new in twn, so her prices
 are reasonable.

 Or you could visit a Temple. A check-up is free, but they charge the
 earth for treatment.

 Or, if you have the necessary Magic, you can always practice some DIY
 (Do-It-Yourself) surgery.

 The fourth option is to keel over. Death is, as the philosophers would
 say, the "end of the game." It's back to Character Generation for you!

 TOURIST ATTRACTIONS

 Finally, since you're going to be staying in Mitteldorf for a while, why
 not seek out some of its more unique attractions?

 Culturally speaking, the highlight has to be the Theatre. There are often
 crowds of people milling around trying to get tickets, and some of the
 fights that break out over the best seats are just as entertaining as the
 plays!

 If you are tempted to go inside, be prepared for a bit of audience
 participation. Because the city's actors haven't learned the art of fake
 swordplay, there is a shortage of quality actors. Just turn up, and
 they'll give you a part. If you survive the first performance, they'll
 probably make you a star!

 If you prefer more restful entertainment, seek out the Museum, which
 contains many relics of the glorious history of Mitteldorf and the island
 of Wolfsbrood. It is here that, one day, you might hope to find a written
 copy of the chronicle of your life, the legend of Valour. Of course,
 you'll be dead by then, but this isn't a complete hinderance to visiting
 the Museum, as you will tell from the staff (who are all Zombies...). Of
 course, gaping eye-holes and no ears makes reading or listening to your
 own life story a bit difficult, but you can still soak up the atmosphere.

 Finally, mention must be made of the Zoo, which is down on East Side,
 not far from the Main Gate. This houses the greatest collection of mean
 and nasty creatures anywhere in the world, and all collected from the
 dungeons under the city (which saved a fortune in transportation costs).
 This has to be worth a visit before you begin adventuring. Isn't it
 better to get a close look at a minotaur behind bars before you meet one
 in a dark cavern somewhere?

                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

               DENIZENS OF THE UNDER-CITY 'NEATH MITTELDORF

                             by Erik the Wolf


          I've added some of my own thoughts, Cousin, to what the old man
          has to say. He's only a lush these days, and it's been a long
          while since he stalked anything more lively than a boiled ham!
          Don't let all his warblins put you off - i've ne'er seen
          anything i'd be afrighted of!

                         ----- DEAR READER -----

      I write these words in the vain hope that you may avoid the fate
 that has befallen many brave and foolhardy souls. My name is Erik. You
 may have heard of me - once men called me Erik the Wolf. I fought in
 the Great Northern War, and destroyed King Peotr's fleet. Aye, all that
 and more before my fiftieth year. Then came I to Mitteldorf.

      I have battled many fell creatures in my time, yet even I was
 unprepared for the numbers that dwell 'neath the streets of this town -
 aye, and who even walk those streets, when the moon is full, or the heat
 of the summer drives them from their lairs. They're no different to the
 night-creatures that haunt many a tower in this world - there are just
 so many of them!

      The people of this town paid me well to walk the dark passages of
 the Under-city. I shed much inhuman blood. I also saw plenty of human
 blood spilled, friends of mine who died for a purse so small it would
 scarce buy a room and a flagon of cheap ale. Pah! Whose fault is it that
 the Under-city crawls with such vermin anyway?! Why can't they just be
 left alone?! What extra coin does a merchant require that he must send
 men to kill beasts 'neath the earth?

      Ah, but you do not want to know this, do you, my new-found friend?
 You bought this information because you too are a sword-for hire, and you
 hope the investment of a few coins will grant you an edge. I shall not
 disappoint you. You have chosen to enter the Under-city in search of
 adventure. I can promise you plenty.

      They say "forewarned is forearmed." Well I say, be forewarned, and
 then be well-armed as well. The creatures who inhabit the under-realm
 care not a fig for thy knowledge, but they respect a mighty sword-arm
 or a well-crafted spell, sure enough.

      So, I share my wisdom with you. I bid you heed it. What a grim joke!
 I wonder how many copies of my work have ended up in some monster's den,
 looted from the corpse of he who bought it? I pray you own this
 publication for rather more years than some.

 BAT

 Bats - the caverns are full of these accursed creatures. They are a grave
 nuisance. Not only are they almost impossible to hit while they wheel
 through the air, but they have fierce teeth and sharp talons. You need
 your wits about you, and stout armor about you even more!

 You can't avoid them, should you need to pass their lairs, since they
 "see" in the dark better than you or I see by day. Their wings make no
 sound as they beat, and the first you shall know of them shall be the
 close grip of their claws, and their sharp bite!

 Keep them at bay with your missles! If you must melee, remember that in
 vast caves, the advantage is all with them. Therefore, draw them into
 narrow spaces, with low roofs, where they cannot easily get behind you.

 And be warned - the other dwellers of the Under-city are better attuned
 to the bats' strange squels than are human ears. Disturbing a colony of
 bats might not only unleash a winged terror upon you, it might also bring
 curious goblins or lizard-men to discover what has caused the alarm....



 BEAR

 In days long past, hundreds of bears lived in the woods that covered
 the lower slopes of the mountain and the plains of this fair island. Now
 that so much of the land is inhabited and farmed, and the forests are
 cleared, the survivors have vanished into the Under-city.

 In their natural state, these beasts are shy, and fight only to protect
 their young. Those that lurk in the Under-city have been afflicted by a
 dangerous madness, however. They attack without warning, ambushing from
 the shadows. They possess a terrible cunning!


          I'm told they eats people! Leastways, that's what Monkey-Mad
          Marten says, an' he lost an arm fighting one. He says he
          wouldn't have been able to get away, if it hadn't stopped to
          take a bite from what it had ripped off....

                                  - 1 -
 _________________________________________________________________________

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 63)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 The most fearsome of these creatures is the Giant Red Bear. Some curse
 must have been laid upon this creature, for it is of monstrous size, and
 fearsome strength.

 There is no secret to fighting them; just do not let them grip you in
 their powerful arms! Aim for the body, where their thick pelt is less
 protecting.



 CYCLOPS

 Several massive beasts inhabit the Under-city, and I would sooner walk
 barefoot across hot coals than meet any of them. One of the most hideous
 is the Cyclops. These things - for I believe there is more than one of
 them - stand seven or eight feet tall, and wear no more than a simple
 loin cloth, though the air 'neath the City can oft' be as cold as a
 winter night.

 Their skin is as hard as marble, and you'll blunt the finest blade in
 Mitteldorf before you ever slay the brute.

 But the most fearsome aspect of the Cyclops is the single eye in the
 center of his brow, a wide, bloody, staring thing, as lifeless as a
 snake's, and capable, they say, of great magics.... I swear that must be
 the only thing - i'm told they cut their hair with a battle-axe....

 So, keep clear, and throw rocks or other missles at it. Best of all, the
 troll-like harridan who cooks for old man Skiold the Provisioner makes a
 meatball which is perfect for the task.

          Hey, Cousin!
          Why are cyclopses always a fightin'?
          Cause they don't see eye-to-eye!

 DEMON

 This horrid creature may never trouble you. If you are wise (and not all
 adventurers are stupid, though this condition is quite common) you will
 never dabble in the darkest forms of magic, nor will you associate - even
 at sword-point - with the acolytes of Demonology.

 Sadly, I have never knows men and women of lesser wisdom, who have spoken
 of the ultimate power and victory to be obtained through summoning
 elementals of great power. I have no idea where they are now; some dark
 dimension, I suspect, or limbo.... Demons only agree to one pact; one
 service in exchange for one soul.

 I beg you, even if you never heed another one of my words, have no truck
 with Demons....



 DRAGON

 Dragons are enormous, powerful winged creatures, If you have never seen
 one, take a visit to the south side of the island, where the King has set
 aside the rocky promontory beyond his hunting lodge for their nesting
 grounds.

 Through very unintelligent, dragons adore gems of all kinds, and their
 nests are decorated with wonderful treasures. They hoard gold, silver,
 weapons, armor, and many other items as well.

 I'm sure all thsi talk of gems and other treasure has whetted your
 appetite. And, I can tell you, some dragons inhabit the Under-city,
 hatched from eggs stolen by the goblins. So, let me prepare you for what
 will follow when you enter their lair.

 The dragon is armored from head to tail-tip in tough, flexible scales.
 Its internal organs are deep within its body, and the

          It's a pity he don' say where he's seen one!

 brain encased in thick bone. It has talons on its forelegs like butchers'
 knives, and its vast may elcoses rows of needle-sharp teeth. It can
 breathe fireballs which can roast a man faster then pig on a bonfire.

 These are truly deadly beasts!



 GHOST

 I have heard tell of terrible spirits who stalk the Under-city also. I
 have never seen one myself, although once I felt a chill on my back and,
 whirling, I thought my sword passed through something before the blade
 crashed into the wall.

          What I want to know is, if they're invisible, how's he drawed
          a picture of one?

 The only wise priest I ever knew told me that ghosts are tortured souls,
 the wraiths of men and women who have died through betrayal. Vengeance
 drives them. They haunt a particular place, or pursue a vendetta against
 the individual who robbed them of life. They suffer no distraction.

 For some, though, that vengeance never comes. Their enemies are taken
 from them by some other cause. These ghosts, my friend told me, wander
 eternity in search of the revenge they have been robbed of, resenting all
 living creatures. They rest for aeons but - if disturbed - attack with
 ultimate hatred.

 No ordinary blade can touch them. The magics which can dispel them are
 costly, but there can be no better investment.... not even life
 insurance.

 _________________________________________________________________________

 GIANT SPIDER

 I curse these venomous spiders almost more than any other, for I have
 seen many a companion yield to their vile poison. Watch you well - the
 bite of these beasts is deadly.

 In almost any lair, you will find these great beasts. As long in the body
 as a great hunting dog, with great long legs bent up high, and vast maws
 dripping venom - I have seen brave men become gibbering fools just at the
 sight of them. Clever sword-play will avail you nought. Strike hard at
 the eyes!

 They trap their pray as normal spiders do, building fantastic webs in
 dark places, or hiding in small side passages to trap passers-by. The
 goblins provide them with much of their diet... those pathetic creatures
 cannot resist their iron grip. A full-grown man, if he be strong enough,
 can pull free.

 And mark you well! If you are bitten, keep a close eye on your health
 and well-being. Should you feel sickness, or should your strength begin
 to fail you, 'tis a sure sign of the poison! Seek a remedy at the
 Temples, or from the leech. Otherwise, magic is the only cure!



 GOBLIN

 Goblins - these cunning little curs pollute the Under-city, like rats in
 a sewer. They are of little consequence individually, being quite small
 though hard-headed, and very weak. They have very little skill with
 weapons. Do not waste your magics upon them, for a good blow from even
 the least

 capable warrior should subdue the beasts. That said, they do hunt in
 great packs, and they have that peculiar bravery that comes from deep
 stupidity and cruel greed. It pays to be wary when there is no reason to
 believe a lair is close at hand. In large numbers, they can overwhelm
 even the most steadfast warriors. In Neustadt, they say, similar
 creatures massacred Prince Wolfram's whole guard in their camp during the
 march  back from the siege of Pfalzmarkt.

 Goblins have poor eyesight, but they do have a keen sense of smell. If
 there is any difference between the female and the male, i've never noted
 it, for they are all berserk fighters. They speak some guttural tongue
 amongst themselves, but I know no-one who can understand half a word of
 it. Small matter. When you invade their world, you will have no need of
 words when they seek to reclaim it.

          Just last week I had a run in with a whole hob of goblins! We
          slaughtered 'em! They're even weedier than he describes!



 GORGON

 They say that the women of Mitteldorf are the most beautiful in the
 world. I would not disagree, though I have traveled far. There are some,
 though, whose beauty is deadly.... Women of terrible splendor haunt the
 Under-city, women of whom it is said that the sight of can freeze a man
 to the spot, while their touch can turn his heart to stone.

 The gorgon is difficult to kill but - fortunately - does not have the
 power to deal death by force of

 arms of its larger brethern. Avoid her touch, and all should be well.

 Should you fail, the Temples may have some aid for you, though I never
 knew a priest who understood affairs of the heart.

          As if the ole fool did. I dunno what this is all about, Cousin!
          I seen some lovely women since I came to this town, but none as
          made me turn to stone.



 LAMIA

 Akin to the gorgon, the lamia has the body of a woman, but deformed by
 evil magics!
 
 The curse of the lamia is that she be part-woman, part-snake. They are
 carnivorous, and drink blood. The most adept seem to possess some
 mind-sapping magics that shred a man's mind.

 The lamia is an Amazon, and revels in battle. Like a Black Widow, she
 seeks to defeat and devour the male.

          Another part-woman! I thinks the old boy has some kind of
          problem....


 LIZARD MAN

 The lizard men lived on this island before Mitteldorf was more than a
 collection of rude huts on the shore. I have seen their colonies all
 over the world, connected by tunnels and volcanic shafts 'neath the
 ground.

 They are shy creatures, who keep well away from the by-ways of men, and
 with good reason. The colony here on Wolfbrood inhabits the warm beaches
 on the north of the island. They hunt and fish in the sun by day, and
 retire to their caves by night. They are col-blooded creatures, and
 warmth is as precious to them as bread and water to you and I. The hot
 volcanic springs 'neath Mitteldrof warm the steamy tunnels they inhabit.

 They speak in a rasping, aibilant language which I understand not a dozen
 words of. You'll find they will rarely offer to communicate, even to
 trade. They have few precious possessions

 _________________________________________________________________________

 save their families, and fight only when cornered. If left alone, they
 pose no threat to anyone!

          I swear, Cousin, the old man must be some kind of reptile-lover!
          The snake-men are cold-blooded, right enough - cold-blooded
          killers! They attacked the town's fishmen, and killin merchants
          who went among them to trade. I'd burn their vermin-ridden
          lairs and slaughter them all, young and old alike! See how they
          like the heat then!




 MINOTAUR

 Another of the great beasts is the Minotaur. Like all of them, he loves
 the taste of human meat - and Elven too, i'm told. I once saw a Minotaur
 refuse to eat a dwarf, but he had dined on five stout warriors already
 by then, and he may have had his fill.

 They stand about seven feet tall, and have massive heads, crowned with
 sharpened horns. Given room, they will charge with their heads lowered,
 trying to gore their enemies. Attacked from the side or rear they are
 less dangerous, though still fearsome.

 There si no reasoning with such brutish creatures. They are the most
 animlistic of creatures, though, and fear fire. A torch, or magical
 fire can do much to harm them that a sword cannot.

          I haven't seen one of these face-to-face yet, but One-eye
          Dorbson, he says he's seen plenty, and that they're a lot of
          bull!



 MUMMY

 Before burial was outlawed on Wolfsbrood, priests, mages, princes and
 other worthies would be embalmed upon death - that is, they would have
 all their innards removed and drained, and then they would be
 close-wrapped in cloth soaked in special preserving brines. The corpse
 would then be encased in a stone sarcophagus and buried deep 'neath the
 city.

 From what I have observed, then, even the tombs of the mighty have been
 defiled! For these mummies have risen!

           - Legends of Valour  (Page 70)  Legends of Valour -
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Mere zombies cannot compare with these horrors, for they can retain the
 powers and might they had a life, amplified by the long solitude of
 death.

 They have one weakness - they fear fire, for the wrappings that bind them
 are usually paper-dry, and the things can be destroyed by torch or magic
 spell. If you have no such means, then you must take great care, and
 break every last piece to atoms, lest the whole rises again!



 SATYR

 These creatures escaped from the King's dungeons, it is said, wherein
 they had been incarcerated since the fall of some great wizard-warlord.

 They stand as tall as a man, horned-headed, and with shaggy pelts,
 particularly on their heads and legs. They are canny fighters, difficult
 to overwhelm. But some have also the gift of magic, and can cast minor
 magics at will, though I believe only their clan-chiefs can cast greater
 spells. They are rumored to possess great treasure, and at least one
 merchant is supposed to have traded with them for pearls and diamonds.

 I have never had dealings with them, so I cannot claim to know their
 language. Gold, apparently, is one word which is sounded the same in
 their tongue as in ours....

          Oh really! If this is a satyr, I don't think it's funny!

 TROLL

 If ever creatures were worth avoiding, trolls are they. Huge, man-shaped
 creatures with skin like stone and the strength of ten! In far-off
 Anname, the warlords of that land train these beasts from when they are
 first born to fight in their armies. I saw five of the beasts break down
 the walls of Herio-ai and slaughter all its defenders, while a
 neighboring prince and all his army stood by drinking rice wine and
 waiting their moment to loot.

 They are flesh-eaters, and have little discrimination in their diet,
 although I have observed that they bore quickly of goblin-meat, and enjoy
 a delicacy such as an elf or a man. They also seem to find great pleasure
 in wearing the bones of their victims as jewelry. The females wear skirts
 made from femurs, and the chieftains wear skull necklaces, and stud their
 gigantic clubs with teeth. You will also find their homes decorated with
 broken armor and shields.

 What peirl, then, for Mitteldorf to have such monsters below its streets?
 Well, I tell you this; the trolls 'neath this town inhabit the darkest
 corners of the tunnels and caverns, living in small groups away from the
 more active goblin colonies, though close enough to hunt them. They shun

 trolls to attack, eh? A steady diet of rare meat finds its way to their
 lairs in search of treasure and adventure.

 They can be killed, but it takes more than some street-bravo with a sword
 to defeat them. Their belly is their weak point, but you must first keep
 clear of their clubs and fists. Disarmed and broken-limbed, they are much
 less of a threat.

          Ah! But the tales I could tell you of the treasures they horde!
          The old fool always leaves out they best bits!



 VAMPIRE

 You might wonder if I am not a little befuddled to speak of vampires. Who
 in Mitteldorf has ever seen one? What evidence is there that they exist?

 You must have heard the legends of these fiendish ever-living creatures;
 how they drink the blood of living creatures to preserve their sinister
 beauty, and how they shun the cleansing purity of running water, garlic,
 and sunlight.

 They are the essence of evil. I am one of those who shares the opinion
 that it is an ancient vampire who is responsible for raising the zombies
 from their graves. Many others have been afflicted with the curse since
 then.

 For, though the authorities deny it, I am sure many lesser vampires stalk
 the streets of the city at night, victims of the greater evil. When an
 ancient Vampire does not wholly drain the blood of a victim, he infects
 the victim with the curse. Vampirism is a contagion, a disease. In the
 early stages, the victim appears much as before, though the color soon
 vanishes from their skin, and they develop a tatse for raw meat. Later,
 they will develop a taste for hot blood. It takes some time for the full
 grip of vampirism to take place, when the taste becomes a driving hunger.
 A madness then takes over them, so that they do not even know the time of
 day....

 Vampires develop unnatural strength, and - in time - they are said to be
 able to turn their flesh, which can be burned by sunlight, into a cold
 vapor. They become ever more beasutiful to behold, which is one clue to
 their identity. Of course, if you drive your blade into the heart of
 every attractive citizen you meet, you will soon be hunted by every
 wtachman in Mitteldorf!

          If you ever listen to this old fool, he'll have you believin'
          every other man in Mitteldorf is vampire! Heck - i'm parcel to
          a sip of Ox blood myself, and i've never been near no undead.



 WEREWOLF

 In amuses me greatly that so many adventurers pass into the Under-city
 to seek out werewolves, for its surely well-known that many openly walk
 the streets of Mitteldorf by night. Ask yourself this; who have I
 encountered in this place who, for one full week in each month, rises
 not in the day, but breathes the clearer air of night?

 Better yet, save yourself the trouble of seeking out the were-beasts,
 and sleep openly in the street. If you are wakened by a sharp point and
 a growling wolfish voice, then 'yis only a member of His Majesty's Town
 Guard. If you wake not at all, then you have found your werewolf.

 Why, you ask, do the authorities, who police the streets of many other
 misdemeanors, not stir themselves to burn out the contagion? Ask yourself
 again; if you were a watchman, to whom would you sooner explain the
 King's justice? A drunk sleeping in a doorway? A man peeking through
 another man's windows? Or a seven-foot tall, steel-muscled man in
 wolfshide, whose talons can shred armor like shears cut through silk?

 On the whole, werewolves are to be avoided. Of course, you can put your
 faith in the charms and gew-jaws carried by credulous aimpletons, or arm
 yourself with silvered

 weapons, spells, and wolfsbane. Certainly, these provide greater
 protection than normal weapons. For all the good they do, you might just
 as well carry a dog whistle.

 One more thing. Do your fellow citizens the coutesy of taking a hard look
 in a mirror before you venture out at night. Lycanthropy, the disease of
 the were-folk, is highly infectious. You may congratulate yourself for
 having slain a werewolf and having taken scarce a scratch, but you will
 be premature to do so. Within the month, you woo will know the joys of
 running padded-foot through the streets with your clothes in rags with
 a rancid taste in your mouth....



 ZOMBIE

 You search in vain for a graveyard in Mitteldorf. The dead, when their
 remains require disposal, are burned in the Temples, or carried out to
 sea on funeral ships. Of course, the latter is the only fitting one for
 a warrior or king, but I have never known another city where the common
 folk aren't tumbled into a hole in the ground at the edge of the fields
 they have worked all their lives.

 Mitteldorf is different for a reason. In times past, burial was a regular
 here as in any other city-state. There was a cemetary 'neath the Dwarven
 Quarter, and another near East Side. Many others were interred beyond the
 city walls.

 Then, as the City grew, came reports of disturbances in the graveyards,
 of tombs opened and recent burials dug up. Guards were placed to prevent

 their trade. The guards disappeared. Then the guards reappeared, slack-
 jawed and loose-fleshed, shuffling through the streets. Mitteldorf
 discovered it was plauged by the risen dead.

 Many were suspected of necromancy. Women were burned by Witchfinders, and
 men tortured by our energetic priesthood. All this was to no avail; the
 dead continued to return. Finally, the King outlawed burial, and the
 Temples opened their sacrificial chambers to more mudane business. I
 mention all thsi to make the point that the undead of Mitteldorf are
 ancient beings - although I suppose a few are recent victims of the
 aeons-old. They have a great and grisly wisdom, a hungry cunning. They
 stalk the living with a cold passion.

 They have no vitals in which to thrust your blade, nor any brain to
 smash. The only way to defeat them is to reduce their bones to dust and
 fragments. Crippling their limbs makes them less dangerous, but I have
 seen a single finger drag itself along in pursuit of flesh. They are
 horror incarnate, and their black talons inflict flesh-rot. There are
 charms and magics which to repel them, but nothing succeeds better
 against these abominations than crushing force of arms!
