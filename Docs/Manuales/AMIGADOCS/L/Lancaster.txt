AIM INDICATOR...TURNING THIS ON WILL GIVE YOU ARROWS ON THE SCREEN TO SHOW
                YOU WHERE TO FIRE.THIS IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL DURING A NIGHT
                RAID.
AUTO TARGETTER..ENABLING THIS OPTION MEANS THAT YOUR CURSOR WILL CHANGE
                SHAPE WHENEVER YOU ARE ON TARGET.
INSTRUCTOR......"LANCASTER" HAS A BUILT IN TUTORIAL MODE.THIS OPTION WILL
                TURN IT ON.THE INSTRUCTOR WILL COMMENT ON EVERYTHING YOU
                DO-GOOD OR BAD.WHEN PLAYING,MESSAGES WILL APPEAR ON THE
                SCREEN THE FIRST TIME ANYTHING HAPPEN,AND THE GAME WILL
                PAUSE UNTIL YOU PRESS THE SPACEBAR.
STATIONARY HANDS...THIS IS INCLUDED TO ALLOW YOU TO TURN OFF THE MOVING
                HANDS,WHICH HAVE NO ACTUAL PURPOSE IN THE GAME BUT TO ADD
                TO THE VISUAL EFFECT.
DEMONSTRATION MODE...TURN THIS ON WITH CAUTION.IT WILL TAKE OVER THE GAME
                AND PLAY,UNTIL DEATH,AGAINST ITSELF.NOTICE THAT IT WILL
                ALSO TAKE OVER THE PRESSING OF THE SPACEBAR (FOR EXAMPLE
                WHEN THE INSTRUCTOR IS ON.)IT WILL NOT ALTER ANY OF THE
                SAVED GAMES,WHETHER IT IS SUCCESSFUL OR NOT.
SEARCH LIGHTS...IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE SEARCHLIGHTS (WHICH APPEAR ONLY AT
                NIGHT.) THEN SIMPLY REMOVE THEM.
BARRAGE BALLOONS...TURNING THESE OFF WILL SPEED UP THE GAME,BUT YOU WILL
                NO LONGER BE ABLE TO PICK UP SOME EXTRA POINTS. *
ACE FIGHTERS...USE THIS OPTION TO REMOVE THE TOUGHEST OPPONENTS. **
FRIENDLY LANCASTERS...AN OPTION TO REMOVE THE FRIENDLY LANCASTERS FROM
               PLAY WHICH HELPS YOU IN AS MUCH AS YOU CANT SHOOT THEM DOWN
               SO YOU CANT LOSE ANY POINTS.**
FLAK...........THE FLAK CAN BE REMOVED MAKING THE GAME MUCH EASIER.**
START PRACTICE...THIS AND THE NEXT ITEM ARE NOT IN FACT TRUE OPTIONS.ONCE
               PRESSED THE CHECKLIST WILL FADE OUT AND THE GAME WILL GO
               ON TO OTHER OPTIONS.
               THE PRACTICE MODE LETS YOU PRACTICE THE "SHOOT-EM-UP" PARTS
               OF THE GAME BUT WITHOUT THE NEED TO FLY THE PLANE AND TRY A
               FULL MISSION.
START SIMULATION...STARTING A FULL GAME IS THE LAST OPTION.NOTE THAT ON
               SIMULATION MODE MOST OF THE OPTIONS CANNOT BE CHANGED- IT
               IS THE AUTHORS INTENTION THAT THERE IS NO EASY WAY OUT.
               THUS THE INSTRUCTOR AND DEMO MODE WORK,BUT ONLY THE FRIEND

               EFING.)SWITCH ON/OFF OTHER ITEMS HAS NO EFFECT.

        * TURNING OFF THESE OPTIONS WILL SPEED UP THE GAME

       ** TURNING OFF THESE OPTIONS WILL REDUCE YOUR MISSION SCORE.

CHOOSING THE TIME OF THE MISSION
--------------------------------

SIMULATION MODE AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNS THE TIME OF YOUR RAID,BUT IN PRACTICE
THIS IS AN OPTION.
ANY MISSION CAN BE ATTEMPTED AT DAY,NIGHT OR DAWN.THIS AFFECTS BOTH THE
SCORE AND THE DIFFICULTY OF YOUR MISSION.

DAWN...THIS IS THE EASIEST TIME TO ATTACK.THE ENEMY ARE RELATIVELY WEAK,AND
THE VISIBILITY IS FAIRLY GOOD-HOWEVER THERE IS NO BONUS FOR A SUCCESSFUL
MISSION.
NIGHT...WHILST FIGHTER ACTIVITY IS FAIRLY LOW,THEY ARE VERY HARD TO SEE AND
WILL BE ON YOU BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.THERE IS A 50,000 BONUS FOR COMPLETING A
NIGHT MISSION.
DAY...THIS IS THE HARDEST OPTION GIVING A 100,000 BONUS FOR COMPLETION. OF
COURSE THE FIGHTER ACTIVITY IS INTENSE AND PERSISTENT,AND WHILST THE 
VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD,IF YOU CAN SEE THEM,THEN THEY CAN SEE YOU....

TO CHOOSE WHICH TIME FOR YOUR MISSION YOU SHOULD CLICK THE BOX TO THE 
BOTTTOM RIGHT OF THE CORRECT TIMESCAPE.(A TICK WILL APPEAR IN THE BOX.)
ONCE THIS IS DONE SIMPLY CLICK THE CONTINUE BOX AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.

CHOOSING THE MISSION
--------------------

PRACTICE MODE GIVES NO OPPORTUNITY TO LOAD/SAVE GAMES AND WILL AUTOMATICALLY
FLICK TO THE "CHOOSING PILOT STAGE".YOU SHOULD NOW SEE A SCREEN OF A MISSION
BRIEFING ROOM.ON THE BLACKBOARD ARE THE MISSIONS WHICH CAN BE ATTEMPTED-
THESE ARE GAMES WHICH YOU HAVE STARTED,BUT HAVE NOT COMPLETED.HENCE ON LOADING
THE GAME FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY SHOULD APPEAR BLANK.ALSO AT THE VERY BOTTOM 
IS A MISSION MARKED "NEW" AND HAS QUESTION MARKS FOR THE MISSION NUMBER.ON
YOUR FIRST GO CLICK ON THIS TO START A "NEW" CHARACTER OR CALLSIGN.IF THIS
IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE PLAYED THE GAMETHEN CLICK ON THE APPROPRIATE
CALLSIGN.
N.B. YOU CAN CLEAR ALL THE OLD SAVED GAMES BY PRESSING CTRL+ESCAPE.
BE WARNED THEY ARE PERMANENTLY DESTROYED(UNLESS THE DEMONSTRATOR IS ON,IN
WHICH CASE ALTHOUGH THE BOARD IS CLEARED THEY ARE NOT REMOVED FROM THE 
DISC.)IF YOU HAVE CHOSEN A PREVIOUSLY SELECTED CHARACTER ,SKIP TO THE
"MISSION BRIEFING" SECTION.

CHOOSING THE PILOT
------------------

IF YOU CLICKED THE "NEW" CALL SIGN,THEN YOU WILL NOW FACE A SCREEN OF THE 3
PILOTS YOU MAY CHOOSE TO REPRESENT.MOVING THE R.A.F. SYMBOL TO THE LEFT AND
RIGHT CHANGES WHO IS SELECTED.(THE NAME OF THE SELECTED PERSON APPEARS IN
THE BOX ABOVE THEIR HEADS.)THE 3 PILOTS YOU CAN BE ARE JENNINGS,THOMPSON AND
PENNINGTON.THERE ARE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES TO EACH ONE.

THOMPSON IS THE "NEW" BOY IN THE SQUADRON.HE IS A COMPLETE NOVICE AND IS
INITIALLY THE EASIEST CHOICE.WITH THOMPSON IT IS MUCH EASIER TO HIT THE
AIRCRAFT,BUT BEING A NOVICE HE HAS TO DO A COMPLETE 30 MISSION STINT BEFORE
BEING DECOMISSIONED.

JENNINGS IS THE 2ND EASIEST,OR 2ND HARDEST DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.
HE LEFT ACTIVE SERVICE 2 YEARS AFTER COMPLETING 15 MISSIONS TO TRAIN PILOTS
ONCE A "HOTSHOT" HE IS NOW A BIT RUSTY,BUT IS STILL BETTER THAN THOMPSON.IT
IS HARDER FOR YOU BUT THERE IS STILL 15 MISSIONS LEFT TO DO.

PENNINGTON IS THE BEST PILOT AVAILABLE.WITH 20 SUCCESSFUL MISSIONS TO HIS
CREDIT.THIS MEANS HE IS THE HARDEST FOR YOU TO EMULATE,BUT THERE ARE ONLY
10 MISSIONS LEFT TO DO BEFORE HE CAN RELAX IN A NICE COSY DESK JOB SOME-
WHERE.
 ONCE YOU HAVE DECIDED WHO YOU WISH TO USE MOVE THE CURSOR OVER THEM AND
CLICK.

CHOOSING A CALL SIGN
--------------------

AFTER CHOOSING THE PILOT AND THEREFORE THE MISSION SCHEDULE,YOU COME BACK TO
THE BLACKBOARD.YOU CAN THEN ENTER THE CALLSIGN YOU ARE GOING TO OPERATE UNDER
*NOTE THAT THESE ARE YOUR REFERENCE ONLY AND CAN BE DUPLICATED.USE THE UP/
DOWN CURSOR KEYS TO GET TO EACH LETTER AND SPACE TO SKIP TO THE NEXT LETTER.
THE LETTER YOU ARE HAS A FLASHING LINE UNDERNEATH.ONCE ALL FOUR DIGITS HAVE
BEEN LOGGED ON THE SCREEN WILL FADE TO A CLOSEUP OF YOUR PILOT,AND HIS PRE-
VIOUS FLIGHT RECORD.

THE MISSION BRIEFING
--------------------

A MAP OF WESYTERN EUROPE WILL FADE IN WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF TEXT.THE MAP
CONTAINS A LUFTWAFFE SYMBOL (YOUR TARGET) AND AN R.A.F. SYMBOL (YOUR BASE)
THE TEXT TELLS YOU WHICH MISSION YOU ARE ON AND WHAT YOUR TARGET IS.

PRESS SPACEBAR OR A JOYSTICK/MOUSEBUTTON TO CONTINUE TO THE MAIN GAME.

THE MISSION CONTROL SCREEN
--------------------------

THE MISSION CONTROL SCREEN WILL APPEAR AFTER TWO INTRODUCTORY ANIMATED
SCREENS (ONE IN STANDARD ANIMATED STYLE AND ONE IN SOLID 3D.)THE MISSION
CONTROL SCREEN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO FAMILIARISE YOURSELF WITH.
IT CONSISTS OF:-
1>.A MAP OF WESTERN EUROPE,4 TIES LARGER THAN THAT OF THE MISSION BRIEFING
SCREEN,AND WITH ALL THE MAJOR TOWNS MARKED.
2>.THE DATE AND TIME IN THE TOP LEFT HAND CORNER.THIS IS CRUCIAL IN CALCUL-
ATING HOW MUCH FUEL YOU HAVE.ON A GOOD NIGHT A LANCASTER CAN FLY FOR NEARLY
SIX HOURS,BUT IF YOUVE BEEN HIT BADLY THEN YOULL HAVE TO ESTIMATE JUST HOW
MUCH FUEL YOUVE LOST.
3>.A LARGE R.A.F.SYMBOL THIS (AS ON THE BRIEFING SCREEN) IS YOUR HOME BASE.
4>.A LUFTWAFFE SYMBOL DENOTING THE TARGET AREA.THIS IS NOT ALWAYS VISIBLE
AS IT IS OFTEN OFF SCREEN.
5>.A FLASHING RED/YELLOW CIRCLE MOVABLE BY THE MOUSE/JOYSTICK.THIS IS YOUR
TARGET CURSOR.THE LANCASTER (SEE BELOW) FLIES TOWARDS THIS AND HENCE IS 
USED FOR NAVIGATION.
6>.A SMALL R.A.F. SYMBOL THIS IS THE LANCASTER ITSELF.
YOU SHOULD HAVE MENTALLY NOTED THE LOCATION OF THE TARGET FROM THE BRIEFING
AND YOU SHOULD NOW HEAD TOWARDS THIS (ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE OFF SCREEN DUE TO
THE MAGNIFICATION OF THE MAP) USING THE TARGET CURSOR TO SHOW THE LANCASTER
WHERE TO FLY.
TO LEAVE THE SCREEN SIMPLY USE THE TARGET CURSOR TO FORCE THE LANCASTER TO
THE EDGES,THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT DELAY (AS THE NEXT CHUNK OF MAP IS LOADED
IN FROM DISC.) AND YOU WILL BE ON THE NEXT SCREEN.
AT ANY TIME (WHEN OVER ENEMY TERRITORY) YOU COULD BE ATTACKED.WHEN THIS 
HAPPENS OR YOU ENTER THE FINAL APPROACH TO THE TARGET (BETWEEN 9 AND 12
MILES OUT) A MESSAGE WILL FLASH AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN,AND YOU MUST PRESS
THE SPACEBAR TO ENGAGE THEM.
IN FACT THERE ARE FIVE WAYS OF EXITING THE MISSION CONTROL SCREEN:
1>.ENGAGING THE ENEMY.WHEN YOU ARE FLYING OVER ENEMY TERRITORY,THERE IS THE
CHANCE OF FLYING OVER A BUILT UP AREA.FLAK,SEARCHLIGHTS,AND FIGHTERS -
USUALLY OVER URBAN AREAS (BUT NOT ALWAYS).ONCE IT HAS BEEN LEARNT WHERE 
THESE AREAS OF RESISTANCE ARE THEY CAN BE AVOIDED.IF THIS HAPPENS THE MESS-
AGE WILL READ "BOMBER UNDER ATTACK",AND YOU WILL GO INTO TAILGUNNER MODE.
2>.INTERCEPTION BY THE ENEMY.DURING A DAY RAID (IN PARTICULAR) YOU MAY BE
INTERCEPTED BY ENEMY FIGHTERS.THE OPPOSITION WILL NOT BE AS STIFF COMPARED
TO THE ABOVE SITUATION HOWEVER.THE FLASHING MESSAGE READS "INTERCEPTION BY
ENEMY" AND PRESSING THE SPACEBAR WILL PUT YOU INTO TAILGUNNER MODE.
3>.ENTERING FINAL APPROACH.PLANES/FLAK/ETC WILL AUTOMATICALLY FIGHT YOU 
FURIOUSLY WHEN YOU ARE WITHIN 10 MILES OF THE TARGET.SEE "FINAL APPROACH"
BELOW.THE MESSAGE WILL READ "ENTERING FINAL APPROACH".
4>.LANDING AT R.A.F. BASE.AS LONG AS YOU HAVE LEFT THE FIRST (S/E BRITAIN)
SCREEN YOU MAY,AT ANY TIME,LAND BACK AT YOUR R.A.F. BASE.OBVIOUSLY IT WILL
BE MOSTLY AFTER YOU HAVE COME BACK FROM A MISSION,BUT A MISSION MAY BE 
ABORTED IF HEAVY DAMAGE IS INCURRED IN AN ENGAGEMENT BY SIMPLY FLYING TO-
WARDS THE R.A.F.SYMBOL.OBVIOUSLY YOU CANNOT DO THIS FROM ANY SECTION BUT 
THE MISSION CONTROL (I.E. DURING AN ATTACK).THE MESSAGE READS "APPROACHING
LANDING STRIP".
5>.RUNNING OUT OF FUEL.YOUR LANCASTER CANNOT STAY ALOFT FOR EVER.THIS IS 
MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR ON LATER MISSIONS WHERE STRONGER OPPONENTS AND LONGER
HAULS MAKE FUEL EXTREMELY TIGHT.

THE TAILGUNNER MODE
-------------------

AFTER YOU HAVE PRESSED SPACEBAR TO ENTER INTO COMBAT,YOU ARE IN TAILGUNNER
MODE.THIS IS WHERE ALL COMBAT TAKES PLACE.USING THE MOUSE OR JOYSTICK YOU
MOVE YOUR CROSSHAIRS AROUND THE SCREEN-NOTE-THE HANDS MOVE IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION-AND PRESSING FIRE/LEFT-HAND MOUSEBUTTON WILL FIRE THE 4 BROWNING
.303S AT THE PART OF THE SCREEN THE TARGET IS POINTING TO.AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE SCREEN (THE COCKPIT PART) YOU WILL SEE SEVERAL DIALS.

SCORE: THIS IS THE SCORE ACCUMULATED DURING THE MISSION.NOT THE SCORE ON 
THE BLACKBOARD.THIS IS THE SCORE WHICH IS TOTALLED UP (TOGETHER WITH ANY
BONUS/PENALTY) AT DE-BRIEFING.(SEE "DEBRIEFING" SECTION.)

TIME: PURELY FOR GENERAL INFORMATION AND SELF EXPLANATORY.

TARGET DISTANCE: THIS DIAL INDICATES THE (APPROXIMATE) DISTANCE TO THE 
TARGET,ESPECIALLY USEFUL DURING THE "FINAL APPROACH". (SEE BELOW)

ALTITUDE: THIS,ALONG WITH THE SPEED,GIVES A ROUGH IMPRESSION OF THE WELL
BEING OF THE LANCASTER.KEEP AN EYE ON THEM BOTH.IF YOU DONT THEN YOU MAY
WELL FIND YOURSELF SUDDENLY ABOARD A FIREBALL....

SPEED: SEE ABOVE
NOTE* THAT YOU CAN AT ANY TIME PRESS THE SPACEBAR FOR AN OUTSIDE VIEW FROM
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET IN FRONT,LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANCASTER.

FINAL APPROACH
--------------

THINGS ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DURING THE FINAL APPROACH.THE TARGET DISTANCE
WILL (FOR INSTANCE) BE COUNTED DOWN BY THE PILOT AND WHEN IT IS AT NOUGHT 
YOU WILL BE PROPELLED INTO THE BOMB RUN.

THE BOMB RUN
------------

THIS IS THE LAST OF THE GAME SUB-SECTIONS AND VARIES IN STYLE FROM ALL THE
OTHERS.THE VIEW IS THE BOMB AIMERS(WHO WAS SITUATED AT THE VERY FRONT-JUST
UNDER THE FRONT PILOT),AND HENCE IS A TOP VIEW OF THE GROUND SCROLLING RIGHT
TO LEFT.THERE IS A CURSOR (AS IN TAILGUNNER MODE) WHICH IS USED (AGAIN MOVED
BY THE MOUSE/JOYSTICK) TO TARGET WHERE THE BOMBS WILL BE DROPPED.THEY ARE 
DROPPED BY PRESSING (AND HOLDING) THE FIRE/MOUSEBUTTON.THERE IS ALSO THE
ABILITY TO "ZOOM" IN/OUT (NOTE THIS IS NOT THE LANCASTER SWOOPING) IT IS 
TELESCOPIC.THE "ZOOM" AUTOMATICALLY EXPANDS THE AREA THE CURSOR IS POINTING
AT AND IS ACTIVATED BY THE UP/DOWN CURSOR KEYS.
THE BOMB RUN IS EXITED WHEN EITHER ALL BOMBS ARE DROPPED OR THE TARGET AREA 
IS PASSED.YOU THEN RETURN TO THE MISSION CONTROL SCREEN.

LANDING
-------

LANDING IS ACHIEVED BY GUIDING YOUR PLANE (ON THE MISSION CONTROL SCREEN) TO
THE LARGE R.A.F.SYMBOL.THE PLANE WILL THEN LAND AND A CAR WILL PULL UP BESIDE
IT CONTAINING EITHER YOUR GIRLFRIEND YOUR WIFE OR YOUR MOTHER DEPENDING ON
THE PILOT YOU CHOOSE.THEN THERE IS A STATIC SCREEN OF THE PILOT AND GIRL-
FRIEND (OR WIFE ETC) TOGETHER. THIS WILL STAY THERE A SHORT WHILE AND YOU
WILL THEN RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL SCREEN,WHERE YOU WILL BE TOLD OF THE SUCCESS
OR FAILURE OF YOUR MISSION......
SUCCESS DEPENDS ON DOING OR ATTEMPTING TO DO THE BOMB RUN,AND NOT INCURRING
HUGE PENALTIES.OF COURSE,THIS ONLY MATTERS IF YOU ARE IN SIMULATION MODE...

FINISHING THE GAME
------------------
ON COMPLETING THE 30TH MISSION YOU WILL SEE ONE MORE SCREEN.....

NOTES ON HISTORICAL ACCURACY
----------------------------

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT,WHILST WE HAVE ENDEAVORED TO KEEP THE GAME AS AUTH-
ENTIC AS POSSIBLE,THERE ARE SOME OBVIOUS DISCREPANCIES.THESE HAVE BEEN MADE
WITH GOOD REASON.E.G. TO KEEP THE GAME PLAYABLE.

THE MISSIONS: WE DECIDED TO MAKE THE MISSIONS FICTICIOUS SO AS NOT TO OFFEND
THE MEN AND THERE FAMILIES WHO TOOK PART IN THEM.NOTE HOWEVER THEY ARE ACC-
URATE IN THEIR TYPE.

TAILGUNNER MODE: THIS CONTAINS THE MOST "ARTISTIC LICENCE" IF THE GAME WERE
STRICTLY ACCURATE THEN THE TAILGUNNER WOULD SIMPLY PLOD ALONG FOR HOURS.IF A
PLANE WAS INTERCEPTED THEN HE WOULD HAVE VERY LITTLE CHANCE OF SHOOTING IT
DOWN BEFORE BEING SHOT UP HIMSELF.

ENEMY FIGHTERS: THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY OF THEM,AND THEY ARE MUCH TOO EASY TO
SHOOT...SEE ABOVE.

BARRAGE BALLOONS: AS MOST PEOPLE REALISE THEY DO NOT FLOAT AROUND AT 10,000
FEET.ALSO THE LANCASTER FLIES PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO THEM.IN REALITY YOUR
LANCASTER WOULD PROBABLY HIT THE CABLE SECURING THEM.

FLAK: FLAK WAS THE COLD KILLER-THE HATE OF ALL FLIERS.RANDOM AND UNAVOIDABLE
IT SURELY COULDNT BE SHOT DOWN BY MACHINE GUN FIRE?....

BOMB RUN: THE BOMB RUN IS ALSO EXTREMELY UNREALISTIC.THE BOMBER WOULD SIMPLY
DROP THEIR BOMBS WHERE THE PATH FINDER FORCE HAD DROPPED MARKER FLARES (OR
WHERE FIRES FROM PREVIOUS BOMBER LOADS HAD STARTED).

FLYING A BOMBER IN W.W.II. WAS NOT GLAMOROUS IN THE SLIGHTEST AND SURVIVING
TO ITS END WAS INFLUENCED BY LUCK AS MUCH AS SKILL....

A TRUE "SIMULATION" IN OUR OPINION WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT GAMEPLAY TO DO
JUSTICE TO THE PUBLIC AND HENCE WE HAVE MADE THE CHANGES ABOVE TO KEEP THE
GAME EXCITING.ANY OFFENCE DRAWN FROM THIS IS PURELY UNINTENTIONAL.....
