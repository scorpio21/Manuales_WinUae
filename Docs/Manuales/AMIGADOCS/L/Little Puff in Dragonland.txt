INTRODUCTION
------------

Little Puffs mum has told him not to wander too far from home.  But one day
he could not resist the temptation to go off and explore the mysterious
world that lay beyond Dragon land.  After a while he was hungry - but he was
to little and not fierce enough to catch anything, so he ran huffing and 
puffing his way back home for dinner.  But his way was blocked by a ferocious
guard demanding a Pass.  What could Puff do - he had no Pass! This is where
you come in...

	...you must help Puff find the 4 parts to the Pass, avoiding hazards
that confront him at every turn - and guide him safely back home!
