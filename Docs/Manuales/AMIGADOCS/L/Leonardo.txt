                                  LEONARDO

INTRODUCTION

Leonardo is a little thief who steals nearly everything he can get his
hands on. Accompany Leonardo on his criminal trips. Help Leonardo to
avoid the numerous alarm systems, guards and ghosts. Follow Leonardo's
way through fifty different banks, museums and warehouses. The existence
of our little burglar depends on your skill and tactical superiority.

SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Commodore Amiga 512K / Atart ST 512K. Joystick required.

LOADING THE GAME

Put the program disk in your internal drive when you start your
computer.

OPENING SEQUENCE

After a short loading process, a title sequence appears on the screen.
Press your joystick button to leave this mode.

THE OPENING MENU

START GAME          - Enter the world of Leonardo
SHOW HIGH SCORE     - See the high score champions
WHAT IS WHAT        - Explanations of the various objects
PASSWORD            - See explanation below

PASSWORD

After level 10, 20 and 30 you will receive a password. By entering the
password you can start the game (with Start Game) directly on the current
level. Level 40 and 50 do not have any more passwords. You will have to
be able to play the remaining levels with five Leonardos (this was
Leonardo's idea, and we were not able to dissuade him from it.)

END OF GAME

After having successfully passed all the levels you will be rewarded with
a photograph from Leonardo's private album.

PLAYING THE GAME

Using your joystick, you lead Leonardo through the several buildings.
By pressing the fire button, you can make Leonardo push everything
which comes in his way except for the walls of the building he is in.
The pushed objects do not stop moving until they collide with
hindrances or with other objects. The guards and the ghosts are stopped
by a collision with pushed objects and returned to the Watchman Lodge.

RADAR

If you should become disorientated, you can find out where you are by
watching the radar in the lower half of the screen. On the radar, the
guards and the ghosts are shown as white dots, the loot as three red
dots, and Leonardo as a yellow dot. Attention! Leonardo has
constructed the radar himself. Disturbances are highly possible!

TIME LIMIT

You only have a limited time for burglary. The number of seconds is
shown at the bottom of the screen, next to the word "TIME." Running
out of time will result in a jailed Leonardo!

BONUS

From time to time you will find a bonus key which allows you to enter a
room filled with pearls. You will then have a certain amount of time to
collect as many pearls as possible.

GOAL

The object of the game is to push all three equal items in one line to
complete a level.

PRISON

If you get arrested (Leonardo will hardly be happy about that,) you will
see the number of your free Leonardos carved into the prison wall.
