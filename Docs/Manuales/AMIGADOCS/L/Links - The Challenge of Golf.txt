Installing LINKS on your hard drive:

	- LINKS must be installed on a hard drive and requires approximately
          1.9 Mb of free space.

	- You should use the INSTALL program to load LINKS onto your hard
          drive.

	- INSTALL will create a subdirectory called "LINKS" and copy all files
          from the floppy disks into the LINKS subdirectory.

Running the INSTALL program:

	1. Insert DISK 1 in the drive you wish to install from.

	2. From the Workbench

		a. Double click on LINKS1 Icon.
		b. Double click on LINKS INSTALL Icon.
	
	3. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete installation.

Alternate Installation Method:

	If the INSTALL program fails to operate properly, you may install
        LINKS manually from the CLI as follows:

		STEP 1. Change directories to the drive on which you wish to
                        install LINKS.
		STEP 2. Insert the LINKS Disk 1 into drive df0:.
		STEP 3. Type: COPY df0:LINKS to LINKS ALL [Enter]
		STEP 4. Repeat Steps 2 & 3 with Disk 2 and Disk 3.

IMPORTANT NOTE: LINKS requires 530K of free memory at runtime to operate
                properly.

Memory Usage:

	LINKS requires at least 1 meg to operate.  If you have extra memory,
        LINKS can use this memory to pre-load course data, graphics and sound.
        This will save loading time and can significantly increase drawing
        speed and speed of play.

Using a mouse:

	Most actions are performed using the left mouse button.  In some
        cases, double clicking on a selection may be substituted for pressing
        the OK button.


START SECTION - RUNNING LINKS

	To start LINKS from CLI:

		1. Type: CD LINKS [Enter]
		2. Type: LINKS [Enter]

	To start LINKS from the Workbench:

		1. Double click on the LINKS Drawer then
		2. Double click on the LINKS Icon.

	The Title Sequence and Credits will appear.  If you wish to bypass the
	title sequence, press the < SPACE BAR >.

	PLEASE NOTE: You can run LINKS without the title screen by typing:
	GOLF [Enter]

MAIN SELECTION SCREEN

	After the Title, you will automatically come to the Main Selection
        Screen.  This is essentially your Home Base, and you have several
        options available:

	START - Begin a round of golf.
	PRACTICE - Head to the practice area.
	RESUME - Resume playing a previously saved game.
	PLAYERS - Add a new player or modify an existing player's preferences.
	SYSTEM - Modify your equipment setup specifications.
	INFO - Review Update Information on this version of LINKS.
	EXIT - Exit LINKS and return to the system.

BEGINNING A ROUND OF GOLF

	While in the Main Selection Screen, move the cursor over the START box
        and click on the left button.

SELECTING A COURSE TO PLAY

	Choose a course from the COURSE LIST, then click [OK].  LINKS comes
        with one Championship Course, Torrey Pines.  Additional courses will
        be available over the next few months.

SELECTING THE PLAYERS

	Only players whose names are on the GAME LIST will participate in the
        round about to be played.  Players are added to the GAME LIST by
        choosing (clicking on) names from the PLAYER FILE.  With this sytem,
        it is only necessary to enter a player's name and preferences once. 
        You can have as many players as you wish in the PLAYER FILE and then
        select up to 8 to participate in the upcoming round.

	If your name is not in the PLAYER FILE, click on the ADD box.  This
        will bring up the ADD PLAYER screen.  Simply type your name and press
        ENTER.  Notice that your preferences have been highlighted in yellow.
        If you wish to change them, you can do so by clicking on the
        appropraite box. (Refer to the PLAYERS Section for more information on
        ADDING and MODIFYING players and prefs.)  When your GAME LIST is
        complete, click on [OK]. Note: Names can be removed from the GAME LIST
        by clicking on them.

SELECTING THE NUMBER OF HOLES, TEES AND PLAY LEVELS

	The last screen to appear before you tee off is called the READY TO
        PLAY screen.  Here you can choose to play 18 holes or the Front or
        Back 9.  You are also given the opportunity to temporarily change your
        preferences.  You can have a different playing level and different
        tees for this round if you choose.  Simply click on the appropriate
        boxes and when all is READY, click on [OK].

	NOTE: LEVEL refers to either PROfessional, AMateur, or BEGinner.  On
              the PRO level, swing timing is very critical, but you can obtain
              the greatest distance.  AMateur is not as demanding on timing,
              but your distance is decreased approximately 10%.  The BEGinner
              level is the most forgiving for bad timing, but is about 20%
              short of the PRO level on distance.  The beginners level, which
              also has no wind effect, was designed for children.  Serious
              golfers should use the AMateur or PRO levels.

	Please refer to the PLAYERS Section for instructions on how to make
        permanent preference changes.

ON THE TEE

	The course is in great shape, fairways lush and green.  You select
        your driver (ignoring your buddy's wise crack)...take a practice
        swing...and drive one right down the middle!

THE SWING PANEL

	The panel at the lower part of the screen is called the Swing Panel
        and its various features are defined on the following pages.

	SWING

		Clicking on this button will swing the club.  The swing must
                be performed in the following manner to produce a good stroke.

		Step 1. Move the cursor over the word SWING.
		Step 2. PRESS AND HOLD the left mouse button.  THIS STARTS THE
                        SWING.
		Step 3. RELEASE the button when the indicator reaches the top.
                        THIS SETS THE POWER LEVEL FOR THE STROKE.  (A yellow
                        line will mark the point of release.)
		Step 4. Press the left button again when the indicator reaches
                        the bottom green mark.  THIS IS CALLED THE SNAP.  If
                        the snap occurs exactly at the green mark, you have
                        hit a perfectly timed shot.  (A yellow line will mark
                        the point of your snap.)

		The swing sequence is PRESS & HOLD - RELEASE - PRESS

	ADDRESS

		The Address feature lets you back away from the ball to take
                practice swings.
	
		Click on the left arrow to move away from the ball.  Click on
                the right arrow to address the ball.

		NOTE: If you are just beginning to play for the first time,
                      back away and take a few practice swings.

	MISSING THE MARK

		If you miss the mark on the Snap, an error is introduced.  The
                further you miss, the greater the error and the worse the
                shot.  On Beginner and Amateur levels, the errors are less
                severe than on Professional.

	OVERSWING

		During the backswing, power level continues to increase until
                it reaches its maximum just before the indicator starts back
                down.  If you release the button at this point, you will
                achieve maximum power and therefore maximum distance.  There
                is a catch, however.  The Red Zone at the top of the indicator
                is called the Overswing area.  If you release in this area,
                be prepared to pay a heavier price if you miss the green mark
                at the bottom.  The higher you reach for that extra power, the
                more severe the error if you miss the mark.

	CLUB Selection

		You are allowed 13 clubs plus the putter in your bag.  The
                small window above the word CLUB indicates your current club
                selection.  Click on the left or right arrows to change clubs.

		NOTE: Changing clubs has no effect when you are putting.

	CLUB DISTANCES

	DRIVER 1       (D1)	275 yds		(Low Loft - 9.5 degree loft)
	DRIVER 2       (D2)	275 yds		(High Loft - 12 degree loft)
	2 WOOD         (2W)	260 yds
	3 WOOD         (3W)	250 yds
	4 WOOD         (4W)	235 yds
	5 WOOD         (5W)	215 yds
	6 WOOD         (6W)	200 yds
	7 WOOD         (7W)	190 yds

	8 IRON         (8I)	148 yds
	9 IRON         (9I)	135 yds
	Pitching Wedge (PW)	120 yds
	Sand Wedge     (SW)	 90 yds
	Loft Wedge     (LW)	 70 yds

	Distances are based on the following:

		Ball hit from a tee, landing and rolling on fairway, no wind,
                normal power (Top green mark), perfect Snap, Pro Level.

POST-SHOT PANEL OPTIONS

	After you have made a shot, the Post Shot Panel will appear.  The
        panel displays information about the shot just made, where the ball
        came to rest, and who's next to hit.  From this point you can choose
        one of the following options:

	1. CONTINUE - Continue on to your next shot or to the next player.

	2. MULLIGAN - Play another shot from the same location. (Mulligans are
                      recorded and displayed on the scorecard.)

	3. GIMME - If a player is within the GIMME distance to the hole, you
                   are given the option of taking a stroke and accepting your
                   next putt as automatically made.

	4. INSTANT REPLAYS

		FORWARD - View an instant replay of your last shot from above
                          and to the right of the normal position.

		REVERSE - View an instant replay of your last shot from the
                          reverse angle (looking back towards your hitting
                          position).

	BALL IN HAZARD

	If you hit your ball into a hazard, you will be penalized one stroke
        and will be given two options - REHIT or DROP.

		REHIT - Places your ball at the point of your last shot.

		DROP -  Places your ball at the point where it crossed into
                        the hazard.  LINKS will then allow you to move the
                        ball anywhere you choose.  However, the USGA Rules
                        state that you can back up from this point as far as
                        you wish, but it must be a straight line with the pin.

		NOTE: All brown areas and all water on the course are hazards.

	BALL OUT OF BOUNDS

	If your ball lands O.B. (over fences, off the course, etc...), you
        will be penalized one stroke and will have to REHIT from the original
        position.

	AIMING YOUR SHOT

	LINKS, automatically aligns you to 2 degress left of the pin.  Even if
        you have a blind shot (where you can't see the pin) you can be certain
        that the green is straight in front of you.  The DIRECTION you are
        aiming is indicated by a red and white pole called as the MARKER.

	You may control the Marker as follows:

		TO TURN THE MARKER ON, move the cursor into the viewing window
                and press and hold the right button.

		TO RE_POSITION THE MARKER, move the cursor arrow to a new
                location and press the left button.

	TYPES OF SWINGS (D, S, F, 1, 2 & CHIP)

	You can have up to 6 different types of swings for each club in your
        bag except the putter.  Although the swing types have been pre-
        defined, you can change any of them at any time during play or
        practice.  You should only make changes if you know what you are
        doing. (Refer to SETUP for more information.)

	Below is a description of the various types of swings.  The swing type
        is selected by clicking on the appropriate box on the Swing Panel.

		[D]    Draw      - A slight hook (Ball moves to the left)
		[S]    Straight  - A straight shot
		[F]    Fade      - A slight slice (Ball moves to the right)
		[1]    Custom shot to be setup by the player.  Currently set
                       to Straight.
		[2]    Same as 1
		[CHIP] Chip Shot - Straight

	CHIPPING

	When you are close enough to CHIP, LINKS will give you that option
	automatically.  Chipping gives you a shorter, more controlled shot.
	The SWING INDICATOR for the CHIP is different than for FULL SWING. 
        First time players should practice chipping on the Driving Range or
        Practice Green or use the Mulligan option to practice on the course.

	PUTTING

	Once you are on the green, LINKS will select your putter auto-
	matically.  The putter swing is different than other swings.  It is
	not necessary to press the button the second time (at the snap point).
	First time players should go to the Practice Green or use the Mulligan
	option to practice putting.  Use the GRID option to lay a non-
	obtrusive grid on the green to help you determine an accurate read.

ADDITIONAL SWING PANEL OPTIONS

	GRID

	When you click on the GRID box, a light green grid will be placed over
	the ground to assist on reading the terrain.  The GRID can be used
	anywhere on the course.

	ROTATE

	If you find yourself directly behind a tree or other obstruction, you
	can turn left or right using the ROTATE function.  Click on the left
	or right arrows in the ROTATE Box.  The window displays the degrees
	of rotation relative to the pin direction.  When you reach the desired
	angle, click on the REDRAW Box.

	TOP VIEW

	Activating this option will show you a top-view of the current hole
	and the flashing ball indicates the positions of the current player.

	DROP

	Clicking on this box will allow you to pick up your ball and move it
	to a new location.  This is called a drop and you will be penalized
	one stroke unless your ball is on the cart path.  LINKS will allow
	you to move the ball anywhere you choose, but the USGA Rules of Golf
	state that you must "drop" it within two club lengths of the original
	spot (but no closer to the hole) or you can back up (straight away
	from the pin) as far as you want.  In the case of the cart path, you
	must drop within one club length of the edge of the cart path, no
	closer to the hole.

	Note: If you hit your ball into a hazard, you will automatically 
	      receive a stroke penalty and be given the option to rehit or to
	      take a drop.

	LIE

	Clicking on this box will show the current lie of the ball.

	SETUP

	Clicking on this box brings up the Swing Setup Panel.  Here you are
	able to adjust swing plane, stance, ball position, and club face.
	Every club (except the putter) has six swing types (setups) assigned
	to it (D, S, F, 1, 2 & CHIP).  An explanation of the physics of 
	hitting the ball and ball flight dynamics is outside the scope of this
	game and this manual.  We have included these parameters to allow the
	advanced golfer to make changes that may more closely approximate his
	own "real" game.

	IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, DO NOT CHANGE THESE SETTINGS!

	If you want to experiment, set up a separate player and go to the 
	driving range.  There you will be able to make changes and see their 
	effects.  When you're finished, you can delete the experimental player
	from the Player File.  Changing every setup is a significant effort
	since there are 20 clubs with 6 swing types for each, or 120 settings.
	(Refer to the heading Types of Swings for more information on the
	standard default settings.)

	Note: Stance has no real effect on the ball in LINKS.  Open or closed
	      stance was included to help give the player the look and feel
	      of his/her actual setup.

	WIND INDICATOR

	The Wind Indicator is the green arrow at the far left edge of the
        Swing Panel.  When the arrow is pointing down, the wind is blowing
	towards you.  Just to the right is the Wind Strength Indicator.  A
	full yellow bar represents a wind velocity of approximately 30 mph.
	Wind fluctuations affect the ball while it is flight.

OPTIONS Panel

	Clicking on the OPTIONS box brings up the Game Options Panel.  The
	following options are available:

	QUIT GAME

	Click here to end the game and return to the Main Selection Screen.

	SAVE GAME

	Click here to SAVE a game in progress.

	SOUNDS

	Click on the sound boxes to switch various sounds on or off.  If you
	have a slow machine, turning the sounds off may help the game play
	better.

	DRAWING DETAIL

	Clicking on these boxes will change the level of detail for drawing
	the terrain.  MAXIMUM detail requires the longest drawing time, but
	looks the best.  We suggest you experiment with the various combin-
	ations to find which ones work best for your speed of machine.  We
	suggest MAX, MED, MIN for Close, Mid, Far respectively.

	If your machine is quite slow, you may try MAX, MIN, MIN or MED, MIN,
	MIN.  If you have a fast machine, you may want to try MAX, MAX, MED or
	even MAX, MAX, MAX.

	EXIT

	Click here to return to the Swing Panel.

	Note: Beginner Level players are unaffected by wind.

OTHER GAME FEATURES

	HITTING FROM ROUGH OR SAND

	Shots hit from the rough or sand will require approximately one extra
	club to achieve the same distance as those hit from the fairway.  
	Shots from the rough will also have reduced backspin.  Shots from the
	sand have somewhat greater backspin.

	NEXT PLAYER

	LINKS shows which player is up next before the scene is drawn so the
	player can get ready.  LINKS uses the Honor System and Who's Farthest
	Out for tee-off and shot order.

	SCORECARD AND SCORECARD PRINTOUT

	At the completion of a hole, all players having finished, LINKS will
	display the Scorecard for your review.  After you've finished playing
	a round, you'll be given an opportunity to print out your Scorecard.
	Make sure your printer is plugged in and is on line.

	SAVING A GAME IN PROGRESS

	You can save a game in progress and resume playing at a later time.
	Simply click on the OPTIONS box in the Swing Panel and then select
	SAVE GAME.  To resume a game, choose RESUME from the Main Selection
	Screen.

	Note: If you wish to continue to play on another machine, you will
	      have to copy the GAME FILE (.GAM) as well as the appropriate
	      PLAYER FILES (.PLR) and COURE FILE (.CRS) to the other machine.

	QUITTING A GAME

	You can terminate play at any time by clicking on OPTIONS at the Swing
	Panel and then selecting QUIT GAME.

PRACTICE SECTION

	LINKS contains a practice area where you can work on your driving,
	chipping and putting.  Simply follow these steps:

		1. Select PRACTICE from the Main Selection Screen.

		2. Select the PLAYER that is practicing. (The program needs
		   to know which PLAYER FILE to update in case changes are
		   made to swing setups.)

		3. Select DRIVING RANGE or PUTTING AND CHIPPING GREEN.

	DRIVING RANGE

	While at the Range, you have access to all normal swing parameters
	(i.e. CLUB, ADDRESS, SETUP, SWING types).  In addition there are
	options to do the following:

		GO TO CHIP AND PUTT

			Move to the PUTTING AND CHIPPING GREEN.

		SELECT PLAYER

			Change the Player that is practicing.

		CANCEL

			Return to the Main Selection Screen.

	PUTTING AND CHIPPING GREEN

	At the practice green, you also have access to all normal swing
	parameters.  In addition you have the ability to change the pin
	(hole) position and your practice position.  The following options
	are available:

		CHANGE POSITION

			This changes the position of the pin or the golfer.

			Clicking on this box will bring up a TOP VIEW of the
			practice area with both positions shown as flashing
			dots.  You can choose CHANGE PIN POSITION or CHANGE
			PRACTICE POSITION.  In either case, a small icon will
			appear.  Simply move the mouse until the icon is in
			the desired position and press the left button.  When
			you're happy with the new position(s), click on [OK].
			Click [CANCEL] if you decide not to make any changes.

		MOVE TO LAST BALL

			This moves you up to the last ball hit and makes that
			your practice position.  Otherwise, you will continue
			to hit from the same position until you select Change
			Position as described above.

		GO TO DRIVING RANGE

			This moves you to the Practice Range.

		SELECT PLAYER

			This changes the Player that is practicing.

		CANCEL

			This returns you to the Main Selection Screen.

RESUME SECTION

	saved.  (See Saving a Game in Progress.)  Clicking on RESUME brings
	up a list of GAMES ON FILE.  Simply select the game you want and click
	on [OK].

	Note: If you wish to continue play on another machine, you will have
	      to copy the GAME FILE (.GAM) as well as the appropriate PLAYER
	      FILES (.PLR) and COURSE FILE (.CRS) to the other machine.

PLAYERS SECTION

	This option lets you build and modify your list of potential Players.
	When a name is added to the list, a file is created for that Player
	that contains his or her preferences for Level, Tees, and Clubs.

		change your selection of clubs, first de-select the ones you
		don't want, then click on the desired clubs.

	DELETE PLAYER

		To delete an existing Player from the list, highlight the 
		player's name (click on it), then click on DELETE PLAYER.

	USE DEFAULT SETTINGS

		Click on this box to restore all preferences to the default
		values.

		Note: This will not return club setups to the default values.
		      If you want to do this, simply delete your current
		      player and create a new player of the same name.  
		      Standard club setups are installed when a new player is
		      added.

	EXIT (ESC)

		Click here when you're done adding or modifying Players.  All
		changes will be saved to disk when you EXIT.

SYSTEM SETUP SECTION

	This option allows you to set up your system to use various default
