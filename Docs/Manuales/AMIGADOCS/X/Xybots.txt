				Xybots

The Game

Xybots is a game for one or two players who take on the characters of the 
heroes Major Rock Hardy and Captain Ace Gunn. Your mission: to penetrate a
vast underground complex and overcome the Master Xybot.

The huge subterranean city is composed of convoluted mazes with locked
doors barring entry to different sectors and transporters to connect
different areas.

Hordes of evil robotic monsters patrol the many corridors and you must
battle with these Xybots to reach the exit elevator and so advance to the
next level. In the mazes you will find energy pods, keys to open doors and
coins to buy essential supplies like Enemy Mappers and more sophisticated
weaponry. At the end of each level enter the store where supplies can be
purchased - some of which are permanent while others are only temporary and
must be replenished.

From the start you are equipped with a laser gun to blast the Xybots
through extra cannons can be picked up on your travels. Your other weapon
is a Zapper which stuns all enemies for a short time. You can buy extra Zap
Power which allows you to inflict more serious damage.

Every few levels you must face the Master Xybot in a one-to-one duel. Only
by defeating him can you advance to the next level. the penalty for losing
is to be sent back a few levels.
