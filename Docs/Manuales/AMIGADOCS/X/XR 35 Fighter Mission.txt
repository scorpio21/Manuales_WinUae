Loading

Please ensure that XR 35 disc is WRITE PROTECTED before you insert it in the drive. Insert the XR 35 disc when
the computer asks for the WORKBENCH. Amiga 1000 owners require KICKSTART 1.2 to load the program.


Instructions

Press the Fire Button to exit the Title screen and get ready to enter the first sector.

Your craft must not touch the edges of the foreground landscape. Destroy everything that impedes your
progress. Some aliens and their ships require multiple shots. Beware! Some aliens mount rear attack as well.

Occasionally, you will see the letter S on the screen. This is a smart bomb and shooting it destroys all aliens
present on the screen.

You start with 3 lives and there is a bonus of 1 life for every 1000 points. Completion of a sector also gives 
you an extra life.


Controls

Joystick only.
