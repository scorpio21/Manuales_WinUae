                                INTRODUCTION
                                ------------
 
Xenophobe is an action-orientated game embodying all that is best in
MicroStyle games. Easy to play, but difficult to master with a unique split
screen and a two player option.

XENOPHOBE

...ONE WHO HAS A DEATHLY FEAR OF ANYTHING ALIEN.

                                 BACKGROUND
                                 ----------

Schickn thought ruefully about the Earth he was leaving - an earth once
mighty in his childhood years now insular, polluted, demoralised nad
dispirited. The proud forays into space during the '30's and 40's marked a
peroid of expansion, an era in which the hope and aspirations of a thousand
generations of humanity has been realised. Then in '56 came the first of a
series of disasters - The New Phoenix Mars colonists were affected by a
mystery plague - some say it was a Martian bug. Most blamed the Central
Bloc and the Brazilians and Indians in particular. Earths sensitive
political equilibrium was deteriorating with the emergence of new so-called
super states - India, Brazil and Pakistan being the major powers. India is
now ruling the whole sub continent with an iron fist and proving a major
threat to both the new free states of Russia and China. Whether it was
biological espionage by the central bloc we'll never know, but nearly a
quater of a million souls lost their lives and Earth when its confident,
possibly arrogant rush for the stars stumbled.
   In '58, 80 personnel of the small Io scientific mission were killed by a
violent volcanic eruption from the surface of Jupiter.
   Indeed, '58 was a turning point in humanity - in retrospect, the skimish
was inevitable but, when war broke out between India and China, a limited
nuclear exchange turned the great cities of New Delhi and Beijing into a
vivid vision of hell. It only lasted a week and only twenty warheads were
used but the Earth was turned irevocably towards a period of introspection.
Why spend money on pointless crusades into the unknown when the cost is the
spiritual destruction of the Earth itself? Throughout the free world the
'planetists' were in the ascendancy, with the protection of the Earth
their major priority.
   So the huge orbital platforms surrounding Earth became largely derelict,
many with only maintenance personnel and small colonies, only the moon
exists as a living shuttle in service. And now this... In '62,
transmissions of an unidentified nature were picked up at the edge of the
solar system in the region of Neptune. Unmanned scanners and transmitters
in the area quickly ceased their broadcasts, blinking out of existence at
the same instant. Routine transmissions from the Europa marine colony
ceased one week afterwards.
   The effect Earthside was devastating Xenophobia gripped the world. In
some strange way, it unifies the disparate bands of humanity in a common
emotion - fear!

- WAS IT THE ALIENS WHO DESTROYED THE EUROPA SETTLEMENT?
- DID THE MYSTERY MARTIAN VIRUS HAVE AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN?

Earth's political strategists now belive the aliens to be studying the
planet from our own orbiting platforms!
   Contact with the scientific teams on board has been lost. One microwave
visual gave a frightening insight to the new inhabitants.
   Schickn reminiscences were shattered by a sharp expletive ny Borolshi or
kwak to his friends, a native of the now extinct European colony "Look at
the..... thing". The space platform was scarred, revealing damage done by
the equivalent of high energy laser cannons. Almost surgically, the space
station Zero One Five has an oval hole measuring around 100 metres in its
upper ring. So, they're here!
   No-one on Earth was prepared to even investigate, all being paralysed by
fear. Our 'expeditionary force' was a mixed bag of scientific idealists.
Embittered European mutants and old spacers like myself were the only ones
to take up the challenge from 5 billion people. Looking at the so called
'Combat Crew', Schickn could not resist a smile. Here he was, the leader of
the oddest band of mercenaries it was possible to imagine. To them this was
no adventure, no military campaign. This was a goddamned crusade. A crusade
not just against the unknown. To some, like Kwak, it was a simple question
of revenge. For most it was a fight to give the people of Earth a purpose -
to save the world from 
XENOPHOBIA !

                              MISSION OBJECTIVE
                              -----------------
 
"The alien life forms are despoilers of intelligent life"

EXTERMINATE THE ALIENS!

1. To exterminate aall hostile alien life forms (called "Xenos") that are
thought to be infesting the derelict space stations and moon bases.

2. To collect the various forms of hardware thought to be left on board the
platforms and bases - which could help the human fight and be useful to the
aliens.

The appearance of the alien force is repulsive. You must avoid xenophobia!

                                  BRIEFING
                                  --------

The power of the alien force is unknown - initially, onlt two of your teams
from the three squads will be sent in. It is for you to assess relative
strengths and send in the two most appropriate personalities.
   The two combatants will report to the shuttle transfer room where the
molecules of each combatant will be dematerialised and rematerialised in
the base.
   Travelling from room to room and level to level (by using the elevator),
you must accomplish the first objective to exterminate the required number
of xenos in each level of the base within a time limit or else the pests
will over-run the base. The length of time varies with the number of
levels. The battle between the Exterminator(s) and the xenos may result in
three different outcomes:

1. Time runs out, the xenos overrun the base, and the base self-destructs
after the Exterminator(s) returns to the mothership via the "transfer
disc".

2. The player (Exterminator) orders a "fast destruct" of the base to
prevent it from being overrun by Xenos. The base is destroyed after the
Exterminator returns to the mothership via the "transfer disc".

3. The player (Exterminator) clears the base of Xenos. The Exterminator(s)
return to the mothership via the "transfer disc".

                            HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
                            --------------------

Research into the nature of the Xenos has provided this breakdown of what
you can expect.

                                   WEAPONS
                                   -------

To help defend against the Xeno attacks you will find a variety of weapons
to use. These are:

SMOKE GUN:        Most powerful hand gun ever, nothing can stop it. But 
		  suffers from a very short range and don't drop it!

PHASER:           Standard issue single shot weapon. Only really effective
	          against small targets but virtually indestructable.

LASER PISTOL:	  Long range attack weapon that will burn through most
		  armour but does lack a big punch. Can be destroyed but is
		  fairly tough.

LIGHTNING RIFLE:  Medium range electrical weapon which is very effective
		  against Xenos. Has a tendancy to short out and explode if
		  dropped.

BOMBS:		  Hand thrown grenades cause high intensity explosion but
		  tend to rebound off walls so use with care.

		  NOTES:
	   	  1. Should you lose your weapon a droid will appear and
		  throw a new weapon for use.
		  2. You can still fight even without a weapon. Remember,
		  you can punch the invaders.....but they're tough dudes.
