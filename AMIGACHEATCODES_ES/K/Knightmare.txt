 CHEAT MODE:

 This cheat involves the woodland section on the first level.
 Use the spade to help you find the five apples. Take these apples
 and throw them at the quest sheild that hangs on the wall, and make
 each character consume two rabbit pies from the inventory screen.
 Continue with your quest and you should find that your hit points
 never decrease.
