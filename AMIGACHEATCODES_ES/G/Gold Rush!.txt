                             (Sierra On-Line)




This  is  a step-by-step guide that will cover the game essentials and show
you  where  to  get  the  points.  Words  enclosed in "Quotation marks" are
commands to be typed in during play.

                               THE SOLUTION

If  you  watched  the  beginning  cartoon you saw Jerrod walk onto the foot
bridge,  and  that  is  where  we  will  start. Walk down the bridge to the
street,  head  SOUTH off the bottom of the screen. The first action will be
to  put your house on the market, so type "SELL HOUSE". Walk to the gate of
your  house.  Type  "USE  THE  KEY" and the gate will open. Go to the front
door, "USE THE KEY" and walk in.

Walk to the roll-top desk in the living room and "CLOSE THE DESK". "GET THE
BANK  STATEMENT"  that is stuck in the slats. "READ THE STATEMENT" and take
note  of your account number. Go over to the table and "LOOK AT THE ALBUM".
When you are finished looking at it, "TAKE THE FAMILY PHOTO".

Go outside and wait for the man with cash in hand. Walk up to the buyer and
he will offer 850 dollars for your house - "SAY YES".

Walk WEST on Front Street to the Park. Go into the Gazebo, near the centre,
and  "GET  THE  GOLD  COIN" that fell through the cracks in the floor. Now,
"PICK SOME FLOWERS".

Walk WEST off the Gazebo, to change screens. In the distance you will see a
ship  docked. Walk NORTH on Dock Street until you are on the Dock, and then
go  into the Warehouse. "LOOK AT THE POSTER" on the first post. Walk out of
the Warehouse.

Walk  SOUTH,  change  screens,  go inside the Bank. Walk up to the Teller's
window. When the Teller helps you, "WITHDRAW SAVINGS". He will ask for your
account  number. Type in the number you read on your bank statement. If you
don't  remember  your number, "LOOK AT THE BANK STATEMENT". The Teller will
give you 200 dollars.

Walk  out  the door at the top of the screen and turn LEFT. Walk WEST until
you see Fast's Grocery and Rand's Hardware.

(You must now decide which route you are going to attempt).

IF YOU WISH TO TAKE THE PANAMA TREK:-
Go  into  Rand's  Hardware and walk to the back counter. When the man helps
you,  "BUY  THE MOSQUITO NET". Leave the store and walk SOUTH into the next
screen.

IF YOU WISH TO TAKE THE CAPE HORN TREK:-
Go into Fast's Grocery and walk up to the counter. When the young man helps
you,  "BUY  SOME  FRUIT".  Leave  the  store  and  walk SOUTH into the next
screen.

IF YOU WISH TO TAKE THE OVERLAND TREK:-
DO NOT go into the stores, but walk SOUTH into the next screen. Go into the
Stage  Travel Office and walk up to the top counter. When the Old Man helps
you,  "BUY  A TICKET". Leave the Office. Go EAST on Fulton Street until the
screen  changes.  Walk  past  the  Livery into the next screen. Go past the
two-storey  office  building  and  walk  SOUTH  into  the next screen. Walk
through  the gate of the Cemetery, head EAST and change screens. Go to your
parent's  tombstones  (the  pair  near  the  upper right corner). Read both
stones  and  "PUT  THE  FLOWERS  ON  THE  GRAVE". Retrace your steps to the
two-storey office building you passed on the way to the Cemetery (the first
building  you  see  going  back  into  town). Go inside the building and go
through  the  door  on the back wall. Walk up the stairs to the right. Step
into  your office (upstairs front right) and "READ THE NEWS CLIPPINGS" that
are  under  the  blotter on your desk. Go to your boss's office (downstairs
front  left) and "QUIT" your job. Leave the building and walk NORTH towards
the Post Office.

IF YOU WISH TO TAKE THE CAPE HORN OR PANAMA TREK:-
Turn  RIGHT at the Post Office and walk EAST on Front Street all the way to
the  last  house  (12  Front  Street). Stand at the gate to the house until
Leonard  comes out. When he talks to you, "BUY TICKET FOR SHIP". Answer his
questions  about  which  ticket you desire and then "PAY" for it. Return to
the Post Office by walking WEST.

IF THE PRICE OF THE SHIP TICKET IS TOO HIGH:-
Getting  on  the  ship  takes an expert game player! If you run out of time
before  the  gold  rush  (that's  when  the prices go up!) you must buy the
ticket  sooner.  Follow the order of this solution, but make a special trip
to  buy your ticket after withdrawing your savings at the Bank. Go into the
Post  Office.  Walk  over  to  the  counter  and  "RING THE BELL". When the
Postmaster  helps  you,  "CHECK MAIL". He will get a letter out of your box
and  put  in  on the counter. "GET THE LETTER" and "OPEN THE LETTER". "READ
THE  LETTER"  and  "LOOK AT THE POSTMARK". "LIFT THE STAMP". Leave the Post
office.

IF YOU HAVE A TICKET FOR THE STAGE COACH:-
Walk  SOUTH  to  Fulton Street, then WEST. Return to the Livery (the yellow
building  with  horses!). Go inside (don't get too close to the horse!) and
talk  to  the  man.  He will ask you to wait outside. Wait just outside the
door.   When   he   comes   out  "SHOW  THE  TICKET"  to  him.  "ENTER  THE
STAGE".......have a nice trip!!

IF YOU HAVE A TICKET FOR THE SHIP:-
Walk NORTH on Dock Street all the way to the Ship. Board the Ship and "SHOW
THE TICKET" to a crewman.......have a pleasant voyage!!

[SAVE  YOUR  GAME  OFTEN  SO  YOU  MAY  RESTORE  IN  CASE AN UNEXPECTED AND
UNPREVENTABLE PERIL CAUSES YOUR DEATH!]

                             THE OVERLAND TREK

The  program  control now takes you to the camp of the Long Island Mining &
Stock  Company  in  Independance.  Notice that you have now grown a beard!!
(good, these Sierra programmers, aren't they?!!).

Walk  EAST  into the next scene. "TALK TO THE MAN" reading a book under the
tree.  Return  to  the  previous  scene.  Walk up to the three men having a
conversation and "TALK TO THE CAPTAIN" then "GIVE MONEY TO THE CAPTAIN". He
will ask you to obtain a team of animals.

Walk  SOUTH  into the next scene. Go to the man in the shed and "GET MATURE
OXEN". Return to the camp, find the Captain and "REPORT" back to him.

North  of  the  camp is a view of the Plains. Walk up between the tents and
wagons until you change scenes. "LOOK AT THE PLAINS" often to determine the
best  time  to  head  WEST. When the message changes to '....the plains are
growing  greener  every  day',  it is time to leave. Return to the camp and
tell the Captain to "HEAD WEST".

The  program  control will now take you to the Green River. Don't forget to
SAVE  your game periodically so you may RESTORE in case an unexpected event
kills you!

When  you  find  yourself  standing beside your wagon at the top of a steep
descent  to  the Green River, "UNHITCH THE TEAMS" right away. The oxen will
drink  from the river then return to your wagon. When the teams are hitched
again "LOCK THE WHEELS".

The program control takes over as you continue West.

The next time you get control of Jerrod, he is dying in the Desert. Go over
to  the  side  of  the  wrecked  wagon and "DRINK THE WATER" that is in the
barrel.  Now,  "EAT  THE  MEAT"  that  is  in  the wagon. Walk WEST off the
screen.

The program control now takes you to Sutter's Fort in California!!

                            THE CAPE HORN TREK

The  program  control takes you out of town. You find yourself on the Ship.
You may explore the ship all you like, but this solution will give you only
the essentials!

Walk  to  the  front part of the Ship (EAST). "TALK TO THE MAN" reading the
book. Press the keys indicated to go to the next scene.

Watch  the  map as the position of the Ship moves. The screen appears again
with  you  standing on the ship talking with the passengers. You don't need
to do anything now, press the keys indicated to go to the next scene.

The  program  control  takes  you  to  Rio De Janeiro, then back out to sea
towards  Cape Horn. There will be a storm rounding the Horn. (If it doesn't
happen when you first get there, press the keys indicated to go to the next
scene).

During  the storm you are in the Bunk Room. "GET THE STRING" that is on the
floor.  Walk WEST to the Engine Room and "GET THE METAL SCRAPS" that are on
the  floor.  Continue  WEST to the Captain's Cabin and "GET THE PAPER CLIP"
off the floor.

Press  the keys indicated to go to the next scene. If you are near the Cape
and it is clear weather, go to the next scene.

The  program  control takes over as your journey continues. When you get to
Mexico, the supplies are gone. You will soon die of starvation if you don't
eat  something!  You find yourself on the Ship again. Walk WEST through the
door,  change  screens. Go DOWN the stairs (use the diagonal keys), then go
DOWN  the  small  set  of  stairs to change screens. Go to the table in the
Galley and "GET SOME PIG MEAT".

Now  walk  WEST  to  the ladder and climb DOWN to the Boiler Room. "GET THE
STICK"  that  is  leaning against the wall. Climb back UP the ladder and go
back  UP  the stairs to the Top Deck. Go to the back of the Ship. This is a
perfect  place  to  "FISH". After catching the fish, you share it with your
companions and save the day!

The program control will now take you on to California.

                              THE PANAMA TREK

The  program  control  will take you to the Isthmus of Panama. You start up
the  Chagres River in a small boat. When you encounter the natives you must
agree to give them your possessions.

After  leaving  the boat you start overland on foot. Follow your guide with
the  others.  Change screens until you see a man sitting under a tree. Walk
over  and  "TALK" to the man who is reading a book. Get back onto the trail
and go in the direction the rest of your team want.

Don't  forget  to  SAVE  your game often lest something beyond your control
kills you!

Wild  jungle ants will surround you. "JUMP" onto the vine that is near you.
Wait until the trail is clear and then "DROP" to the ground. Walk EAST into
the next scene.

There are four hidden trails through the dense jungle scene. Take the trail
closest  to the top of the screen (the one closest to the bottom has poison
plants).  When 'Ouch!' is flashed on the screen, "LOOK DOWN", "GET THE GOLD
DISK" that you stubbed your toe on. Walk EAST into the next screen.

The  swampy river has quicksand! SAVE your game. Walk straight out into the
water  about  ONE-THIRD  of the way across and stop. Walk UP RIGHT a little
way  until  you  are  even with the top trail on the RIGHT, then stop. Walk
RIGHT  until  you are on the other side. If you sink in the quicksand or an
alligator  eats  you,  RESTORE  the game and keep trying until you make it!
Walk EAST into the next screen.

The program control will take you to California before you know it!

                          SACRAMENTO - CALIFORNIA

You arrive by ship. Your position is marked by a tiny figure on the screen.
Walk  over  to  the  White  Building on the NORTHEAST corner and go inside.
"LOOK AROUND" then "GET IN THE STAGE COACH" leaving for Sutter's Fort.

The program control will now take you to Sutter's Fort!

                               SUTTER'S FORT

You  have  been  dropped  off  near  the  Front Gate of Sutter's Fort. Your
position is marked by a tiny figure on the screen. Move UP through the gate
and into the Fort.

Once  inside,  walk  LEFT  off  the screen, then walk DOWN until you change
screens.  Walk  through the door that has a sign on it. Walk EAST to change
screens. When you are inside the Trading Store, "BUY A GOLD PAN", "GIVE THE
GOLD COIN" to the man.

Leave  the  Store  and  walk  EAST, changing screens. Continue walking EAST
until you change screens again. Go through the gate to the Cemetery.

"READ THE TOMBSTONE" (near the centre) that says: 'William Marshall'. "READ
PSALM  23"  from  the Bible. Remember the letter that Jake sent you? It had
some  interesting  holes  that had been cut intentionally. "USE THE LETTER"
here.

Move  the  letter UP and LEFT (use the direction keys or joystick). Stop it
in  the  EXACT POSITION that covers the words: 'WILSON MARSHALL' through to
'A  PLACE  IN  OUR  HEARTS  IS'. You will know it is right when you see the
message: 'Hold it right there!", followed by other messages.

Press  the  keys  necessary  to  return to the Cemetery. Walk to the RIGHT,
changing  screens. You can now see a map of the Fort area. Your position is
marked  by a flashing dot. Move EAST to the edge of the screen. Now you are
in the country by the American River, one mile East of the Fort. Follow the
river  until  you  are  15  MILES  EAST  of  the  Fort. Now you are in GOLD
country!!

Go into the river and "PAN" for gold. Panning in another man's claim can be
very  dangerous!  SAVE  your  game  often while discovering gold! There are
thieves  in  these  parts!!  Get  gold at least FOUR TIMES (a maximum of 50
pieces is possible by panning in different scenes).

Return  to Sutter's Fort. Go to the Trading Store where you bought the gold
pan  earlier.  Buy a Shovel and a Lantern with your Californian gold. Leave
the  Store  and  walk  off  the  BOTTOM of the screen. Walk RIGHT to change
screens.  Continue  RIGHT,  changing screens, past the Front Gate until you
see the Blacksmith's Shop.

Walk  into  the Blacksmith's Shop and "TALK" to the man. "YES" you are from
Brooklyn,  New York. Your name is Jerrod Wilson. Your brother's name is (as
far as you know!), Jake. The Blacksmith will give you a branding iron.

Leave the Blacksmith's shop and walk DOWN to the BOTTOM of the screen. Walk
RIGHT,  changing  screens.  Now  you  are near the Gristmill. Go to the man
leaning  against  the  fence and "BUY A MULE". "GIVE GOLD" to the man. When
the  man  brings  it out to you "GET THE MULE". Walk LEFT (changing screens
twice) and return to the Blacksmith's Shop.

The  mule  will  follow you, but you MAY lose it if you aren't careful. The
mule may not fit everywhere YOU do!!

Enter  the  Blacksmith's  Shop.  Go close to the fire and quickly "HEAT THE
IRON". Catch the mule before you lose it and "BRAND THE MULE".

Go  LEFT,  back to the Front Gate. Outside, you can see the entrance to the
cattle area. Walk through the front gate. When the screen changes you see a
full  view  of  the  Fort.  Your position is marked by a tiny figure on the
screen. Move to the door of the cattle area.

When you enter the Corral, a man will take a description of your mule. Walk
through  the  gate  at the BOTTOM of the screen. "LEAVE THE MULE" in one of
these  corrals. "LOOK AT THE BRAND" on each mule in these corrals. "GET THE
MULE" that is trusty, high spirited and bears a special brand (looks like a
horseshoe and a key). Leave the cattle area and walk EAST.

Walk  EAST  along  the American River. When you are SEVENTEEN MILES EAST OF
THE  FORT  you will see a tailrace. Continue EAST, following the road, past
the  sawmill  and  past  the  log  yard,  until  you  enter  Coloma. At the
intersection,  walk  SOUTH and then follow the road when it turns EAST. You
are now in front of the Green Pastures Hotel.

                         THE GREEN PASTURES HOTEL

"TIE  THE MULE" on the hitching post in front of the door and go inside. Go
up  to the desk and "RENT ROOM 11". The room is already rented, but the man
will  give  you  a message to deliver to the occupant. "SAY YES" to get the
message and walk UP the stairs.

Find  Room  11  and  "KNOCK" on the door. "GIVE THE MESSAGE" to the man who
answers and he will go away, leaving the door wide open. Go into Room 11.

Walk  to  the fireplace and "TURN THE WHEEL" on the cannon. "GO THROUGH THE
FIREPLACE"  into  the  concealed  Room 12. Walk over to the table, "GET THE
NOTE", "READ THE NOTE" and "GET THE MAGNET". Walk to the BOTTOM of the room
and  "GET  THE  STRING"  off  the  floor.  Walk to the window. "UNLATCH THE
WINDOW"  then "OPEN THE WINDOW". Stay by the window until a bird flies into
the cage. "CLOSE THE WINDOW".

Walk  over  to  the  cage and "LOOK AT THE BIRD". "LOOK AT THE CAPSULE" and
"PUT THE PHOTO IN THE CAPSULE" that is on the bird's leg. "OPEN THE WINDOW"
to  let  the  bird  fly away. Wait for the bird to come back (it may take a
little while!) and then "CLOSE THE WINDOW".

"LOOK AT THE CAPSULE" again and "GET THE AEROGRAM". "READ THE AEROGRAM" for
a very important clue. "OPEN THE WINDOW" again. "GO THROUGH THE WINDOW" out
onto the narrow ledge.

You  may  want to SAVE your game here. Move quickly towards the balcony (to
the  LEFT), avoiding the man in Room 13. Walk the length of the balcony and
go  in through the door. In the Hallway, go through the door to the stairs.
Walk downstairs and out the front door.

"GET THE MULE" from the hitching post, and head SOUTH, being careful not to
lose the mule. Make your way SOUTH until you are well out in the country (4
MILES SOUTH OF SUTTER'S FORT).

Consider  the  aerogram clue........'As stubborn as our friend may be, just
leave  it  to  him  and he'll lead you to me!". "FOLLOW THE MULE". When the
mule  starts  to move, stay close to him and go where he goes. He will lead
you to your brother's cabin!

                          JAMES' CABIN & THE MINE

Go  inside  the Cabin. "GET THE MATCHES" off the table. Go back outside. Go
into  the  Outhouse  by walking SOUTHEAST, going behind the bushes (be sure
you  are all the way down against the bushes) and then walk WEST. The trail
is  narrow  so  if you run into something, wriggle through by going up then
left  or  similar.  Go  inside  the  Outhouse.  "JUMP DOWN THE HOLE" in the
Outhouse.

You  are in the Mine now. "LIGHT THE LANTERN" and walk WEST down the shaft.
Continue  down  the  shaft, changing screens, until you come to a huge door
with  a  double  lock.  "LOOK  AT  THE  DOOR",  then "TIE THE STRING TO THE
MAGNET",  "PUT  THE MAGNET IN THE HOLE" in the door and "LOWER THE MAGNET".
When  you  hear something 'click!' onto the magnet, "RAISE THE MAGNET". You
now  have  the  key  to this huge door!! "UNLOCK THE DOOR" and walk through
it.

[SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN IN THE MINE - IT'S DANGEROUS IN HERE!]

In  the  next scene, walk WEST and climb onto the ladder. Climb all the way
to  the  bottom  of  this  ladder  and then continue walking WEST, changing
screens.  When  you  come  to  another  ladder,  get on it and climb to the
bottom. "GET THE PICK" that is lying on the ground beside the rock.

There  are  deposits of gold in the walls of the Mine. Some are visible (8)
and some are hidden (12). "PICK" on the walls around the mine to expose the
gold that you can't see, and then "GET THE GOLD" that you CAN see!

To  find your brother James, climb to the top of the ladder, then move down
about  EIGHT  RUNGS.  You will see a ledge that you can walk onto. When you
are level with that ledge, walk LEFT.

Follow  the  shaft  WEST,  changing screens twice, until you see the ladder
going  down.  Climb  down this ladder to the bottom. Walk a few steps EAST,
and  switch  ladders.  Climb  down to the bottom of this other ladder. Walk
down the small 4-rung ladder until you are at bedrock.

Follow the shaft WEST until you find your brother.

After  your reunion, move to the back wall where you see some exposed gold.
"PICK"  at  the  wall and "GET THE GOLD". Repeat in the same spot until you
make a hole big enough to fit through. "GO THROUGH THE HOLE".

You  have  struck  it  rich!!  You  have  been reunited with your long lost
brother,  and  now  have  so  much  gold  that  it  causes an error on your
inventory screen!!!
