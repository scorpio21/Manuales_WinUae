 CHEAT MODE:

 If you press the [Help] key during the scrolling messages, the following
 setence will appear. "Yeah, sure you need help... find the correct word
 and you will get help!"
 Well, the correct word is 'ALIENSGOHOME'. Upon typing this, the words
 "Trainer Activated..." will appear along the scroll. This enables these
 in-game keys:

 [1] - Add 1up.

 [D] - Double bullet.
 [F] - Extra firepower.
 [N] - Next level.
 [B] - Beam.
