Great Giana Sisters


 CHEAT MODE:

 The cheat is Armin and it must be entered during play as follows:
 Hold down keys [A], [R], [M], [I] and [N] to warp to the next level.

 Note, this cheat was for the C64 version so I'm not so sure it'll
 work on the Amiga. The reason being is that Armin Gessert was the
 original programer, it was converted to the Amiga by a guy called
 Thomas Hertzler. Another interesting fact (not) is that the Amiga
 conversion never seen the light of day (apart from a few hundred
 copies that is). Nintendo successfuly got a court order to stop
 it's release. They claimed that it was too similar to their very
 own Super Mario Brothers.


On level 3 stand at the end of the row of blocks and jump up
to hit an invisible block that takes you to level 6.
