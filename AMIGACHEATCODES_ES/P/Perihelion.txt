Perihelion

Short briefing how to get started in Perihelion.

First of all go to Location A located on the map in the middle area of
the map. 'TALK' to the fellow there and he will after some meaningless
words tell you that he is willing to help you if you specify something
in question.

'ASK' him for 'NETCODE' and he will tell you to search for a friend of
him living not too far from his location, do notice the network codes
'INDIGO' and 'GLOBAL'. Now exit and head for Location B in the NorthWest
area of the map.

Enter, choose 'TALK' and again some bull will be mumbled then 'ASK' for
'NETCODE' and he'll give you the netcode 'PSYCHO' ..

Now use 'LOGIN' and the three different stated codes as netcodes.

As 'DIR' is a good way of wasting your cash i'll write down the filenames
for you to 'READ'/'DOWNLOAD', some of them will not be available for you
to 'READ' but thou to 'DOWNLOAD' .. No further on that , do not want to
spoil all the fun =) ...
