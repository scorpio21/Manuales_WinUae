Platoon


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the title screen, type either 'HAMBURGER', 'HAMBURGER HILL' or
 'HAMBURGER-HILL' (use the minus sign from the numeric keypad).
 The word "cheat" will appear below the credits so you'll know when
 you've activated it correctly. Press fire, then [F5] when the jungle
 screen comes up. Your man is now invincible.
 From here, [F1] either starts you where you are or skips levels,
 [F2] puts you at the location of the explosives, [F3] takes you to the
 bridges that you have to blow up, and [F4] takes you straight to the
 village where the entrance to the tunnels is hidden in one of the huts.
 From here on the cheat is no longer active, the game runs as normal and
 you can die, but it certainly gets you further along the track.
