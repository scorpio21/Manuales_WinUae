 CHEAT MODE:

 During play, type in 'KILLER'. The screen will flash and may invert -
 depending on how fast you typed in the cheat. If it does invert, just
 press [N] to turn the screen the right way up again. Either way, you'll
 now have infinite credits and you can press [F1] to [F8] to skip to the
 appropriate level.
