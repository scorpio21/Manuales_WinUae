			 QWAK - HINTS `N` TIPS
			 =====================

Here are some useful tips for that crazy platform caper, Qwak.

Basics
------

There are eight worlds, and 10 scenes per world. To complete each scene you
must collect all the gold keys and make your way through the open door.

Eggs and Baddies
----------------

Touching a baddie causes loss of one armour or death. Eggs can be thrown at
baddies and it takes one hit to destroy them in World One, two hits in
World Two, three hits in World Three, and four hits in World Four upwards.

Big baddies take six hits in World One, eight in World Two, 10 in World
Three and 12 hits in World Four and above.

Peace Bonus
-----------

Completing a scene without throwing and eggs gives a bonus of 10,000 points
x double world points, and doubles the egg bonus.

Egg Bonus
---------

Collecting the fruits and completing a scene gives an egg bonus. Each fruit
is worth one to six fruit points (red equals one, purple equals six). In
World One you need four fruit points for an egg bonus, in World Two, you
need six fruit points, in World Three, eight fruit points and in World Four
and above you need 10 fruit points for an egg bonus.

Gem Bonus
---------

Collecting all six gems gives a gem bonus which starts at 10,000 points and
doubles each time you get it. The gem bonus resets to 10,000 points when
you die.
