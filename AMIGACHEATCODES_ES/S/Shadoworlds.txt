Shadoworlds


 WALK-THROUGH:

 In this game, light and dark both play a vital role, therefore,
 batteries and flares need to be used sparingly wherever possible.
 Before embarking on the mission you will need to select a team of four
 adventurers. A spread of skills is the best possible combination.

 Level 1
 ~~~~~~~
 This is a small area to explore. Here is the best place to learn about
 the techniques needed to progress further. Light is required to read
 computer terminals which give vital clues. Pressure pads and photo-cells
 can open doors; you should also become familiar with using keys.
 All objects found should be taken, as later there are plenty of pressure
 pads which all need to be opened using weight. After you've got used to
 the control technique it's off to level 2.

 Level 2
 ~~~~~~~
 It should be noted that some of the robots will leave some valuable
 presents when they are dispatched. In the next two rooms the first long
 range weapons will be found.
 However, all long range weapons have ammunition limitations, so be
 careful how you use them. It's on this level that the first two
 recharging stations can be located.
 The first re-supplies food and can be used an unlimited number of times.
 Conversely, the second is for weapons and batteries and can only be used
 once. Once all the robots have been eliminated you can proceed to the
 next level.

 Level 3
 ~~~~~~~
 On entering this level there is another weapons recharge point.
 It's best to use this one when your ammo is at a minimum.
 You should now make your way to the central room of the Biological
 Research area. Using a light to open the door, there should be a robot.
 It is carrying a crate, so when you've killed it open the crate.
 Take the contents of the crate and deploy it as you see best.
 Now put the empty crate on the pressure pad to open the next security
 door.
 Enter the next two rooms, kill the robots and pick up the medical pack.
 You will also find a key; by going to the central room you will be able
 to use it and enter.
 Kill all the robots and you can use the food outlet and the very useful
 regeneration pad. The pad resurrects dead characters so long as you have
 brought their DNA pod. Be warned, the pad only works three times.
 After this, proceed to the central room and go through the remaining
 door to the transporter. Warning: beware of the pits en route.
 When you arrive at the transporter you should find another weapons
 recharger, using a green card should secure you a laser - just the
 ticket!

 Level 4
 ~~~~~~~
 Having exited the transporter, head down the corridor to the first room.
 Access is denied by a pit, the only way to close the pit is by throwing a
 flare over it. This will operate a photo-cell, which in turn closes the
 pit and allows you to pick up another key.
 In the next room there is another pit with a key which is just out of
 reach. Throwing something on the pressure pad moves the key within reach.
 Now you can open the corner door and move quickly into the little recess.
 Fire at the robot when it is as safe as possible, light a flare and throw
 it towards the door.
 The robot will head to the light. As he passes you by, stab him in the
 back.
 Next on the agenda is yet another room which requires the lighting of
 three photo-cells to get to the key. The following room calls for some
 teamwork: one man to operate the door switch, the other to fire at the
 robots.
 When you've managed to obtain this key, you should leave one man here so
 he can open the door in a little while to let another man out.
 The next room contains a one-way system, so only one man can enter to
 collect the keys. To get past this section, the man you have sent in must
 stand at the edge of the pit and throw the keys to another team mate,
 who will open the door for him to escape.
 In the next room one character must operate the wall switch which will
 turn on the transporter. Place a man in the transporter and he will be
 transported to the little room to pick up a key. Operating a switch sends
 him to where you left a man to open a door. At this point you can regroup
 and collect more food if necessary.
 The next room contains a key which when picked up, make three robots
 appear, so be warned.
 The last room on this level contains a robot, a key and a slot.
 Kill the robot and use the gold card in the slot to reveal a secret room
 full of goodies.
 After that dispose of the final robot, and it's off to the teleporter.

 Level 5
 ~~~~~~~
 Outside of the teleporter is a fence. Like all fences in Shadoworlds it
 should be treated with extreme caution. It's best to walk one man at a
 time around them for safety.
 One the plus side, you can hide behind this fence and the approaching
 robot will commit suicide.
 Then it's a long walk to the central teleporting area. The key that
 you should have collected opens a door, which will transport you to
 Ice World.
 The character that you send to Ice World should be the strongest and
 made as light as possible.

 Level 6 - Ice World
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 On arrival you will have to move very quickly and dodge the multitude
 of robots that inhabit this section. Eventually they can be lined up so
 that they fire on one another.
 You can collect the crate and use the transporter pressure pad to get
 back to the teleporting area.
 This crate contains a key so that you can open the next door to get to
 Jungle World.

 Level 7 - Jungle World
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The person who you send here needs to be equipped with a light sabre,
 plenty of flares for light at night and also some food.
 Near to the pressure pads are three guards who do not always fire at you.
 If you are healthy, save the game here.
 Using the pad transports you to another jungle, where once again you are
 attacked immediately on arrival. Collect your crate then flee as fast as
 possible back to the teleporting area.

 Level 5 (Continued)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Rest the party again, feed them and kill the robot guards.
 Now use the teleporter.

 Level 8
 ~~~~~~~
 The first man out of the teleporter should be armed with a flame thrower
 to kill the wandering bugs which are there to greet you. On this level
 are four rooms, each has a pressure pad which requires a weight leaving
 on it to open the exit door.
 The top two doors are quite straight-forward. However, the central
 connecting room is quite tricky, so save the game before venturing
 further.
 On entering you will be attacked by heads, so stand in the doorway and
 use the light sabre on them. You will then have to very carefully walk
 one character around the fence that obscures your path.
 After killing the remaining head, dodge past the robot in the bottom
 right room and move onwards.
 The last room takes a team effort and plenty of light. This is because
 all the lights in this area are activated by photo-cells. The last room
 is occupied by a robot who will kill himself if you occupy the right
 space.

 Level 9
 ~~~~~~~
 This level is full of pits, but they can be closed by using light to
 operate the photo-cells. The two rooms are symmetrical so only one side
 needs to be closed.
 Kill the guards and have a lighted flare available. You will approach
 three photo-cells, which depending on which is activated opens a
 combination of two doorways.
 It is vitally important to leave one man here if you want to complete
 the game. Walk around the corridor until you reach a switch.
 Use a light to open it, and then stand in the doorway with your sabre
 drawn. As the guards walk by, kill them. The third guard will not cause
 you any bother and can be left alone.
 Place objects on the pressure pads to open the next two doors and then
 move on to the next room.
 There are two heads that wander around that must be despatched with
 immediately. Then find the pressure pad which is up a small dead end,
 place an object on it and the last door to a teleport will open.
 This room contains three buttons. The first will turn on the teleport,
 so position a man there with a light-sabre, while another team member
 operates the button.
 The teleported character will arrive in a room where casting light onto
 a photo-cell releases heads. Kill the heads and get the character at
 the buttons to operate the second.
 This will turn on another teleport which transports your character into
 another similar room. Once again light releases heads which need to be
 despatched with. Pick up the key and use the button controller to press
 the third button which returns the transported character.
 Now you have a hell of a trek back to the teleportation room on level
 five. You can now use the key to open the last room. The character that
 enters needs to be a fast mover.

 Level 10 - Desert World
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 On arrival walk past the two robot, but do not stand too long in one
 spot or you may receive a rather unpleasant surprise from a sand monster.
 Progress to the pit and jump in.

 Level 11
 ~~~~~~~~
 You will now have to move extremely quickly to dodge all the robots that
 are firing on you. This will probably take some doing and may use nearly
 all your team.
 Provided you have one survivor everything will be all right.
 Once all the robots have killed each other there's only one room to
 contend with.
 Throw a lighted flare into the room and it releases two heads.
 Stand in the entrance way and despatch them using the light sabre.
 A robot also occupies this room; he cannot move from the room until both
 lights are removed. Wait until the robot has moved into the corner where
 the heads came from, and then enter the room. The robot will fire, but
 the shots will rebound and kill him. He will leave a key to the last door
 which when opened completes the game.
