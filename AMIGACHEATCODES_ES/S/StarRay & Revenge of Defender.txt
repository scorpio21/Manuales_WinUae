StarRay / Revenge of Defender


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the options screen type 'AL YANKOVIC' and then press [F5] for effect.
 Also pressing [X], [T], [C] and the [Spacebar] produces a cheat screen.

 This next cheat only works on the budget release, not the full price
 game.
 Here's the step by step guide to getting an invincible ship. Make sure
 your mouse is plugged in, but don't use it to move the highlight.

 Access the Options with the [Spacebar].
 Move down to the View Game Screen option.
 Push the joystick left and press fire.
 The game screen should appear.
 Center the joystick and press fire again.
 The Options screen should reappear.
 Move down to the Sound On option.
 Push the joystick right and press fire.
 If Sound On changes to Sound Off, start again from scratch.
 Press [Return] to the View Game Screen option.
 Push the joystick right and while holding it in this direction,
 hold down the right mouse button.
 Press the left mouse button.
 The Options Screen should change to "Cheat Mode".
 Press [Return] to Resume Game and continue play with a shield that
 never depletes.

 If this doesn't work, try again from a new game.
