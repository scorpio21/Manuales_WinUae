PART ONE: NOVEMBER GRAVEYARD



The  last thing you remember is driving in the car with Sarah on the way to

your  meet  with  the drugs gang. All your undercover work was about to pay

off.  Now  you  find  yourself  standing  by your own grave, with a priest,

mourners  and  a  detective.  One of the policemen there says he's glad the

funeral  is over, this is the part of the work he hates - going to funerals

for  stupid  bastards who get themselves killed and their partner captured.

Another agrees and says that it's only because Mr Severian stumbled on them

dumping  Alan's  body  that the crooks needed a hostage, otherwise the girl

would be dead.



EXAMINE  DETECTIVE;  Severian,  a  new  recruit  to  the  drugs squad. He's

carrying  a matchbook and newspaper. From what he says, talking to himself,

you  realise he's one of the crooks. He set you up and because you're dead,

you're a convenient scapegoat.



No-one suspects what has happened. If you follow him, he pats the vaults on

his way out of the graveyard and mutters:"Who'd think of looking in there".

You realise it's where he stashed the drugs. It's up to you to do something

so  that the crooks can't pick up the drugs that evening to give the police

time to complete their investigations.



EXAM  VAULT;  You  see  a flash of white and inside you see a pile of white

plastic  bags.  EXAM BAGS; the sort you get from high street shops but they

contain narcotics.



After  a  while, a spotlight comes on in the graveyard and the shock of the

lights  sends  you back to your grave. When you recover, Joe Danby turns up

and  offers  to  show you around. He introduces you to the other ghosts and

then asks to walk round with you.



The  first  thing  you must do is to build up your strength. You do this by

picking  up  small,  light  things  to  start with and gradually picking up

heavier  and  heavier items. When you pick up your first thing, Joe says it

won't  be  long before you can lift something worthwhile. You can only pick

up one thing at a time.



Start  with the thistledown, leaf or petal and pick up two of them in total

to start increasing your strength. Then get matchbook and pebble.



Go  towards  the shed area and you will find a dog. It is making odd noises

and  has  something  (a  bone)  stuck in its throat. "PAT DOG" three times,

following it if necessary till it knows you're a friend. "GET BONE".



Go  to  David.  He  is  very  scathing about your lack of abilities to move

things. "PUSH URN"; it moves, David is impressed and says he will help.



The  Willmots  are  arguing  over a wreath which Edna says is hers but Bert

won't  let her have. Go to the faded wreath.  On it is a card showing it is

Edna's. Get the yellow card. Go to your grave, get the white card from your

new  wreath  and  drop  it.  Get  the  yellow card again, put it on the new

wreath.  Try  to  get  the new wreath. You can't but the dog can. Go to the

Willmots  and  "WAIT FOR DOG". Edna says the cards on the wreaths are wrong

but is still happy about it. The Willmots will now help you.



Get  them  all  to  follow  you  and  go to the shed. "EXAM LOCK"; it has a

barrel,  short  lever,  medium lever and long lever. All the levers must be

moved out of the way before the door will open.



"JOE,  WAIT  3, PUSH LONG LEVER", "BERT, WAIT 2, PUSH MEDIUM LEVER", "EDNA,

WAIT, PUSH SHORT LEVER", "DAVID, TURN BARREL".



They  do  so and the door is now unlocked. Try to pull the rope and the dog

helps.  The  door  opens and the dog enters, grabs the bag of biscuits from

inside as his reward and goes off to eat them.



From talking to Violet before, you know she is afraid to leave her grave in

case  she  can't  find  it  again  because she was blind in life. She wants

something  by  it  to  make a noise. Inside shed, "GET BELL", go to Violet.

"PUT BELL ON BUSH"; it makes a noise so she can now leave her grave.



To  turn  off  the spotlight and enable you to go further south through the

graveyard,  "JOE,  WAIT,  PUSH  BUTTON",  "PUSH BUTTON"; the spotlight goes

off.



To  get  rid of the vandals, in the shed "PUSH SWITCH"; the vandals flee as

the light goes on. "PUSH SWITCH" again to turn it off. The colonel will now

follow you.



To  help  Edith, she says she is cursed to remain by her grave till the end

of  time. Joe says you must demonstrate the end of time to her. "GET WATCH"

from  shed,  go to Edith, "PUT WATCH IN VASE"; it breaks thus demonstrating

the end of time! She will now follow you.



Go  to  the  sundial and "JOE, PUSH SUNDIAL", "PUSH SUNDIAL"; it breaks and

you  can  get  the  gnomon. Go to the bushes and examine them. You can tell

there's  something  in  there.  "SEARCH  BUSHES"  to  find  a  copy of Time

magazine.



Go  to  the  stonework  and  examine  it  to see a statue that looks like a

sleeping  man.  "WAKE STATUE"; you hit it and it wakes. It's another ghost,

Alex Pym.



Go  to  the wall which is leaning and "PUSH WALL". Everyone helps. The wall

collapses  and  traps  the  drugs so the dealers can't get them that night,

giving you time to find their hideout and clear your name.

                       (PART ONE IS NOW COMPLETED!)




PART TWO: HAUNTED HOUSE



You  start  the  next  night  by  your grave, aware of a house north of the

cemetery.  You  must find the gang's hideout. Joe says you can probably now

heat  and cool things and also reach through solid objects. He says he will

come with you to find the crooks.



To  pass the green safely, go to the south green and wait till you see pale

headlights.  Go  south  and north. You now see red tail lights heading away

from you and Joe says it's now safe to cross.



Outside  the  house, Joe says if you concentrate you might be able to bring

back  visions  of what happened. If you "CONCENTRATE" in various locations,

you  will  see  what  happened.  You  see yourself burying something in the

garden, you shooting one of the crooks in the hall, the crooks clearing the

house  and  burning papers in the fireplace, one piece being trapped in the

chimney  shaft,  two  crooks  taking their dead comrade's body upstairs and

returning  without  it and then you being hit and taken from the house. The

visions  leave  you  unsure as to whether or not Sarah, your colleague, was

working with the crooks.



After  your  vision  of you burying something in the herb garden, "DIG" and

you unearth your plastic ID card. Get it and drop it in the hallway.



"EXAMINE DIRECTORY" in the hall to find a bookmark. EXAMINE it; it's an old

envelope  showing the postmark of the village near the crooks' new hideout.

You  can't get it on your own so "JOE, WAIT, GET BOOKMARK", "GET BOOKMARK".

Now drop it in hall.



By  the garden is a stream but the water makes you nervous. On the water is

a  branch  and  on  the  branch  is a map. To get the map, "COOL WATER", it

freezes. Get the map, examine it; it shows the crooks' new hideout.



To  get the paper from the chimney, it's too high up to get from inside and

Joe  says  it  might  be  better  to  try from the other side. If you reach

through  the wall from inside, Joe says it must look funny from outside. If

you  reach  through  the wall from the outside (by the ivy), you don't know

where you are reaching.

Joe  says  he wonders if he could help. Go back inside, "JOE, WAIT 5, REACH

THROUGH  WALL".  Go  back to the ivy and wait till Joe's hand waves through

the  wall.  Now  if you "REACH INTO WALL" you know where the chimney is and

dislodge  the  paper. Go back to the lounge and get the paper. It shows all

the  first  names  of  the  gang - it's a list of their gambling debts. You

realise it will help the police find out their full names by narrowing down

their search. Drop paper in hall.



If you try to go upstairs, the ghost of Luke, the crook you killed, attacks

you  and  Joe  saves  you.  To  get  rid of him, you must turn on the light

upstairs  but  not  downstairs  (as that will affect you.) so in hall, "GET

BULB,  DROP  IT,  PUSH  SWITCH";  the  light goes on upstairs and the ghost

screams  and  vanishes.  But  now  the light upstairs stops you going up or

turning  off  the  switch  downstairs.  You must fuse the lights. Go to the

kitchen, "GET BULB, DROP IT, GET FUSE, PUT FOIL IN HOLDER, PUSH SWITCH" and

the fuse blows. You can now go upstairs.



In  the  tank in the attic, if you "CONCENTRATE", you see Luke's body being

put  in  the  tank.  You  find  it in the tank and push off the lid in your

panic.



Get plug, go to the bathroom. You see a mirror. "THROW PLUG AT MIRROR"; the

mirror  breaks, you see an alcove behind. In it is a briefcase. Get it. Joe

says  you  have  enough  evidence,  now  you  must  work out how to get the

police.



Drop  all  evidence  in  the hall - the paper, bookmark, briefcase, map and

card.



You  have  to  summon  the  fire  service  and  bring the evidence to their

attention  or  they will just kick it out of the way. To do this, go to the

attic  carrying  the  plug and either "FREEZE PLUG TO BODY" or "TIE PLUG TO

BODY".  Get  the socket, go to the clock, "OPEN PANEL, PUT SOCKET IN PANEL,

CLOSE  PANEL".  Then  "PUSH  CLOCK"; it falls down the stairs and drags the

body  down behind it. Go to kitchen, "PUSH BOTTLE"; whisky vapour fills the

room.  "LIGHT VAPOUR, BLOW CURTAINS"; the fire gets a grip, firemen arrive,

see the body and realise he was not killed in the fire.



They call the police.

                       (PART TWO IS NOW COMPLETED!!)



PART THREE: POLTERGEIST



You  awake  at the start of the third night wondering if you are now strong

enough  to  bend  metal  and manifest to mortals. There is a priest bending

over the grave with two members of the gang, preparing to exorcise you.



Go west so you aren't exorcised. You can't return to your grave either as a

free  spirit  or  by  being  sent  there  by  light as you will be banished

forever.



The crooks arrive and say they'll go and get the drugs so follow them. They

collect them, get into the van and it leaves.



It  drives to a farm. They park in a barn and enter the house but you can't

because  of  the  light inside. You realise it's their hideout and that you

must  not  only  help the police get there without being seen but also save

the evidence. You get a hint during the trip about the possibility of power

cuts.



Near the farm is a shed with a generator and at the back of the farm house,

some  dangerous-looking  connectors with exposed wires. You can't enter the

barn as it's the place you died and the pain drives you back.



Examine  hay  to  find  a  sprayer  and  get  it. Go to connectors and "HIT

CONNECTORS  WITH  SPRAYER"  to short them out. One crook comes out to start

the  generator but says it won't give much power. Go into the house and you

realise  you  can  charge things with static and manifest yourself. Examine

the  cupboard  in the hall to see a circuit breaker. "PULL BREAKER" so they

can't put the lights back on properly.



The  gang  are  in  the  kitchen  playing cards. There is a briefcase there

containing drugs and you know you'll need it as evidence.



John goes up to the attic to act as look-out and Sarah is taken down to the

cellar, tied up and gagged.



Follow John to the attic. The window looks out over the countryside and you

know you must distract John so he doesn't see the police. You also know you

must  do  this five times. Don't distract him till you see movement outside

the  window  and  also don't do it straight away as you have to "DRAG" this

bit  out  a bit! If you wait too long, he will spot the police and warn the

others so you must time it so you do it just before he gets suspicious.



At  the  right  time, get bulb and drop it; the darkness and noise frighten

him. Get the broken glass.



Go  down  to the cellar door. You can't carry anything if you float through

the door so wait till Weasel arrives to check on Sarah. Go in when he does,

drop  the  glass and go back to the attic. At the right time, distract John

again - charge the holder so the static makes his hair stand on end.



Go  back  to the cellar. "MANIFEST" so Sarah can see you and hear you, then

"CUT ROPE" using the glass. She goes and puts the hammer on the shelf above

the  door  and  goes  back to her chair, pretending to still be tied up. Go

back  to the door and wait till Weasel arrives again. When he enters, "PUSH

HAMMER"; it hits him.



Sarah comes through. "MANIFEST" again and "SARAH, TIE WEASEL"; she ties him

up. Leave and she follows you, bolting the door behind her.



Go  up to the hall and she looks at the cupboard and says she ought to find

somewhere  to hide. "SARAH, GO TO TAXI, DEFLATE TYRES, GO TO CUPBOARD, HIDE

IN  IT,  WAIT  20".  She  goes  off  to  do it. You can't deflate the tyres

yourself as the taxi is in the barn where you were killed.



Go  back  towards  the  attic  and on the way you see a creaky stair. "PUSH

STAIR"  to  frighten John so long as it's the right time. Go into the attic

and wait for movement outside again, then "BLOW CURTAINS". Wait again until

the  time  is  right  and  "COOL  JOHN"  to  scare  him the fifth time. Now

"MANIFEST";  he  is  petrified  and  fires  his  gun at you. The others run

upstairs  to  see  what's  wrong,  leaving  the  briefcase unguarded in the

kitchen.



Go  back  to  the  hall  and  "MANIFEST".  "SARAH,  E, GET CASE, W, HIDE IN

CUPBOARD, WAIT 20". This is because the case is too heavy for you to carry.

She goes, does it and returns.



The  crooks will now get ready to leave the farm but because the police are

now so close, they won't be able to get away, so long as you slow them down

a bit more. If you have previously examined John, you know his jacket has a

pocket  which  contains the key to the van. Go out to the van and "LET DOWN

TYRES".



When  the crooks get to the van, they don't have time to inflate the tyres.

Wait  till John arrives and "BEND KEY".  They don't have time to straighten

it  so  they  make  a  dash for it over the fields where the police capture

them.



Severian and the Professor go to the taxi. When it gets out of the barn, it

is  going  slowly  because  of  the  flat tyres so "GET INTO TAXI". Inside,

"MANIFEST";  you  fight  with  Severian and because the tyres are flat, the

taxi  slides  and  crashes.  The police catch the two of them when they run

away.



The  evidence  is  recovered  and Sarah is safe and so can give evidence to

clear your name.

points.)
