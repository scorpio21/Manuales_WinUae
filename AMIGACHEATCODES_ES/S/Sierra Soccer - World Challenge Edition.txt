Sierra Soccer


 CHEAT MODE:

 Choose to play a friendly match, and when picking your teams,
 press [X] on the keyboard. The screen will flash and you'll
 be playing on a blue pitch which makes the ball extra bouncy.

 To stop the opposition from scoring penaties, press [C], [F2] and
 fire when goalkeeping and a wall should appear and you'll never
 let any goals in.
