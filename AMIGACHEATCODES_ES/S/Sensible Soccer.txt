SENSIBLE SOCCER

This cheat will allow you to play the game in slow motion.
What you have to do is play a match and then make a
substitution.  Then when the player is walking off, press the 'ESC'
key and you will quit the game.  Start another match and you should
notice that everything plays at slow speed, even the timer!  To
return to normal, make another substitution, but let it carry
through.
