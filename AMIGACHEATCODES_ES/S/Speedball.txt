SPEEDBALL

League General tips: 

Spheres near the opponents goals are very usefull for a
bounce off goal, especially against top goalies. Against an easy team try to
grab as many coins as you can, as well as trying to win the game (of course !)
Concentrate on using coins to build your POWER, SKILL, & STAMINA. Once they
have reached their maximums which is POWER=300, STAMINA=55, SKILL=260 
(I Think !) Now you can use coins on, BRIBE REF (for extra goals), REDUCE
SKILL, REDUCE STAMINA & if needed BRIBE AN OFFICAL. All the others don't seem
to do much, but these are my preferences, and they go me through a 100 week
league with my team coming top ! When game starts slide tackle the enemy in
front of you (especially against a hard opponent, sometimes you don't have to
do this). Watch out for the ball rebounding off of spheres, when shooting aim
for the corners and not the middle.
