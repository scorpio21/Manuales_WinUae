AMAZING SPIDERMAN

Get a decent score and on the highscore table and enter your name as 
GENERIC then press HELP while playing to get full energy!

 If that fails! try typing 'SPIDEY'S GONNA CHEAT!' on the title screen.
 Now press [Return] - normally this takes you into the game, but if it
 doesn't then you know you have typed the cheat correctly.
 This also allows you to hit the [Help] key to replenish your energy.
