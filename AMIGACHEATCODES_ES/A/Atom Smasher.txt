 Designing A Maze
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Each level consists of 3 layers, and pressing [D] will go through them.
 Depth 0 is where the backgrounds are designed, depth 1 is where the ice,
 mud and mines go, and depth 2 is where you actually design the maze.
 On depth 2, pressing the [Spacebar] takes you to the block select screen,
 where you can select any block by pressing fire on your joystick.
 This then puts you in "block" mode (which appears at the bottom right of
 the screen) where you can place the block by pressing fire again.
 
 Placing Characters
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Select depth 2 and press [M] to go into "baddie" mode.
 Position both players by pressing [1] and [2] at the desired position.
 You can toggle through the baddies using the comma [,] and [.] keys, and
 can place them using fire, or replace existing baddies by first selecting
 the space, and then adding your preference.
 Baddie characteristics can be changed by placing the cursor over it and
 then using the arrow keys:

         Up - Increase baddie speed.
 Left/Right - Decrease/increase rate at which the baddies drop hazards,
              from 01 (a hazard every move) to 99 (a hazard every 99
              moves). 00 means it'll never drop anything.
       Down - Increase drop speed by 10.

 Pressing [9] will change the speed at which the baddies will then appear.
 Once you've placed all the initial baddies, pressing [Return] takes you
 onto the "que" screen, where you can place up to 50 replensished ones.
 Pressing [0] will change the time between these baddies appearing.
 Any new levels can now be saved on a blank disk by returning to the main
 menu and selecting the save option.
