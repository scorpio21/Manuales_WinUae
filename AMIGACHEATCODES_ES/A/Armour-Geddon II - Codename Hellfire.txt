Armour-Geddon II


 CHEAT MODE:

 Access the Equip screen, now move the mouse pointer to the top left
 corner of the screen and press both mouse buttons and the [Esc] key
 simultaneously. You will now be returned to the Messages screen and
 it will read "PYSGY GAME TESTERS MODE ON". The cheat is now active.
 Repeating the above process a second time will produce the message
 "SOMEBODY HAS TO PLAY IT FOR REAL" and thus turning the cheat off.
