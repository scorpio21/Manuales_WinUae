Ivan Ironman Stewarts Super Off Road


 CHEAT MODE:

 Simply hold down the fire button while the game is loading only
 releasing it when you come to the name/country selection screen.
 You will then find when you loose a race that you have infinite
 credits and money.


HINTS:

In the speedshop,acceleration and top speed are most important, but you
don't get full effect unless you have decent tyres.

Staying on the track with all four wheels is important,so some shocks will
come in handy after a few races.They help to decrease the effect of the
bumps on the tracks.

Sometimes its better to take the long route around a bump,just to keep the
speed up,especially if you have low acceleration.

If you can,try to cut the corners around the track - the computer
controlled trucks usually take the slightly longer but safer routes.  Try
to avoid hitting walls as large amounts of time are lost by careless
driving.

Use nitros wisely.  There's not much point in firing a nitro at a corner
and banging straight into a wall.  They are most effective when used on a
long straight.

Dont use nitros with other trucks directly in front of you, they will get
more benefit from the knock on effect than you will get from the nitro.
It's better to stay behind cars than trying to force your way past them at
tricky parts of the track, you will normally end up worse off anyway.

Remember, Ironman is the fastest and craftiest computer truck, so he`s the
one to concentrate on, although to survive a race you must beat ALL of the
other computer controlled trucks.

The computers trucks, Ironman especially, get upset if you beat them by
too much in a race and jazz up their trucks accordingly for the next race
- so try not to beat them by too large a margin.
