                                   Introduction
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Conan the Cimmerian is Virgin Games' action adventure based
     on the story of Conan, created by Robert E. Howard, made
     popular over the years by numerous books, comic books and
     movies. In this first game of the Conan series, Conan swears
     vengeance will be his after witnessing Thoth Amon destroy
     his entire village and murder his wife. Before obtaining the
     information he needs to complete his quest, he must earn the
     respect of the inhabitants of Hyborea by first completing
     seemingly impossible tasks.

     As the player, you will control all of Conan's actions and
     decisions. You will start at the main gate in Shadizar, where
     you are told to find the Red Dog Tavern. Ninook, who has been
     expecting you, will urge you to find Taurus, the master thief.
     While Taurus has been ousted from the Thieves' Guild, he may
     well be your only hope to completing the first task set before
     you.

     The game is divided into seven major episodes. Each episode
     has one to a few primary goals. In addition, there are six
     side "minor" quests, which are not necessary to solve the
     game. However, by completing these side quests, you will
     earn gold to finance items needed to make solving the game
     easier. In addition to money, you might find some useful
     information and objects which you will need to find the
     vile Thoth Amon and avenge the deaths of Conan's people.

     This hint book is divided by episode for easy reference.
     In Conan, after you complete each episode, you will be
     taken back to the Red Dog Tavern in Shadizar, where you
     will be given information regarding the next episode.


                           ITEMS
                           ~~~~~
     Swords

     Starting Sword
     This is the sword that Conan crafted as he was growing
     up, and the only sword that he has in his possession when
     he starts the game. In combat, the starting sword does no
     extra damage against Conan's opponents.

     Brass Sword
     Available from merchants selling their wares in the city
     of Shadizar, this sword will give Conan +25% extra damage
     in combat.

     Bronze Sword
     Available from merchants selling their wares in the city
     of Shadizar, this sword will give Conan +35% extra damage
     in combat.

     Lizard Sword
     Found in Larsha in Episode Five, this sword is necessary
     to kill any Lizard men. In combat against all other foes,
     this sword gives Conan +35% extra damage.

     Snake Sword
     In the underground lies the snake guarding the Eye of the
     Serpent. To destroy the snake, you will need this snake
     sword, also in the underground under lock and key. The
     snake sword gives +35% extra damage against any other
     foe in normal combat.

     Obsidian Sword
     This sword is found in the pyramid in the Jungle Ruins in
     Episode Two. The most unique feature is its non-metallic
     construction. It is helpful for getting past the monolith,
     which catches unsuspecting victims by drawing in all metal
     items. Against normal foes, this sword yields Conan +35%
     extra damage in combat.

     Steel Sword
     Available in some specialty shops in Shadizar, the steel
     sword nets Conan +50% in combat against his opponents.

     King's Sword
     Guarded by the mummy of an ancient sorcerous King in his
     crypt in Episode Two, this sword is one of the strongest
     and most powerful in all of Hyborea. Successfully in
     Conan's possession, it will give him +70% extra damage in
     combat.

     Enchanted Sword
     Available from only one merchant who does not sell to just
     anyone, the enchanted sword is of the strongest construction
     known to the people of this time. Successfully wielded, it
     will give the possessor +100% extra damage in combat.


     Amulets

     Ruby Amulet (The Amulet of the Undead)
     Somewhere in the underground, this amulet can either be
     returned to its rightful owner in exchange for gold, or can
     be used by Conan to his advantage; It causes all mummies in
     a confrontation to burst into flames and burn.

     "Freeze" Amulet
     In Hyborea, powerful wizards have been known to bring some
     statues to life to attack their enemies. Impervious to normal
     weapons, such a foe can only be stopped by freezing it back
     into stone with this amulet.

     Emerald Amulet
     The wearer of this Amulet has protection against any priests
     who attempt to use harmful magic against them.

     Keys

     All keys in the game open the lock of the corresponding color.
     A jade key, for example, opens a jade lock, a silver key opens
     a silver lock, etc. The keys that are available in the game
     are as follows: Copper, Jade, Bronze, Green, Brown, Silver,
     Golden, Brass, Steel, Black, Onyx, Skeleton and Marble.

     Gems

     There are four types of gems in the game that are easily
     found throughout Hyborea. Rubies, sapphires, emeralds,
     and diamonds can be found in residences, and can be bought
     or sold to merchants in Shadizar. Comparison pricing will
     help Conan get the most gold for each gem.

     Maps

     There are several different maps in the game. Each map must
     be used to the city in which it refers, on the correct level.
     This means that a map of Shadizar can only be examined in
     Shadizar.  Following is a list of maps which are available
     in the game:

     Map                        Obtained From/At

     Map to Inn of the Veils    Ninook in the Red Dog Tavern
     Map to Thoth Amon's Ring   In a guarded room in Larsha
     Map to Underground         From any Chartmaker in Shadizar
     Map of Larsha              From any Chartmaker in Shadizar
     Map of Snake Alley         From any Chartmaker in Shadizar


     Miscellaneous

     Flint & Steel
     Found in the shops of many merchants in Shadizar, or in hidden
     places, it will start a fire, providing there is material on
     the ground that will burn.

     Rope
     Available from merchants, or from some residences, it will
     allow Conan to climb out of holes, should he fall into any
     pits without exits.

     Torches
     A necessary item if Conan is to traverse the underground
     of the cities.

     Gem of Light
     Found in a few secluded areas in Shadizar, this gem works
     exactly the same way a torch does, except that the flame
     never dies while you are in the underground. It can be used
     only one time but will remain lit until you exit the
     underground.

     Staff of Power
     The Staff of Power is a very powerful weapon. In a battle,
     it will cause all opponents to perish immediately. Because
     of it's powerful nature, it can be be used only three times.

     Gem of Sight
     Like a map, the Gem of Sight will show the surrounding area
     with Conan (or whomever is using it) in the center.

     Horn of Valhalla
     Found in obscure locations in Larsha or Zamboula. When used,
     it summons the aid of a mystic warrior who will assist Conan
     in his current battle.

     Potions

     White Lotus
     Restores Conan's stamina level.

     Black Lotus
     Will seriously harm Conan if swallowed.

     Purple Lotus
     Temporarily adds 10% to Conan's current defense percentage.

     Red Lotus
     Temporarily adds 10% to Conan's current combat percentage.

     Gold

     Gold is very important to Conan. It is needed to buy all
     items he will need to complete his quests. The best, if
     not the noblest, ways to make money are to either
     complete side quests in exchange for gold, or steal
     from residences and pawn any valuable items Conan might
     find in exchange for gold. If Conan is caught stealing,
     however, he will not only lose three months time in the
     local slammer, he will also lose all gold he is currently
     carrying. Be sure to stash extra gold in a safe place
     such as a temple.

     Spells

     The only spell available in the city of Shadizar is a
     teleport scroll. It can be found in residences inside
     Shadizar. It can be used twice, and will transport
     Conan to a location nearby. When used, a small map
     will appear. Click on the location on the map where you
     would like Conan to be, and he will be put there. This
     item is very useful for travelling to places which have
     no entrances on foot, or are heavily guarded.


                       Combat Strategy
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Each opponent that Conan must face will require a different
     type of swing to defeat. While other swings will do minimal
     damage, Conan will surely have a difficult time claiming
     victory if he does not use the more effective fighting style.

     Following is a list of opponents and the swing required:

     Foe                        Swing       Miscellaneous Notes
     Guards in Shadizar         Chop
     Toughs in Shadizar         Thrust
     Thieves in Shadizar        Swing
     Priest in Underground      Thrust     Has Jade key in his possession
     Priests                    Thrust
     Snake                      Thrust     Easier to kill w/Snake Sword
     Lizardmen                  Any Swing  Easier to kill w/Lizard Sword
     Temple Priest              Thrust
     High Priestess/Horned Ape  Swing      Must use Obsidian Sword
     Guardian                   Thrust
     Underground Rats           Thrust
     Spiders                    Thrust
     Mummy                      Chop
     Jalung Thongpa             Chop
     Thoth Amon                 Thrust
     Assassins                  Swing
     Corsair                    Chop
     Elite Guard of Set         Chop       Idenifiable by green kilt
     Horned Warrior             Swing
     Guard in Thoth's Palance   Chop

     There are some opponents that Conan cannot bring down with a sword.
     These foes will require thought and planning if Conan is going to
     triumph.


                    General Questions
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     I keep wandering aimlessly around! Is there more
     to the game?
     Of course there is. Look around you, and talk to
     everyone you see. Perhaps they know of Thoth Amon
     and can help you finish your quest.

     How do I see how Conan is doing?
     By clicking on the face icon, or by typing "S",
     you will see Conan's statistics: current and
     maximum hit points, his defense ability, any
     extra damage that the sword Conan currently has
     in use gives him, etc. You will also see his
     ability in the the three types of swings:
     Thrust, Chop and Swing. An asterisk next to
     a swing type indicates the swing that Conan is
     currently using. Also shown is Conan's stealth
     ability.

     How do I pick up items?
     Any item in the Scene Level that can be picked
     up and that you'd like to add to Conan's
     inventory can be picked up by clicking on the
     object with the mouse. If you are using a
     joystick, you can move the cursor to the object
     and press the button. Not every in a scene can
     be picked up.

     How do I check a character's inventory?
     Clicking on the pouch icon or hitting "I" will
     show what Conan is currently carrying.

     I keep having to start all over from the
     beginning each time my party dies!
     SAVE YOUR GAME. Every time you pass an episode,
     or right before a battle that you are unsure of,
     you will want to save your game, just in case.
     In this game, you can save one game at a time.
     What this means is that if you save a game, it
     overwrites any previously saved game.

     How do I drop items?
     Clicking on the fist menu or on Conan will bring
     a menu on the Scene Level which will allow Conan
     to drop the items in his possession. Click on the
     DROP button, and then click on the item you wish
     to drop. Press the ALL button to drop all of the
     the items in Conan's inventory. Beware, of the
     lurking thieves who will make off with valuable
     dropped items!

     Should I take what I find in the residences?
     Without gold to buy items, Conan stands very
     little chance of completing the quests set
     before him. One of the best sources of income
     is fencing stolen goods. Remember, Conan is
     not famous for being a "nice" guy!

     I'm out of gold! How do I get more?
     You can obtain gold one of two ways: Either
     steal from the residences in the city, or
     finish side quests in exchange for gold.
     You might also try selling back items you
     no longer need. (Remember kids, don't try
     this at home. This is make believe.)



                    Episodes
                    ~~~~~~~~

     Episode One
     ~~~~~~~~~~~
     Conan has vowed to avenge the deaths of his
     wife and fellow townfolk. First,  he must gain
     the respect of the people of Hyborea. Starting
     at the main gate in the city of Shadizar, Conan
     must locate the tavern shown on the paper map
     included in the Conan game box. Here he must seek
     help in locating Taurus, the master theif.

     On his way to the Red Dog Tavern, he should speak
     to everyone he meets to familiarize himself with
     the city. South of the Red Dog Tavern, is the home
     of Master Quan Yo, a trainer in the "Riddle of the
     Steel", or sword fighting. There, Conan can learn
     the Thrust and Overhead Chop types of swings. Once
     trained, he should find the Red Dog Tavern and
     speak to Ninook, who will give him a map to
     Taurus.

     Before Conan searches for Taurus, he should buy some
     torches. Torches can be bought from several different
     merchants in the Merchant's Quarter. In the
     underground, torches will be required for Conan to
     see his way around.

     Conan will find the Inn of the Veils, located on the
     map which Ninook gave him. Inside, Conan will meet a
     man who will not openly discuss Taurus, unless Conan
     gives him some gold to aid his "memory".

     Finding Taurus, Conan will seek the Eye of the Serpent
     in an underground tomb guarded by a snake, that is even
     larger than Conan himself. The only weapon Conan can use
     against this snake is the Snake Sword, which is hidden
     somewhere in the catacombs underground.

     Before he can obtain the sword, he must first find the
     jade key to gain entry to the shrine. Contrary to his
     already exhibited highly moralistic character, Conan
     must kill a Priest of Set to obtain the Jade key.
     Once you've gotten the key, you can grab the sword,
     and kill the snake. Once the snake is defeated, you
     will have free access to the fabled Eye of the Serpent,
     and you will have completed Episode one.


     Episode One Questions & Answers
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     How can I kill a guard?
     Guards are very difficult to kill, and require an
     Overhead Chop, which Conan is not yet trained in
     when you start the game. Before attempting to kill
     a guard, train with Master Quan Yo and gain some
     experience with your sword. Should you be in combat
     with a guard, you can ignobly leave by clicking on
     the left margin of the screen, thus exiting back to
     the City Level.

     Where is Master Quan Yo?
     South of the Red Dog Tavern, Master Quan Yo resides
     on the south side of a building with an open
     courtyard. Find your way there carefully, for it
     is guarded on both sides of the door.

     How come I can't get into the Inner City?
     The Inner City is heavily guarded and cannot be
     entered through normal means. Any attempts through
     the main gates will result in Conan's death.

     Why do I keep getting thrown in jail?
     Whenever you steal, you run the risk of being
     caught. If caught, the guards will put you in
     jail and take your money. However, the only way
     to get good at something, is to keep practicing!
     To conserve money, use the gold you start with
     before you attempt to steal from a residence.

     What should I buy from the merchants?
     Torches, rope, and perhaps a stronger sword if
     you have the funds available. Be sure and
     compare prices! Not all merchants charge the
     same amount, and most can be haggled down in
     price.

     How much can I haggle?
     It varies from item to item. It will take some
     practice before you discover if you're paying
     the lowest possible price.

     How do I find the Red Dog Tavern?
     Use the map that was included in your Conan
     box. The Red Dog Tavern is marked in the upper
     left quadrant of the map. Head toward the
     north-west side of the city, near the Thieves'
     Guild if you are still having problems locating
     it.

     Where is Taurus?
     By following the map to the Inn of the Veils,
     you will get information of Taurus' whereabouts.
     Be sure you have enough money to bribe the man at
     the Inn of the Veils, for he has a faulty memory
     that only a bribe will help him with. Twenty Gold
     Bezants should be enough to get the information
     from him.

     Where do the underground entrances lead
     throughout the city?
     There is only one underground in Shadizar, lest
     you be confused by which entrance you use to get
     there. Different entrances will bring you to
     different parts of the catacombs, which do not
     necessarily have connecting routes to other
     sections. You may wish to map these areas, as they
     all look very similar.

     The underground is dark!
     We weren't kidding about the torches. If you are
     already underground, go back the way you came and
     buy a few torches.

     Where's the Snake Sword?
     If you head west, then south, then west again from
     the ladder after leaving Taurus' home, you will find
     a door locked with a jade lock. Behind this door is
     the Snake Sword.

     Where do I find the Jade Key?
     Heading west, then north, then east, then up, you
     will find an underground entrance to the towering
     Temple of Set. Head west from there until you find
     a room with a gargoyle statue in it. In the room
     to the left of the statue is the priest who has
     the Jade Key you need.

     How do I kill the priest?
     Using the thrusting swing with the sword, you should
     be able to overcome the priest.

     Where is the Eye of the Serpent?
     After you get the Snake sword, go back to the temple
     where the priest was, only this time head east when
     you come to a room where you must make a choice
     between east or west. Click on the gargoyle statue,
     and enter the room beneath it.

     I'm not even hurting the snake!
     Be certain that you are using the thrusting swing,
     and that you have put to use the Snake Sword by
     clicking on the USE button and then clicking on
     the Snake Sword.




     Episode Two
     ~~~~~~~~~~~
     Now that Conan has completed Episode One, he will find
     himself back at the Red Dog Tavern in Shadizar. Vicarus
     the Sage is waiting for him, telling him of a crypt
     north of the city of Shadizar where a great king was
     mummified and buried. As in the practice of those days,
     the king was buried with some of his greatest treasures.
     Many men have attempted before Conan to retrieve these
     items, but all of the grave robbers have disappeared,
     never to surface again.

     Conan must find his way to the crypt, retrieve the
     King's Sword and Crown, and return to Shadizar. In
     his way stands the mummified king himself, who will
     not part with his possessions without a fight. Even
     retrieving the items is not enough, as the timeworn
     lock has locked Conan inside the crypt, where he
     will surely perish unless he can find a way out!

     Episode Two Questions & Answers
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     How do I get to the Crypt?
     Leave the city of Shadizar by exiting through the
     south or west gate. You will be on a large map with
     an icon of a skeleton north of the city of Shadizar.
     Click on the fist icon, and then click on the
     skeleton icon. Conan will move automatically into
     the crypt.

     I'm locked in the Crypt! How do I get out?
     The ancient lock requires a steel key to exit the
     crypt itself. The mummy in the right room happens
     to have one in his inventory, but you'll have to
     defeat him before he'll give it to you willingly.

     How do I attack the mummy?
     The mummy rests peacefully as long as its
     possessions are left unmolested. Should you take
     any of his treasures, however, he will defend
     them to your death.

     How do I kill the mummy?
     The mummy cannot be brought down with bare
     steel. There are no bones to break, or blood to
     shed, so a mummy fears little. In fact, the only
     adversity a mummy might face is an open flame.

     How do I start a fire to burn the mummy?
     Two objects are hidden in the statues erected
     into the walls: rope and flint & steel. Using
     the flint & steel, you should be able to start
     a fire.

     Where do I find things to burn to help
     start the fire?
     In the first room, there is some dry broken
     decaying wood which should burn rather nicely.

     How do I get the steel key from the mummy?
     Conan is a brave and mighty warrior! Surely he
     doesn't mind getting a few hairs singed while
     he retrieves the key from the mummy! While you're
     getting the steel key, you should also get the
     King's Crown, as it is a very valuable asset to
     have.

     There is a staff in the crypt - should I take it?
     Yes, yes, yes! You never know when a staff might
     come in handy, and it might just save your life.



     Episode Three
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Conan has now successfully completed Episodes One and
     Two! Upon his return to the Red Dog Tavern, he speaks
     to Jalek, who tells him of a tragedy that has occurred:
     Belit has been captured by a wicked Enchantress working
     for Thoth Amon in the Jungle Ruins, and all attempts to
     free her have been in vain. Jalek is understandably
     concerned, as Belit was en route to help the Kushite
     forces, who were battling Thoth Amon. Without her
     leadership, Thoth Amon could win, amassing even more
     power over the land.

     Belit is being held captive by the Enchantress,
     protected by a large monolith which snares
     unsuspecting victims with its power, and holds them
     until the witch kills them at her leisure. Conan must
     find a way past the powerful monolith and destroy the
     Enchantress to rescue her! Beware her power. She's
     more than just a pretty face, and isn't at all what
     she appears to be.

     Episode Three Questions & Answers
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Where is Belit held captive?
     There is a large black monolith on the east side of
     the city. She is shackled near to it. Be wary,
     however, of the Enchantress who is holding Belit
     against her will!

     I keep getting trapped by the monolith!
     The monolith's power centers around metallic objects.
     Before attempting to save Belit, you need to drop all
     of your metallic items so that you are not drawn into
     the power of the monolith.

     Where can I drop my possessions safely?
     There are a few different places you can choose, but
     your possessions are not always safe from molestation.
     Travel to the highest point of the pyramid and you
     will find a safe place to store your items temporarily.

     How do I get up the side of the pyramid?
     There are vines running down the pyramid. You will
     need to climb the pyramid on the right side of it to
     safely traverse to the top.

     What is the Obsidian Sword for?
     Obsidian is black glass that has volcanic origin.
     Because of its non-metallic nature, it is ideal for
     killing the beast which holds Belit captive.

     Should I take the copper key?
     Because time is of the essence, you may not wish
     to search for treasure now, but a key to treasure
     in the future is better than no key at all!


     Episode Four
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~
     After a brief respite from his quest, Conan
     returns to the Red Dog Tavern to find another
     maiden needing his aid. Juma, a kushite warrior
     tells of Princess Zosara of Turan, who was to
     be married to Kujala, the Great Khan of the
     Kuigar nomads. Thoth Amon's agents kidnapped
     her as a bargaining chip to force the King of
     Turan and Kujala into withdrawing their forces
     from attacks on Thoth's territories. Unless she
     is rescued soon, they will have no choice but
     to retreat.

     She was taken to Zamboula, which has no
     entrances directly into the city. Even if Conan
     could manage to get inside the city, there is
     still the matter of finding the princess and
     defeating her captor, a very powerful agent of
     Thoth Amon who has the ability to appear as
     mere vapor no more substantial than the air
     we breathe.


     Episode Four Questions & Answers
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Should I go get the princess, or work on
     getting the treasures left behind in the
     Jungle Ruins?
     Time is of the utmost importance, and it is
     imperative that you save the princess before
     Thoth Amon pressures her father into with-
     drawing his troops. The treasure isn't going
     anywhere, and it can always be found at a
     later date.

     I found a dying man en route to Zamboula!
     How can I help him?
     Unfortunately, by the time you reach the
     dying man, it is much too late to save him.
     Listen to what he has to say, lest the same
     thing should happen to you!

     Does the man have anything I might want?
     The man was a thief, but now that he is dying,
     cosmic justice has willed that he become a
     victim of theft himself. The only object left
     in his possession is a piece of paper.

     Should I take the piece of paper?
     The piece of paper might have something
     important on it! Once you have it, EXAMINE
     it to read its contents. While it may sound
     confusing, it could save your life.

     How do I get into Zamboula?
     Zamboula has no direct entrances. EXAMINE the
     piece of paper you received from the dying
     man. It instructs you to find the odd heads.
     Look closely at the wall of the city and you
     will see two or four heads in each wall
     segment. Keep looking down the side of it
     until you see a section with three heads.
     Here is a secret entrance. Simply walk
     towards the wall at this location.

     How do I get over the open crevices?
     The open crevices are intentional to keep
     you from your goal. You must either find an
     alternate route to get to the same location
     or tunnel deeper into the underground
     passages.

     I am having problems locating the magician!
     You should map the tunnels so that you do
     not wander for hours. To reach the lair of
     the magician, you must go down two levels
     from the underground and then find your way
     back up to the first level of the catacombs
     to get around the open crevice that protects
     the entrance.

     How do I free the princess?
     The princess is held captive by a magician
     who has the ability to turn invisible. The
     bonds she is shackled by are magical and
     can only be removed by the demise of the
     magician who created them.

     How do I kill the invisible magician?
     Wait until the magician is about halfway
     across the room from you. Then USE your
     staff. This will place the staff in a hole
     in the ground which opens a trap door and
     will cause the magician to fall to his death.


     Episode Five
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The final day of confrontation with Thoth Amon
     approaches soon. Thoth Amon's agents are at this
     moment searching for Thoth Amon's Ring of Power,
     stolen by thieves years previously. To triumph
     over Thoth Amon, it is imperative that Conan find
     the ring before he does.

     To find the ring, Conan must visit Morhan, the
     sage, who is rumored to be the greatest scholar
     of the land. Morhan will tell Conan to search
     Larsha for a map to the ring. Once Conan has
     the map, he must find a way inside the Inner
     City where the Ring is hidden in the palace.
     Inside the palace, Conan must fight off the
     guards, locate the ring, and return it to Akado.

     Episode Five Questions & Answers
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Where is Morhan the Sage?
     Head southeast from the Red Dog Tavern. A large
     building by itself with a door in the center is
     the location you seek.

     How do I kill the lizardmen in Larsha?
     Like the snake that guarded the Eye of the
     Serpent, the Lizardmen require a special sword
     to defeat. This special sword is the only sword
     strong enough to get through their tough skin.

     Where is the Lizard Sword?
     The Lizard sword is in the city of Larsha where,
     naturally, the Lizardmen are. You will need to
     move cautiously, but quickly, to its location
     carefully avoiding the Lizard men. If one of
     the dreaded large reptiles should spot you, exit
     the Scene Level by clicking on the left most margin.
     However, doing so will not cause the Lizardmen
     to stop pursuing you, so you will need to run
     quickly.

     How do I find the Lizard Sword?
     Buy a map of Larsha from a Chartmaker in
     Shadizar. The location of the Lizard Sword is
     marked on this map.

     Where is the Marble key?
     There is a Marble key next to the map which
     leads to Thoth Amon's Ring of Power.

     Should I get the Marble key?
     The marble key might lead to something else
     you need! Never drop a key unless you have
     already used it and no longer need it!

     I got the map, now where?
     Go back to the city of Shadizar and EXAMINE
     the map to see where Thoth Amon's ring has
     been hidden. The map will show the location
     of the building where the ring is hidden
     along with Conan's current location, if he
     is in the general area.

     How do I get past the guards in the Inner
     City?
     The guards will attack you upon sight, so
     you must find an alternate route past the
     guards. The only way into the city is to
     follow the wall. To get on the top of the
     wall, use either a teleport spell, or climb
     the ladder on the northern wall.

     Where is the ring in the palace?
     You must search for the ring. Check every
     room, every doorway, and even things that
     don't look like they could be hiding
     anything. The ring is inside a hidden room,
     so do not leave any stone unturned.


     Episode Six
     ~~~~~~~~~~~
     Conan has managed to find Thoth Amon's ring
     of power in the Governor's Palace and has
     returned it to Akado. Akado finds to his
     great dismay that the inscriptions on the
     ring, which  tell of its power and how to
     harness it, are beyond his understanding.

     To complete this quest, you must retrieve
     the Scrolls of Skelos, hidden somewhere in
     the Scriptorium of Larsha. Not only are the
     Scrolls hidden away, they are guarded by a
     demon made solely of iron, indestructible
     and unstoppable with the aid of Thoth Amon's
     magic. Legend has it neither man nor beast
     can triumph over this demon. Conan must
     somehow outwit the Iron Demon and retrieve
     the Scrolls of Skelos. Then, he must return
     them to Akado to unleash the power of Thoth
     Amon's ring.

     Episode Six Questions & Answers
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     I go to Larsha and the Iron Demon kills me!
     The Iron Demon cannot be killed with steel
     alone. You must find a way to destroy or
     trap him before he kills you.

     I still can't kill the iron demon!
     Do you expect all the answers handed to
     you on a silver platter? Think back to
     something that might attract metal!

     I led the Iron Demon to the monolith,
     but I got ensnared and I died too!
     The Iron Demon can be caught at a greater
     distance from the monolith than you
     considering he is made entirely of metal.
     And the monolith has tremendous magnetism.
     Do not run straight for the monolith when
     you enter the Jungle Ruins. Run close
     enough that you are not trapped, and wait
     for magic against magic to work in your
     favor.

     Okay, I trapped the Iron Demon! Now
     where's the Scroll of Skelos?
     Go back to Larsha and locate the Scriptorium.
     You will need to have your Lizard Sword ready
     to defend yourself against the Lizardmen. Once
     you find the Scroll of Skelos, you have
     completed this Episode.

     Where is the Scriptoruim?
     North of the northern city wall. You must
     find a way past this wall.

     I can't get past the wall!
     Try climbing ladders and travelling on top
     of the wall until you come to another ladder
     you can use to get down.


     Episode Seven
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The final battle is now about to take place.
     It will not be an easy one, although Conan
     is protected by the Ring of Power and Akado's
     magic, he must still defeat the numerous
     subjects foolishly willing to die for the vile
     Thoth Amon. Enter the palace of Tarantia and
     unleash Conan's will for vengeance to it's
     fullest potential. Only then will Conan
     possess the inner strength to defeat the
     murderer of his wife and friends.

     Episode Seven Questions & Answers
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     What items should I take with me to Thoth
     Amon's Palace?
     All the foes you've encountered so far will
     be in Thoth Amon's palace. Therefore, some
     good items to take are:  The King mummy's
     Crown, some White Lotus to help Conan's
     strength, an Enchanted or Gold Sword to fight
     ordinary foes, a Snake Sword to kill any wild
     snakes, a Lizard Sword to destroy lizardmen,
     the Horn of Valhalla (if you have it), the
     Staff of Power (if you have it), the Freeze
     Amulet, the Ruby Amulet, the Emerald Amulet,
     flint and steel, and rope to be sure you have
     a way of exiting from pits.

     There are keys on the ground, but my pack
     is full!
     You're going to have to make several decisions
     throughout Thoth Amon's Palace about what to
     keep and what to leave behind. Take one key at
     a time and discard it after you use it.

     How do I defeat the Giant Snake without
     a Snake Sword?
     The Snake Sword was made specifically to kill
     reptillian enemies. However, any sword will
     do damage against the snake. Before going
     into battle with the Giant Snake, make sure
     you have a White Lotus to restore your stamina.

     What about the Lizard man? I don't have the
     Lizard Sword!
     Same idea as before: give yourself a small boost
     and stay persistent. Not using the Lizard Sword
     means it will take you longer to defeat your foe.

     There are mummies here!
     You have a choice with mummies: You can burn
     them using either some flint & steel, or the
     Ruby Amulet.

     How do I defeat the Iron Demons?
     Just like the demon guarding the Scrolls of
     Skelos, these demons are completely indestructible.
     You have no magnetic monolith to aid you now, so
     your best bet is to avoid the Iron Demons. Should
     you encounter any, run for your life, for that is
     exactly what you're fighting for.

     The Elite Guard keeps killing me!
     You need a very strong and powerful sword, such
     as the King's Sword or Enchanted sword. If you
     find you still cannot defeat this foe, use the
     magic of the Staff of Power or the Horn of
     Valhalla.

     How do I defeat the Priest of Set?
     Conan's only hope of survival is the Emerald
     Amulet, Staff of Power or Horn of Valhalla to
     kill the Priest.

     How do I get past the living statue?
     Use the Freeze Amulet to return the statue
     to its stationary form.

     What good is the throne?
     Search the throne to find an alternate path.

     How I do kill Thoth Amon?
     You cannot kill Thoth Amon. The only way to
     hurt him, is to hurt that which keeps him
     alive: his heart. You must find his heart
     in another room and destroy it.

     How do I break Thoth Amon's heart?
     Tell him you had a great time and you'll
     talk to him soon and then never call. That'll
     work. Otherwise, use a sword to break the
     protective glass jar which houses his heart.
     Once you have done this, Thoth Amon's evil
     presence will be removed from the land of
     Hyborea once and for all, and you will have
     earned your right to be King of Aquilonia, as
     well as fulfilled your internal quest to
     avenge the deaths of your wife and townfolk.


                         Minor Quests
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The Gem of Sight
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Conan is given the task of locating the Gem of Sight.
     A wealthy merchant bought the Gem from some members
     of the Thieves' Guild who stole it from Crom's Temple.
     Legend has it that this merchant lives in a secluded
     place in the Merchant's Quarter. If you return the
     gem to Crom's Temple, you will be rewarded greatly.

     How do I find which room the merchant lives in?
     Head west along the southern wall of the city of
     Shadizar. You must pass several entrances until you
     find a large building with a door in its center. Go
     just past this. Now you must use a teleport spell to
     gain entrance to the roof. Inside the room on the
     roof is a street tough who will defend his master's
     valuable gem to his death.

     I have the gem, what should I do with it?
     Taking the gem to a jeweler will only get you
     one-third of the amount of gold Crom's Temple
     will give you. On the other hand, the gem is
     used like a mapping device centered around
     its owner, so you may wish to keep it for
     yourself. Try using it, then decide.


     The Amulet of the Undead
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     A tavern owner in the city of Shadizar will
     tell Conan of the Amulet of the Undead. It
     can be used to destroy undead foes, which
     Conan would find rather useful. Although
     the owner gripes that only a fool would
     attempt to find the Amulet, he is willing
     to give a map to Conan to aid his journey.

     Where is the Amulet of the Undead?
     Under Shadizar, lies a labyrinth of tunnels
     and catacombs. Close to the green arrow is a
     door which houses the Amulet.

     The Door is locked!
     Of course the door is locked! What kind of
     protection against thieves would an unlocked
     door be? Go back up to Shadizar, buy a brass
     key from a locksmith and try again.

     What will the Amulet do for me?
     Once safely in Conan's possession, the Amulet
     will destroy all undead creatures in a
     confrontation, keeping Conan safe from harm.


     The Wizard's Gold
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     If Conan bribes the owner in the Dead Crow
     Inn, he will be told that two years ago a
     great and powerful wizard named Anor died,
     leaving his treasure behind. It was rumored
     to be hidden someplace accessible only by
     magical means. Legend has it the treasure
     is worth twenty-five hundred Gold Bezants.

     Without a map to the treasure, how will I
     find it?
     The treasure is very well hidden in the
     underground, and only a brave and persistent
     man will be able to successfully locate it.

     I'm looking for it, but not finding it!
     Remember, the innkeeper said it could only
     be accessed using magic! Look for a room
     that has no obvious entrances.

     How do I get to the location?
     You will need to use a teleport spell to get
     there and back. So be sure you have two uses
     available before you use one.

     The door is locked! I need a golden key!
     Conan should always keep a few keys on him!
     Go back to Shadizar and buy a golden key.


     Emerald Amulet
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The wearer of this Amulet has protection against
     any priests who attempt to use harmful magic
     against them. Working almost like a mirror, it
     reflects magic back unto the attacker. You are
     told of this magical item by a Priest at Ishtar's
     temple in Shadizar. The Amulet is rumored to be
     hidden at the top of the Temple of Set.

     Where is Ishtar's Temple?
     Just south of the Bazaar in the Merchant's Quarter
     you will find a temple door. This is Ishtar's
     Temple.

     How do I get to the top of the Temple of Set?
     The only way to the top of the Temple is to go
     inside and climb, or teleport. Since you are a
     rogue and not welcome in the Temple, the wisest
     choice is to use a teleport spell to reach the
     very top. Go inside the building and retrieve
     the Emerald Amulet, and then teleport down.
     Be certain you have at least two uses of the
     teleport spell to get there and return.

     Should I return the Emerald Amulet or keep it?
     Returning the Amulet to its rightful owners will
     yield Conan a great reward. On the other hand,
     all the money in Hyborea cannot protect Conan
     the way the Amulet can. Try it out, you can
     always return it later.



     The Staff of Power
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The holiest relic of the Temple of Adonis,
     the Staff of Power was stolen! Because it
     is underground, no one has yet been able
     to retrieve it. In the hands of Thoth
     Amon, it is a very dangerous weapon, as
     it will kill all opponents within a
     specfic radius.

     How do I get the Staff of Power?
     Get to the underground using one of the
     secret tunnels inside residences.

     Where should I go underground?
     To get as close as possible to the location
     of the Staff of Power, enter through a
     secret tunnel in a residence near the
     cursed Temple of Set.

     Should I keep the Staff of Power?
     The Staff would definitely be helpful against
     foes that could potentially defeat Conan.
     However, as Conan is not a skilled magic
     user, his ability to use the Staff of Power
     is limited to one time - at which time, it
     will destroy the Staff of Power completely.



     The Thieves' Guild's Gold
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Bribing owners of various inns in Shadizar will
     net the following story: The Thieves' Guild hides
     all their stolen treasures underground in a locked
     chamber that is guarded. Attempts at gaining
     entrance to the Thieves' Guild have all been in
     vain, and it is rumored only a fool would even
     try.

     How do I get underground?
     A good entrance to use to the underground is the
     residence just east of the Temple of Set.

     What should I bring with me?
     Torches are a definite must. A few teleport spells
     wouldn't be a bad choice, either. Since the door
     of the chamber is locked, you'd best visit a
     locksmith and pick up a few keys.

     Where should I look in the underground?
     In the north-west of the underground, you will find
     several doors in a row.

     How do I know which door?
     Unfortunately, Conan was not granted telepathic
     powers. Look for a locked door, however, and not
     an open one.

     The door needs a golden key! I didn't bring one
     with me!
     What kind of thief are you? You'll need to go
     back up to the City Level of Shadizar and find
     a merchant who will sell you a golden key.

     I can't find a merchant to sell me a golden key!
     While his reputation does not include having the
     best prices in town, there is a broker in the
     southwest most building. Of course, first you'll
     have to get past the guards...

                     & [RYGAR] !
