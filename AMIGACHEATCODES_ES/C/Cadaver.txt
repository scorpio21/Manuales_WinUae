                                 CADAVER

Sorry, So far there's no solution for level two, but all the rest
are here!

LEVEL 1
The caves lie beneath the castle and contain many distinct areas; the mines,
the mortuary, the gaol, the crypts, the chapel and the king's tomb. A secret
opening onto the marsh has allowed Karadoc to gain access unobserved.  Karadoc
starts in the old mine workings and is seeking the route up to the next level
of the castle. In the first room, collect the pickaxe, coin and diary, then go
north.Pull the lever (this unlocks the north door) and leave through the north
door.  Collect the sack of stones that is on the floor (weapon) and go west. 
Kill the spiny creature and then collect the charm; head south. Collect the
runic stone that is on the ground, kill the spider that drops from the ceiling
and exit north twice.  There are several sacks in this room, and if you move
them you will discover a gem;collect the gem, kill the worm and exit south. Go
east twice and then south to get to the main chamber, and once there collect
the rope on top of the barrel (the barrel is filled with stamina restoring
potion) and head east twice.  Collect the key in this room and then make your
way back to the room you started from.  Head east from here this time into the
next room and pull the lever that is there.  Make your way back to the main
chamber and go through the now unlocked southern door. The passage you are now
in is blocked by a large wall, but don't worry, just simply keep on throwing
the pickaxe at the wall until it is completely destroyed, and then exit by the
south door. Search the skeleton in the corridor, and take the clue book that
appears. Go east; you are now at map point A.  This corridor has four buttons
on the northern wall.  These unlock the door to the dragon room if pressed in
the right order (1432, the left button equals one),although you won't be going
there right away.  Once you1've pressed the buttons go north, and then west to
where the well is, take the key that is hidden under the bones, and leave
again.  Go west into the stores, open the chest and take all the contents
(coin, chicken and bread).  Go east, and then north into the gaol. Collect the
coin on the table, use the key on the keyhole in the west wall and go north
into cell one. Exit south straightaway and kill the monster that has appeared,
then go into the next cell. There is a man present in this cell and giving him
food will provide you with some handy clues; exit south afterwards.  Go east
into cell three and exit west. Head east into cell four, collect the key, exit
west.  Now return to map point A, and head east from there. Collect the green
gem and hit the button on the wall to lift the cover in the Cadaver store. 
Read the book to find out what you're meant to do with the gems and the pit,
then go north into the Cadaver store. Drop the rope down the hole in  the 
centre  of the room and then fall down the pit.  Walk over to the rat  and 
open  it  to reveal a key for the east door, collect the other  key  that  is 
on  the  floor,  open the chest and collect the urn that was inside.  Go east
twice into a small room. Collect all the gems (you should now have six) and go
back to the main pit room that you entered through the hole. Throw each of the
six gems into the water and you should be teleported to map point B (this is a
bit confusing as when you leave via door E you will be moved to map point F). 
From here go east into the embalming room.  Search the skeleton to find a
hidden key (touching the other corpse will disturb a monster).  After getting
the key go north into the balm store.  There are several potions in this room
on a ledge; cure poison (unknown), shot shield, stamina (red cross), poison
(acrid). Drink or collect the ones you want.  The key on the floor is for the
keyhole in the west wall which reveals three spiders and is not necessary. Go
back into the embalming room and then head east into the purifactory. Take the
learn potion spell and the giant jump potion (frogskin),then go west and south
to the offal store, although this contains nothing of value. Return to the
corridor with the row of buttons (w,w,w,w); from here exit south, but be ready
with the bag of stones so that you can kill the hopping brain.  Insert the key
(skeleton) into the keyhole and continue south. Go west twice to the mourning
room and kill the hopping brain that is on the table (not too hard considering
it's asleep), then take both the holy water flasks and the charm before going
south.  There is another brain to kill in this room, however, this one is
awake, but if you're quick enough you should be OK.  Collect the key that is
left after you've destroyed the brain, then go west and north to the Royal
Armoury. Pick up the bronze armour, the sword, the red striped shield and the
bronze helmet.  Now exit south and west into the ante room.  Press the button
on the wall (without the armour that you collected this will not work) and you
will be transported to the king's secret treasury.  Take the crown, the coins
and the charm and then pull the lever to go back to the ante room. Head south
and open the chest with the key you got from the brain and take the contents
(meat and coin).  Return to the mourning room and exit east into the passage,
then east again and south.  You should now be in the first room of the chapel. 
Two bugs are wandering around, but they can be easily avoided.  Put out the
flames in the bowls by jumping on them (this unlocks the east door), then go
east three times to the common crypt. Collect the key on the alter (revealed
when the urn smashes), push the four stones off the other alter to reveal a
dispel trap spell and a canister of experience (open the canister,and take the
spell).  Exit east into the shrine. Collect the money and the bag of stones
then return to the common crypt. Go south into the glutton's shrine and throw
the joint of meat onto the shrine to be rewarded with a super fast potion. 
Take it and go back to the common crypt and head through the west door then
north into the lesser crypt.  Under the pile of stones there is a runic stone
(spell); take this then south and north to the priest's crypt. While standing
on the alter search the large urn to reveal a charm and a worm. Take the charm
and and go south twice to the warrior's crypt.  Drop the gold funerary coin
onto the tomb of Kazah, and then collect the potion (fire shield;save this for
the dragon).  Go north again (you will have seen these two rooms when you were
teleported from the pit), and cast a dispel trap on the chest.  Open the chest
and collect the charm and urn.  Return to the first room of the chapel and go
south.  Avoid the bug and drop the urn of Lord Carolus onto the alter of Lord
Carolus and collect the spell that appears (massacre:unknown and unusable till
known.  Save this for the dragon).  Exit south to the inner sanctum, and west
into the crematorium.  Place the urn of Ragnar the chief alchemist onto the
appropriate slab, collect the flask of blood and return to the inner sanctum.
Drop the blood on the high alter, collect the key and the spell (read magic),
use the key in the keyhole in the west wall, then go west. Cast dispel trap on
the chest, then open it and take the runic stone (read language).  Head north
into the library, collect the spell (map) and return to the inner sanctum. 
Drop the unknown spell that you found earlier and cast read magic upon it; 
this will allow you to use it to kill the dragon. Now go south and west into
the purifactory. Drop a flask of holy water into the bowl and then drink it;
this will teleport you into a hidden treasure chamber.  Pull the lever and
collect the reward, pull the lever again to be teleported back to the room
adjacent to the purifactory.  Repeat this as many times as you have flasks of
holy water. Having got the massacre spell, the fire protection and the king's
crown you are now fully equipped to face the dragon.  Go back to the passage
with the four buttons and go west into the dragon room.  Drink the fire shield
potion to protect you from the fireballs, hold the massacre potion and press
fire to cast it ridding you of the troublesome monster.  Press the button on
the wall, exit north, pull the lever, and thats level one completed!

Room TWICE; lever ==> E; use Giant Jump to reach upper platform ==> Immortal
Potion + four Gambling Tokens.
SOUTH PASSAGE:  I use the Immortal Potion to jump over the spikes and pull
the lever to remove the spikes (maybe you should build a pile to help you
jump over and save the Immortal Potion for somewhere like the Fire Pit? -
though I suspect they are just teasing and you are supposed to have to use it
straight away!); the N door leads to the Central Hall - you MAY get a key for
it later (K7) by gambling - you don't need it - don't go that way.

RESTING CHAMBER (via W pit):  Pile the bones on the chest and jump on them to
reach the lever ==> key (probably for this door - but it unlocks before you
can use it - you don't need this key); Eternal Rest Potion (for Thief);
Sweaty Potion - this is Strength - use it to move the bars to leave the room;
wait and the doors will eventually unlock.  As you enter the Great Pit you
should find a Fizzy Potion (Stamina).  Return up stairs to Malladin's Pits.
GREAT PIT (via S pit):  Push scroll into doorway to prevent plant growth
there; get gold and wait; door will eventually unlock; jump over roots to
leave; Dispel Trap Spell.
INNER PIT:  Leave quickly; return up stairs to Malladin's Pits.
FIRE PIT:  If you walk the right pattern you cause one of the rods to
disappear so that you fall through - maybe this is where you should use the
Immortal Potion?  I cheat and enter from below on the way back from the Great
Pit - if you take a couple of hits and go out again then you will get the
goodies on your exit; Unlock Door Spell, Mind Blast Spell, Bless Potion
Spell.
(Alternative: go in from below and cover each of the jets!)
UPPER CHAMBER:  The W door is for returning to the NE Solar if you fall down
a pit early in the game and manage to press all four buttons or control your
fall so that you land in the Great Pit; you can't open it if it is locked.
SOUTH EAST HALL:  Cast Dispel Evil to make the Demon vulnerable then kill him
with Magic Missiles or Shuriken; Cast Unlock Door ==> N.
LEARNED HALL (S):  Search Lever - DON'T pull it yet.

D = Down, M = Middle, U = Up, - set the levers to the following positions
(from left to right)
D, U, M, U ==> First Light

SYMBOLIST'S HALL (W):  Do east hall first to create button; press button ==>

SEALED CHAMBER:  Symbols Planet (not really sure how this room works -
sometimes there are bars in the way - if you go in early and don't take any
other planets with you then you should be OK!).
QUADRATIC:  Sandy Planet; move strongbox to second tile from the right on N
wall; jump on it; jump up to touch tile '4 along and 5 up' ==> Small Planet.
DIANOS'S LIBRARY:  Search Drape ==> ** K8 **; Unknown Spell (it is Unlock

Read Language on Book to discover numbers to use in Learned Hall (M).  Search
Lever - DON'T pull it yet.
SIDE CHAMBER:  Drop off stairs to reach lever; search Lever - DON'T pull it
yet; don't take black coin - it is cursed and will destroy some of your gold.
TOP OF STAIRS:  Use K8 to open chest ==> Read Magic Spell, Map Spell.
QUEEN'S LIBRARY:  Cast Unlock Chest ==> Glowing Planet.
WISDOM'S HALL:  Moon Planet; search Lever - DON'T pull it yet; the planks are
for use in the East Passage.
EAST PASSAGE:  K9 unlocks W door; the planks help you get across the
electrified floor; it only leads to the Central Hall so there are plenty of
easier routes!
UPPER ROOM:  Search Lever - DON'T pull it yet; drop planets in holes:
        Glowing Planet in nearest hole to door;
        Small Planet in nearest hole to centre;
        Symbols Planet in furthest hole from door;
        Moon Planet in last hole ==> planets are now in correct places in
Planetarium.
PLANETARIUM:  Drop planets from Upper Room to correct places ==> switch on
Globe ==> 2 GOLD KEYS (you should have FOUR now); search Lever - DON'T pull
it yet; if you want ** K9 **, go back to Upper Room and drop Sandy Planet in
any hole then come back here and press the button on the Void.
LEARNED HALL (N):  North Door: you should have now found six levers marked
with a letter; pull them to spell DIANOS; this lever (marked 'DIANOS') will
then open the North Door.

(Take any route to the Central Hall - the North Passage is the easiest and
you can now pick up the sack of gold from there).
CENTRAL HALL:  Cast Dispel Evil to make the Demons vulnerable; kill them -
the 3x100 Mind Blast is especially effective!  You need four GOLD KEYS plus
the number from the Thief.  The keys are; two in Planetarium; one in South
Chamber; one in Kitchen.  Search keyholes to discover their numbers; use keys
in the order 1432 ==> LEVEL FIVE

LEVEL FIVE
GREAT TOWER:  Get Marble; leave quickly!
NORTH BRIDGE:   Marble; walk on every tile until you find the one that creates
the Skull; insert Marbles in Skull ==> E door in Ward Room unlocks. WARD ROOM: 
Get Acid and Blood; leave quickly; the S door only opens from the other side,
much later. HELM'S BRIDGE:  Pull first lever; walk to middle; drop your diary
behind you; pull the second lever; the monster cannot touch you if you dropped
your diary in the right place - it will push you and your diary along; walk
back and press the button ==> Strength Potion; pull third lever when the
monsters are at the far end to seal them off; retrieve your diary; the door E
unlocks automatically. HELM'S VIEW:  Emerald; ignore the bars and lever - you
will find out later what they do! GREAT CHAMBER:  Dispel Trap Spell, Cure
Poison Potion; caskets (on pillar tops) contain Dispel Trap Spell, Ruby,
Amethyst, Tiger's Eye; you have to teleport to the pillar tops from the East
Cellar and jump quickly around them to get both caskets; use Strength to drag
the blocks away from the E door -it is unlocked by the lever in the Separator.
CELLAR STAIR:  Orb of Kamul - you will learn later that it is strengthened by
picking up Gems - make sure you get them all! The lever is for smashing things
with the 'nutcracker'. SOUTH CELLAR:  Ignore it -you will discover its purpose
later! MAIN CELLAR:  You need the Blood Key to open the W door - this comes
much later; Bless Potion Spell, Urn; smash the Urn with the nutcracker in the
Cellar Stair ==> Emerald. GREAT CELLAR:  Magic Missile Spells. EAST CELLAR: 
Immortal Potion (save this for the endgame!), Cure Poison, two Stamina Potions
- but you can only have one - the 20x10 is much better as it can be Blessed to
make a 20x50!  Stand on skull; throw blood at Pentagram ==> Teleport to top of
pillars in Great Chamber. EAST PASSAGE:  Get all the Gems; avoid the Teleport
Tiles (the East side of the passage is safe apart from the last tile but one).
SEPARATOR:  Use the small item (e.g. Emerald)to push all the bombs to the side
(east and west) - you can then walk around safely; use key on keyhole ==> S;
pull lever ==> E Door in Great Chamber unlocks - go back there now! OUBLIETTE: 
Search Skull ==> Token, Tiger's Eye. HIGH PASSAGE: Pull middle lever to create
a keyhole in the Sea Watch; go to the far top corner to start the monster
moving, but get out the way quickly; keep jumping from stair to high ledge and
over the gap to get Gems;eventually you will also get a key for the Sea Watch.
AXEL'S LEAP:  I usually walk round to the items; push them out of the way and
stand in the middle; jump when the monsters approach and you should take
minimal damage - they back off again; pick up the items and get out quickly. A
pile of bones on the other side of the pit can be used to leap on top of the
items and reduce the damage when you jump; Orb, gold. SEA WATCH:  Spider
Poison, gold;if you pulled the right levers in the High Passage you can use it
to go W. AXEL'S FALL:  Insert Emeralds in Skull by standing on edge of first
floor board; jump over pit. BOKSON'S HALL:  (Nasty) DON'T pull the LOWER lever
until you have USED the Spider's Key - It destroys the Key! Pull Upper Lever;
jump down lift holes; drop Spider Poison on floor ==> Spider dies and leaves
Spider's Key; go down again and get Key-jump back on lift quickly and go back
up; use Spider's Key in keyhole to unlock W door.  Get Lead and gold from
chest; go down; pull lower lever to remove bars.  The other lower lever is to
activate the lift on your return journey. VOID:  Water Potion and gold in the
air - ignore them - they will fall automatically on your way back later; make
sure you find THREE exits - N, W(N), W(S). NORTH OF VOID:  Magic Shield Potion,
gold; stand on strongbox to press button ==> Ruby. LORD'S VIEW:  Solve'Numeric
Riddles for Beginners' ==> 741 ==> S. SIDE ROOM:  Lever activates buttons on
Lord's Watch (but not until you have been there!); the key for the chest is in
the Lord's Watch (just gold), however by the time you have got the key the
chest will have fallen down a pit - don't worry it is now in the Great Cellar
and you will be passing it later. LORD'S WATCH:  Now that you have visited it
you can go back and pull the lever in the Side Room to activate the buttons;
press buttons ==> Chest Key (for chest in Side Room), Bridge Key, Casket - you
must carry this with you; the Bowl is for later use. GREAT BRIDGE:  Insert
Rubies in Skull; insert Bridge Key in Keyhole; insert Token in Slot ==> W.WEST
WARD:  Use Strength to move the board a little to the side then push it allthe
way along so that you can jump on to it and reach both the lever and the door;
lever ==> N; Gems, Amethyst. MAGNUS'S WARD:  The Casket you carried here from
the Lord's Watch will now open, you should go back to the Lord's Watch NOW.
LORD'S WATCH (second visit):  Open the casket ==> Lead; drop Acid and TWO Lead
in Bowl ==> unlocks N door from High Parapet. HIGH PARAPET:  Use GOLD in
previous room to unlock N; lever ==> lift; jump up; read book; jump over next
section of ledge; Stamina Potion (5x200!). INNER WATCH:  2 Jades, Blood, Gems,
Green Casket, Red Casket, Key; the Key is for this Keyhole (E) but you
shouldn't need it; DON'T attempt to take the Green Casket East.CALIBAN'S VIEW:
 Blood Key - this is for the West Door in the Main Cellar - yes you have to go
all the way back!  BUT FIRST -you must go back to the Inner Watch and pull the
lever, this will remove the block on the East Door - you are going to teleport
back here and use it. On the way back to the Main Cellar make sure you pick up
the Red and Green Caskets from the Inner Watch,all the stuff from the Void and
the gold (if you want it)from the Chest in the Great Cellar. CALIBAN'S CELLAR:
 Jet; press button ==> Banish Spell; stand on skull; throw Blood at Pentagram
==> Teleport back to Caliban's View - the sole purpose of that who;le exercise
was to get the Green Casket through the E door of the Inner Watch!  If you
pulled the lever on the Inner Watch you can now go E. INNER WARD:  Petrify
Spell; the cellar has moved to here! OPEN BRIDGE:  Pull lever ==> N.  You can
now go back to the North Bridge (the second room on this level) and you will
discover new stairs leading to a New Cellar! NEW CELLAR (from North Bridge): 
Dispel Magic Spell, Jet, Gems. AXEL'S STAND:  Orb; press button ==> Gems;
insert Opals ==> E. (What! No Opals? Smash the Orbs with the nutcracker in the
new conveniently close cellar!) LAST WATCH:  Better do a SAVE here!  Use the
Immortal Potion to cross, but don't take it with you - drop it here so that
when you come round again you can cross again. LAST BRIDGE:  Insert Jets;
insert Tiger's Eyes; insert Turquoise; (careful timing to reach skulls). What!
No Turquoise? that is because neither of them exists - you have to create them
- one is by Casting Petrify on the Water Potion from the Void; the other is
made by Casting Dispel Magic on one of the Power Gems in the Ward Room (I did
warn you to save before crossing the Last Watch!). GUARD POST:  You could use
an Immortal Potion to stop this Skull draining your Stamina - but I use it for
other purposes.  You have to let this Skull drain you down to less than 10
Stamina, then insert the Bloodstones ==> E; the 5x200 Stamina Potion from the
High Parapet is useful at this point! What! No Bloodstones?  They are actually
the Jades from the Inner Watch -if you put a Jade in the Green Casket you will
find a Bloodstone in the Red Casket! (Now you know why you went to all that
trouble to get the Green Casket through the Inner Watch door - it won't let
Bloodstones through either!) INNER CHAMBER:  DROP EVERYTHING DIANOS'S LAIR: Go
straight through the Middle Door -you are not yet powerful enough to challenge
Dianos; you will fall through the Great Cellar with some more Gems; get them
all; return to Inner Chamber getting the Immortal Potion on the way. INNER
CHAMBER (second visit):  Put the Immortal Potion, Banish Spell and Kamul's Orb
in the Strongbox - they will teleport to the Strongbox in Dianos's Lair.
DIANOS'S LAIR (second visit):  Retrieve your possessions from the Strongbox.
Wait for Dianos to appear.  To defeat Dianos you need to cast both Mindblast
AND Banish.  The Mindblast must be powered up by the Gems - you DON'T need to
have found them ALL.  To cast Banish you must be touching Dianos which drains
your Stamina unless you have a dose of Immortal Potion left. If your Orb is at
power 245 (the highest I got) then Mindblast, touch Dianos, ONE Banish is
sufficient.  If your orb id down to 189 (the most I could get without going
through the Middle door on the first visit to the Lair) then it is too weak -
you need more Gems.  If the Orb is at 195 then Mindblast, touch Dianos, TEN
Banishes will defeat him - but you probably need the Immortal Potion to touch
him for that long. (Once he is dead, just take the head and leave via the
middle door.)
