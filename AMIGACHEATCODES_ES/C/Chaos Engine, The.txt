 TIPS:

 Play the game until you come to world 1-4 and collect the Party Power
 up icon. This will last for five seconds. Before the countdown has
 expired you must double back to the entrance in the forest, at which
 point you will be awarded with Party Power for the rest of the game.

 General Playing Guide:

 When you start out, use the map (if available) as often as possible as
 it may reveal secret rooms. It's also useful for finding out what a set
 of keys do. Use it before you pick them up and then again afterwards.
 Try to collect all the silver keys that you can as they open up the
 exit route and can make other vital objects appear. Gold keys open up
 secret rooms or bonus areas. They also have a habit of disappearing if
 left alone for too long. If you pick up one set they may make the
 others disappear, so  don't worry if you can't find them.
 Bonus rooms often contain tough monsters, so don't tackle them until
 you're more experienced.

 If a level has more than one exit, try to make your way to the one
 with the higher letter. The higher the letter, the better the starting
 position will be on the next level. You'll need cash to power the
 players up. Pick it up as soon as the monsters drop it, as it quickly
 disappears. When you get to the equipment stage buy weapon power-ups
 and extra lives for yourself and intelligence for the computer player.
 Extra lives are awarded for every 7000 points.

 Finally, not everything is as it seems. Bonus/secret areas may be
 concealed behind walls/hedges and can be accessed simply by shooting
 the obstruction. Also, some monster generators are actually warps to
 secret areas - if you kill the monsters and the generator remains,
 then try jumping into it.
