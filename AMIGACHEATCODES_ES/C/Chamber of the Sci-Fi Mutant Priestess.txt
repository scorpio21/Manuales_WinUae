Chamber of the sci-fi mutant priestess
--------------------------------------

You don't have to complete all five Ordeals. Instead, go into the tunnels
(from The Noose) and wait an hour. Then leave the tunnels and go to The
Master's Eye. Wait around until The Master dies. Search his body for the
whistle. Use it and a panel will open up. Reach Inside and grab the egg.
