 PLAYING TIPS:

 On the first mission of every level take the SU-25 Frogfoot loaded fully
 with Maverick missiles. Fly over all the terrain destroying every SAM and
 anti-aircraft site. This makes the following missions easier and safer.
 After destroying all the SAM and anti-aircraft sites, take the Harrier up
 with one drop tank and 2 x 2,000lbs bombs. Watch for any enemy aircraft
 taking off to locate SPUDD's aircraft base. Once located, use the Harrier
 to destroy the runway. Now the SPUDD aircraft are grounded, before you
 start any missions take a fighter plane up, and destroy those in the air.
 This should leave you with total air supremacy enabling you to complete
 the missions unhindered.
 Persevere. If you don't complete a mission try again. It really feels
 good on the last level when you see the SPUDD base go up in roaring
 flames.

 Secret Tips
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you fly at a high altitude along a straight line, in every frame there
 is a one in eight hundred thousand chance of a UFO appearing. This means
 once every five and a half hours. But if one does appear the aliens are
 so embarrassed about accidentally shooting you out of the sky that they
 give you one of their planes with some pretty impressive statistics -
 extremely high manoeuverability, a chain gun with six times the power and
 a 32,000 pound payload under each wing.
 The chances of one appearing on the CD version is one in a million.

 Also, if you manage to bomb Stonehenge, you will be cursed by the Druids
 and it will be cloudy for ever.
