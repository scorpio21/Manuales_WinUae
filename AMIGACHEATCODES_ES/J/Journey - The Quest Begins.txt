                JOURNEY
                -------

Outside of a store,what a perfect place to begin a game, oh well you might
as well ENTER and LOOK AROUND. EXAMINE MAP and REPLY to storekeeper, it
does'nt appear to worth be it but you might as well BUY MAP along with the
FOOD. EXIT and PROCEED. ENTER the tavern EXAMINE CUSTOMERS and of course
LOOK AROUND. Not much here so EXIT. You will be approached by a somewhat
unsavoury looking character who will ask to join your party,you can GET
ADVICE but for your party's sake ACCEPT or suffer the consequences later.Now
that MINAR has joined your party you may PROCEED.

Now that you have left Lavos, you have two paths to follow, but being as
Minar is with you he might as well SCOUT. As suspected there are bandits
lying in wait on the LEFT path so go RIGHT. Minar should now SCOUT again and
discover a cairn. Praxix should first EXAMINE the BODIES to discover some
essences, examining the CAIRN is of no great value. PROCEED. Once again
Minar should SCOUT the area, FOLLOW SMOKE this will lead you to a hut.
KNOCK. Inside you will find a hermit reply to his ravings by telling the
TRUTH. Two things should be done here the first of which is for Praxix to
EXAMINE HERMIT, this will reveal who he is. The second thing to be done is
for Minar to LOOK AROUND the results will surprising and very useful. EXIT
and EXAMINE BAG. PROCEED. You will now arrive at a stream let Esher EXAMINE
STREAM then be greedy and FIND GOLD, you won't but it is important to look
anyway. At this point you will be called upon to use magic to prevent a
tragic accident. But first a little point to remember about the use of
magic. The use of essences is of vital importance to the game so any wasting
of them WILL! cause future problems, if you must play around with magic(and
some very funny things can happen) save the game first. And now back to the
game. CAST an ELEVATION spell at Tag to prevent the wall of water from
washing Tag's pack away you will need it's contents later. After this Praxix
will discover that there is no gold but instead there is vital water
essence. From here on various members of the party will wish to recount
their legends and stories allways read these carefully as vital clues and
answers are to be found in these.

Your next stop will be at a lake where after fishing Minar will disapper(it
won't be the last time) forget about the lake you won't find him, PROCEED
instead and ENTER CAVE. CAST GLOW on STAFF and PROCEED untill you arrive at
a pool. ENTER POOL and then LEAVE TUBE. upon arriving you will find Minar
but don't worry about him for the time being just HIDE.ENTER WIDE PATH and go
LEFT, PICK UP TORCH and go BACK. Now go RIGHT and PICK UP BLUE AMULET you
can't leave the treasury with it in your possession so PROCEED. At the
second pool PICK UP COVER and DROP BLUE AMULET then make your way back to
the SMELLY POOL and DIVE, PICK UP BLUE AMULET and SURFACE. Go BACK to Minar
and EXAMINE MINAR he should be well enough to go with you so it's BACK TO
THE CAVE where you will join the party, and once again PROCEED.

At the river PROCEED UPSTREAM twice BUILD RAFT and LAUNCH RAFT. Keep
CROSSing river untill you reach the other side. CAST GLOW on MAP and then
EXAMINE MAP this will lead you to Astrix who will inform you of what is to
be done.

After leaving the Sunrise Tower SCOUT around and once again Minar will
disappear LOOK AROUND twice then GET HELP. ENTER and PROCEED. When you hear
approaching footsteps STAND, when the Dwarves approach PARLEY and TELL
TRUTH. ACCEPT their offer and PROCEED twice. At the runes let Hurth EXAMINE
RUNES and ENTER. Once inside you get lost no matter what you do so CAST
FLARE this will reveal an upper level CAST ELEVATION at anyone and take the
RIGHT tunnel, here you will find Minar is being held captive by Orcs. To get
past the Orcs FIGHT and CAST MUD, now FLANK Orcs and select COMBAT untill
all of the Orcs are dead. There is no way of stopping Hurth from being
killed but at least you have obtained the Dwarf stone. RETURN. PROCEED and
you will begin to encounter an evil force PROCEED again and it grows
stronger PROCEED again and you realize something must be done so go BACK
this will leave Praxix on his own, now CAST a TREMOR spell to seal off the
tunnel. At the stairs go UP and go LEFT, at the chasm CAST ELEVATION at
anybody and CAST WIND. It does not matter who go's UP or who stays just LOOK
AROUND and PICK UP SPYGLASS now go DOWN. Go RIGHT and EXIT.

Now to make matters worse Minar has managed to get bitten by a Nightfang of
which the known cure is Westflake. SPLIT UP. The first character you control
is Bergon who should RETURN immediately. The second character you control is
Praxix who should PROCEED. At the stump CAST LIGHTNING and go DOWN and BACK.
The last character you control is Tag who should follow the STREAM PATH
where he will come upon an Elf to whom he should APPROACH. APPROACH again
and talk to Elf. If you paid attention to Hurth's story of the Elves you
should realize that what is required is to SPEAK ELVISH and say AGRITH B'RAN
the Elf will now go to Minar's aid.
FOLLOW PRAXIX ROUTE and go DOWN into the stump and PROCEED. Once again you
will become lost but it is important for Esher to keep EXAMINING the walls
untill he finds the Hawkbane, the same applies to Praxix finding some stones
containing fire essence. Eventually find will find an exit which will take
you to the spot where Tag met the Elf.Go to ELF HOME which is on fire,
FOLLOW ELVES and CAST RAIN. The grateful Elves will give you the Elf stone,
The story will now take you back to Astrix who will reveal that he possesses
the Wizard stone.
    This now concludes the quest for the four.
    Now for the quest of the two.

Take the NORTHERN ROUTE and ENTER the Dwarves caverns, CONFRONT the presence
you encounter and you will discover it is Hurth the Dwarf (TELL STORY to
discover how this was possible). Go DOWN and stay on THIS LEVEL, SCOUT
around to discover the Orcs and go AROUND ORCS. At the gate allow Praxix to
EXAMINE RUNES, the problem now seems quite perplexing but in reality is
quite simple to solve, SPEAK and enter "lorem". Now go BACK and go PAST
ORCS. To create a diversion CAST TREMOR and immediately CAST ELEVATION AT
HIMSELF. PROCEED twice untill trapped and again CAST TREMOR, while Praxix is
busy engage in COMBAT untill the spell takes effect. During the fight Bergon
will have been injured and will die soon unless something can be done. MIX
REAGENT with WATER ESSENCE and USE MIX on BERGON to restore his health.
PROCEED and ENTER TUNNEL go LEFT and enter NEW MINE then ENTER CLEFT nothing
here so go BACK, but wait is'nt that laughter you can hear better ENTER
CLEFT again and EXAMINE WALLS and lo and behold a miner will appear. ASK
MINER about ORCS and the MINE, and when it is possible allow Tag to PICK UP
the RED ROCKS once this is done go BACK. BACK again and go RIGHT and take
the CRUDE PATH, GET ADVICE and let HURTH go DOWN, at the bottom JUMP. LOOK
AROUND and you should find a key CLIMB UP and go BACK. Take the ORNATE PATH
and OPEN DOOR. EXAMINE VAULT and RUNES and then MIX REAGENT with FIRE
ESSENCE and USE MIX on VAULT, EXAMINE COFFIN and PICK UP STONE. Go BACK
twice to leave the caverns as there is nothing else to done here, the old
mine and the stairs are false trails.
And now to find the second stone. PROCEED and CAST FLARE to get past the
trees, PROCEED again and Praxix will become separated from the party. When
Praxix awakens he will be confronted by a talking tree, ASK TREE ABOUT PATHS
and follow the MILKY WAY. EXAMINE MECHANISM which will reveal a hole, CAST
GLOW on STAFF and go DOWN. Go RIGHT and EXAMINE DEVICE, note the runes. Go
left to the pits and CAST WIND this will reveal each pit has a rune that
corresponds to a rune on the device in the control room.( this does not
apply to the third pit whose rune is obliterated). Save the game now because
what is to follow differs from game to game and does not always go according
to plan. Here follows what each pit contains:-
1st pit:- this is accessed by just going DOWN, in the pit are veins of earth
and fire essence( essential as you have run out of it). You cannot mine
these veins with magic. Go UP to return from pit.
2nd pit:- accessed only by ELEVATING yourself. Inside is a pick-axe,
unfortunately you cannot escape from the pit.
3rd pit:- accessed only by ELEVATING yourself. This pit will only lead you
to the outside, access to the pits is then impossible.
The runes on the pits change from time to time so the determining of the
third rune can only be known by first knowing the first and second runes.
The solution to solving the pits should be as follows. Go to the control
room and set the LEFT DIAL to the rune of the second pit and the RIGHT DIAL
to the rune of the first pit, now PUSH BUTTON and go BACK TO THE PITS and go
DOWN. If you have done it correctly you will find the pick-axe there, so
PICK UP PICK-AXE and MINE ROCK. Now to escape, go back to the CONTROL ROOM
and set the LEFT DIAL to the rune of the first pit and the RIGHT DIAL to the
rune of the third pit, PUSH BUTTON and go BACK TO THE PITS, go DOWN and
FOLLOW LIGHT. If you are having trouble finding the third rune it will
require you to keep restoring the game and trying different combinations
until you can escape. Alternatively you can simply escape by ELEVATING
yourself down the third pit, this however will waste your air essence which
is required in abundance latter in the game.
Once leaving the mines CROSS bridge then PROCEED, go to TOWER and go UP
there you will meet Umbar. ACCEPT Umbar's offer and go DOWN, Umbar will show
you a secret room where you should MIX REAGENT with FIRE ESSENCE, USE MIX ON
STONES, you now have the second stone in your possession. Go BACK and go to
COURTYARD, here CAST FLARE. The flare attracts the attention of the
remainder of the party who should now PROCEED. Hurth will now fall ill,
allow ESHER to EXAMINE HURTH who will use the Hawkbane to cure him. PROCEED
again and Bergon will be snared in a trap, you cannot free him so HIDE and
FOLLOW ORCS. At their camp let Tag check the INVENTORY where an interesting
discovery will be made, USE RED ROCK and this will lead you to Bergon, then
RUN FOR IT. The story will now take it's own course leading to Praxix rescue
and returning to Astrix tower.
         This now concludes the quest for the two.
         Now for the quest of the one.

PROCEED from the Sunrise Tower and you find yourself on the coast where a
large shadow is present, Hurth should EXAMINE SHADOW and then HIDE, this
will prove impossible but Praxix can MIX AIR and WATER to create a fog in
which you can hide. PROCEED and STAY in the cave, where you will once again
meet Umbar. ASK UMBAR ABOUT MUDWARGS and GET ADVICE. When Umbar goes to
sleep EXAMINE UMBARS SACK and MIX BLACK REAGENT with FIRE ESSENCE it is now
safe to LEAVE. Enter the CURIO SHOP and LOOK AROUND, REPLY to the proprietor
and BUY the GREY STONE, it's pretty expensive so TRADE SPYGLASS. PROCEED and
enter TAVERN. ORDER MEAL and EXAMINE OTHER TABLE. CAST INVISIBITY and
EAVESDROP on their whole conversation, your invisibility will wear off half
way through the conversation but continue to EAVESDROP as they mention the
name of a ship's captain who has not been bribed ( this name changes every
game). EXIT tavern and go to the WHARF where the harbormaster will ask you
if you have any particular captain in mind, say YES and enter the name you
heard in the tavern, go to his ship which is usualy the ZEPHYR. TELL TRUTH
to captain and ACCEPT his offer. Now go to the INN and CHECK IN. ACCEPT and
then EXIT and CAMP OUT, this will lead you to being put in jail, but at
least your party is intact. In the jail MIX GREY REAGENT with FIRE ESSENCE,
CAST a TREMOR spell to summon sheriff and USE MIXTURE ON SHERIFF, who will
now release you.
On board the ship RELAX and follow the story until after the storm. You
cannot climb the mast so CAST ELEVATION AT TAG and CAST WIND. Save the game
here as the next part differs in all games. The Demon that arrives will
knock Praxix out, so PICK UP PRAXIX POUCH and MIX ???? ( the mixture
required to create a lightning storm is always different, but it does
require three essences. The best way of finding the right combination is to
first mix two essences together until you have created a small storm, you
then know that all is required is to keep adding a pinch of a third powder
until the right combination is acheived. If at first you don't succeed keep
restoring the game until you do.) After CASTing the mixture at the Demon the
game will follow it's own course until the finality of the game is reached.
       This then concludes the quest for the one.
       And herein concludes JOURNEY!
