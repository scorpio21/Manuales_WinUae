Brides of Dracula
-----------------

When you're Dracula, go right from the first screen and turn the first two
women into vampires, taking them back to their coffins. Then return to that 
screen again, walk between the lift and the second table and crouch down just
past the skulls on the floor. A vampire should then appear ready to be put
into her coffin. Do this again and again to get all eleven vampires, and then
polish off Heising before he knows what hit him.
