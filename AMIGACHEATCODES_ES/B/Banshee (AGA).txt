 CHEAT MODE:

 On the title/options page type 'FLEV17' and hit the [Return] key.
 The screen flashes blue to indicate that the cheat mode is active.
 This cheat gives you infinite everything and also allows you to skip
 levels by pressing any of the function keys.

 Also type in 'I AM EXQUISITELY EVIL' and again hit the [Return] key.
 This prints a message on the high score table and allows you to kill
 all the animals and civilians in the game.
