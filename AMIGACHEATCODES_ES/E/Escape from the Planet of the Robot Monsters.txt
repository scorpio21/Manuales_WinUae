Escape From The Planet Of The Robot Monsters


 TIP/CHEAT:

 This little trick only works in a one player game.
 During the game when you reach the Reptillon monster, run past it and
 stand in the centre of the join of the gates that block your way.
 Now waggle the joystick left and right and keep dropping bombs. In a few
 moments you'll go through the doors and appear on the other side.
