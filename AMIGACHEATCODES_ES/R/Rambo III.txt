 CHEAT MODE:

 Typing 'RENEGADE' on the high score table will give the ability
 to skip to the appropriate level by pressing keys [1], [2] or [3].

 GENERAL HINTS:

 (1) When inside the 2nd building, wear your IR goggles. 

 (2) Don't walk in front of soldiers, since it will trigger an

 (3) If you enter a dark room, use the glow tube. 

 (4) Never use a gun without a silencer. 

 (5) Turn off the electric door with switch located several
     rooms away. 

 (6) The mine detector won't work without the generator. 

 (7) The IR goggles won't work without a battery. 

 (8) Watch out for ir beams, since they also trigger alarms.
