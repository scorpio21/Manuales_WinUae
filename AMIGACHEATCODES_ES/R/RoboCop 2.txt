RoboCop 2


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the title screen type 'SERIALINTERFACE' and after a bit of disk
 accessing the words "cheat mode active" will flash up on the screen.
 You can now press any of these keys during play:

  [F9] - Tops up your energy
 [F10] - Skips to next level

 Apparently, if you don't move the joystick at all on the shooting
 gallery, when the score comes up you will have shot 1186 targets.
