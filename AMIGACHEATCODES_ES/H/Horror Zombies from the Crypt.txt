TIPS:

LEVEL 1
In the long room with headless lady ghosts, push joystick up to
enter a secret camber behind a certain painting

LEVEL 2
Outside the main doors of the manor move right to find a green
key in the gaveyard, guarded by invulnerable Horror Zombies!
To get past thesemonsters you must find and use the potion witch
is located on the right-hand edge of the roof. The green key
needed to trigger a magic cloud, enabling you to get past the
broken drainpipe. Jump ON the flag 

LEVEL 3
Use Crawl to move undertected beneath some Vampires  (Useful for
avoiding skeleton's arrows too!)
Sorry! the only way out of dead end chambers is to commit suicide.

LEVEL 4
You need to push a table from a room at the top of the first ladder
encountered and jump down immediately after it. Puch the table left
and use it to get the green key past the headless lady.

LEVEL 5
When you first get out onto the Chapel roof(through the door at the
base of the large creeper), move left (avoiding vampires) and shoot
the monks, retrieve green key, and continue left. Puch the joystick
forward five spikes in from the next room and you'll move into a
secret area to retieve an extra life.
There are three chests in the Chapel tower. Only one of these
activates the magic cloud - it is the one in the lower right corner.

LEVEL 6
Sorry, no tips for this level!!
