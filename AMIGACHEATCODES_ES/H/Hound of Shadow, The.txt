The Hound of Shadow - Electronic Arts
 
Information compiled by John R. Barnsley 
 
FIRST DAY 

There is very little you can do at the beginning of the game 
except follow it through to the seance where you can examine 
people, look around and wait.
 
(When you notice "something wrong with Lady Saunders".....) - 
HELP LADY - (You revive her. After the seance, you are dropped 
off at your flat by your friend John Playford, who says that he 
will pick you up here at noon tomorrow. You can now either 
wander around and map out the area, or go for a drink at a 
nightclub) - GO TO THE WEST END - (This will take you through to 
the next day).

SECOND DAY 

(Go downstairs to 'Outside your flat') - WAIT TILL NOON - 
(Shortly after, John arrives in a taxi and takes you to a 
restaurant. John tells you that he recognised the woman's voice 
spoken by the medium, Adept Karmi, at the seance) - WHAT WOMAN - 
(John goes on to explain, and then suggests that you meet him in 
the Front Hall of the British Museum at nine tomorrow and for 
you to get a ticket for the Reading Room this afternoon. You are 
then taken back to your flat).

GO TO THE MUSEUM - (Go NORTH into the Museum where you are told
by two attendants that you apply for a ticket to the Reading Room
at the Readers Admissions Office) - WEST - (To the Readers
Admissions Office. The clerk gives you a form to fill in for a
two-day pass, and suggests that you write to the Director of the
British Museum to apply for a lifetime ticket) - FILL IN FORM -
(You are given a temporary two-day pass and can now enter the
Reading Room, but only for a look around because, as yet, you
don't know which books to look for. If you go inside, go to the
Enquiry Desk and.......) - ENQUIRE - (The Enquiry Clerk will then
explain the workings of the Reading Room) - GO TO THE FLAT - (In
your Lounge, where your writing materials are) - WRITE TO THE
DIRECTOR - (Thus applying for a lifetime pass to the Reading Room).
 
(There is nothing more to do for this day, so you could go to a 
Cinema, go to a Pub, or wait until the evening and go to a 
Nightclub).
 
THIRD DAY 

GO TO THE MUSEUM - WAIT UNTIL NINE - N - (John meets you and 
says that he managed to get the business card of the man at the 
seance who had the 'Mark of the Hound' on him. John suggests 
that you go to the address) - S - S - S - (You are outside 49A 
Museum Street, an antique shop) - ENTER THE SHOP - (You meet 
Rowland Marcus) - SHOW THE BUSINESS CARD - (Marcus says that 
Mr.Talbot is not there today) - ASK ABOUT TALBOT - (Marcus will 
give you no information).
 
[NOTE: There are many items in the antique shop that can be 
examined and even bought, but none of these are of any use to 
the completion of the game]

GO TO THE MUSEUM - (Enter the Reading Room where John meets you. 
He shows you a book he had reserved, "Psyche", and says that you 
will find the reference under "Hecate") - READ HECATE - (He then 
hands you "Brands Dictionary of Faiths and Folklore" and asks if 
you can find anything about a Hound) - READ HOUND - (This gives 
you "Hounds of Annwyn") - READ HOUNDS OF ANNWYN - (This gives 
you a cross-reference: "see Barguest, The or Great Dog-Fiend") - 
READ BARGUEST - (This refers to "Chambers' The Book of Days, 
Page 229") - GET CHAMBERS - (You go and get the book) - READ 
PAGE 229 - (This gives a reference to "William Hone's The 
Everyday Book and Table Book") - GET HONES - (You go and get the 
book) - READ BUNGAY - (You read about a Hound appearing at 
Bungay and Blythburgh churches in 1577. Both you and John then 
leave the Museum and go to a restaurant where John asks you to 
try the antique shop again tomorrow to see if Mr.Talbot is 
there. You return to your flat).
 
FOURTH DAY 

In the morning, you are woken by Mrs.Bastable who says that you 
have a young lady visitor who is waiting in the lounge.
GO TO THE LOUNGE - (The lady is the maid from the house where 
the seance was held. She says that she is worried about Harry 
Pelham, the Adept Karmi. She introduces herself as Vivienne 
Powers) - HELLO - (She then asks if you would come back with her 
to see Harry Pelham) - YES - (She takes you back to the house in 
Bloomsbury Street where Harry Pelham tells you about the bad 
dreams he has had since the seance, and of 'HER' in his head. He 
then collapses on the table sobbing and Vivienne Powers shows 
you out).

WHAT DO I DO NOW - (This brings you up to date with what you have
learned so far. You think another visit to Harry Pelham tomorrow
would be a good idea. Remembering what John asked you to do today,
you......) - GO TO THE ANTIQUE SHOP - ENTER SHOP - SHOW THE
BUSINESS CARD - (To Marcus.....Rowland relents, as he has become
concerned about Matthew Talbot, and gives you his address on a
piece of note paper) - READ NOTE - ("M.Talbot, 34B Dean Street").
 
GO TO 34B DEAN STREET - (You are outside Matthew Talbot's flat) 
- KNOCK ON THE DOOR - (The door swings open) - E - (to a 
passage) - UP - (to a landing) - S - (to a bedroom) - OPEN THE 
DOOR - (This is where you find what's left of Matthew Talbot, 
and the horror of it causes you to stagger back downstairs, out 
of the front door, and pass out. When you regain consciousness, 
you are in your own bed).

GET UP - (As you are about to get up, John comes in and explains
that he found you outside Talbot's flat and got you home. He hands
you a copy of "The Times") - READ THE TIMES - (You read about
Talbot's so-called 'murder'. John says that he went to Talbot's
flat in answer to a note given to his landlady by a woman, and he
thinks he knows who. Saying that he will pick you up later, you go
back to sleep.

Later, John calls and asks if you are fit enough to go to a 
restaurant) - YES - (In the restaurant, John hands you the 
delivered letter and asks you to look at it) - LOOK AT THE 
ENVELOPE - (You notice a black wax seal) - LOOK AT THE SEAL - 
(You recognise it as that of "Bathory" the infamous "Blood 
Countess") - READ THE NOTE - (It tells John to go to 34B Dean 
Street. John says that he needs to know if his aura is marked, 
and as only a medium with genuine psychic talents would see it, 
a visit to Rowland Marcus tomorrow might be in order to ask if
he could recommend one. Both you and John go back to your flat
where you sleep).
 
FIFTH DAY 

(John and you go to Marcus' shop) - ENTER THE SHOP - (because of
Talbot's savage death, Marcus is unwilling to talk to you) -
SHOW THE SEAL - (John shows the seal to Marcus who then agrees
to help you) - ASK ABOUT A MEDIUM - (Marcus says that he knows
of one, and will meet you at your flat at around six. Remembering
that you planned another visit to Harry Pelham.........) - GO TO
PELHAM - (You are let in by Vivienne Powers, and hearing the
sound of a chair being knocked over upstairs, you follow Vivienne
up where you find Harry Pelham hanging from a cord) - HELP HARRY
- (You take the weight of his body and cut him down) - WAIT -
(Until the ambulance and police arrive, then you go home).

When you get back to your flat, you should be given a letter by 
Mrs.Bastable) - READ THE LETTER - (It is the reply for your 
application for a pass to the British Museum Reading Room to be 
presented to the Admissions Office. As there is nothing more to 
do at the moment, you can......) - WAIT UNTIL SIX - (Shortly 
after, Rowland Marcus arrives with a woman who he introduces as 
Miranda).

HELLO MIRANDA - (Miranda tells you that it is not John's aura
that is marked, but yours! Miranda asks, "Where did you first
meet Matthew Talbot?") - AT A SEANCE - ("And what happened at
this seance?") - THE MARK OF THE HOUND - ("Do you think that
Harry Pelham is responsible for Talbot's death?") - NO - ("So who
do you think is behind it all?") - MAGDA BATHORY - (John then
goes on to fill in the details and suddenly realises that he is
not the next victim, you are! As there is nothing more Miranda
can do for now, she leaves. You now know that you are the next
victim, so John and Marcus decide to stay the night and guard
you. You go to sleep).
 
SIXTH DAY 

(You wake up in the morning covered in blood from a small 
incision in your right arm. Wondering how someone managed to 
gain entry, and to get past John and Marcus, you all decide to 
split up and search the house).
 
[NOTE: AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME, THERE IS A MINOR BUG WHICH 
STOPS YOU MOVING BY USING COMPASS DIRECTIONS, SO......] 

GO TO THE ATTIC - (You see some marks on the floor drawn in the 
dust) - LOOK AT THE MARKS - (A pattern of symbols and a hand-
print) - LOOK AT THE PATTERN - (A square sub-divided internally) 
- LOOK AT THE SYMBOLS - (The symbol for the Dragon's tail, and 
some form of script) - LOOK AT THE HAND-PRINT - (NOTE: If your 
character has been created with a knowledge of the occult, you 
will recognise this as a Hand of Glory, the severed hand of a 
hanged man, with candles made from black wax and human fat on 
its fingers. With the right charms, this will plunge the 
inhabitants of a house into a deep sleep. Failing that, you will 

see nothing unusual) - LOOK AT THE FOOTPRINTS - (High-heeled 
shoes leading to and from the pattern).

DOWN - (You tell John and Marcus of your find, and after Marcus
has made a sketch of the pattern, you all go to his shop to look
it up in the Gascoigne Journal. Back at the antique shop, Marcus
finds the journal and points out a page for you to read. It
tells of keys and portals to other worlds, and mentions a person
called 'Bridewell' and von Junzt's 'Nameless Cults'. Marcus then
takes back the journal) - GET NAMELESS CULTS - (Marcus says that
he has no copy of that, but to try at the British Museum Reading 
Room).......
 
From this point, the game can be concluded in two ways, 
through Miranda, which is the quickest and easiest method or 
through Father Paul Mason at Blythburgh in Suffolk which 
takes longer and is more complex. 

The Father Paul solution 
------------------------

GO TO THE MUSEUM - (Go to the Readers Admissions Office - West 
from the Reading Room entrance) - GIVE THE LETTER TO THE CLERK - 
(You give the letter that you received from the British Museum 
to the clerk, and he gives you a lifetime pass for the Reading 
Room. Enter the Reading Room and find an empty desk) - GET 
BRIDEWELL - (The press mark tells you that the book has to be
ordered from the Book Request Desk) - REQUEST BRIDEWELL - after
a wait, the book is delivered to your desk) - READ NAMELESS CULTS
- (You learn that the pattern in your attic is called a 'Gate',
which is used to travel and return instantaneously, and that the 
Dragon's Head or Tail shows if the Gate opens outward or inward. 
Now, knowing about magical 'Gates' and their uses.......) - GO 
TO THE FLAT - GO TO THE ATTIC - (Where the magical Gate is) - 
USE THE GATE - (You find yourself in Matthew Talbot's bedroom!) 
- SEARCH - (You find another Gate in the lounge) - USE THE GATE 
- (This transports you to the churchyard at Blythburgh, where 
you meet Father Paul Mason. He asks, "Did you create this 
gate?") - NO - ("Then who did?") - MAGDA BATHORY - (You tell 
Father Paul of the events that have brought you here, and he 
suggests that you go back to London and find out the nature of 
the Beast that killed Talbot and to write to him, care of the 
Post Office. Using the gates, go back to your attic, then......)

GO TO THE SHOP - ENTER THE SHOP - READ THE GASCOIGNE JOURNAL -
(Marcus lets you read the whole journal. You find a reference to
'The Plateau Of Leng', a book by von Juntz) - ASK ABOUT LENG - 
(Marcus says that it is spoken of in Bridewell's 'Nameless 
Cults') - GO TO THE MUSEUM - (Enter the Reading Room, and after 
finding an empty desk.......) - REQUEST BRIDEWELL - (It is 
delivered to your desk again) - READ NAMELESS CULTS - (You find 
the mention of the 'Plateau Of Leng', and it goes on to explain 
about the Hound. John, who has been reading along with you, 
talks about Worlsman, the creature he encountered in San 
Francisco, and how he managed to kill him, but he cannot see how 
that will help us now with Magda Bathory. John asks, "What can 
we do?") - DESTROY HER - (John explains that Worlsman's secret 
was that he made an homunculus, that took any attack on himself 
and kept him safe) - CAN WE DESTROY MAGDA BATHORY - (John thinks 
it unlikely, and even if we did, the Hound would still carry out 
the curse on you, but maybe there is a way you could survive 
it?) - MAKE AN HOMUNCULUS - (John says, "Yes! I think you are 
right! It would trick the Hound into destroying that and you 
would come to no harm". You have now learned about the Beast, 
and what you must do to decoy it and save yourself) - GO TO THE 
FLAT - (In your lounge......) - WRITE TO FATHER PAUL MASON - 
(You write to Father Paul, telling him of your plan to make an 
homunculus, and hoping he can help).
 
[FROM NOW ON, IT IS JUST A MATTER OF KILLING TIME UNTIL YOU HEAR 
FROM FATHER PAUL MASON. THIS WILL LAST FOR THE REST OF THIS 
SIXTH DAY, AND ALL OF THE SEVENTH DAY. THESE ARE SOME OF THE 
THINGS YOU CAN DO...........]  GO TO A PUB, GO TO THE CINEMA, GO 
TO THE MUSEUM (Where you can read other books, for example....) 
(READ ABOUT MAGDA BATHORY) (GET BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY) (GET 
SABINE) (READ ABOUT VLAD TEPES)  (Or in the evening......) GO TO 
THE WEST END (To a Nightclub)  YOU COULD ALSO SPEED THINGS UP 
AND 'WAIT' THE TIME AWAY BY 'WAIT TILL NINE' - 'GO TO BED' - 
'WAIT TILL NOON'..........AND SO ON UNTIL THE MORNING THE LETTER 
ARRIVES.
 
EIGHTH DAY 
 
(When the letter from Father Paul finally arrives, he says that 
he deeply regrets that he has to withdraw his offer of help. 
John says that if he won't come to us, then we must go to him. 
Go to Liverpool Street Station by underground train, get a 
ticket from the Booking Office, and when you are on the platform 
for East Anglia........) - WAIT FOR TRAIN - (When the train 
pulls in....) - GET ON THE TRAIN - (Then keep WAITing until you 
get to Blythburgh. Go South into the village, and enter the 
Black Dog Inn) - ASK ABOUT FATHER PAUL - (You are told to ask at 
the Post Office, so go to the Post Office).
ASK ABOUT FATHER PAUL - (The Postmistress is reluctant to tell 
you) - PERSUADE and BLUFF - (repeatedly, until she gives you the 
directions to Father Paul's cottage. Leave the Post Office and 
go south to the cottage) - KNOCK ON THE DOOR - (Father Paul lets 
you in, but says, "I cannot help you. It would be wrong of me".) 
- WHY WOULD IT BE WRONG - (Father Paul talks about not having to 
purge himself, as yet, of the Sin of Pride) - WHAT IS THE SIN OF 
PRIDE - (He tells you about his duties as a missionary in Haiti, 
and that the knowledge he gained was dangerous) - WHY WAS IT 
DANGEROUS - (He says that he was forced to learn their magics, 
which left him prey to a great temptation) - WHAT WAS THE 
TEMPTATION - (He explains that the temptation was to use their 
superstitions, but would it be for good and not evil?) - 

PERSUADE FATHER PAUL - (You finally manage to persuade Father 
Paul to help you, so he gives you a manuscript which tells you 
the ingredients of an homunculus, and how to make it. Father 
Paul tells you to go and make your homunculus, and return to him 
with it) - GO TO THE INN - (Enter the Black Dog Inn, and....) - 
ASK FOR A ROOM - (The landlord takes you up to a room).
 
MAKING THE HOMUNCULUS 
 
LOOK UNDER THE BED - (You find a chamber pot) - GET THE CHAMBER 
POT - GET WATER - (You pour some water into the pot from a water 
jug) - NORTH - (To the landing, where you....) - GET MERCURY - 
(You take the barometer from the wall) - DOWN - EAST - (To the 
Bar, where you.....) - GET SALT - (The barmaid gives you a salt 
cellar) - GET SULPHUR - (You get a box of matches) - WEST - 
(Outside the Black Dog Inn) - GET CLAY - (You get some from a 
field) - GET HAIR - (You cut a few strands from your hair) - GET 
NAILS - (You trim your nails) - GET BLOOD - (The fresh cut on 
your arm will do) - MAKE HOMUNCULUS - (You make your homunculus, 
and then return to Father Paul).
 
THE COMING OF THE HOUND 
 
(Father Paul examines your homunculus, and says that it has the 
image of your soul, but is weaker. As the Hound will attack the 
stronger of the two, Father Paul teaches you how to calm your 
soul, making you weaker. You then all go to the Church, as this 
is the place of power) - DROP THE HOMUNCULUS - (This is very 
important, as holding the homunculus will put you as one with 
it, so when the Hound attacks, both you and the homunculus will 
perish instead of decoying the Hound with a scapegoat. It is 
time to take your place, so remembering what Father Paul taught 
you for calming your soul, you......) - RELAX - (the Hound 
arrives, and satisfies its lust for destruction on your 
homunculus and leaving you unharmed, but in doing so, takes the 
life of Father Paul Mason, and badly injures John).
 
YOU HAVE SURVIVED THE HOUND OF SHADOW, BUT TO WHAT COST..?

The Miranda solution 
--------------------

READ THE GASCOIGNE JOURNAL - (Marcus lets you read the whole 
journal. You find a passage that mentions von Juntz's book and 
the Plateau Of Leng) - WHAT IS LENG - (Marcus says that von 
Juntz speaks of it in 'Nameless Cults') - GO TO THE MUSEUM - (Go 
to the Readers Admissions Office, West from the Reading Room 
entrance, and......) - GIVE THE LETTER TO THE CLERK - (You give 
the letter that you received from the British Museum to the 
clerk, and he gives you a lifetime pass for the Reading Room. 
Enter the Reading Room and find an empty desk) - GET BRIDEWELL - 
(The press mark tells you that the book has to be ordered from 
the Book Request Desk) - REQUEST BRIDEWELL - (After a wait, the 
book is delivered to your desk) - READ NAMELESS CULTS - (You 
learn that the pattern in your attic is called a 'Gate' which is 
used to travel and return instantaneously, and that the Dragon's 
Head or Tail shows if the Gate opens outward or inward. You also 
find a mention of the 'Plateau Of Leng' which you read, and then 
close the book. John, who has been reading along with you, talks 
about Worlsman, the creature he encountered in San Francisco, 
and how he managed to kill him, but he cannot see how that will 
help us now with Magda Bathory. John asks, "What can we do?") 

DESTROY HER - (John explains that Worlsman's secret was that he 
had made an homunculus that took any attack on himself and kept 
him safe) - CAN WE DESTROY MAGDA BATHORY - (John thinks it 
unlikely, and even if we did, the Hound would still carry out 
the curse on you, but maybe there is a way you could survive 
it?) - MAKE AN HOMUNCULUS - (John says, "Yes! I think you are 
right! It would trick the Hound into destroying that and you 
would come to no harm. You remember seeing something about 
homunculi in the Gascoigne Journal, so you and John return to 
Marcus' shop.

Back at the shop, you read up on homunculi, and it also mentions 
'Stanopoulos' and 'Paracelsus') - ASK ABOUT STANOPOULOS - 
(Marcus says that he is a rogue and a scoundrel) - ASK ABOUT 
PARACELSUS - (Marcus says that he has no alchemical texts on 
Paracelsus at the moment, and he suggests you try the Reading 
Room again) - GO TO THE MUSEUM - (Enter the Reading Room and 
find an empty desk) - GET PARACELSUS - (When it is delivered to 
your desk, you find that it is a ten volume work) - READ 
PARACELSUS - (You discover that it is written in Gothic font, 
and it is in a mixture of Latin and German. You are going to 
need help to translate it). 

STAND - (Walk out of the Reading Room, where you are met by John
who is coming to see how you are getting on. You tell John about
the Paracelsus works, so he goes and fetches Marcus, and between
them they translate the books. Marcus then tells you the
ingredients you need to make an homunculus. John suggests that
you make your stand at Blythburgh church, and adds that once you
have made your homunculus, to get Miranda to check that it has
your aura).
 
MAKING THE HOMUNCULUS 
 
(The ingredients you need to make your homunculus are: CLAY, 
MERCURY, SULPHUR, SALT, WATER, HAIR, NAIL CLIPPINGS and BLOOD) - 
GO TO THE FLAT - (From your lounge, go North to the passage 
where there is an aspidistra plant, and.......) - GET CLAY - 
(You take some soil from the plant pot) - GO TO THE KITCHEN - 
GET A POT - (You take a saucepan) - GET SALT - (You find a small 
salt cellar) - GET WATER - (You pour some water into the 
saucepan from the tap).

GET SULPHUR - (You find a box of matches, which contain sulphur
or phosphorus, either of which will do) - GO TO THE BATHROOM -
GET MERCURY - (You take a thermometer from the medicine cabinet)
- BREAK THE THERMOMETER - (You pour the mercury into the mixture)
- GET HAIR - (You cut off some strands of hair) - GET NAILS -
(You trim your nails) - GET BLOOD - (The fresh cut on your arm will
do. You and John decide to go to Blythburgh tomorrow).
 
[NOTE: THE GAME CAN BE CONCLUDED HERE BY TYPING IN 'CONTACT 
MIRANDA', AS CONFRONTING THE HOUND MUST BE DONE IN A PLACE OF 
POWER, AND APART FROM THE CHURCH AT BLYTHBURGH, YOUR FLAT HAS 
THIS POWER. THE ONLY TROUBLE IS THAT THE DESCRIBED DETAILS OF 
THE COMING OF THE HOUND, DOES NOT EXACTLY RELATE TO THE 
DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FLAT, SO IT IS BETTER TO GO ON A LITTLE 
FURTHER]  WAIT TILL NINE - GO TO BED - (You sleep through to the 
next day).
 
SEVENTH DAY 
 
GOING TO BLYTHBURGH BY TRAIN 
 
GO TO THE STATION - (You go to Tottenham Court Road Station) - 
DOWN - (To the Booking Office) - GET A TICKET - DOWN - (You are 
on the platform) - WAIT - (a train arrives) - GET ON THE TRAIN - 
WAIT - WAIT - (The train pulls into the British Museum station) 
- WAIT - WAIT - (The train pulls into Liverpool Street tube 
station) - LEAVE THE TRAIN - UP - UP - (You are on the concourse 
of Liverpool Street station) - WEST - (To the Booking Office) - 
GET A TICKET - EAST - NORTH - (To the platform where the trains 
for East Anglia leave) - WAIT FOR TRAIN - (A main-line train 
arrives) - GET ON THE TRAIN - WAIT - (The train pulls out) - 
WAIT - (The train pulls into Halesworth where you change to 
another train) - WAIT - (The train pulls into Blythburgh 
Station) - LEAVE THE TRAIN - (You are on Blythburgh station) - 
SOUTH - (To the Booking Office, having handed in your ticket.

You can now go South to the Village, and wander around 
Blythburgh visiting the church, churchyard, Post Office and even 
have a drink in the Black Dog Inn, but using the 'Miranda' 
method of finishing the game, nothing else will happen here, 
so.......) - CONTACT MIRANDA - (When Miranda arrives by train, 
you all go to the Church where she examines your homunculus. She 
says that it is weaker than you, and as the Hound will attack 
the stronger of the two, she teaches you how to put yourself 
into a trance and feign death) - DROP THE HOMUNCULUS - (This is 
very important, as holding the homunculus will put you as one 
with it, so when the Hound attacks, both you and the homunculus 
will perish instead of decoying the Hound with a scapegoat.
It is time to take your place, so remembering what you learnt from 
Miranda, you......) - RELAX - (You put yourself in a trance, and 
shortly after, the Hound appears, satisfying its lust for 
destruction on the homunculus and leaving you safe, but taking 
the life of poor Miranda and badly injuring your friend John).
  
YOU HAVE SURVIVED THE HOUND OF SHADOW, BUT TO WHAT COST..?
