                                  INTRODUCTION:
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Vengeance of Excalibur is Virgin Game's sequel to the Fantasy
      Epic adventure Spirit of Excalibur, which is based on Arthurian
      Legend,  primarily in the time of Constantine, successor to the
      throne after the death of King Arthur. Vengeance is the second
      of a two-part series in which the knights of the Round Table
      are given the task of finding the treasures stolen one dark and
      stormy night from Camelot's treasury: Excalibur, the Gaunts
      d'Poeir (Gauntlets Of Power), Arthur's Helm and Shield, and
      most importantly the Holy Grail to help Constantine, who was
      put under a spell the night of the robbery by the shadowy
      figure who accompanied the thief, Sir Breuse Sans Pitie!

      In Vengeance of Excalibur, you, the player, are the controller
      of all decisions made by the characters in the game. You will
      start in Portsmouth, where you must choose your companions.
      From there you will sail to Bayonne with the four knights of
      your choice. While you play, you will make allegiance with
      kingdoms, and other knights, and you will also make enemies.
      You command all of the soldiers and knights that have pledged
      their allegiance to you.

      The game is divided into seven major Episodes. Each Episode
      has one major goal and smaller minor quests to complete.
      Completion of all of these minor quests are not necessary to
      successfully solve the game.  However, by completing them,
      you will be given information and items that will aid in your
      overall quest to restore the treasures to Camelot's treasury
      and rescue Constantine from the dreadful spell he is under.

      Prowess Potion
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Can only be used one time. Whoever uses this potion will
      notice an increase in their combat ability by one point.

      Healing Potion
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Can be used several times before it is used up. The target will
      have one damage point removed.

      Vitality Potion
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Can be used only one time. This potion increases the user's
      maximum Hit Points by one point.


      ITEMS OF MAGIC:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Arthur's Shield & Helm
      These are two of the great treasures that were stolen from
      Camelot. They can be found in the city of Kurtuba in Episode
      Four. Used together, they aid the wearer in a stronger defense
      against his opponents. However, be aware, the wearer must find
      another helm and shield to wear if he wishes to return these
      items to his inventory. You will most certainly need them in the
      final confrontation in Episode Seven, so guard them carefully,
      lest they be stolen.

      Dragon's Teeth
      To find the teeth, you will need to go to the dragon, who
      is on the Isle of Malorica in Episode Six. Once the dragon
      has been destroyed, you will need to search for his teeth.
      When sown, these items will sprout into skeleton soldiers
      which will fight for the possessor of the teeth. These
      soldiers are the most effective tool against foes of the
      undead variety.

      Excalibur
      This is the great sword that Arthur proudly wielded before
      his death. It was in the treasury that fateful night and
      was stolen. It can be retrieved only by killing Al-Mansur
      in Episode five, who will not relinquish possession of it
      without a good fight. When a knight uses Excalibur, it will
      aid his ability to defeat his foes. However, once put to
      use by a knight, it can only be returned to inventory if
      the knight finds another sword to use instead.

      Gauntlets d'Poeir
      The Gauntlets of Power were another item stolen from
      Camelot's treasury. They are found in a rooom in Santiago in
      Episode One. When used, these will aid the wearer in his
      ability to fight and will raise his combat points. However,
      once used by a knight, they cannot be given to another knight,
      unless the original wearer dies in the heat of a battle. In
      this case, they must be taken from his dead body.

      Holy Grail
      This is the only item which has a prayer of saving Constantine!
      It is in the hands of the Shadowmaster himself! Only by
      defeating the Shadowmaster can you recover this treasure.
      Remember, only the most pious of men can use it to save the
      King.

      Mandrake
      When used by Nineve, they aid in her Osteon Malakos spell,
      which will kill skeletons in the City of Brass, and the
      Enchanted City. It can be found at Barcinona and Fatima
      in the hands of herbalists. However, it is needed for
      each occurrence of Nineve's spell.

      Runic Blade
      This sword can be found at the Isle of Malorica, in the
      caves where the dragon resides. Whoever puts this item
      to use will find his combat points increased. One of
      your secondary knights is the best choice for this item,
      as your lead knight will most likely have Excalibur.

      Bird
      Located in a room in Santiago in Episode two, Nineve's
      soul was captured inside this bird after being kidnapped
      by Sir Breuse sans Pitie. You will need to defeat Breuse
      who will not give her up without a valiant fight. Once
      you have the bird, you will then need powerful magic to
      restore Nineve to her natural form.

      NOTE: The knife, broadsword, helm and shield are not useful
      because your knights already have them implicitly, and no one
      but knights can use them. They are useless items.

      NOTEL The Herbalists and Apothecary do not have all the items
      at any given time. You will need to visit them during different
      Episodes to obtain all the items needed for spells.


      Character Stats:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Hit Points
      Each character begins with five number of hit points.
      This is the maximum amount of hit points a character
      can have. At the beginning of each episode, hit points
      are reset to their maximum.

      Health Points
      Health points are the current number of hit points. At
      each episode, they are equal to the maximum number of
      hit points. In battle, as a character draws damage, his
      health points will decrease. Using a healing balm, or a
      healing spell, a character can increase their health
      points until the next episode when they will be reset.

      Magic Points
      Magic points can only be gained by characters that start
      with magic points, and are skilled in this area. Nineve
      and the Djinni can raise their magic points by successfully
      casting spells in combat. However, each spell they use
      depletes the number of magic points they would have to
      use in the next spell. When Nineve's spell points are
      depleted, she must either wait until the next episode when
      her spell points are replenished, or go to the Well of
      Souls to cast her repletion spell.

      Combat Points
      Knights that wish to raise their combat points can do so
      by successfully defeating their foes, or using items that
      have magical qualities which enhance their skills. Prowess
      potions will raise a characters combat points by one.

      Armor Points
      This stat is raised or lowered according to the armor that
      each character is wearing. As a character discards his armor
      to replace it with stronger armor, his armor points will
      increase accordingly.

      Nobility Points
      A character gains nobility points by completing noble acts
      such as vanquishing evil foes. Your characters will lose
      nobility, however,  if they run ignobly from battle, or take
      part in the killing of helpless characters, such as merchants.

      Faith Points
      Only a person of great faith will be able to use the Citadel
      Scroll, which is necessary to rescue the King. To increase a
      character's faith points, he should spend some considerable
      time in a church.


      GENERAL STRATEGIES:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      At the beginning of each Episode, you will be given a
      general idea of the task set before you, and the
      problems your party might encounter.  Unfortunately,
      this information is vague and will not give you a
      detailed description of your mission.  To obtain the
      knowledge needed to complete each Episode, you must talk
      to the residents of the land. Some of these people will
      offer pieces of information, some important to your
      quest, and some worthless. Others may know little to
      nothing at all of the happenings in the realm.  Be wary,
      though, as some of the people you encounter will attempt
      to mislead you with their tales and others may require a
      few Gold Besants to help their memory.

      Look throughout the map for allies whose troops may join
      you.  Some will not help you at all, while others will
      lend you themselves and their troops if you can aid them
      in their own quests, such as rescuing a kidnapped maiden
      for them.  Still others are paid mercenaries and will only
      lend aid to your conquest in return for money.

      Take caution, if one or more of your characters is killed
      in a particular Episode, you still may be able to complete
      that Episode.  However,  you may not be able to complete
      the game without him or her.  A few of the very important
      characters whom you should never allow to die are:  Lancelot,
      Nineve, and the Djinni.  If other leaders are killed, you
      will still be able to complete the game, but not without
      some difficulties.  For example, if Sir Edward is killed
      early on, and you should need a knight to replace Lancelot
      so he does not perish as well, you would not have a very
      strong knight in which to defeat your the Shadowmaster in
      the final Episode.

      When a normal knight is in combat against an enemy that
      knows the use of magic, be warned. The best character to
      handle a magical beast is a magic user.  Only if a knight
      is very well shielded, with magical armor and a magical sword,
      will he be able to stand against a creature of darkness.  Be
      sure that when you vanquish a foe, you search his expired
      corpse thoroughly as


      Spells:
      ~~~~~~~
      Nineve

      Nineve has strong, powerful magic. At the beginning of
      each Episode her magic points are reset. Take heed in
      each Episode that you only use Nineve's magic when it
      is necessary, or you will find that she will be unable
      to help you when you need her to.

      Repletion:
      ~~~~~~~~~~
      When Nineve has exhausted her spell points, you must
      send her alone to the Well of Souls. There she will be
      able to cast her repletion spell, which will replenish
      her magical power.

      Healing:
      ~~~~~~~~
      When a character's health is failing, this spell can be
      used to increase their health by one health point.
      However, you can only increase health to the maximum hit
      point value.

      Charm:
      ~~~~~~
      Casting this spell on others will cause them to be very
      accommodating and friendly. They will tell you all that
      they know, and give you anything that they have.

      Defend:
      ~~~~~~~
      This spell requires a Bat's Wing to function properly.
      It causes an increase in the defense ability against
      magical attacks to whomever the caster chooses.

      Shield:
      ~~~~~~~
      Nineve must have a Hellsbane in her possession, for
      this spell. This causes an increase in the defense
      ability against normal attacks.

      True Sight:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~
      This is the spell to use when your party is trying
      to recover the stolen bell of Santiago. They will make
      hidden items readily apparent.

      Osteon Malakos:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      This spell can only be cast if Nineve has Mandrake. It
      is a destructive spell against undead creatures only.




      Djinni
      ~~~~~~
      The Djinni has several spells to his use, but remember,
      he can only be used a limited number of times.

      Rara Avis:
      ~~~~~~~~~~
      This spell is to be used on Nineve when her soul is
      trapped within the body of a bird. It can only be cast
      when a bird is present.

      Stupefactus:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~
      This is a damaging spell that will cause the target
      to sustain a hit point. It is especially useful against
      live targets. It will harm the undead, but is not as
      damaging as other spells.

      Higamus Hogamus:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Also a damaging spell. This spell is more powerful then
      Stupefactus against animated skeletons, who will quickly
      kill most of your party if they are not destroyed swiftly.

      Flying Carpet:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      This spell is to be used when you reach the City of Brass
      in Episode Three, which has no visible entrance into the
      city. If there is a silk carpet in the room, this spell
      will grant it the magical power of flight.

      Salubria:
      ~~~~~~~~~
      A healing potion in magical form, this will restore health
      points to the target.


      General Questions:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      I keep wandering aimlessly around! Is there more to
      the game?

      Of course there is. Look around you, and talk to everyone
      you see. Perhaps they've seen Sir Breuse or the missing
      treasures, and can lead you along the right path.

      Everything is happening too fast! How can I slow
      things down?

      Use the Hourglass Icon to choose the speed that's best
      for you. The game is automatically defaulted to fast.

      How do I see how the characters are doing?

      By clicking on the Crystal Ball Icon or by pressing
      the "S" (Status) hotkey, you will see the hit, magic,
      combat, nobility points, and how much gold each character
      has. Click on a character's name for complete information.

      How do I pick up items?

      Any item in the scene level that can be picked up and
      that you'd like to add to your party's inventory can be
      picked up by clicking on the object with the mouse. If
      you are using a joystick, you can move the cursor to the
      object and press the button. Not every item in a scene
      can be picked up.

      How do I check a character's inventory?

      When you click on the Crystal Ball Icon a box will
      appear, revealing all of your party members. Click on
      any party member, and you will be shown a complete status
      report of that character, including their inventory.

      How do I drop an item?

      When you are on the scene level, you can drop items by
      clicking on your character or by using the "D" (Do)
      hotkey. Click "Drop" on the menu that appears. You will
      then be shown what that character is carrying. Click on
      the item you wish to drop. Take heed, you might want to
      think before you drop something, "What if I need to use
      it later?" Some things should be kept, even though they've
      been used, even if the reason doesn't seem readily apparent.

      I keep having to start all over from the beginning each
      time my party dies!

      SAVE YOUR GAME. Every time you pass an Episode, or right
      before a battle that you are unsure of, you will want to
      save your game, just in case. You can save a lage number
      of saved games, according to disk space.

      I'm having trouble clicking on the right person! What do
      I do?

      You can also tell a character to do something by clicking
      on the Glove Icon, or by pressing the "D" (Do) hotkey.
      This will bring up a list of the characters in your party.
      Click on a name to select the character. A menu will appear
      with actions that you can select from.

      I've lost my party! I can't find them on the map!

      First of all, don't panic. Click your mouse on the map
      icon from the map level. You will be shown an overview
      map that has all the different cities in Spain marked.
      The blinking red lights on the map represent a member of
      your party. If your party is split into two groups, there
      will be a light for each group. To go to the location of a
      group, click on the magnifying glass. Move it to the group's
      blinking light and click. You will be taken back to the map
      level where that group is located.


      Episode One
      -----------
      Characters


      Merchant
      In the city of Bayonne, your party will come across
      a merchant. He has items to sell you that will be
      helpful on your quest, He has heard that Sir Breuse
      was seen headed to Pamplona the year before. He will
      also suggest you speak with the Pilgrim in Pamplona
      for more information.

      Monk
      After you leave Bayonne to begin your quest, you will
      encounter a Monk who will tell you to seek the pilgrim
      in Pamplona. He will also suggest you speak to gypsies,
      who are said to be able to see the future.

      Pilgrims
      En route, your party will meet two Pilgrims who will
      tell you to seek the advice of the Pilgrim in Pamplona.

      Messenger
      A messenger will find you somewhere on your journey to
      Pamplona. He was sent to warn you of the Rogues seeking
      to destroy your party. He counsels you to hire armed
      mercenaries as protection against them.

      Basques
      There are five groups of Basques. One is west of the
      Pyrenees mountains, with a group of five hundred. Even
      with the help of paid mercenaries, you will not be able
      to defeat this lot, so avoid them at all expense! You will
      meet a lone Basque in the Pyrenees mountains who will tell
      you to turn back as strangers are not welcome by the
      Basques. Do not listen to him, for the fastest route to
      Pamplona is through these mountains. The other three
      groups of Basques are in different locations of the
      Pyrenees. With the help of mercenaries, you should be able
      to claim victory should you go to battle with these foes.

      Sir Roland
      Also on their way to Pamplona is Sir Roland and his army
      of fifty soldiers. They will offer your party an escort
      over the Pyrenees. It would be a wise choice to accept his
      offer as they can help to defend you against the numerous
      Basques in this area.

      Gypsy
      The gypsy in the gypsy camp along your way will offer to
      read your fortune for a small price.  She will tell you
      of the pilgrim in Pamplona, Diego Garcia, who you will
      meet en route,  she will also mention where you might
      find some gold to finance the armies you will need to
      hire to protect yourself from the Rogues, and the Basques.

      Rogues
      There are four groups of rogues roaming throughout the area
      of Bayonne and the Pyrenees, each seeking a different member
      of your party, so trying to split your party to avoid them
      will not work. In fact, it will decrease your chances of
      survival, as one or two knights won't be able to defeat
      a group of rogues. Your party had best avoid them at all
      costs if they are to survive!

      Diego Garcia
      He is a pilgrim in the Pyrenees, but he's not as simple
      as he might at first appear. He will offer your party the
      use of his secret tunnels beneath the Pyrenees mountains,
      and if you accept, with a wave of his hand, the path will
      suddenly become visible.

      Dwarfs
      The dwarfs in the caves protect the treasure that is
      there. If your party moves in peace, not touching any of
      the treasures scattered throughout, the dwarfs will in turn,
      let your party move in peace. However, if you take even a
      single gold Besant, the wrath of every dwarf will be upon
      your party. However, now you're faced with a dilemma.
      You need the gold, so you'll have to deal with the dwarfs.

      Don Jaime
      You will meet up with Don Jaime soon after leaving the
      pilgrimage in Pamplona. He will offer his small army for
      a nominal fee. However, he doesn't like Duke Lupo of Leon
      and will start a battle if you hire him also.

      Ramirez
      You will find Ramirez just South of the path on the way to
      Santiago. Ramirez has a medium-sized army that he is willing
      to aid you with - for a fee, of course. However, he will not
      fight with your party if you choose to hire someone he does
      not like, such as Duke Lupo of Leon. In fact, Ramirez will
      attack your party if Duke Lupo is with you.

      Duke Lupo
      In Leon, Duke Lupo has a good-sized army backing him. He will
      render your party aid for the right price. However, if you
      have already hired Don Jaime or Ramirez, then you'll be dragged
      into a battle between the two enemies.

      Ramon II
      In Santiago is Ramon II. He has a medium-sized army of
      followers, and will attack your party if you try to enter
      Santiago. It is best to have built up some armies before you
      try to tackle this foe.

      Domingo
      He is awaiting your party inside the church in Santiago. He
      will tell your party of Bartholomew, who has news that would
      be of interest to your party. But first, you must kill Breuse,
      so that Bartholomew will come out of hiding.

      Sir Breuse sans Pitie
      Inside a room in the city of Santiago, you will find the vile
      Sir Breuse, the villain you've been seeking. Your lead knight
      will move to fight him the moment he sees him.

      Bird
      Not all things are what they appear, and the bird in the cage
      in Santiago is definitely not just a bird. A gypsy will tell
      you that there is a soul trapped in the form of a bird. This
      is indeed that bird. It is wise to take the bird with you
      until you find a way to recover this soul.

      Bartholomew
      Bartholomew is hiding inside the church in Santiago for fear of
      his life from Breuse. He will assist your party by telling you
      the infidels headed southward, but will also plea for your help
      in restoring the stolen church bell they took with them. In
      return for the bell, he will grant your party a reward. He
      will also advise you to take the bird with you.

      QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Which Knights Should I Choose For My Party?
      You can choose only four of the seven knights. The choice
      is entirely up to you, but keep these things in mind:
      Lancelot is the best fighter, with the highest combat points.
      Edward is a close second, and good to have with you if
      Lancelot should perish in battle. Sangramore carries a
      prowess potion with him. Amadis has a healing potion. Bors
      has the Blessed Cross and is the most pious, though not
      pious enough to use the Citadel Scroll. He is also the only
      knight with magical ability. Ironside is the swiftest, and
      will help you outrun the rogues. Braniles is wealthy, which
      will help you finance mercenaries, and buy various other
      items needed to complete your quest.

      I accidentally chose the wrong knight! How do I change it?
      You can deselect a knight by clicking on him again. The
      number you see next to each name selected shows the order
      in which the knights will be in your party. This is
      something to consider as the knight listed as two will be
      the leader of your party if the knight listed as one dies
      at any time.

      Should I stop and talk to the pilgrims, the messenger, and
      the merchant?
      You will want to talk to everyone who might have information
      helping your party in obtaining your quest. However, since
      time is of the essence, once you've heard what they have to
      say, you don't need to return there each time you start the
      game. If you wish to buy from the merchant in Bayonne,
      conserve time by stopping only for him.

      Should I hire Sir Roland?
      The Pyrenees are hard to cross, so you might want some extra
      manpower. Sir Roland charges the least amount of money for
      his aid.

      I keep getting killed by the Basques! What should I do?
      If you had Sir Roland's help, you might have the strength to
      beat the Basques. Start over and make sure you enlist his
      army! You might also look for alternate routes across the
      mountain.

      Diego Garcia offers me a path through the mountain, should
      I accept?
      While Diego will accept payment for this favor, he will grant
      that you have nothing at this time that he desires, and will
      agree to claim his price at a later date. Since the Basques
      are not inside the caves, it is the best way to avoid them.
      In addition, you must avoid the rogues to survive, and going
      through the caves might confuse them.

      There is a lot of gold and treasures in the caves, Should I
      take it?
      The dwarfs warned you not to take any, lest you suffer their
      wrath. On the other hand, you'll need gold to finance armies,
      so you might as well takee everything you see, right?

      I can't find Santiago!
      Check the overview map by clicking on the map icon while
      you're on the main map. Then look in the upper left corner.
      This is where Santiago is located.

      When I leave Pamplona en route to Santiago I am ambushed
      by rogues! How do I get past them?
      You must move quickly once you reach Pamplona. It's best to
      save your game while you're in the Pilgrim's room after the
      caves. This way if your party dies, you'll be able to
      restore the game at that point. If you move immediately
      North, you should be able to get headed in the right
      direction toward Santiago before the rogues are upon you.

      Should I hire Don Jaime, Ramirez or Duke Lupo?
      The problem with Don Jaime or Ramirez is that they both
      have medium-sized armies, and will create havoc if you try
      to add Duke Lupo to your alliance. However, for short-term
      protection from the Rogues, either Don Jaime or Ramirez are
      a viable option. For taking on Santiago, however, Duke
      Lupo's army is larger so it would be the best choice.

      * SAVE GAME *
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Do I have to keep paying mercenaries?
      Only if you want them to remain with your party. Unpaid
      armies tend to wander off.

      I went to Santiago, and was attacked, but the other army
      repelled my attack, what should I do?
      Santiago has a strong army defending it, but it will weaken
      in time. Keep attacking until you have claimed victory.

      I'm inside the city fighting Sir Breuse, and the leader of
      my party isn't the strongest knight! What can I do?
      You can switch off who is fighting your foes by clicking
      on the new knights name in the combat list and clicking
      on the word 'normal'. This will cause whoever is fighting
      to withdraw, and your new choice will take their place.

      I killed Sir Breuse, but there is a message saying it
      wasn't really him! What gives?
      Sir Breuse didn't get inside Camelot that rainy night by
      being dull. He sent a spectre to fool people into believing
      he was living in the city. Bishop Bartholomew might be able
      to send you in the right direction.

      There is a bird here! Should I take it?
      You should definitely heed Bartholomew's advice about the
      bird. You can pick it up by clicking on it.

      What will the Gauntlets d'Poeir (Gauntlets of Power) do?
      Eventually, they will be returned to the treasury of Camelot
      from which they were stolen, but in the meantime, what's
      the harm in using them to benefit your party? Whichever knight
      you wish to put them to use on should be carrying them in
      this inventory. Using the DO option menu, click on the USE
      button. They will increase the wearer's combat points.

      Which of my knights should use the Gauntlets d'Poeir
      (Gauntlets of Power)?
      Your strongest knight should wear the Gauntlets, as well as
      any other treasures you should find. Should that knight die
      in combat, be sure and have another strong knight take them
      for his use.

      Bartholomew wants me to find the bell, should I?
      While recovering the stolen bell is not required to solve
      the game, you might think twice before deciding not to.
      Bartholomew did promise a reward, and you are definitely
      going to need money to continue paying mercenaries to fight
      for you.

      Episode 2
      ----------
      Characters

      Traveler
      On the journey southward from Santiago, you will encounter
      a traveler who spent some time in the Chapel of Bones, a
      leper colony in Evora. He will tell you he has heard nothing
      there about a stolen bell.

      Motamid
      Motamid has a small group of followers at Aveiro. With the
      help of Duke Lupo of Leon, you can defeat this army. However,
      doing so will only deplete your forces, for there is nothing
      at Aveiro that you need at this time.

      Ibn Teshufin
      With the support of three hundred men, Ibn Teshufin is
      travelling the same route you are, and will keep you from
      Evora if you allow him to. If you kept paying your mercenaries,
      and they are still with your party, your party should prevail.

      Unmayed Emir
      There is a large group, over five hundred soldiers and knights,
      that follow Unmayed Emir. He will try to prevent you from
      reaching Alcantara, but do not be dismayed. As long as your
      party navigates around him, he will not follow.

      Gypsy
      The gypsy is in the gypsy camp on your route southward. For a
      small donation, she will look in her crystal ball and tell you
      what she sees. She has knowledge of the how Nineve's soul was
      put into the bird you found at Santiago, and how to rescue Nineve
      from the spell. She will also tell of a diseased man who will
      bestow a great gift in exchange for kindness.

      Leper
      The leper is in the city of Evora, damned there because of his
      disease. He might be able to aid your quest if you show him some
      kindness and respect.

      Djinni
      The djinni is a powerful character, and will definitely help
      your party if he is your ally.

      Nineve
      Nineve was kidnapped from Camelot the night of the robbery. She
      was with Sir Breuse when he went to Santiago, but while she was
      there, she was enchanted into the form of a bird. This is the
      bird you've been carrying. A gypsy will tell you that great
      magic is needed to restore Nineve to her natural form.

      Abraca
      On your return to Santiago to give the bell to Bartholomew,
      travel cautiously so that your path does not cross with Abraca,
      who has the support over six hundred soldiers and knights.


      Questions & Answers
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Okay, I was told to head South, but not told where to go!
      How do I find out?

      Talk to everyone! Talk to the travellers, talk to the gypsies.
      They will aid in your quest.

      I went to the gypsy and she told me I need to find a
      diseased man, who will give me a great gift, where do I find
      him?

      By talking to the travellers along the southern route, you
      will be told of a leper colony in Evora. This is the best
      place to look.

      The gypsy also told me to go to Barcelona! When should I go
      there?

      You will definitely need to heed the gypsy's advice about
      going to this city. Be sure to return the bell to Santiago,
      before you do anything else.

      The traveller doesn't tell me anything about the stolen
      bell! How do I get those too?

      While the bell is certainly important, you will find that by
      first finding the diseased man, you will gain information
      concerning the bell.

      I'm in Evora, in the church, but the leper wants money!

      In this case, you definitely want to give him some. Five
      Gold Besants are enough to entice him into offering you the
      Lamp.

      I went to the hospice but the lamp was not there!

      Be sure you go to Evora first. You cannot circumvent
      giving the leper money by not going to Evora.  The lamp
      will only appear in the hospice if you have helped the leper.

      I have the lamp, but what do I do with it?!

      Whoever has the lamp should rub it by clicking on that
      character, then clicking on the USE button, then the lamp
      in the character's inventory. By doing so the Djinni should
      appear willing to do your bidding. Beware, he will appear a
      limited number of times.

      The djinni says he's at my command!! What should I use him
      for?

      The Djinni is a powerful magic user, but you shouldn't waste
      his talents. However, remember that a gypsy said that 'great'
      magic would be required to free the soul trapped inside the
      bird. Surely the Djinni is best for this. Whoever has the bird
      in their inventory needs to drop it. Then click on the djinni
      and click on the 'Magic' button. You should see the Djinni's
      spells in a box. Click on the spell, "Rara Avis", which will
      restore Nineve to her natural form. Nineve will tell you to
      head to Alcantara, where the stolen bell was taken.

      When I left the Hospice, the Djinni disappeared from my party!

      The Djinni can only travel inside his lamp. Whenever you leave
      a city, he will return to his bottle automatically. Each time
      you need him, 'USE' the lamp to summon him, but remember, all
      good things won't last forever.

      I get to Alcantara, and go inside the church, but there is
      no bell to be found, and I searched everywhere! Help!

      The bell is well hidden, indeed.  You need some magic if you
      are to find it. Click on Nineve and click on the 'MAGIC'
      button. Then choose her spell, "TRUE SIGHT", which will cause
      the stolen bell to be visible. Click on the bell to retrieve
      them. Now head back to Santiago to return the bell to
      Bartholomew.

      I get to Santiago to give the bell back, only I can't find it!
      More than likely, Nineve picked up the bell when you clicked on
      them. Click on Nineve and then click on the 'GIVE' button, and
      choose your lead knight from the list.

      How many Gold Besants should I ask for in trade of the bell?
      While Bartholomew is not a rich man, nor is the church affluent.
      He will offer six hundred Gold Besants, and will not give you
      even a single Besant more.

      Gypsy
      The gypsy in the camp by Santiago will aid in your quest
      to go to the City of Brass, for a small donation, of
      course. She will talk of a special silk carpet needed for
      a spell the Djinni must use to get you inside the city of
      Brass.

      Merchants
      In the city of Barcelona there are several merchants
      selling their wares in the street. Some are scrupulous,
      and some are not, so let the buyer beware! Don't believe
      everything they might tell you. They will offer to sell
      you several different types of carpets, a carpet they
      promise with fly, or an ancient carpet blessed by a
      wizard - if that's what your party is seeking.

      Herbalist
      The herbalist sells healing balms and wine.  His wares
      are not that expensive, and this is a good time to stock
      up before the journey to the City of Brass.

      Al-Mansur
      He is not of your faith, and he is not a friend. However,
      seeing as he cannot get inside the city, he will offer to
      help you defeat the strong skeleton army if you help his
      army to get inside the city.


      Questions & Answers
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      The Gypsy tells me that I need a flying carpet to get inside
      the City of Brass, where am I going to get that?!

      Go to Barcelona to get a silk carpet from the merchant inside
      a building. You will also want to purchase a wine bottle from
      the Herbalist outside. On the way to Barcinona, you will pass
      the church Santa Fe De Soria. Leave one knight at the church
      to gain faith points while the rest of your party continues
      on to Barcelona.

      I'm in Barcelona and there are several merchants selling
      carpets! Which one do I buy from?

      The first merchant didn't seem to take you very seriously,
      so he's not a good choice. Go right until you come to the
      door where the Herbalist is outside. Inside you will find
      a merchant who will sell you the silk carpet.

      How much do I offer to buy the silk carpet?

      You must be cautious not to offer too much! Not all merchants
      are scrupulous, but you can buy the silk carpet for twenty
      gold Besants.

      Who do I buy the wine bottle from?

      Buy the wine bottle from the Herbalist outside from the
      merchant you bought the silk carpet from. Once you have
      bought the wine bottle, USE the bottle to get the cork.

      Once you leave Barcelona, send the knight that was at
      Santa Fe De Soria to the city of Zamora while the rest
      of your party heads to the City of Brass.

      Al-Mansur wants my help to get inside the city. Should
      I give it?

      What you have here is a trade between two people. In
      exchange for helping him get inside the city, something
      he cannot do on his own, he will help you fight the army
      inside the city, something you cannot do on your own.
      Because of that, your choices are limited. While you
      cannot trust him, you must at least believe he is a man
      of his word and will keep his end of the agreement.

      Ruy Diaz
      Ruy Diaz is a Christian mercenary who formerly worked for
      the Moslems. He might help your party in exchange for your
      party's aid in his quest to recover Landoine, the daughter
      of Alfonso.

      King Alfonso of Castile
      Located in Logrono, King Alfonso's daughter was kidnapped.
      He has enlisted Ruy Diaz de Bivar to find her.

      Landoine
      She was kidnapped by Al-Mansur and taken into a harem in
      the city of Kurtuba.

      Breuse sans Pitie
      Apparently Breuse is in the dungeon of the city of Kurtuba,
      after being captured by Al-Mansur. He might have some
      information that will help your party in exchange for his
      release.

      Gypsy
      In exchange for some Gold Besants, the gypsy will tell you
      what she knows.

      Guards
      The Guards just outside the city of Kurtuba will not let you
      enter the city. They will fight to their death first.


      Questions & Answers
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      I start to head to Kurtuba, but Al-Mansur is in my way and
      kills my party!

      Move slowly in the same direction as Al-Mansur, but don't run
      into him! He's got over two thousand men with him, and will
      undoubtedly kill your party. Wait a bit for Al-Mansur to move
      away from the City of Brass. Then move down another path to get
      to the Kurtuba.

      Should I hire Ruy Diaz?

      Ruy Diaz has a key to unlock one of the side gates to Kurtuba.
      Your party needs his aid. To repay him, you must save King
      Alfonso's daughter. Fortunately, she is in Kurtuba, so it is
      not out of your way to do so.

      Once Ruy has joined your party, move the party he's in toward
      Kurtuba. You will be headed toward a collision course with
      Al-Mansur. You will need to head south off the path away from
      Al-Mansur to be sure you beat him to Kurtuba. Your two parties
      should meet at Kurtuba and join forces before entering the city.

      I get to Kurtuba, but Al-Mansur got there first, and now he's
      killed everyone!
      You need to get to Kurtuba before Al-Mansur does. Send your
      party down another path to get to Kurtuba so you don't run
      into him. Have whoever you sent to Zamora meet you at the
      city of Kurtuba. If you do not reach it before Al-Mansur,
      restore your saved game and start again. Al-Mansur's army
      is very large, and without a large-sized army on your side,
      your party will have no hope of defeating him.

      I get to the city of Kurtuba, but the city gate is guarded!
      How do I get in?

      There is a gate to the left once you're outside the city on
      the scene level. Click on the left margin of the screen to get
      there.

      Okay, I found the gate to the left, but it's locked, and no
      one in my party  has the key!

      Apparently you didn't heed the gypsy's advice to seek out
      Ruy Diaz. Restore your saved game and recruit him. He has the
      key with him.

      I got inside the city, but there's Moors guarding the palace
      gate! How do I get around them?

      Go inside the house to your left once you enter the city.
      There will be a hole in the floor you can enter through to
      get to the catacombs. Head to the north from the catacombs,
      and then west from the dungeon.

      I found Breuse in a cell. Now he wants my help! Isn't he the
      villain who stole everything in the first place?! Why should
      I help him?

      Breuse is indeed the villain who helped the shadowy figure
      steal the treasures from Camelot. Unfortunately, since Alfonso's
      daughter is in the palace somewhere, he may be your only hope
      if finding her. With his help, you should be able to find the
      Daughter of Alfonso.

      Breuse helped me find the daughter of Alfonso, but where are
      the treasures?!

      Landoine will have a key you need, so be sure to invite her to
      be a part of your party. Head south of the hallway from the room
      where she was held captive and  then go west. You will need to
      battle several Moors before finding the treasure room. Once you
      have reached the treasure room, whoever has in use the Gaunts
      d'Poeir (Gauntlets of Power) should also use Arthur's Helm and
      Shield, as they provide the best defense. Once you have recovered
      these treasures, you will be returned to Logrono where King
      Alfonso is reunited with his daughter.

      In return for the recovery of his daughter, King Alfonso will
      offer Ruy Diaz the use of his full army.

      and Porto, who are being attacked by rogues. Without your
      help they will surely lose. Another  messenger will report
      that there is a revolt in Valencia, and that they need the
      aid of your party to help the inhabitants in their
      revolution against their Moorish masters. In exchange for
      your aid, some of their knights and soldiers will be given
      to your party to help your cause.

      Gypsy
      The gypsy along the route to Valencia will tell you to head
      to Tuliatala to recover Excalibur. She will also tell you
      that the only way to beat the Shadowmaster is to reforge
      Excalibur into the Sword of Vengeance in the fabled Forges
      of Destiny in Tuliatala.

      Dancer
      The dancer in the tavern at Tuliatala will tell you Al-Mansur
      is somewhere in the city, though she does not know where.

      Miguel Salaman
      In the Weapon Shop in Tuliatala, Miguel will help you reforge
      Excalibur into a sword of Vengeance. However, he will need a
      special rare ingredient and the help of Nineve to do so.

      Questions & Answers

      I go to Tuliatala and die immediately! I have the army of
      Logrono! Why can't I defeat Al-Mansur?

      You will need to rally support from other cities before
      going to Tuliatala to do battle with Al-Mansur, who has
      a very large army there to protect him.

      The messengers told me of several cities needing my help.
      Who should I help- Zamora, Porto or Valencia?

      This is a good time to gather more support to prepare
      for your battle with Al-Mansur. While Zamora and Porto
      do need your aid, you do not have enough time to help
      them and get back to Tuliatala to defeat Al-Mansur. By
      that time he will surely have a larger army than you.
      Your best bet is to help Valencia and accept their aid
      in return.

      I'm inside the city of Tuliatala, but I can't find
      Miguel! Where is he?

      Once you're past the city gate, head to the left to
      reach his weapon shop. However, he cannot help you until
      you have Excalibur and the special ingredient needed to
      reforge it.

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Where is Al-Mansur hiding?

      Once you're inside the city, head to the east. There will
      be a gate with several Saracens guarding it. They are not
      difficult to kill, however, and your party should have no
      problem getting inside the fortress. There will also be
      some Moors to contend with. Once you reach Al-Mansur's
      room, your lead knight will have to do one-on-one combat
      with him. He is no easy adversary, and whichever knight in
      your party has the use of Arthur's Helm and Shield and the
      Gaunts d'Poeir (Gauntlets of Power) should do battle with
      him. If your knight loses to Al-Mansur, you should restore
      your game and try again.

      Once Al-Mansur is killed, you will be able to gain possession
      of Excalibur. Again, your lead knight should use this item.
      Now you should search for the meteoric iron which will be
      needed to reforge Excalibur.

      Characters

      Monk
      The Monk in the church will be able to tell you, for
      a small fee, where you might find some meteoric iron.

      Diego Garcia
      Here is our old friend Diego Garcia. In addition to
      wanting payment for his old favor, he will help you
      this time, for something very valuable.

      Dragon
      The dragon in Malorica, once killed, will give you
      the dragon's teeth, which when sown, sprout into
      skeleton soldiers which fight for the sower.

      Questions & Answers
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      I go to Malorica, but I can't find the dragon!

      Look for a small cave; the dragon is inside.

      Do I need to kill the dragon to complete the game?

      No. This is a minor quest. However, without the
      skeleton soldiers which will spring from the
      dragon's teeth, you might not make it to the end
      of the game on your own. Every little bit of aid
      will help your party.

      How do I kill the dragon?

      Use all of your resources, including the magic of
      the Djinni to defeat this foe. Be sure that your
      lead knight isn't killed, however.

      I found the teeth! How do I sow them?

      When you need the aid of the skeleton soldiers,
      click on the character in your party that has the
      teeth in their inventory. Then click on the word
      USE in the action list, and then click on the
      TEETH in the inventory box.

      Diego Garcia wants the Djinni's lamp in exchange
      for the meteoric iron! Should I trade?

      If it weren't for Diego Garcia, you wouldn't have
      been able to get through the Pyrenees and avoid
      the Basques. Your party does owe him for that. The
      Djinni has no doubt been a valuable member of your
      party up until now. Since you cannot beat the
      Shadowmaster without reforging Excalibur, and you
      can't reforge Excalibur without the meteoric iron,
      you don't have a lot of choice.

      Can I kill Diego Garcia to get the lamp and the
      Djinni back?

      You can try to kill him, if you wish. However, take
      caution that men of great faith are very powerful
      and have abilities beyond that of mortal men.


      Episode 7

      Characters

      Gypsy
      The gypsy, for a price, will tell you how to get
      through the labyrinth to reach the Enchanted City.

      Skeleton Guards
      Skeleton guards are loyal to the Shadowmaster and
      are very difficult to kill. Use your best knight,
      or skeleton soldiers to kill them.

      Shadowmaster
      The evil Shadowmaster himself! The ONLY way he can
      be killed is with Excalibur, the Sword of Vengeance.
      It is he who took the most important item from
      Camelot: The Holy Grail which you will need to
      restore Constantine to his natural self.

      Questions & Answers
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      I was making my way through the labyrinth, but I
      fell into a hole and I can't get out! What can I do?

      Unfortunately, this hole has no exit, and you must
      restore your game and start again. Be careful of
      this hole, for you will need to go through another
      that looks just like it to reach the Enchanted City.

      Okay, I've finally made it the Enchanted City but
      my party keeps dying from the skeletons!

      With the help of plenty of mandrake, Nineve's Osteon
      Malakos spell will certainly save your party here.

      How do I avoid the Fell Beast! He kills everyone!

      The fell beast is definitely a tough character to
      destroy. You can go around him though. If you can't
      find the way, go to the cell and rescue the girl,
      then go left, north, left, northeast, and then right.

      How do I defeat the Shadowmaster?! Every time I
      try, everyone dies!

      Before you can kill the Shadowmaster, you must
      first find Breuse and retrieve Arthur's Shield. Only
      a member with very high faith (you did leave someone
      in a church for a few Episodes, didn't you?) can use
      the Citadel scroll. USE the Citadel Scroll on Arthur's
      Shield before doing battle with the Shadowmaster and
      victory will be yours.
