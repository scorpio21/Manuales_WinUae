Fate - Gates of Dawn

# Miras Athran and the cavetrain quest:
Go east a few locations and then north. Find a place where a stone road begins - this is where the inn used to be. Walk around here - there are some useful items lying on the ground - some basic armour and weapon, gloves and so on. Collect them. Then follow the road east and then generally north heading for Larvin (keep track of the road and go where signs point to Larvin). On the way try to talk to characters and make somebody join your party. But try to get to Larvin before night, because the night in the wilderness is not pleasant (if a novice as you are will manage to live through the night at all).
After getting to Larvin try to complete a reasonable party. A wizard, sorcerer, priest and some warriors would do - it's up to you. Try to spend nights in inns and DO NOT SLAY INNOCENTS. Try to trade with different items to gain some money, and keep bigger sums of money in banks in case of getting robbed. Get your party well armed. But mostly talk to people as much as you can to get the plot going. You can often hear new information listening in the pubs. Sometimes you can't get on with your quest if you don't geet some information from the people, so even if you know what to do you should keep on asking - this is not a rule but sometimes happens. You can pay visits to the wilderness too (preferably during daytime), sneaking among the border rocks around the country - there ale a few better items to be found there.
Speaking with people you will find out that Larvin and Laronnes became isolated from the outside world since a mage called Miras Athran, master of the shade ghosts dwelling in the catacombs beneath Larvin stopped the Cavetrain - the only way of transport under the surrounding mountains. Now as he controlls the ghosts that powered the cavetrain it doesn't run. Your first quest is to kill Athran, free the shade ghosts so they will make the cavetrain work again.
You will also learn about a Druid called Mulradin that can help you living on the south island of Larvin. There is only one way through the Catacombs to that isle. Go west from the main gates to location (17,6) in Larvin, then through the wall make a step east (there is a hidden door there). You will see stairs leading down into the catacombs. Before descending make sure you have a few lamps or a LIGHT spell, otherwise you will be walking in complete darkness. It is also good to have an invisibility spell to omit some hard fights in the catacombs. And remember to collect items (most marked on the map) as they can be used or sold.
Go down. Cast LIGHT or ignite a lamp. Go through stairs 24 (on the map of catacombs lev.1) to level 2. There you will find a large boulder on the ground (marked as stairs 22) around there are some chambers with switches. Pull the switch marked S! (if it doesn't work maybe you should pull all of the switches, I don't remember) and return to the boulder - it shoould have moved revealing stairs down. Follow them. On level 3 go to stairs 23 and go up. You can drink from fountains on that level to cure and heal you. Now you are on level 2 again, go up stairs 6 to level 1 and then up stairs 5 to Larvin. Descend again stairs 4 and then ascend stairs 1. You are now on the south isle.
Here you have to loiter for a while asking people until you find the druid Mulradin. He will tell you that Athran can only be slain by an innocent being (a child) and it will need a magic staff called the Gathalak to snatch the shade ghosts at the moment of Athran's death. Thank him. The teleports on the island are now inactive, but if you feel strong enough you can go down staairs 2 and explore the Alarian Vaults (many useful items). If not listen to the news in pubs and return through stairs 1. On the way back go up stairs 3 for a while and if you have a suitable spell (fairy spell REVIVE or RAISE DEAD) or a revive item revive the dead girl you find there. If you can you can try to take her with you and revive her using a RAISE DEAD or REVIVE fountains found in the catacombs. She may become useful. But I think this is not necessary. Now go down the stairs 3 and all the way back to the main part of Larvin.
Now you should find out that there is another way to enter the Catacombs through Lich's Inn. So go there - location (24,42). Rent a room there - but I don't remember which, possibly the suite. If you rent the right room the party will find stairs hidden in it leading down. Go down and now follow the maze - blue crystals on the walls will lead you. On level 3 you will find a map (Map1) telling you to dig at once at the correct places in the correct sequence. This is the Map 1 from the manual (included here in the maps section). It shows you to dig in places: (10,22), (12,21) and (12,23). You will encounter such maps later and always you have to do what they say - fit the corresponding map to a place on the big map and dig, search or do whatever else they say. This is a kind of game protection - but the maps are included here. Now you've done it press the switch (24,21). Teleport G will act normally then allowing you to go down stairs 27.
After making your way down and then up the catacombs again (generaly following the blue crystals, marked BC on the maps) you will find yourself on the middle island in Larvin - the Royal Island, coming from stairs 51. Go to loc (29,32) and talk to Tinius. He will tell you where to find the staff of Gathalak - it's buried nearby at loc (34,29), go and get it. He will also give you a piece of parchment containing clues how to pass the Stone Guardian further in the vaults. This is really a drawing found in the manual - another game copy protection. Alas as I lent my manual I cannot put it here since I retreive it (I hope soon). Take it, then go to (34,28) and move the switch, switching on a set of teleports between the both islands and the main part of Larvin - you now don't have to pass through the catacombs any more to reach the islands.
Sleep, eat, drink and regain health. Before you go further make sure you have a child in the party. If you raised the dead girl maybe she could make do, but I'm not sure. Probably the person should just be below 18. If you don't have a child in the party, you should have a Nymph spell YOUTH, a Potion of Youth or locate a fountain of youth. One may easily be found in the wilderness just outside Larvin - leave the city, go a few steps west and then north. It should be somewhere around the corner of the city border - quite close to the gates. The point is just to make one of your compans young , no matter how. If you've done this or are sure you can do it later then enter the catacombs again using stairs 52. After a while you will meet the Stone Guardian - answer his questions using the clues from the manual (a diagram with gems - sorry, not here yet!) and he will let you pass the stairs to level 2. Make your way down to level 7 again (help yourself with the maps) using stairs and teleports. After using teleport K on level 7 go to (10,15) where you will find MAP 2 asking you to search in specific places in the right order. Use the includeed little manual maps and search in (13,24), (12,22) and (14,22). Then go through the south door in that chamber to the Ancient Crypt where Miras Athran can be found in his chamber at (14,19). Split your party so that the child is alone in a separate party and give him/her the Staff of Gathalak. Then the child alone should enter Athran's chamber and he shall be defeated! The curse is broken and the cavetrain works again!
Make your way back to the Royal Island. Probably the quickest way is going up the escape stairs (stairs 18 on level 7) and then straight up. After getting out in Larvin use the now active teleport E at (27,20) to teleport yourself to the island. Go and see Tinius again. He will reward you lavishly.
Now you can access the cavetrain through the Holo Station at (5,15) or Park Station at (53,41). You can at last leave Larvin and travel to the outside world... and the world is ENORMOUS! The cavetrain makes a round stopping at some stations in different places and then comes back to Larvin, so you can travel "round". Don't forget to buy tickets, theres sometimes a ticket control and if you don't have one someone will get killed! The cavetrain stations will be probably placed in the tips section of these pages. Now enjoy your freedom for a while! But go on asking people about what to do next. The quest has just seriously began!

# Finding and rescuing Mandrag:
Travel around the country by train. Talk to the people, listen to news in taverns... you will find out some interesting facts about the world. You will learn about a city beyond the sea, called Katloch, about Cassida and its citizens, and about Valvice, a city by the sea. You can visit Cassida and talk to people there, but your main aim is Valvice now. The sailors there speak about a mage called Mandrag, who arrived at Valvice years before. He was an enemy of the evil master Thardan. Thardan's minions tried to hunt Mandrag down and one day he disappeared mysteriously. Some say that he was on a quest for a strange stone, hidden somewhere in the Gahmonian Grottos beneath Valvice.
So as you have such a clue, go to location (19,13) in Valvice. Then go north through a hidden door and you will find yourself standing in front of the stairs leading down to the Grottos. Step down. First go north to location (25,34) and take the paintcan item found there. You will probably need a levitate spell to do this to get past the pool of water beside the teleport D. You can use the fountains on this level to regenerate and cure. Then make your way down to level 4 where you will find a "Map 4". Do what it says (search the places), then collect the valuable items from this level (if you want to). Go to location (46,41) where you will find a small statue on the ground and dig there to find a brush. Take this item and go down to level 6. You'll encounter a map, "Map 5" there - do what it says (search the places). You should wonder around the level and using the paintcan and brush paint all the large eyes on the walls found there. Also look at the golden signs on the walls - in each you will find a coloured jewel with a number - remember the colours and numbers associated with them. After you succeed in painting all the eyes, the teleport C should become inactive and you should be able to reach stairs 13 and go down to level 7. There make your way to (31,49) where you will encounter seven coloured jewels stuck in the wall. Press them (I think, but I'm not sure, maybe pull or something else) in the order defined by the coloured jewels found on level 6. If you succeed, you will be able to pass east into a chamber where you find Mandrag. Let him join your party - revive him, feed him and give something to drink if necessary. When he will regain consciousness, he will tell you his story about being captured by the Myrmidons and imprisoned where you found him. He was on a quest for an item called Bergerac's Heart, hidden somewhere in Katloch. But to retrieve the Heart, you will need the Opal Key that opens a magical crypt it's hidden in. The Opal Key is hidden somewhere in the Grottos and you have to find it now. So go for it - this is quite easy if you know where to search. After wondering around the Grottos Mandrag will tell you that he'd heard the Myrmidons speaking about the key being hidden in a magical fountain on the first floor. So go straight back to level 1, and then through teleport G near the exit. You will find the key at (19,42), hidden in the water inside a fountain. Take it and go up back to Valvice.

# Learning about Bergerac and the Moonwand:
Talk to people in Valvice and then in Cassida (though they're not very friendly there). You will learn that the evil master Thardan lives in the so called Forbidden Zone. It is surrounded by two deadly spheres - the outer and the inner one. Everyone not being in the service of Thardan will be instantly killed after entering the inner, magical Death Zone. But an old tale tells that accept of Thardan's slaves only Cassidian mages are able to enter the Death Zone and break the deadly sphere. To cross the zone this mage must additionally carry a legendary, once lost Moonwand which was owned by Thardan a long time before. Alas, no Cassidian mage will want to join you due to the curse cast on Cassida - nobody will probably even want to talk to you there, not telling about joining! And more, the Moonwand was lost long ago and there are few clues what happened to it.
But there still is hope! You will be instructed to talk to the keeper of the Sorion Lake, located west to Cassida. This keeper can be found on a cape on this lake, but seek him during the day - he's not always there. I suppose you don't really have to talk to him, but I'm not sure if the game (question) plot will go on without that talk.
You will learn that Mandrag's master, Bergerac, once an extremely powerful Cassidian mage, was once turned to stone by Thardan. Thardan, after casting his spell took out Bergerac's stone heart so that nobody could undo his curse without killing Bergerac. If, with help of Mandrag who is able to do this, you find Bergerac's heart and bring him back to life then he, being free of the curse cast only on the living, will surely join you on your quest. Legends say that this heart was hidden in the Agyssium, a dreadful, ghastly dungeon beneath the legendary city of Katloch. Katloch is supposed to be found somewhere on an island in the eastern sea, and it as well as the Agyssium is filled with the most dreadful, fearsome Thardan's creatures. Only the bravest and strongest heroes and masters of mystic arts can dare to enter the Agyssium. But to protect the heart better, the entrance to the Agyssium has been sealed by Thardan. Only by using the previously mentioned Moonwand in the middle of the Blood Circle in the centre of Katloch you will be able to enter the Agyssium. You can learn some more about the Agyssium from an old hermit Gideon, living on a small island in the south part of the sea (marked on the map).
So to retrieve the stone heart of Bergerac, you have to find the Moonwand first.
You will discover that the Moonwand, once owned by Thardan, has been broken into seven parts and scattered over the whole land. Some know about what happened with some of the parts. The seven pieces of the Moonwand are: the Dreamstone, the Spiralgem, the Crincross, the Marbeye, the Shadeshag, the Lightpearl and the Erinstaff. Retrieving them all and then joining them into the magical Moonwand is probably the greatest quest in the whole game. So before going any further rest, eat, drink, cure yourself and get equipped with the finest armours and weapons you found up to this point. Also go to Valvice, to the Shipbroker at location (32,9) and buy a ship there - if you don't have enough money get some (it's up to you how...) because a ship is essential to travel the seas. After buying a ship, leave Valvice through the south exit, just next to the Shipbroker and you will find the ship waiting there. Sail for some time and get accustomed to steering. You can board and leave the ship while being next to a piece of land on which you can stand. You can leave the ship anywhere - nobody will steal it and it won't sail nowhere without you... and never forget where you have your ship when you leave it!
So... equipped? Ready to go on?

# Finding the Lightpearl:
One on the parts of the Moonwand is said to be in possession of a hermit, called Rubenock, living in the centre of a forest south-east of Valvice. You will have to look for him there - he is usually wondering around a few locations on a clearing in the middle of the forest, you'll have to find the way among trees to him. Once you find him ask him about the Moonwand - he'll admit that one part of it, the Lightpearl is in his hands. But he will want you to do a quest for him if you want to get it. In fact there are three quests to complete before he gives you the lightpearl.
First, he'll tell you to find a small coffin, buried somewhere in a graveyard in which stands a black monolith. This is quite easy - locate the graveyard, as far as I remember it's somewhere in the west part of the country, in the wilderness. You are able to see it on your jewel-maps because its shape is more regular than the chaotic wilderness. Go there, you should find a mysterious black monolith in the middle of the graveyard. Dig in that place, or somewhere around until you find the coffin. Don't open it! Bring it back to Rubenock.
Second, he will give you a bottle and ask you to fill it up with the water from the oracle of Demon Tower. Take the bottle and go to the Demon Tower - it's on a cape on the west shores of the sea, north of Deathstone (it's briefly marked on my wilderness maps as the Demon Tower). You have to find a way to it from the north, because it's hidden among the rocks. Once you're there, use the bottle you got from Rubenock and fill it (probably, just do something to fill it). But beware! Before filling the bottle cast the spell TIME L (stops the flow of time for a while) because if not a demon of the Demon Tower will jump out of the oracle and instantly kill you! Maybe there's an other way to stop the demon, but I don't know - I used the spell, filled the bottle and quickly ran away before the spell stopped working. Return to Rubenock and hand him the bottle. He'll pretend that he forgot where he had put the Lightpearl and to refresh his memory he will want you to do him another favour.
So third, he will tell you that in the Catacombs of Larvin, on level 2 at position (35,41) there is a small pit with a gem inside defended by a ghastly monster. He will give you a cross to carry so that the monster will be frozen when you enter the pit, and ask you to bring back the gem. So take the cross, go back to Larvin, use teleport E at (27,20) to teleport to the Royal Island and then teleport B at (34,25) to teleport to the southern island. Descend stairs 1, go up stairs 4, down stairs 5 and then down stairs 6 to level 2. Enter the ghastly room beside the stairs, there's the pit in it. One of your characters that holds the cross should descend the hatch and bring back the gem. Return it to Rubenock and after a short spat you he will give you the lightpearl. The first part of the Moonwand is yours!

# Finding the Spiralgem:
The Spiralgem is owned by the fairies of the Fawn Island. Board the ship and find the Fawn Island (its approximate location is marked on the maps), then find the Queen of Fawn Island there. Ask her about the Moonwand and the Spiralgem. She'll help you by giving it to you after you help her, of course. The Queen will tell you that not long before pirates from Pirate Rock attacked their island, stealing some goods, and abducted one of the Fairies called Myriam. You have to find her and bring her back. So board the ship and sail to Pirate Rock Island. Enter Pirate Rock and listen in taverns what the pirates talk about. You will learn that Myriam is imprisoned in one of the local taverns. Go to Black Rock Tavern at (26,9), that's where she is. Before you enter make sure that your party is quite strong and well armed, you must have one place in the party free for Myriam (you may split parties for a while) and, most important, you must have 400.000 piaster to pay the ransom. When you have all this, enter the tavern, listen to the news about Myriam and pay the ransom. Maybe there's a way not to pay, I don't know - I paid it. The pirates will free Myriam and she will join your party. Return to Fawn Island with her and talk to the queen again. She will be very grateful and give you the Spiralgem as well as the permission to improve three abilities and three new spells for each mage in the party.

# Finding the Dreamstone:
People will tell you to seek the keeper of Laronnes, called Ringoes. Seek him at the southern cross of Laronnes, where he appears every day just for one hour at the witching hour. As far as I remember, he's there then between 0 am and 1 am, at location (18,21) in Laronnes. Go there, talk to him and ask him about the Dreamstone. Now, at this point I don't know what you really have to do. Ringoes probably won't want to give you his dreamstone. I asked him several times and he always said 'no'. Maybe the parson who asks should have some attributes pretty high? I don't know, I obtained the Dreamstone almost by accident: not knowing what to do (since Ringoes wants nothing from you, simply doesn't want to give you his Dreamstone) I wondered around Laronnes, sleeping in the inns, and maybe once I had a dream (sometimes you have strange dreams when your party is asleep). Then one time I went to Ringoes and asked him to give me the dreamstone, after the third question he said 'OK!' and passed me it! He just wants you to promise that you will bring it back to him after the quest.
So try asking Ringoes until he gives you the Dreamstone!

# Finding the Crincross:
Some say that it was once buried in the Withering Woods, and that a druid sometimes met by the Moonlake knows more about it. So go and find the druid, his name is Gilmarin and he walks somewhere not far from the south-east shores of the Moonlake (it's a lake near the Moonlake Station, that's where the station's name came from). Talk to him and he will give you a clue to ask the oracle of the Demon Tower about the Crincross. But before asking the oracle any question you must make a special offering - throw a gold coin inside. But where to find such a gold coin? Near the oracle there is a clue carved in a stone to dig around a lonely rock at Zabros Point, maybe you noticed it. So go to Zabros Point (marked on the map, it's a cape south to the Demon Tower), you will really find only one lonely rock there. Dig somewhere around the rock, not far from it and you will find a Goldcoin. Now go to the oracle of Demon Tower (you should already know where it is) and throw the coin inside. Then ask the oracle about the Crincross. It will answer that you should seek the southern edge of the Moonlake, then make 24 steps east and 11 south and dig in the ground there. The exact location of the Crincross is (303,317) - go there and dig in the place before 0 am and 3 am, because that are the only hours the Crincross is visible. Dig it up and take it. Just three more items you have to find.

# Finding the Marbeye:
The Marbeye is said to be once owned by a fearsome corsair, Captain Bloodhawk who had slain over 5000 man during his life. Legends say that he buried his great treasure, including a magical item called the Marbeye on a small, deserted island in the eastern sea. Captain Bloodhawk liked to stay in the taverns of Fainvil during his raids, always choosing the most expensive and finest beds. Some say that his spirit still haunts Fainvil, sending horrible dreams to those who sleep there. That's the clue - so go to Fainvil and spend nights in different taverns and in different rooms. One time you will have a dream sent to you by the ghost of Captain Bloodhawk, in which you will see him dying lonely on a small island. He will be drawing a map that he will show you, presenting the position of his buried treasures. Now you have to match the map that you saw to the real map of the sea and find out what is the place he showed you. The exact location is (561,223) on a small island close to the east shore of the sea (shown on the map of the wilderness). Sail there, dig at the place and you will find the Marbeye.

# Finding the Shadeshag:
A pirate on Valvice or Pirate Rock will mention you that he once head an item named Shadeshag, but he doesn't remember what he did with it. But he'd written its location on a piece of parchment which he then buried in a special place in the NE part of an isle called Carilon. So sail to Carilon (marked on the map), you may find Spock there who will tell you a little bit more about the Shadeshag, but I don't think talking to him is necessary. Go to the north-east part of Carilon, as far as I remember reached from the north by the beach and dig there (this place is marked somehow I think) until you find a piece of parchment. It will tell you to dig in Spectre Wood, at location (50,200) in the wilderness. So if you even can't find the parchment it doesn't matter - go to this location (it's in a forest on the main land) and dig there. You will find the Shadeshag there.

# Finding the Erinstaff:
Near Cassida there is a stone circle in the wilderness. If you stand in the middle of the circle, you will hear a clue: "Two must go down and three must go up, only then can you enter the Erin Crypt". This should help you a bit later. Go to Mernoc City, it's far to the east behind the Outer Death Zone. Travelling there is very dangerous and needs a really tough party. Near Mernoc, north-east to it is a small graveyard, the Mernoc Graveyard with a slab on the ground. The slab is usually closed and blocks the way to the Erin Crypt. In the south part of Mernoc you will find five switches. Before them you will find "Map 3", do what it says. (dig in the appropriate locations). Then you have to position the switches as follows: switch at location (34,14) down, switch (31,14) up, switch (27,15) up, switch (27,14) down, switch (27,13) up (as in the clue - two go down and three go up). These switches are also marked on the map as 17A, 17B, 17C, 17D and 17E. After doing this the slab in Mernoc's Graveyard will move and you will be able to enter the Erin Crypt. Go there, send a character in there and he will bring you back the Erinstaff. Now you have all the seven parts of the Moonwand!

# Fixing the broken Moonwand:
To join the seven parts of the broken Moonwand back together you will have to seek the Chambers of Lhanis. Ask for the Chambers and you will be instructed where you can find them. Seek a small graveyard in the west part of the land, I think the same one that you were in to find the black coffin, the one with the black monolith, but I'm not sure now. When you find it, give Winwood all the seven parts of the Moonwand and split the party so that he is alone in a separate party as only Winwood may enter the Chambers Of Lhanis. Walk around the graveyard between 3 am and 4 am (at dawn) and a glowing gate should appear in the middle of the graveyard. Winwood will enter it and come back with the complete Moonwand! The seven parts have changed into the Moonwand again and vanished, accept the Dreamstone.
Take the Dreamstone back to Ringoes to Laronnes, and he will reward you (with gold and some permissions). Now that you have the Moonwand you can go for the Stone Heart of Bergerac!

# Reviving Bergerac:
Board the ship and travel to Katloch, a cursed city on an island of the same name, located far east on the sea. Be sure to have a strong party, because there are few places you can regenerate in Katloch, and numerous strong groups of dreadful creatures - better try to omit them. Go straight to the centre of the city at (26,24) (marked A' on the map) - this will be the middle of the Blood Circle. Then use the Moonwand there, which will activate teleport A located east to the Blood Circle. Enter it and you will be teleported to (52,1), almost in front of the stairs leading down to the Agyssium. Descend them.
The Agyssium is not complex, but filled with strong creatures and as far as I remember spells as invisibility do not work there. So make your way down to level 7 as quickly as possible, because if you will have to leave the Agyssium to regain strength your effort will be lost - there will be the same amount of creatures there as in the beginning. So you have to find the Heart in one single descend. So go straight to level 7, if you feel strong enough collect some valuable weapons and armour on the way (there is not much though). On level 7 enter the chamber at (12,14) and take the item you will find there - the Heart Of Stone. Leave the Agyssium as quickly as possible, leave Katloch and sail back to Cassida.
Let Mandrag have the Stone Heart. Go to the central square in Cassida, to the memorial place at (26,27) where you will find the stone statue of Bergerac. Let Mandrag use the heart. He will levitate it to the statue and Bergerac will come to life again, and the curse put on Cassida and its citizens will be broken!
Now it's time to hear Bergerac's story. He and Mandrag together, using the Moonwand, are able to neutralise the Inner Death Sphere behind which Thardan dwells so you will be able to enter his kingdom. This will cost them all their powers, and even such strong mages as them are not able to defeat the immortal Thardan, because no mortal weapons nor spells are able to injure him. But Bergerac once knew another mage, a young witch, whose immense magical power was even bigger than Thardan's even when she was a little girl. As this power made her immortal too, Thardan could not kill her but summoning all his powers he cursed her when she was still young and unaware of her strength so that she could not destroy him when she grew up and her powers became too strong for Thardan to match. After cursing her he imprisoned her in the Castle Crypt beneath the once cursed city of Cassida. If you are able to rescue her and take the evil curse off her, she could probably try to defeat Thardan and the world will be free of his evil power again.

# Rescuing Morganna:
Now you will have to find a way to enter the Castle Crypt beneath Cassida. Alas I don't remember how to get to the entrance! You probably have to activate the teleport at (27,31) so that it will teleport you to the entrance located at (7,34) using switches located around the central square, but I'm not really sure because I didn't mark it on my map. Maybe just reviving Bergerac activates the teleport. This is something you have to find out yourself. If you've done it, descend the stairs to the Castle Crypt.
The Castle Crypt is a very complex maze of halls, hidden doors, one-way doors, teleports, switches and traps. It will cost you some time to pass it as you must make your way to level 7. Consult the maps and find the way. You will probably need the LEVITATE spell to get above some damp places, and as far as I remember in one place you will have to split your party so that one party stays in a location so that a teleport is activated, and the other party enters this teleport then. On level 2 you will have to rotate a cross you find on the wall at (44,12), probably to open a passage somewhere. On level 3 touch all the glowing pads on the walls near teleport G to activate this teleport. Also on level 3 use the gems near location (43,49) to activate teleport A. Collect the valuable items on all levels - many of them can be later sold with great profit.
When you finally reach level 7, go to location (35,44). You will find a strange key buried in the ground there - the Bane Key. Then go to (54,21) where you will find a large cage with a strange being in it. Use the Bane Key to unlock the cage and let the strange being named Rabby join your party. This is really Morganna, but she is still cursed. Now you will have to find a way to take Thardan's curse off her.
Leave the Castle Crypt and leave Cassida. Search the lands west to Cassida and Valvice. You should find a clearing in one place in the wilderness with a strange statue of a Stone Lion standing there. It is a little strange to associate the Lion with the curse, but what you have to do is command Rabby to "reach in" the Stone Lion. The Stone Lion will start glowing and Rabby will vanish in cloud of red smoke, and a nice, young lady will appear!
This is Morganna. She will thank you for taking off the evil spell and turning her into a human again. She announces that now she has the power to destroy Thardan. The day of revenge is near! Prepare to stand face to face with the most dreaded, immortal evil mage - Thardan...

# Defeating Thardan:
Before undertaking the final task, equip yourself with the best weapons and armours available. If you have more than one party, create just one containing the most skilled warriors and mages. Be sure that Bergerac, Mandrag, Morganna and Winwood are in this party too, and Mandrag or Bergerac hold the Moonwand. Do not save money any more! Best sell all you can and buy as many crystals as possible - they are the best way to get rid of unpleasant creatures, I think. There is no point in saving money now because this will be your last, most important trip.
When you are ready, go west and enter the Outer Death Zone (where Mernoc's Graveyard is in fact located) and then further west enter the Inner Death Zone. Normally you would get killed, but Mandrag and Bergerac will be able to break the Death Sphere using the Moonwand now. The Inner Death Zone is inhabited by creatures from your worst dreams - some of them extremely tough, so that you will have to use a few crystals to exterminate a party of them. Normally a single crystal would make do, but those creatures are Thardan's best minions, and he knows you are coming for him and tries to defend himself that way.
Best try to follow the road leading into the zone, and you will find Thardan himself in his castle to which the road leads. Face him! After his final confrontation with Morganna, Thardan shall be defeated, loose his might and disappear from that plain, never to come back! Morganna, after gaining all his power, will be then able to create a magical gate for Winwood's return to his real dimension.

This is how this fascinating story ends. After all the adventures, Winwood will be able to wake up in his bed back in his real world and lead a normal life once more. But he will still sometimes miss the mysterious world of Fate... and won't you?


I hope that one fine day Fate II will be released. I've looking forward to it for a few years now, but I didn't completely lose my hope. Not often do you have a chance to enjoy such a brilliant piece of work as Fate - Gates of Dawn. Thanks to all the authors for your wonderful idea, design and work - the mood of a game is most often what makes if really playable. And Fate DOES have a wonderful mood. No doubt.
