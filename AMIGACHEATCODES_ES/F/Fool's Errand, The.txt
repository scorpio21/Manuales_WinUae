The Fool's Errand

    Puzzle Types

Crossword Puzzles

    * The Blacksmith
    * Temperance
    * The Page of Cups
    * The Hierophant
    * The Empress
    * The Boat
    * Most of the Treasure Puzzles 

Jigsaw Puzzles

    * The Sun
    * The Cathedral
    * Strength
    * The Hanged Man
    * The Cloud
    * The Tower
    * The Magician 

Jigsaw puzzles are solved by exchanging pieces (most conveniently done
with the mouse) to create a complete picture. Jigsaw puzzles cannot be
restarted from their original jumbled-up form, so be sure to copy your
.TFE file beforehand if you want to solve the puzzle from the beginning.

Polyomino Puzzles

    * The Farmer
    * The Pentacle
    * The Dancers
    * The Vision
    * The Star
    * The Chariot 

Polyomino puzzles involve the positioning of puzzle pieces to completely
fill a rectangular area and spell out a hidden phrase or words. To get
you started, one of the pieces is fixed in its correct position.

Decryption Puzzles

    * The Knight of Wands
    * The Juggler
    * The Knight of Cups
    * The Knight of Swords
    * The Chant
    * The Devil 

Decryption puzzles sometimes have an initial word or phrase that, when
used, may decode enough of the message so that the rest of it can be
determined.

Maze Puzzles

    * The Archway
    * The Humbug
    * The Maze of Hedges
    * The Hermit
    * The Maze of Thorns (in Treasure Puzzles) 

Most mazes are more easily navigated by putting the game into keyboard
mode. Warning: Mazes do not have a restart command, so be sure to
first copy your .TFE save-game file if you want to replay the maze from
the beginning.

Word Square Puzzles

    * The Queen of Wands
    * The Queen of Pentacles
    * The Queen of Cups
    * The Queen of Swords 

Word square puzzles involve the positioning of nine letters in a 3 x 3
matrix so that six 3-letter words are formed. The center letter in the
matrix is fixed. Word square puzzles have two solutions that are
transposes of each other (rows and columns exchanged).

Word Search Puzzles

    * The Canopy
    * The World
    * The Family
    * The Emperor
    * The Lovers 

Word search puzzles contain words in horizontal (left to right) and
vertical (top to bottom) orientations. The puzzles may be easier to
solve by finding all vertical words first.

Word Formula Puzzles

    * The Fighting Boys
    * The Children
    * The Enchantment
    * The Dream 

Word formula puzzles require a sequence of text operations to be
completed in the proper order. Operations include adding prefixes andor
suffixes to existing text, replacing occurrences of one text string with
another, and reversing the text string. Pay particular attention to the
positioning of spaces separating words.

Mask Puzzles

    * The Singer
    * The Moon
    * Despair
    * Judgement 

Mask puzzles involve the difficult task of displaying or hiding
irregular regions of the screen in order to disclose three hidden
letters, typically in an unusual blocky font style. A button for each
letter of a phrase controls one area of the screen, and overlapping
areas cancel each other out. Solutions given below use carets (^) to
indicate which letter buttons to press.

Hidden-Phrase Puzzles

    * The Page of Wands
    * The Couple
    * The Thief
    * The Sentry 

Hidden-phrase puzzles involve the entry of text which is hidden in some
way in the screen background.

Other Puzzles

    * The Wheel of Fortune (game)
    * The Stone Wall
    * Three Ships
    * The Chapel
    * The High Priestess
    * Justice
    * Death
    * Some of the Treasure Puzzles 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Scroll Puzzles

Scroll puzzles are accessed from the pull-down menus arranged along the
top of the screen.


      The Sun

The Sun puzzle consists of a map in which 21 locations are initially
displayed; turn them all over so that new locations can be easily
identified. Reading the scroll sections from the pull-down menus will
identify many of the initial map locations; for example, a reference to
a lion in Strength (II) and to a strange bird in The Emperor (IV). The
main objective of the first part of the game is to first uncover and
then descramble the Sun map locations. Noting that there are 80 scroll
sections in the pull-down menus and 81 Sun map locations, it should be
obvious that there is a one-to-one relationship between scroll sections
(whether or not they have an associated puzzle) and Sun map locations.
It is therefore imperative that you revisit the Sun map every time a new
scroll section is uncovered, and make a written note describing the
newly-uncovered map location (unless you want to use the sun map
solution given below).

After all puzzles have been solved and all sun map pieces displayed, the
Sun puzzle can be solved. A continuous path through all scroll sections
in order must be created:



On completion of the sun map, the Treasure Puzzles are available.


      The Singer

The Singer is a mask puzzle with solution

	a r e Y O U R e y e s B L I N D
	^           ^ ^   ^     ^   ^ ^

disclosing the three letters

    B O W 


      The Page of Wands

The Page of Wands is a hidden-phrase puzzle in
which hidden text may be found at the bottom of the screen:

    TO THE EAST 


      The Knight of Wands

The Knight of Wands is a decryption puzzle in
which the initial clue

    FBUMSFF = SADNESS 

gets you started toward the solution:

	       WELL
	     HE BEGAN
	   I MET A PAGE
	  IN MY TRAVELS
	AND HE WAS SEEKING
	   THE PYRAMIDS


      The Wheel of Fortune

This puzzle, actually a card game using a simplified Thoth tarot deck,
requires you to beat the "Old Man" computer opponent by accumulating 700
points before he does. At the beginning of every turn, you're allowed to
pick one of three dealt cards to add to your existing two-card hand:

	Old Man's     Dealt      Dealt      Dealt      Your
	Hand          Card 1     Card 2     Card 3     Hand

	Hand                                           Hand
	Card 1                                         Card 1

	Hand                                           Hand
	Card 2                                         Card 2
	(hidden)

We found the game to be too sensitive to mouse clicks, and recommend
using the arrow keys to select cards after configuring the game for
keyboard mode. A general strategy is to choose the dealt card that will
maximize the value of your own hand while preventing the possibility of
a high hand being created by your opponent. A "pass" or yield option is
available by pressing the Y key if you feel more would be lost by
allowing your opponent to take any of the dealt cards. The best
combinations for each card (ranked from best to worst) are:

	Card		combined with			makes

	Death		High Priestess,Devil		Dark Pair
	Magician	Fool				High Pair
	High Priestess	Death,Devil			Dark Pair
	Hierophant	Justice,Judgement,Temperance	Council Pair
			Emperor,Empress,Hanged Man	Royal Pair
	Devil		Death,High Priestess		Dark Pair
	World		Moon,Star			Astral Pair
	Moon		World,Star			Astral Pair
	Star		World,Moon			Astral Pair
	Justice		Hierophant,Judgement,Temperance	Council Pair
	Judgement	Hierophant,Justice,Temperance	Council Pair
	Strength	Hanged Man,Hermit,Chariot	Mortal Pair
	Emperor		Hierophant,Empress,Hanged Man	Royal Pair
	Empress		Hierophant,Emperor,Hanged Man	Royal Pair
	Hanged Man	Strength,Hermit,Chariot		Mortal Pair
			Fortune Wheel,Lovers,Fool	Lucky Pair
	Hermit		Hierophant,Emperor,Empress	Royal Pair
			Strength,Hanged Man,Chariot	Mortal Pair
	Fortune Wheel	Hanged Man,Lovers,Fool		Lucky Pair
	Temperance	Hierophant,Justice,Judgement	Council Pair
	Tower		Chariot,Lovers,Fool		Low Pair
	Chariot		Strength,Hanged Man,Hermit	Mortal Pair
			Tower,Lovers,Fool		Low Pair
	Lovers		Hanged Man,Fortune Wheel,Fool	Lucky Pair
			Tower,Chariot,Fool		Low Pair
	Fool		Magician			High Pair
			Hanged Man,Fortune Wheel,Lovers	Lucky Pair
			Tower,Chariot,Lovers		Low Pair

The rankings of the pairs are:

Pair		Cards						Score

High Pair	Magician,Fool					81
Dark Pair	Death,High Priestess,Devil			72
Astral Pair	World,Moon,Star					63
Council Pair	Hierophant,Justice,Judgement,Temperance		54
Royal Pair	Hierophant,Emperor,Empress,Hermit		45
Mortal Pair	Strength,Hanged Man,Hermit,Chariot		36
Lucky Pair	Hanged Man,Fortune Wheel,Lovers,Fool		27
Low Pair	Tower,Chariot,Lovers,Fool			18

A triplet of cards from the same pair group beats any pair. Likewise, a
pair beats any single card. A winning high card scores 9 points. A
winning pair gains the score shown above. Triplets (all three cards from
the same pair group) score an additional 72 points beyond the pair
score. Tying pairs or triplets are ranked by the highest card they
contain, using the basic card ranking in the first table above.

Armed with the tables above, you should be able to win a game relatively
quickly. However, you will eventually win a game no matter what
choices you make, so if you want to get on with the rest of The Fool's
Errand without playing the Wheel of Fortune, you can hold down the
Enter key for a few minutes until you win.


      The Archway

The Archway is a maze puzzle in which secret doors and
panels may open or close unexpectedly as you try to maneuver the white

      Three Ships

In the Three Ships puzzle, you must click on the "?" icon, but if your
mouse cursor gets too close to it, it jumps away! Using the clue in the
solution to the Devil puzzle, note that typing in N, E, S
or W on the keyboard causes the icon to move in the corresponding
compass direction, without moving your mouse cursor. Exploit this trick
to solve the puzzle by moving the icon to the cursor (rather than the
other way around) using the keyboard keys for the compass directions.

The 1st Key of Thoth. On completion of the Three Ships puzzle, you'll
momentarily see the message "Behold the 1st Key of Thoth", and your
mouse cursor will change from a white arrow into a golden key. At this
point you can complete the unfinished High Priestess puzzle.

    L5 U3 L6 D6 R11 U3 R4 U3 R9 D12 L15 D5 

The 2nd Key of Thoth. On completion of the Humbug maze, you'll
encounter one of the animated or arcade-like puzzles in the game. Here,
the object is to successfully click on each of four stationary pink
squares against a randomly-changing background. In keyboard mode, a
reliable way of solving the puzzle is to move the arrow cursor to the
extreme upper right-hand corner and then use the move sequence

    L17 D10 [Enter] U8 R11 [Enter] R4 D10 [Enter] U6 L9 [Enter] 

at which point the target areas are displayed on a static screen:

      The Star

      The High Priestess

To solve the first High Priestess puzzle ("The 99 Enchantments"), click
on each of the numbers 99,...,1 in descending order. The number you're
currently looking for will be shown in the "Enchantments" title at upper
right. When you get down to 32, the numbers will start to reposition
randomly on the screen, with the dwell time decreasing as you approach
1. The last number is particularly difficult to click on, but with
vigorous mouse clicking in previously-visited regions, you'll eventually
get it.

On completion of the 99 Enchantments, you'll be viewing a large Eye of
Horus with the cursor rubberbanded to the center of the eye. To complete
this puzzle, you'll need the 1st Key of Thoth from the Three Ships puzzle.

The Book of Thoth. When you've completed the Three Ships puzzle and
your mouse cursor has changed into a golden key, move the cursor to the
center of the Eye of Horus symbol in the High Priestess puzzle to
display the Book of Thoth animated puzzle. Switch to keyboard mode.
Follow the same solution sequence you used to solve the 2nd Key of Thoth
part of the Humbug puzzle, but here the stationary pink
squares are now invisible: Move the arrow cursor to the extreme upper
right-hand corner and then use the move sequence

    L17 D10 [Enter] U8 R11 [Enter] R4 D10 [Enter] U6 L9 [Enter] 

Next, switch back to mouse mode and follow the solution sequence for the
3rd Key of Thoth part of the Justice puzzle: Drag the left
side of the display to the right, painting the screen purple. Continue
by dragging from right to left (blue), top to bottom (red) and bottom to
top (gray).

Finally, switch to keyboard mode and follow the solution sequence for
the Last Key of Thoth part of the Hermit puzzle: Position
the point of the cursor in the extreme lower-left corner of the blinking
grid, then move

    R6 U1 [Enter] R3 U2 L2 U2 R2 U3 L3 U4 R7 D4 L3 D3 R2 D2 L2 D2 R3 

You'll then see the Treasure Puzzle, but won't be able to access it
until later. Press [Enter] a couple of times to return to the scroll.

	   TO COME TO YOU


      Death

Death is an animated puzzle the object of which is to click on the white
eye symbol without being "hit" by the red eye symbol. On a
reasonably-fast PC, this is virtually impossible without halting the
animation in some way. To solve the puzzle, move the mouse cursor to the
menu bar at the top of the screen. Click and hold on the "-I-" item to
pull down its menu. Drag the mouse cursor down to the white eye symbol
at the bottom left of the screen. Release the mouse button, then click
the mouse without moving it. The timing is a little sensitive, so this
procedure may have to be repeated a few times until the puzzle is solved.

    The Treasure Puzzles

All treasure puzzles (except the Maze of Thorns) are best played in
mouse mode. When the Sun puzzle has been completed, fourteen
treasures must be identified and entered in the Book of Thoth crossword
puzzle displayed by clicking on the scroll icon above the lower-right
corner of the sun map. Each of these treasures is identified by a clue
that gives some idea of where to discover the treasure. Some of these
clues contain "code words" indicating the disposition of letters in the
crossword solutions:

    Confused: Letters must be unscrambled
    Within: The treasure will be found in a secondary crossword puzzle
    on the sun map
    Disguised: Letters must be decrypted 

Note that some treasures are both scrambled and encrypted.
Decryption can be performed using one of four decoders
available on the sun map where there are double borders bracketing the
map square boundaries vertically or horizontally; to use one, enter the
text to be decoded or press the space bar to restart. Four secondary
crossword puzzles are accessible on the sun map where grids of
blue-and-white squares are shown. Additional secondary puzzles are found
in the Straight Path, Maze of Thorns and Wheel of Fortune map locations.

The name of the scroll section corresponding to any sun map location is
displayed by pressing the Shift key when the cursor is on the square.
Other new game control features are described by clicking on "The Sun"
menu item at the top of the screen.

The game is completed when all fourteen treasures have been entered into
the Book of Thoth crossword puzzle; disclosing a final treasure for the
Fool. These treasures can be entered into the puzzle as soon as they are
known; it is not strictly necessary to first solve an associated
secondary puzzle.

Some of the secondary puzzles are themselves interesting challenges, but
frankly, some of the treasures and the arrangements of their supporting
puzzles seem to be derived in rather arbitrary ways from the clues given
in the scroll sections and on the sun map; several solutions or
combinations different from the "right" one are sometimes equally
consistent and logical. For those needing an "easy way out" for the
Treasure Puzzles, all solutions may be found within the main game
executable file immediately after a record containing "SOUP". Also,
visual indications of the treasures are displayed by the separate
"FINALE" program.


      The Kings are confused

From the sun map, collect the letters O, E, A and R from the locations
for the Kings of Swords, Pentacles, Cups and Wands. In the corresponding
scroll sections in menu V, obtain the red letters N, Z, T and U. In the
scroll sections for the kingdoms themselves (The Wand, The Pentacle, The
Cup and The Sword), get the red letters S, B, T and E. Unscramble the
twelve letters to derive the name of the treasure:

    BRONZE STATUE 


      Within the Kingdom of the Pentacles

The treasure can be found by solving the secondary crossword puzzle
located at the boundaries of The Page of Pentacles and The Merchant map
locations. Eight 3-letter words are entered using information in the The
World, Strength, Temperance, The Hanged Man, The Blacksmith, The
Cathedral, The Chapel and The Humbug scroll sections:

	Y E *S*
	E R *A*
	*S* I *P*
	*T* O *P*
	*A* I *H*
	*R* O *I*
	M Y *R*
	F I *E*

The highlighted letters give the name of the treasure:

    STAR SAPPHIRE 


      The Queens are confused

From the scroll sections for The Queens of Wands, Pentacles, Cups and
Swords, obtain the four magic words CLAC, TRSC, YNAL and EKE. Unscramble
the fifteen letters to derive the name of the treasure:

    CRYSTAL NECKLACE 


      Within the Kingdom of the Wands

The treasure can be found by solving the secondary crossword puzzle
located at the boundaries of The Canopy, The Watchtower, The Fighting
Boys and The Stone Wall map locations. Sixteen 3-letter words are
entered using information in the four corresponding scroll sections:

	*R* E D | *R* A T
	*U* R N | *I* V Y
	------+------
	*B* A D | *N* E W
	*Y* A M | *G* N U

The highlighted letters give the name of the treasure:

    RUBY RING 


      The Path of Six is disguised

Solving this puzzle requires careful reading of the scroll sections. In
the Three Ships section, note the highlighted reference to "the first of
six", obtain the letters RW and note the reference to chasing a fish. In
the Page of Cups section describing a fish chase, get the letters KD and
note the reference to a woman holding two swords. In the Chant section
describing a woman with two rusty swords, obtain the letters EZC and
note the reference to a family departing by boat. In the corresponding
Boat section, pick up the letters YH and note the reference to a broken
wheel. In the Chariot scroll section describing a broken chariot wheel,
obtain the letters HA and note the reference to a thief stealing seven.
Finally, in the Thief section, pick up the letters RW and note the
highlighted reference to "the last of its kind". This phrase indicates
that you have found all necessary letters:

    R W K D E Z C Y H H A R W 

Process these letters through the decoder on the sun map between The
Dead Warrior and Justice locations to obtain the name of the treasure:

    ONYX MEDALLION 


      The mystic chant is disguised

In The Stream scroll text may be found a reference to a mystical chant:

	N Z S L T Z M B   H G Z U U

Process these letters through the decoder on the sun map between The
Madness and The Page of Wands locations to obtain the name of the treasure:

    MAHOGANY STAFF 


      The Knights and Pages are confused

Collect eight green capital letters on the sun map locations
corresponding to the Knights and Pages of Wands, Pentacles, Cups and
Swords:

    D S L U T D O G 

This doesn't sound like a treasure! Unscramble the eight letters to
derive the name of the real treasure:

    GOLD DUST 


      The Maze of Thorns is disguised

Change to keyboard mode and select The Maze of Thorns sun map location.
To traverse this Rogue-like maze, you'll need to find various
inventory items (amongst some red herrings) to pass various entities
blocking your passage, and eventually make your way to the exit at
right. 

The first inventory item, a four-leaf clover, is inaccessible until
"eleven are seen"; that is, until all eleven blocks are first
identified. From the initial white dot location, follow the move sequence

      The Hierophant is disguised and confused

In The Hierophant scroll text, note the reference to four others coming
before. From The Hierophant and the preceding four scroll sections (The
Cloud, The Vision, The Enchantment and The Abandoned Cups), obtain the
numbers

    6 13 15 2 20 14 8 15 16 16 15 24 2 

Use the dark-blue text in the corners of the sun map squares to decode
these numbers into letters:

    A D E R O W F E L L E M R 

Unscramble the thirteen letters to derive the name of the treasure:

    EMERALD FLOWER 


      If justice be done

In the Justice scroll section, note the reference to the Emperor taking
what is his from what is hers. Could this mean some sort of letter
subtraction? In the Emperor scroll section are the letters

    WIF DOVE 

and in the Empress scroll section are

    VILE SHADOW FIVE CIRCLE 

Removing the seven Emperor letters from the twenty Empress letters leaves

    V I L E S H A C I R C L E 

which can be unscrambled to derive the name of the treasure:

    SILVER CHALICE 


      Within the Kingdom of the Swords

The treasure can be found by solving the secondary crossword puzzle
located at the boundaries of The Book of Thoth (High Priestess), The
Sentry, The Dream and The Nightmare sun map locations. Twenty-five

Warrior, The Warrior and The Singer scroll sections, as well as the nine

sun map:

	Q *M* | P U *S*
	Z *A* | B O *W*
	----+------
	E *G* | O N *O*
	L *I* | R O *R*
	O *C* | D N *D*

The highlighted letters give the name of the treasure:

    MAGIC SWORD 


      Follow the straight path

In The Hermit scroll section preceding The Straight Path section, note
the reference to starting with the letter J. In the Judgement scroll
section following The Straight Path section, note the directions

    4 North
    7 West
    3 North
    8 West
    6 South
    5 East
    9 North 

If this information is plotted out on a grid, you'll see that the
covered area extends 10 rows above and 15 columns to the left of the
starting point. Select The Straight Path sun map location. In the array
of letters, the only "J" that has the required area above it and to its
left is located in the second row from the bottom and the fourth column
from the right. Select this letter, then follow the compass directions
above to derive the name of the treasure:

    JADE IDOL 


      Within the Kingdom of the Cups

The treasure can be found by solving the secondary crossword puzzle
located at the boundaries of The Family, The Children, The Couple and
The Dancers map locations. Twelve words are entered using information in
The Dancers, Despair, The Knight of Pentacles (scrambled words), The
Pyramids, The Page of Wands, The Knight of Wands, The Devil, The Couple,
The Star, The Family and The Not-A-Merchant sun map locations:

	G R I *E* F
	      *W* H E A T
	R I C *E*
	      *L* E A P

	D E A *D*
	      *C* A R E
	    E *R* R
	    C *O* R N
	      *W* I S H
	  N I *N* E

The highlighted letters give the name of the treasure:

    JEWELED CROWN 


      Eight in the land are disguised

The "eight" here refers to the eight large yellow letters on the sun
map. In path order, they are:

    D R B U F V Y U 

Process the eight letters through the decoder on the sun map between The
King of Pentacles and The World locations to obtain the name of the
treasure:

    AMETHYST 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Endgame

After the names of all fourteen treasures have been entered into The
Book of Thoth crossword, the final treasure is disclosed:

    THE GIFT OF WISDOM 

To view the endgame sequence, type FINALE at the DOS prompt. The Fool
must confront The High Priestess one last time, and solve the final riddle


Although the Fool gives the answer as

    THE BOOK OF THOTH 

another interpretation is obtained by converting the capital letters in
the High Priestess's riddle:

	B -> D
	H -> A (once)
	K -> L
	O -> E (once)

The resulting letter sequence

    T A E D E O L O F T H O T H 

can be descrambled into

    DEATH TO THE FOOL 

which is a "death sentence" the Fool wisely avoided!
