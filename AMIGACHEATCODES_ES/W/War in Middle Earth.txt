                               Quick Solution

The method detailed in this listing, to completing the game, should only
be viewed as the quickest way, and therefore will vary greatly from the
way the game was originally meant to be played.

1) The first step to be taken is to send the ring-bearer to some safe
location away from the clutches of the Nazguls.  I have found that sending
the ring bearer to the west is probably the safest place.

2) Nothing much can be done at this stage until Saurons army is on the
move.  Once you gain control of the forces of good the first moves that
must be made are those concerning the Rohirrim, displayed as horse icons.
Send all of the Rohirrim to Edoras, this will give you a large army which
will be needed to defend against massive attacks from Orcs and Uruk-Hai.
Should Edoras fall to the forces of Sauron then his victory will be
assured and the game will end in your defeat.

3) From this point on it would be advisable to save the game frequently as
one wrong move, or a battle that goes wrong will ensure victory for
Sauron.

4) Send all of the forces of good (except the Rohirrim) to Mt.Doom or
Barad-Dur, remembering that more and more forces will become available to
you as the game progresses.  You will find that the forces of good will
find their own way there and in there own time, this will probably mean
that large losses may be sustained by you as your forces may appear to be
spread pretty thinly.  Meanwhile in Mordor, Saurons army should be
spreading across the map, this means that if you are careful you can avoid
confrontations and reach Mordor in pretty much one piece.

5) If things have gone according to plan the 10,000 Orcs encountered at
the Morannon gates should have been overcome by the forces of good
continually arriving there, if however large forces of Orcs are still
present it may be worth trying to go over the mountains.  Once sufficient
forces have entered Mordor it only becomes necessary to overcome the
5,000 Orcs at Mt.Doom.  If after Mt.Doom is captured and you still have
large forces available you can try over running Barad-Dur, but I found
surrounding it much easier as the game at this point is almost complete.

6) To finish the game all that is now required is to get the ring to
Mt.Doom.  The quickest way to do this is to send the ringbearer to the
nearest encampment of Orcs, poor Frodo gets killed and a Nazgul is
summoned to return the ring to Sauron.  Nazguls don't sleep so the
journey to Barad-Dur will not take very long, the only thing that you
must ensure to do is to intercept the Nazgul with the forces that are
surrounding Barad-Dur.  Once you are in possession of the ring take it
to the now Orc free Mt.Doom.  That is all that is needed to end the game
on a winning note!
