War Zone (Core)


 CHEAT MODE:

 Allegedly pressing [F1], [F2] and [F3] in quick succession on the
 title screen gives both players infinite lives.
 But because I couldn't get this to work on my version of the game
 I rang up the Core Design help line and asked why, the answer was,
 and I quote "it's a load of bul!$hit that's why".
 But the rearly strange thing about all of this is that some time
 latter I decided to try it again, and guess what, it actualy started
 the game off with about 45 extra lives. Since then I've never got it
 to work again. Go figure?
