Warhead

The very first time you attack the berserker, hit him with everything
you have, including the MDC.  He will then keep following you.  When
Solbase says to take him anywhere, go to CH010 and he will get sucked
into a black hole.

To evade missiles, your best bet is to fly away backwards in front of
them at a range of about 3000m.
