                                WARLORDS (SSG)
                                --------------

DO NOT START A WAR, BEFORE YOU HAVE CLAIMED IT. IF YOU DO THAT, YOU CAN BE
           UNLUCKY, AND THE OTHER WARLORDS WILL BE AGAINST YOU.

 PUT YOUR ARMIES TOGETHER BY USING "ARMYBONUS": SPIDERS IN CASTLES, HEAVY
                      CAVALRY I OPEN LANDSCAPE ETC...

DO NEVER LET A CASTLE BE UNGUARDED NEAR BY THE ENEMY, EVEN NOT IF THERE IS
             PEACE. YOU'LL JUST RISK THAT HE WILL BURN IT OFF.

 IN THE START, IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO PRODUCE 'GIANT BATS' OR SOMETHING LIKE
THIS. THEY CAN WATCH THE TEMPELS AND THE RUINS, UNTIL YOU GET A HERO THERE.

   USE YOUR HEROES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE IT'S BEST WHEN THEY ARE
'PALADIN'. THE HEROES MUST ALSO HAVE SOME 'ITEMS BONUS' BECAUSE THE STACK THE
                 HEROSE IS IN, ARE GROWING MUCH STRONGER.

IF A HERO HAVE GOT A 'QUEST', IT  H A V E  TO BE SUCCEDED, BECAUSE YOU WILL BE
                            AWARDED AS A KING.
