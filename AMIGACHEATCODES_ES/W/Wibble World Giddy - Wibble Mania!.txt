                        WIBBLE WORLD GIDDY
                        ==================

If this cute PD game is causing you problems then read on for the 
complete solution...

The first puzzle couldn`t be easier if all you had to do was press a 
large red button with a gigantic sign above it saying `Please press this
button`. On the start screen you`ll find a bucket of water. Walk to the
right until you come to a large fire and use the bucket of water to douse
it! From here on in things get a little harder but not much.

Head to the right, stopping to climb the tree laden with coins as you`ll
find an aerosol can at the top. Keep going to the right, collecting coins
as you go on, and you`ll come to a hole in the ground. Drop into this and
collect everything you find down there, namely coins and a large sticking
plaster.

Leave the hole and continue to the right. Drop down the next hole and
you`ll come across a huge cork, just right for plugging large holes. I`m
sure there`s a joke there, but I`m not going to make it. Leave this hole
and keep going right all the way until you come to the balloon. Take this
and go right another couple of screens and you`ll come to an Atari ST 
left in a bin. Collect it, go right again, and collect the coins you find
on the next screen.

Now return left all the way back to the Atari fan. Give him the ST and
he`ll give you a sweaty sock (sounds like a fair swap!). Go right over 
the next six screens and drop down the hole next to the `Men At Work`
signs. Head to the left, collecting coins, and then head as far right as
you can, still collecting coins. Before long you`ll see a burst pipe. Use
the sticking plaster on this to fix it, and get the tin of Drab Clear 
from the next screen.

Leave the hole and head right. When you come to the volcano, plug it 
with the cork (obviously) and carry on right. Drop down the next hole you
come to, collect the coins, leave it, head right and drop down the next
hole to the right. To get the large boulder out of your way use the
balloon to lift it. Get the oil can, go back out and head right once 
more.

Use the tin of Drab Clear on the alien plant to kill it, jump the next 
two holes you come to and spray the aerosol on the sad snowman to kill 
him. Head down the next hole and collect all the coins. Leave and head to
the right. Take the magnet from the North Pole, while sailor`s all over
the world start to change bearings.

Continue right, taking all the coins you come to, and before long you 
will reach another hole. Enter and use the sweaty sock to get rid of the
snake. Use the glue on the broken LP to fix it. By this stage you should
have 51 coins. Here`s the tricky part. You now have to head back to the
left all the way back to the last shop you saw. Use the coins to buy a
spade and go down the hole to the right.

Step to the edge of the water and use the magnet to get rid of the 
cabinet. Jump across and get the red boots. Leave the hole and go right 
a mamoth sixteen screens. Give the LP to the hippy and go right two
screens. Use the spade on the radioactive glop. Head right two more 
screens and use the oil on the rusty spikes. Right once more and use the
boots on the dinosaur. Now you just need to walk right, and the game is
complete!
