Worms

On the title screen, Type in "TOTAL WORMAGE" for SHEEP MODE.  If
you are using a joypad press GREEN, UP, PAUSE, PAUSE, YELLOW
(which spells GUPPY - a tribute to the late Bananafish).  This gives
you 3 sheep, 1 banana bomb and a minigun straight away (go into
Weapon Options if you need an UNLIMITED SUPPLY of sheep)

The "legendary prod move" is a not available in any shops.  To
activate get next to your victim and press AWAY, AWAY, TOWARDS, 
TOWARDS (in other words, if your worm is facing right press left,
left, right, right)

The custom level option is EVEN MORE EXCITING than you thought.  You
can set the gravity, friction, sky and water colours for your levels.
Instead of saving your level as FISHCAKE.WRM, save it as
FISHCAKE.????.WRM (the 4 question marks being 4 numbers).

The first number is gravity and can be between 1 and 5 (1=very low,
3=normal 5=very high).  Mars and alien levels have a gravity of 2.

The second number is friction and can be between 1 and 5 (1=very low,
3=normal, 5=very high). Arctic and alien levels have a friction of 2.

The third and forth numbers are the sky and water colours and can be
between and 9 - fans of green water can now have a matching green
sky.

You can also make your own message appear, when your level is chosen,
by giving your level file a comment.  Do this by clicking on the
level icon and choosing "Information" from the Workbench menus.
