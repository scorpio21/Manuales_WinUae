Captain Planet


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the level select page type in 'GO PLANET'. Now when you start the
 game press [F10] and the [Return] key together to go back to the level
 selection page where you should be able to select any level.

 Complete the Fire level and then get killed on the Water level.
 Now type 'BBBB' into the high score table for infinite continues.

 Finally, if you just happen to have a copy of Captive then try this.
 During the level select screen, insert the Captive disk in the drive
 and press Fire. Then when you get a disk error message, insert the
 correct disk to activate a cheat mode.
