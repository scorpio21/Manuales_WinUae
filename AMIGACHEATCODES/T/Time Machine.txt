Time Machine


 CHEAT MODE:

 Enter your name as 'DIZZY' into the high score table for infinite lives.
 This also enables keys [1] to [4] to change zones and [A] or [S] to
 change screens in a particular time zone.


 PLAYING GUIDE:

 All you need to know before we begin is a brief explanation of the
 terminology used for the zones and screens within. Zone One, Screen Three
 is represented by 1.3 (the horizontal strip of screens is numbered from
 left to right, so Screen One is to the far left). As fate would have it,
 you do in fact start by the geysers in 1.3...

 Creation Of Zone Two
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1> To start with, you must transport the mammals to the cave in 1.5.
    Go to 1.2 and place a Travel Pod there. Go to 1.5 (use the Pterodactyl
    to cross the river) and place another Travel. Pod by the cave.
    Go back to 1.2 and use your Beamer to stun a mammal. Stand next to the
    stunned mammal so it is displayed in the 'Look' window. Now transport
    yourself and the mammal to the Pod in 1.5. Repeat the above several
    times. (you can have up to 16 mammals in the cave at a time.
    You may transport mammals even after you have created Zone Two).

 2> Go back to 1.3 and block up the geysers and Zone Two will now be
    created.

 Creation Of Zone Three
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1> The first objective is to make a fire by the cave in 1.5 to keep the
    apemen warm. Place a pod by the cave, remembering that fires last
    longer in the green area. Go to 2.2 and find wood to transport to 2.5.
    Go to 2.1 and stand in the middle of the screen on the solid patch.
    Go back to 1.1 in the First Zone and transport the flame to 2.5 to
    ignite the wood. If the fire goes out then just idnite it again.

 2> Now you must unblock the geysers to warm up the planet. The Yeti
    doesn't like warm weather and so will try to keep the geysers blocked.
    Distract him by feeding him fish from 3.4 and apples from 1.2.
    Once you have succeeded unblocking the geysers you will have created
    Zone Three.

 3> Now you need to plant seeds in 2.4. Place a pod on the river bank
    (in the green area by the existing plants) and transport apples from
    1.2. Repeat this for both river banks.

 Creation Of Zone Four
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The main task before you is the transportation of the round wheel from
 3.2 to 3.5. If you planted the seeds in 2.4 then you should have trees in
 3.4. You need to take the wheel across the river, so you must break the
 branches of these trees to form a bridge. Use the Pterodactyl in Zone One
 and as you cross the river change zones so that you drop onto the
 branches. Repeat this for the branches on both sides of the river and you
 can then take the wheel across. There is, however, a more sneakier way of
 taking the wheel across. Carry it to 3.3 and enter the hut. You will now
 appear in hut 3.5. Now just walk up to the square wheel and drop the
 round wheel. Talk about re-inventing the wheel!

 Creation Of Zone Five
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1> The first thing you have to do is destroy Goliath. Get a powder barrel
    from 4.5. To avoid the cannon ball, stand in the middle of the screen
    in 3.5 and change to Zone Four. Take the barrel to 4.4 and drop it as
    near to the right of the bridge as you possibly can. Place a pod near
    the barrel and wait for Goliath to get near it. Now transport a flame
    from 1.1 to ignite the barrel and, in the ensuing explosion, destroy
    Goliath.

 2> Now you have to reveal the oil source. Take another barrel from 4.5,
    take it to 4.1 and drop it by the moving rock-this is the oil source
    you are looking for. Place a pod near the barrel and ignite it to
    dislodge the rock and reveal the source.

 Repairing The Time Machine
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1> To start with you need to recover the crystal for the time machine.
    Kill a few terrorists in 5.5 and wait for a bomb. Transport this bomb
    to 1.1 by the rock with the crystal in it and ignite it to dislodge
    the crystal from the rock. You won't be able to find the crystal in
    the swamp as it's too deep, but you can find it in 2.1 if you search
    for it. Place a pod in front of the time machine and transport the
    crystal to it.

 2> Now you need to switch power to the time machine. There is a power
    switch on top of the building above the VID OIL sign in 5.1. Use the
    Pterodactyl to land on top of the building and beam at the switch to
    turn the power on and off. However, you must make sure that the
    crystal is in the time machine before you switch the power on.
    Once the crystal is in place and the power is on, just get inside the
    time machine and do a pick up and you will have completed the
    adventure.
