                                   Hints

When the Werewolf appears you have only one move to get rid of him, so go to
another location immediately.

When a giant Eagle appears which transports you to another location in the
game, you must start your game over at your last save position, so save your
game frequently.

If you have loaded your gun with the silver bullet and the Werewolf appears:
"Shoot Werewolf" and he makes no problems in this adventure.

In the castle, if you meet the Vampire, just show the cross to him and then
drop the cross.
