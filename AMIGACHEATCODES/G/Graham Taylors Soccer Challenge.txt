 PLAYING TIPS:

 Training
 ~~~~~~~~
 For optimum results, train four times a week, and use team training as
 often as possible. Select your training method carefully as each
 programme will have different effects on your players skills; for example
 Circuit Training for stamina, Outdoor Game for overall skills/set piece
 practice, and Indoor Game for passing. Avoid prolonged use of any single
 method, as this can reduce player morale and may also lead to injury.
 In June you may give your players a break, but resume training in July.

 Transfers
 ~~~~~~~~~
 Before getting a player on loan it's wise to know how good he is, as even
 a player from a higher division may have lower skills than most of your
 own squad. Find an available player first and, when asked how many weeks
 you require him for, enter a very high figure. This should abort the
 loan, and then enable you to send out a scout to have the player watched.
 Compare his skills with those of your own players and, if suitable, go
 and borrow him. When placing players on the transfer list, try not to
 price them too highly, or you may scare offother clubs.
 Examine a player's value from the Contracts screen and use a similar
 figure to this. Remember either to send a scout or watch a player in
 action before purchasing to avoid wasting valuable cash.
 As you climb the leagues, think about getting rid of as many of your old
 players as you can, this enables you to replace them with newies with
 skills to match their opponents. Remember, one good player is more
 valuable than two average ones. The best type of player to go for first
 is a really good goalkeeper. When in Division 3 try to save up
 £100,000-plus for your goalie, and this will solve half of your problems.
 It's possible to make money by giving a full contract to a trainee (only
 select the very best), and then putting him straight on the transfer list.
 Give him time though, and his skills will blossom so you can sell him for
 a higher price.

 General tips
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 When seeking a new job (or just starting) try to select a club that
 attracts large crowds, as realistic ground capacities are included in
 the game. As a guide when starting out go for Burnley, Carlisle or
 Cardiff - avoid Doncaster, Halifax and Torquay at all costs!
 When picking your team, if necessary use players out of position rather
 than opting for a trainee to fill a gap (goalkeeper excepted).
 Watch as many of your matches as you can, because the results will be
 more of a realistic reflection of your team selections and players skills.
 Choose your words carefully when it comes to team talk. Generally, try to
 use the responses 'praise', 'no comment' and 'reprimand' whenever
 necessary. Remember to check your players contracts and re-negotiate
 with valued players regularly. A player out of contract may choose to
 walk out on your club and you will not receive full value for him in
 compensation.
