INTRODUCTION
------------

Gateway to the Savage Frontier is the first in a new series of Advanced
Dungeons & Dragons computer role-playing games set in the Savage Frontier, a
broad area on the northwest seacoast of the Forgotten Realms game world.  In
Gateway, the characters have the chance to save the Savage Frontier from a
surprise Zhentarim invasion through the Great Desert.

WHERE TO GET HELP
-----------------

The various sections of the clue book provide different kinds of adventuring
help.  The BACKGROUND section describes the events that have lead up to the
adventure.  The EVENTS section describes one way the adventure can turn out.
The MAPS section shows the different locations in the game and describes the
various encounters there.  The MONSTERS section contains a description of all
monsters in the game with information on what the monsters can do and how to
most effectively fight them. The NPCs section describes the various non-player
characters who can join the party.  The MAGIC ITEMS section lists the magic
items in the game and where they are to be found. The CITY DIRECTORY lists the
various services that are available in the cities of the Savage Frontier.

THE ORDER OF EVENTS
-------------------

The EVENTS and the MAPS sections present the various challenges in the order
of increasing difficulty.  The tasks the party must complete to win can be
accomplished in almost any order.  Feel free to set out across the wilderness
in any direction in search of adventure.  If the party is strong enough to
overcome the enemies they meet, their successes will help them win the game -
even if their effect on the big picture isn't instantly apparent.

THE BACKGROUND
--------------

Two thousand years ago Ascore was a thriving port on the Narrow Sea.  The
gateway to the great dwarven nation of Delzoun, it was a melting pot where
humans,dwarves and elves all conducted trade with nations across the Forgotten
Realms.

Now Ascore is nothing but a maze of sand-swept ruins, its mighty stone docks
thrust proudly into the advancing wastes.  The Narrow Sea has vanished before
the relentless march of the Great Desert.

As the waters receded from Ascore and the city began to strangle, the leaders
of the metropolis faced new dangers.  Orcs, trolls, dragons and especially the
monsters of the growing desert all came to feast on the city's bones as it
shrivelled in the suddenly-relentless sun.

Ascore called upon the greatest magic-users of the Realms, promising
wonderful treasures if they could create a magical defense to protect the
city. Although many tried and failed, no wizard could claim the prizes.

Then, one blistering summer day, four old and powerful magicians from the
distant east appeared at the city gates. Each, using his special knowledge and
rare components, had crafted a magical statuette on a triangular base to
protect the city from monsters from the north, east, south and west.

Each statuette glowed magically with a symbol representing the part of the
Realms upon which it was to focus, and they were breathtaking to behold.  Each
created a small area where any monster become lethargic, even nauseous.  The
creatures upon whom it was tested hurried away from the city.


  2 |=========================================================================

When four statuettes were set together upon an altar in the great plaza of
Ascore, however, their power increased many thousandfold.  The great stone
pyramids that surronded the altar began to glow, as the energy of the magical
device was magnified in all directions.

The wizards' creations worked.  The monsters that had plauged the once-great
seaport fell back, and the city was reprieved.

But it was not enough to save Ascore.  The Narrow Sea continued to recede,
the merchants abandoned their shops or changed their trade routes.  The great
dwarven navy lay aground in the dusty harbor, and the city melted away in the
tide of the encroaching desert.

During the city's final death throes corrupt city leaders took the statuettes
for their own enrichment.  The set was split apart, and its four glowing
elements passed through many hands in the Northern Realms.

For many years the Zhentarim knew of the existance of four statuettes, and of
of their potential power.  With the help of the evil Kraken Society, who
themselves held one statuette in the Purple Rocks, the Zhentarim located the
remaining three items.  Once each was held by Ceptienne, a sorceress in the
Star Mounts; by the Hosttower Mages in Luskan; and by dwarves in Llorkh.

To gain the statuette from the honest dwarves in Llorkh the Zhentarim simply
murdered their leaders, took over the town and stole the magical treasure.
Deals were struck with the other, evil owners to trade the statuettes for
control of their local regions after the Zhentarim conquest.

The long-held Zhentarim goal to breach the desert and dominate the Realms from
the Moonsea to the Sword Coast was now at hand.  All that remained was to
reunite the statuettes at Ascore and focus them to the east to clear the
uncrossable desert.

A Zhentarim general named Vaalgamon was dispatched to oversee this task.  A
ship would carry one statue from the Purple Rocks to Luskan, where a convoy
would bring it and the Hosttower's object overland to Ascore.  Ceptienne would
fly to Ascore with her statuette atop her black dragon steed.  A column sent
from Zhentil Keep itself would go around the desert on the long, traditional
path and escort the final statuette from Llorkh.

The party, quite by accident, stumbles across this plot in its final stages.
They realize that they are the only ones in the Savage Frontier who can stop
Vaalgamon from collecting the statuettes and completing the Zhentarim conquest
of the region.

THE EVENTS
----------

After purchasing new equipment and preparing their spells, the party saves a
small man named Krevish from being assulted by a group of bandits.  Krevish
leads the party to his Captain, who offers the party the job of 'taking care
of' an evil cleric who is causing trouble in Nesme.  Krevish offers to come
along.  After accepting the job, the party rents a boat and heads for Nesme.

In Nesme, the party searches the city for the cleric.  They fight their way
through the barbarians who are roaming the streets, and help clear the city's
ruins of trolls.  Finally, they find the secret hidden temple of Bane and
defeat the evil cleric.  But, in the rubble after the battle, they learn that
the evil Banite cleric was the center of a plan to stop the equally evil
Zhentarim from invading the Savage Frontier. It is now up to the party to stop
the invasion of the Zhentarim.  Their only clue mentions one of the Banite
cleric's


  3 |=========================================================================

allies in the town of Silverymoon and a good southern wizard.

The party travels by boat to Silverymoon.  During the festival to the goddess
Mielikki, the party meets the Banite's ally and learns that the southern mage
is called Amanitas.  Searching the town for the wizard, the party discovers
that Amanitas has been kidnapped. During their search, the party rescues Erek,
Amanitas' servant and learns that the wizard has been taken to Everlund.
Renting another boat, the party sets off to Everlund to rescue Amanitas.

In Everlund, the search leads through a secret door into the hidden dungeon
where Amanitas is being held.  After a sharp battle, the party releases the
kidnapped mage.  Amantias tells the party what he knows of the Zhentarim Plan,
and gives them the riddles that lead to the four statuettes.  He also directs
the party to look for a Kraken Outpost back in Yartar.

The party travels overland back to Yartar.  Their stay is reasonably
uneventful, but as they try to leave the city they are pulled through a secret
door and down into a cell in the Kraken Complex beneath Yartar.  The party
escapes from the cell and defeats the Kraken Captain and his men.  In the
remains of the captain's office the party finds information that leads them
toward the coastal cities of the Trackless Sea.  The party defeats several
giant squids in a huge water tank as they escape from the underground complex.

The party travels west to Neverwinter, the nearest city on the coast of the
Trackless Sea.  In Neverwinter, they help clear the city's indoor gardens and
check out the items in the magic shop, before proceeding north to Port Llast.
In Port Llast, the party searches the seemingly haunted ship, the Gallant
Prince. On the ship, they find clues that point to the Hosttower of the Arcane
in the port city of Luskan.

In Luskan, the party finds that the pirate captains of the city are receiving
their annual gifts from the local sea captains.  After defeating many of the
pirate captains'sailors, the party finds the imposing Hosttower of the Arcane,
'a great tower...' with 'many spires...'  In the dungeon under the tower, with
the help of Brinshaar, the renegade Hosttower mage, the party finds the
statuette of the East.  But, as the party leaves the tower, Brinshaar turns on
them and tries to get the statuette for himself.  The party defeats this
traitor and continues with the quest.

Following the second of Amanitas' riddles, the party sets off with the Company
of the Brazen Pennant to the Island of Tuern. While exploring the island, the
party defeats a group of fire giants and finds a piece of meteoric ore.  The
party then takes a ship to the island of Gundarlun.  While exploring
Gundarlun, the party finds and frees the kidnapped Princess Jagaerda.  She
joins the party while they search the remianing islands.

As the party leaves Gundarlun by ship, a giant Kraken smashes the ship to
pieces.  The party is washed ashore on the Purple Rocks, a small set of
islands controlled by pirates and the Kraen Society.  The party takes a small
boat across the straights to the great Kraken Headquarters.  They race
through the headquarters to get to the statuette of the West before the
Krakens put it aboard ship and set sail.  The party arrives just in time,
defeats the Krakens, and gains the statuette of the West.

When the party gets back onto their small boat, the currents take them to the
city of Neverwinter.  After taking some time to


  4 |=========================================================================

rest, train, and get the meteroic ore made into a magic sword, the party sets
off overland for Amanitas' home in Secomber.  There, Amanitas directs the
party through the city of Loudwater toward the dwarven city of Llorkh.

In Loudwater, the party spots a huge group of Zhentarim who are intent on
ambushing the party.  By using side streets, the party cuts down the group of
Zhentarim and finally defeats it.  As the party explores the rest of the
town, they discover Rishpal, an ex-Zhentarim Guard.  He joins the party for
their journey to Llorkh.

In Llorkh, the party enters a shop to buy some additional supplies and is
dropped down a secret chute into a huge arena.  Rishpal shows himself to be a
traitor and joins the Zhentarim leader Vaalgamon to watch the party fight for
its life.  After battling in the arena, the party escapes from captivity,
frees a half-orc named Muthtur, and battles their way through the arena
beneath Llorkh.  Finally, they find the statuette of the North and exit back
into the wilderness.  Muthtur thanks the party and leaves before they reenter
a city. 

The party heads back to Secomber to speak to Amanitas again.  He directs them
to the Star Mounts, 'where even the birds cannot fly.'  The party rents a
boat and travels up the river into the dangerous High Forest.  At the base of
the Star Mounts the party saves a group of giant intelligent bird-creatures,
the aarakocra.  The aarakocra tell the party they have seen a woman riding a
dragon among the peaks.  The aarakocra fly the party to her fortress.  In the
fortress, the party negotiates a maze and finally confronts the evil
magic-user Ceptienne.  They defeat her and gain the statuette of the South.

The party then travels overland through Sundabar to Ascore.  In Sundabar, the
Zhentarim leader Vaalgamon tries to stop the party with illusions, bribes,
and hideous monsters.  But the party makes it through to the dead city of
Ascore.

In Ascore, the party fights past the undead remains of the city's
inhabitants, and finally confronts Vaalgamon in a seemingly endless combat
maze.  The party finally sprints past Vaalgamon and reunites the statuettes
with the famous pyramids of Ascore.  The power of the statuettes, the
pyramids, and the Great Desert itself, combine to defeat the Zhentarim
hordes.  The party then makes a harrowing escape and returns triumphantly to
Yartar.

COMBAT STRATEGIES
-----------------

Consult the MONSTERS section carefully to study the different monsters in the
game to learn their strengths and weaknesses.  Do the same with the list of
clerical and magic-user spells in the Adventurer's Journal, to learn their
functions.  Look for spells that are especially effective against various
kinds of monsters.

Pay extra attention to spells that can be cast in camp before a battle to
strengthen the party.

Altough this book at times suggests specific spells that will be useful in
particular battles, many spells have broad uses in many situations.  For
example, casting Bless or Protection from Evil before a close battle may give
the party just enough extra staying power to come out alive - this is good
advice in any especially dangerous encounter.


  5 |=========================================================================

To speed up the game at the end of any fight, hold down the 'E' key on the
keyboard after the last monster is defeated. Each character will flash through
their "End" command and you'll be offered the chance to end the battle.

Here's a short list of strategies to try if the party is having problems
coming out as the winner in combat situations:

Is the party getting hurt by enemy archers or magic-users?

  * Hide vulnerable party members (especially those with armor classes worse
than 2.) behind a corner to avoid spells as well as arrows and other missle
weapons. They can then step out into view only when they're ready to cast a
spell.

  * Charge the front row into hand-tohand combat,since missle weapons can't be
used when an adjacent enemy threatens the character or monster.

  * Try to hit enemy spell-casters with at least one spell, melee attack or
missle every combat round-they cannot cast a spell on any combatround in which
they were damaged.  If they were preparing to throw a spell when they were hit
they may lose it completely, which gives the party a big advantage.

Is the party almost winning many battles, but coming up just short?

  * Use geography to create a momentary numerical advantage against a part of
the enemy force - try to arrange the party so that few of the monsters can
attack the party, but the party can attack them with as many characters as
possible.  In a fight against big monsters try to use a corridors protruding
doorway to block the monsters path.  Executed properly, the monsters will have
to attack one at a time, but four characters can hit the monster.  The rest of
the party can attack with spells and arrows from behind the front phalanx of
fighters, creating a 6-1 or greater advantage.

  * If the magic-users or clerics have the memorized spells they can't use
(for example, a Sleep spell cannot be used against a monster with 6 or more
hit dice),discard them with the CAST command in camp prior to the battle. Then
use that slot to memorize another spell that will help during battle, such as
Magic Missle or Charm Person.

  * Always save the game before a big battle - it makes it much easier to get
back into the game quickly and either rejoin the fight or work around it.

  * If the party is defeated in a close battle, remember that small changes in
strategy can have a great effect. A few small differences in preparation -
and a little luck - are often the difference between a defeat and having all
the characters standing when the last monster goes down.

  * Always get every party member the best armor available.  Often high
quality armor is left as treasure after a battle.
    Be on the lookout for magical armor, it will not only give the character
a good AC, but it can increase their mobility as well.

  * Always keep the characters in the back row well stocked with arrows, and
give magic-users plenty of darts to throw at the enemy once their spells have
been exhausted.  Know what each character's most effective weapon is for any
kind of combat by studying the Weapons Tables on page 40 of the Adventurer's
Journal.

  * Concentrate attacks on as few enemies as possible.  If a fight starts
with six manticores, it's much safer if half way through the battle there are
three healthy manticores left instead of six damaged ones.  Six damaged
manticores can hurt the party twice as much as the three healthy ones.

  * Use two or more characters to attack and enemy from opposite sides at the
same time to increase the character's chance to hit.  Once a character is
next to a monster, he can often slide around behind it while another
character continues to attack from the front.


  6 |=========================================================================

  * Practice using a thief to Back Stab enemies during combat - the extra
damage can help take out especially dangerous opponents quickly.

  * Sometimes luck plays a big part in these battles: a Stinking Cloud spell
may take out three ogres during one battle, only to mildly impair only one
ogre the next time around.  A Hold Person spell may take out three pirates in
one battle and none the next.  If the party fights a battle once and seems to
have bad luck, perhaps their fortune was worse than their strategy.  A second
try may win the day.

What are powerful spells for spell casters to throw?

  * The first level clerical spells Bless and Protection from Evil are the
most useful in combat.

  * The second level clerical spell Hold Person is very useful against
character type opponents.  Remember to target it all three times.

  * The third level clerical spell Prayer is very useful in combat.

  * The first level magic-user spell Sleep is the most useful weapon against
large numbers of low hit-dice monsters.  The spell Magic Missle is useful
against almost any monster.  And the spell Charm Person is very useful
against high level character type opponents.

  * The second level magic-user spell Stinking Cloud is an effective weapon
against anything that breaths.  The spells Invisibility and Mirror Image are
useful defensive spells for the mage.

  * The third level magic-user spells Fireball and Lightning Bolt are the
most potent offensive spells.  The spells Blink, Hast, Invisibility 10'
Radius, Protection from Evil 10' Radius, and Protection from Normal Missles
are all useful preparation spells.

And generally remember to:

  * Accept the offers of help from NPCs, unless the NPC section says to
reject them.  Krevish, Erek, Jagaerda, and Muthtur can all help the party a
great deal.  Make sure to keep all NPCs supplied with arrows so that they
won't charge headlong at the enemy.

  * If all else fails, an area the party can't get through may be a little
too tough for them.  Try exploring someplace else until the party has enough
experience to train for a higher level.  Then come back and try again.

    Don't hesitate to use different combat strategies than the ones listed in
this book.  This is a big game and there are lots of different ways to
achieve your goals.  Clever players will always find new ways to solve old
problems.

WILDERNESS TRAVEL
-----------------

When travelling from city to city in the wilderness, stick to the roads,
paths and rivers whenever possible.  Open plains are the next safest terrain
to cross.

If the party enters the wilderness looking for adventure, the forests and
rough hills will result in more frequent encounters with higher level
monsters.  These may even include especially dangerous monsters like hill
giants.  The moors are even more dangerous to traverse, enter them at your
own risk.

Deep forests, canyons and the Great Desert are the most dangerous terrains of
all.  The only time the party should travel in deep forests or canyons is to
reach the Star Mounts, and the party never needs to travel through the
desert.

In the more dangerous areas the party may encounter the poisonous monsters.
One hit from these enemies can kill a character.  If a character gets
poisoned, go quickly to the nearest city with a temple and pay for them to
cast a Neutralize Poison spell to bring the character back.


  7 |=========================================================================

MAPS
----

YARTAR

Synopsis:  Yartar is the party's first home base.  As a centrally located
crossroads town it is called the "hub of the Savage Frontier."  The party
should visit here regularly to buy equipment, train characters, heal wounds,
etc. Such services are also available in a number of other major towns and
cities scattered across the map, but Yartar always seems to be "on the way"
to wherever the party is going.

As the start of the game the party should immediately rest and memorize
spells, buy weapons and armor in the store, and then explore the town.  There
are many secrets throughout the Savage Frontier, put the party in Serach mode
and keep it there throughout the game so that they don't miss anything.  In
any case, they cannot leave immediately due to an alarm about trolls in the
area.  Many useful pieces of information can be learned from talking with
various shopkeepers here in Yartar.

Resting: The party can rest in Yartar only at the inn.

Returning to Yartar: Later in the game the party acquires the Ring of
reversal.  If the party comes back through Yartar with the Ring of Reversal,
they are ambushed by the Kraken Society on their way out of town.  If the
party comes back to Yartar with the ring, don't try to leave the town until
the game has been saved and the party is fully healed and has memorized their
spells.

Wandering Monsters: If the party has acquired the Ring of Reversal and has
not yet cleared Sub-Yartar, Kraken agents may attack them on the main streets
of the town.  Once Sub-Yartar has been cleared, there are 2 more such attacks
by stragglers, after which the party is safe from attack in Yartar.

EVENTS

1. The guards stop the party as they try to pass through the city gates.
Once the party has explored the town, the guards let them leave.

2. The Inn of the Glowing Gem. This is where the party begins the game.  Be
sure to have they party's spell casters memorize spells before beginning the
adventure.

3. The Tired Traveller Tavern.

4. The Yartar Armory.  The party should buy weapos and armor here.

5. Hall of Training.  Characters, including NPCs like Krevish, can train to
advance levels here.

6. City Guard Post.  The guards direct the party to the riverboat rentals,
and inform them that ships sailing the Trackless Sea depart from a pier in
Luskan.

7. Vault of Yartar.  This is where the party can store any items or money
they acquire but don't want to carry around.  Later in the game the party
acquires a magical card and may access treasure left here from other vaults
in Silverymoon and Neverwinter; until then this vault is open but the others
are closed.

8. This is the home of the Waterbaron, the leader of Yartar.  He tells the
party about some of the problems troubling the region.

9. Temple of Tymora.  Here, for a fee, the party can raise dead characters,
heal wounds, cure poison and turn stoned characters back to flesh.

10. This is the headquarters of the City Guard.

11. Frydhazes' Shop of Unusual Items.

12. These are large building shops set beside the river.

13. Boat Rentals.  The party can rent boats at almost all towns and cities in
the Savage


  8 |=========================================================================

Frontier.  Most of the rental fee is a deposit on the boat, and if the party
returns the vessel safely, even at a different town, the deposit is refunded.
Boats allow the party to travel on the rivers on the Wilderness Map.
Travelling by boat is one of the safest ways to get around, since wandering
monsters rarely attack parties on the river.

This boat rental shop is closed until the party has explored some of the
town.

14. Northwaters Fish Market.

15. Dessarin Boat Repair.

16. Three Rivers Festhall.  This is a secret Kraken hideout, but at the start
of the game it looks like any other tavern.  After the party has gained the
Ring of reversal they are attacked here by Kraken Spies.

17. Back Rooms of the Festhall.  There is a 50% chance that a Krekn captain
and a small group of Kraken spies are in either of these places.  Defeating
them once removes them from both places forever.

18. This is a residential area.

19. Dark riders gallop past the party the first time they go here.  One of
the riders is Vaalgamon, the Zhentarim general dispatched to organize the
invasion of the Savage Frontier.


  9 |=========================================================================

20. At one of these locations,the party has a chance to help a small,terrified
man cornered by bandits.  If the party doesn't help the man and the bandits
sprint away, the party may see them again.  If the party helps the man, the
banits turn and attack.

The man the party saves is named Krevish.  If the party accepts him, he can
travel with them for the rest of the game.  He fights on the side of the
party in the battle with the bandits.

Use a sleep spell to stop the bandits, catching as many of them as possible
in its 3x3 square area.  Don't let the party members be caught in the spell's
range, or they are put to sleep as well.  The Sleep spell is the most
important weapon in the eraly part of the game - if two party members can use
magic-user spells they should both memorize it.  After the battle, grab the
bandits' money and items.  The party can sell the items for cash as the
weapons shop.

After the party defeats the bandits, Krevish offers to help them find work.
If the party accepts the offer, he leads them to his Captain.  If the party
refuses his offer they can change their minds by going to Krevish's house at
location 21.

The captain offers the party the chance to go to Nesme and destroy an evil
cleric who is causing troubl there.  If the party accepts the mission the
captain leaves.  If the party doesn't accept they have to fight the Krakens
to get out of this room.

In either case, Krevish offers to come with the party.  If the party accepts
Krevish, buy plenty of arrows for him and keep him in the back row of the
party.  From time to time during the course of the game Krevish gives hints
or suggestions.  In each case he is telling the truth or giving good advice.

If the party rejects Krevish, they can still add him to the party by visiting
his house at location 21.

Hint On Strategy For NPCs: Krevish and the characters Erek, Jagaerda and
Muthtur (all of whom can help the party for a while) operate under computer
control in battles.  Make sure that Krevish and other NPCs have their bows
readied, have plenty of arrows, and are placed in the back row of the party.
If NPCs run out of arrows they charge ahead and attack the enemy, sometimes
endangering both themselves and the party.

21. Krevish's House.  Come here if the party rejected either offer he made
and they now want to accept him.

22. Captain's Quarters.  This is where the party meets the Captain after
accepting Krevish's offer.


NESME

Synopsis: Nesme is a walled, well-defended city on the edge of the Trollmoors
in the north-central part of the map.  The leaders there are frightened by
the stories of troll armies gathering near their gates, and have offered a
reward for any adventurers who slay trolls in the nearby areas.

The party is looking for a hidden Banite temple where the evil cleric
resides.  Stay in Search mode to make it easier to find the temple.

In addition to the scare about the trolls, a recent power struggle here saw
Longtresses Alaraun overthrow the ruling clerics of Waukeen with the support
of local barbarians.  The Krakens have been fanning the jealousy between
these two rival forces secretly, in order to divert attention from the real
plans for the conquest of the region.


 10 |=========================================================================

Resting: The party can rest safely in the Inn or in any non-street location
inside the city walls.

Wandering Monsters: In the ruins outside the palisade in th northeast and
southeast, a small number of trolls appear.  In the streets, up to five
groups of barbarians may attack the party.

EVENTS

1. A proclamation posted here announces a 100 gold piece reward to
adventureres for every troll slain in the ruins outside the city.

2. Town Hall of Nesme.  This si where the reward for slaying trolls is paid.
Longtresses Alaraun, Nesme's new leader, tells the party about what's been
happening in the town, blaming the temple of Waukeen for everything.

3. The Temple of Waukeen.  Healing services are available here.

4. The Tavern of the Riders.

5. The Evermoor Inn.

6. Palisade Weaponry Shop.

7. The sign here says "We Banish Pests!"  This is actually the hidden Banite
temple.  The party has to pick the lock or break down the door to get in.  A
secret door is located inside the north wall - pick its lock


 11 |=========================================================================

break it down to enter the temple complex behind it.

8. Basanicas Boat Rentals.

9. This is the headquarters of the Riders of Nesme.  Their captain tells the
party his view of what's been happening in town.

10. Stables of the Riders of Nesme.  The stable boy tells how their horses
are being stolen.

11. The Harbormaster's Office.

12. An empty warehouse.

13. This building is divided into stock pens.  Lizard Men have been attacking
the livestock here and ambush the party if the look around the pens.

14. City Guard stations.  The exits leading to the ruins outside the palisade
lie at the end of the street just past the guard stations.

15. This is the library of the Banite temple.

16. Murals of Bane decorate the ceiling here.

17. A group of orcs and Banite clerics are in this room of the hidden temple.

18. Lizard men and orcs guard this entrance to the Banite temple.

19. This is the chamber of the Banite cleric whom the party seeks to destroy.
Here they fight the first big battle of the game.  The cleric is guarded by a
large group of orcs and lizard men, as well as by fellow clerics from this
hidden shrine.

Make sure that the party is fully healed and has memorized spells before
entering thr oom. A Bless spell cast in camp can help the whole party.  Make
sure the magic-users have memorized Sleep and Charm Person spells.

Once he is defeated, the Banite cleric uses his last ounce of strength to set
fire to some papers.  Only one page escapes the flames, but it describes a
Zhentarim plot to conquer the entire savage frontier!

Normally allied in the pursuit of evil with the Zhentarim, these Banites are
afraid that such a conquest would unbalance the historical relationship
between the temples of Bane and the forces of Zhentil Keep.  They have
resolved to stop the plot before the Savage Frontier is conquered.

The letter says that the cleric whom the party has just killed was one of
three people who knew how to stop the Zhentarim plan.  The two others are
a fellow Banite who lives in Silverymoon and a magic-user from the south.
This man was to go Silverymoon to meet his fellow conspirator during the
upcoming Festival of Mielikki.

The party has accidently removed the one roadblock to the Zhentarim's plans -
just as the Krakens had planned when they sent them on this quest.  They must
now take on a new mission: to find the Banite cleric in Silverymoon and save
the Savage Frontier!

20. Three Zhentarim agents are imprisoned here.  When released they are
surprised and pleased that the Banite cleric has been killed, for they were
sent to Nesme to eliminate him as well.

21. The party surprises the Priestess of Waukeen in her personal chamber
here.  She initially believes they've been sent to kill her, but then
realizes they discovered the secret door after defeating the Krakens.  She
relates her version of what's happening in Nesme, blaming Longtresses for
everything.

22. A stone bridge across the River Surbrin.

23. Bandits and a Kraken spy are hidding here behind the secret door in the
palisade.


 12 |=========================================================================

They have been stealing horses from the Riders of Nesme (and trying to put
the blame on the barbarians) to encourage civil war in the town.

24.  In each oth these warehouses by the river there is a chance that one of
three groups of giant frogs attacks the party near the wet walls that lie
above the riverbank.

25. Barbarians attack the party here.

26. The local Kraken spies have their hideout here.  They are planning to
kidnap the Priestess of Waukeenm using the secret door at the rear of the

temple.  The Krakens have been fanning the rivalry between her and
Longtresses in order to divert attention from their true plans.

After defeating the Kraken spies, if the party is in search mode, they find
the secret door in the north wall of the room.

27. Trolls inhabit these areas of ancient ruins outside the wooden palisade.
They are immune to Sleep spells; if a magic-user is at least 3rd level use
Stinking Cloud to force them to attack the party through a cloud of noxious
gas.

Try to arrange the party so the best fighters line up vertically in a doorway
on the combat screen with the rest of the party behind them.  Since the
trolls are 2 squares high, only one can attack the front row at a time, while
the back row peppers them with spells and ranged weapons.  After a troll goes
down, have a character stand over where it fell to keep it from regenerating
and coming back to life.


 13 |=========================================================================

SILVERYMOON

Synopsis: Silverymoon is a big town located in the northeast section of the
map.  It is normally less concerned about outside attack than with such
things as the study of magic, music, etc.  It is the site of the two shops in
the game where magical items can be purchased.

The Festival of Mielikki occurs in Mielikki's Glade (in the small part of the
city south of the river) every seventh day this time of year.  Banners in the
city tell how many days to the next festival day.  If necessary, the party
can rest in the inn until the appointed time.

Located at the edge of Mielikki's Glade, the hidden Banite shrine serves as a
perfect cover for the cleric Broadhand's illicit trade of precious metals
mined - or stolen - from the northern mountains.

The party must enter the shop during the Festival so Broadhand mistakes them
for fellow Banite conspirators and tells them how to stop the Zhentarim plan
to conquer the Savage Frontier.

Resting: The party can rest safely in the Inn or in any non-public location.
They cannot rest in the streets, the market or Mielikki's Glade.

Wandering Monsters: In the market place, bandits may accost the party.  After
their hideout has been cleared ther may be one more such attack and then they
stop.  In the piers and warehouses by the river several lizard men may
attack.

EVENTS

1. Vilriel's Shop of Useful Items.

2. The Silverymoon Vault.  This vault remains locked until the party recieves
the Card of Counting from Amanitas in Everlund.  Once they have the card, it
allows them to magically store and retrieve treasure at all 3 vaults (in
Silverymoon, Yartar and Neverwinter) as if they were all one place.

3. Moonbridge Boat Rentals.

4. Helmer's Wall Tavern.

5. Inn of the Downstream Run.

6. A secret door to the eats leads to the hidden area where the Zhentarim
hide their captives.

7. The Lady's College.  The Dean here tells the party of the city's troubles.

8. Padrumm's Armory.

9. The Temple of Mielikki.  A banner here lists how many days remain until
the next Festival, which occurs every 7th day.  Inside the temple healing
services are available.

10. The Bridge Guards here assure the party that the invisible bridge across
the River Rauvin is actually quite safe to use.

11. Miresk's School of Thaumaturgy and Shop of Magical Items.  The magic
items on sale here are very expensive, probably too expensive for the party
this early in the adventure.  Later, when the party has more money, they
should return to Silverymoon and pick up any items they might find useful.
The store sells 3 different clerical scrolls; potions of invisibility, speed,
and extra healing; gauntlets of dexterity; arrows +1; and daggers +1.

12. The Vault of the Sages.  This ancient library for magic-users is where
Amanitas stayed whenever he visited Silverymoon.  The party is told that he
was here, but has disappeared amidst signs of a struggle.  The party can then
search the building for clues.

13. Mielikki's Glade.  The Festival is held here every seventh day.


 14 |=========================================================================

14. Broadhand's Forge and Tack Shop.  This shop is open only during the
Festival of Mielikki and is where the hidden Banite shrine is located.  When
Broadhand appears, choose DISCUSS FESTIVAL and then FRIEND IN NESME SENT US.
Broadhand mistakes the party for fellow Banites and leads them through the
secret opening in the back of the shop.

Behind the shop, Broadhand tells the party more about the Zhentarim plot, and
explains that a magic user named Amelior Amanitas has found a way to prevent
the conquest of the region.  Amanitas is staying at the Vault of the Sages
here in Silverymoon, and Broadhand tells the party to seek him out
immediately.

15. This wide area is the market place.

16. Searching this ransacked room, the party finds a note giving directions
to the hidden rooms in the northern part of the city where Amanitas was taken
by the Zhentarim.

17. Hall of Training.

18. This is the Moonbridge, and invisible span that magically crosses the
River Rauvin.

19. This is an area of warehouses and piers along the river.


 15 |=========================================================================

20. Erek, Amanitas' grumpy but loyal northman assistant, is chained to the
wall in this tiny room.  After the party releases him, Erek tells them that
Amanitas has been taken to Everlund.  He says that from there, the Zhentarim
plan to take Amanitas to Zhentil Keep to endure cruel tortures.  He implores
the party to hurry to Everlund and rescue the great magic-user.

21. Several bandits are sorting through their loot here in their hideout.

22. A small group of trolls inhabit this room.  Someone is shouting at them,
but the party has to fight the trolls before they can see who it is.

This is an important battle in the early part of the game.  The trolls are
very tough, make sure that the party is fully healed and has memorized
spells.  Casting a Bless spell on the party before the battle couldn't hurt
either.

The party is standing in a doorway as the combat opens.  Try to arrange the
party so the 3 best fighters line up vertically in the doorway, with the rest
of the party behind them.  Since the trolls are 2 squares high, only one can
attack the front row at a time in the 3-square-high corridor, while the back
row of the party can attack with spells and arrows.  Try to have a character
stand on the spot where the first troll falls to keep it from regenerating
and getting back up.

The treasure from this battle includes a piece of jewelry.  Have it appraised
at a local shop - if you're lucky and its value is high it may pay for the
training of several characters.

23. Several orcs guard this room.

24. A group of orcs is hiding in this house.

25. Barbarians have taken over this residence.

26. A small group of Kraken spies and a Kraken captain are in this hideout.
Use a Sleep spell to take out the spies, then surrond the captain to complete
the battle.  After defeating them the party finds a map of the Kraken complex
beneath Yartar.

27. Several giant frogs are in this warehouse near the river.


EVERLUND

Synopsis: Amanitas, a high level magic-user, is being held captive in the
city.  His Zhentarim captors intend to take him to Zhentil Keep itself.
There, the exact details of what he has learned can be extracted from him by
whatever means are necessary.

The party must rescue Amanitas in order to learn the locations of the four
statuettes and defeat the Zhentarim plan.

Resting: The party can rest safely in the Inn or in any non-public location.
They cannot rest in the streets.

Wandering Monsters: In the city streets up to 5 groups of stirges may attack.
In the Old City in the northeast up to 3 groups of several skeletons can
attack the party.  In the hidden Zhentarim complex in the southwest up to 3
small groups of gnolls can be found.

EVENTS

1. City Guard post.  The guards warn the party of the undead in the Old City.

2. A bridge over the River Rauvin.

3. River Rauvin Boat Rentals.

4. Inn of the Well-Marked Path.

5. Everlund Town Hall.  A member of the Council of Elders tells the party
what's been happening in the city.


 16 |=========================================================================

6. A small stone fountain.

7. Hahr-Peer's Bazaar.  The owner says he has been cleaned out by robbers.

8. A storage and rest area.

9. The party hears the sound of a large animal eating something here.  Go
farther into this room and the party discovers a small group of owlbears,
feasting on the remains of a horse.

In the battle, have the front row of the party select GUARD and stand their
ground as the owlbears charge.  Usually only two of the owlbears are able to
attack at any one time.  The back row of the party can pepper the enemy with
arrows while a magic-user casts a Stinking Cloud on them.

This is a good way to deal with many different large monsters until a
magic-user reaches 5th level and can use the Fireball or Lightning Bolt
spells.

The owlbears have been placed here by the Zhentarim to guard the secret door
in the south wall of the room.  Going through the secret door leads to a
passageway below the River Rauvin.  The hidden complex where Amanitas is
being held is at the end of the passageway.

Owlbears have gems as treasure - be sure to appraise and sell these at a shop
as


 17 |=========================================================================

soon as possible, and use the money to pay for training party members.

10. This caravan supplier has been robbed of everything he owns.

11. Several gnolls are in the back room of this warehouse, ransacking the
place and looking for loot.

12. A small leather workshop.

13. This gate leads to the Old City, which has been taken over by the undead.

14. This secret door leads to a secret passage beneath the river, and
connects the hidden Zhentarim complex to the city.

15. A group of gnolls is looting this home.

16. The party interrupts several gnolls who are eating from a pot of honey
they have found while looting this store.

17. This is teh room where Amanitas is being held.  He is guarded by a mixed
group of Zhentil fighters and owlbears.

Have the front row of the party charge the owlbears to try to keep them close
together.  While the back row of the party peppers the owlbears with arrows,
a magic-user can come up behind the front row and cast a stinking cloud on
the owlbears.

After his rescue, Amanitas tells the party about the location of the four
statuettes.  He cannot give their exact locations, only the feelings he has
about where they are hidden.

* One is in a great tower that is filled with evil;

* One lies in a chest carved from a giant pearl, deep within a rocky island
  far out at sea;

* One is hidden somewhere that no one likes to go;

* One lies where even the birds dare not fly, but the party must itself fly
  to get there.

Amanitas gives the party the Card of Counting (which magically links the
vaults in Yartar, Silverymoon and Neverwinter), and the Ring of Reversal.
This ring, combined with the four statuettes at Ascore, reverses their effect
and thrwts the Zhentarim plans.

If Erek is with teh party, he goes back to Secomber with Amanitas to protect
him.

The treasure from this battle includes a piece of jewelry.  Have it appraised
at a local shop - if you're lucky and its value is high it may help pay for
training several characters.

18. A man here is using a whip on a small group of owlbears.  They all attack
the party.  This is an easier battle than #17, but the same strategy should
work well.

19. Several skeletons and zombies are here by day.

20. Several skeletons and zombies come here in late evening and stay all
night.

21. Several zombies attack the party here.

22. The party encounters several ghouls here.


KRAKEN COMPLEX IN SUB-YARTAR

Synopsis: The first time that the party comes through Yartar after getting
the Ring of Reversal, the Krakens are determined to stop them from upsetting
the Zhentarim plans.  They don't know the party has the Ring, but they do
know that they rescued Amanitas at Everlund.  That means the party knows too
much to be allowed to live.

As the party approaches any of the gates on the way out of town, the street
in front of them is blocked by a broken wagon.  A herd of sheep closes in
behind them, trapping them.  They are suddenly pulled through a secret door
and down into teh main Kraken complex, which is laid out in the shape of a
Kraken, a huge ocean-dwelling giant squid of great intelligence and strength.


 18 |=========================================================================

Here the party meets Vaalgamon, the Zhentarim general who is directing the
collection of the statuettes and the conquest of the region.  He dismisses
them as insignificant opponents and leaves them to be disposed of by the
Krakens.

Resting: The party can rest safely only after the Kraken captain has been
defeated; before then they are interrupted by Kraken spies.  The difficulty
of resting in the Kraken Complex makes saving spells and avoiding extra
battles critical.  Go directly from the cell to the library to find the
magic-user scroll, then go through the secret passage around the first set of
lizard men guards to attack the Kraken Captain.  If wandering patrols attack
the party try to flee; if they can't escape, ration their spells carefully so
they have enough firepower left to defeat the Kraken Captain.

Wandering Monsters: In the corridors of the complex small patrols of Kraken
spies and lizard men attack the party.  Once the Kraken captain has been
defeated there are no further wandering monster attacks.

EVENTS

1. From here the party can see that the central portion of the complex is
actually a gigantic aquarium, with large squid swimming lazily in the dark
waters.


 19 |=========================================================================

2. Searching this storage room finds nothing.

3. Searching thsi room reveals a hidden dagger +1.

4. This is the room where the party is imprisoned as they enter the region.
If Krevish is with them, he points out an opening above the door through
which a small party member might be able to squeeze.  If Krevish isn't with
the party, SEARCH the room to reveal the grating.

Select a character to try and climb through the opening.  Have the party's
thief attempt to do so - a character that falls suffers damage.

Once the party member has gotten through the grate open the door from the
outside and the party is freed.

5. The Kraken's library, filled with information about the Forgotten Realms.
Searching here finds a scroll with the spells Sleep, Magic Missle, and
Stinking Cloud.

6. Searching this room reveals a map of the Krakens' fortress headquarters in
the Purple Rocks.

7. Another room filled with maps.  Nothing special can be found here.

8. A small contingent of lizard men guards the corridor here.  Just to the
south of this door secret openings lie on both the east and west sides of the
passageway.  Use either secret door to avoid fighting the lizard men.

9. There is a 50% chance that several giant frogs are in these rooms.

10. There is a 50% chance that lizard men are in these rooms.

11. The party surprises the leader of the local Krakens and a large group of
Kraken spies here in the Captain's office.  Use Sleep spells to take out the
spies; if the spells are targeted carefully the rest of the battle should be
fairly easy.  If the party has used up their Sleep spells before reaching
this battle, try to force as many Krakens as possible to attack through a
Stinking Cloud.

After the battle the party is rewarded with a +2 magical long sword - the
same one stolen from teh party at the Inn at the beggining of the game.

Rest in the Kraken Captain's office after the battle, save the game, heal and
rememorize spells.  One especially difficult battle ramins in this section of
the game, and the party must win it before they can return to Yartar.

When they search the room they find a secret staircase leading out of the
complex.  They must take it to leave, but it leads to a catwalk suspended
across the great aquarium.  While the party is crossing, the catwalk gives
way and they fall into teh water, where they have to fight a group of young
giant squid.

The water in the aquarium is deep enough to submerge the party to their
chests.  This slows down movement and makes the use of bows, slings and other
missle weapons impossible.  The spells Fireball, Lightning Bolt and Burning
Hands do not work in this battle, since water makes them inoperative.  If the
characters have memorized these spells they will lose them when they fall
into the water.

Make sure any magic-users are well protected behind the rest of the party - a
squid may try to move around the edges of the party's front line to reach
those in the rear.

Try to keep characters away from the squid until they can surrond one and
concentrate their attack.  The squid's tentacles can constrict a character
that they hit in melee.  Constricted characters can still fight by using the
AIM or CAST commands, but


 20 |=========================================================================

they are trapped next to the enemy and cannot move.

If the party can finish off two of the monsters quickly, the rets of the
battle can usually be won even if all available spells have been expended.

After defeating the squid the party completes their escape, returning to the
streets of Yartar in front of the Three Rivers Festhall, which is a haven for
the local Krakens.

12. Lizard men guard the corridor here.

13. There is a 50% Chance that Kraken spies are in these rooms.


NEVERWINTER

Synopsis: A pleasant coastal town set on a river that flows with warm water,
Neverwinter welcomes visitors from all across the Realms.  It is farmed for
its verdant, year-round indoor gardens, but the gardens are now being beset
by monsters.

Neverwinter is the site of the only magic shop in the game outside of
Silverymoon.  There is also a weapons maker-magic user here who can make a
sword +3 from meterorite ore if it is brought to him by the party.

Resting: The party can rest safely in the Inn, in any non-street location in
town, or in any indoor garden where all the wandering monster battles have
been completed.


 21 |=========================================================================

Wandering Monsters: In city streets 4 large groups of stirges can be
encountered.

EVENTS

1. Helm's Hull Works - Ship and Boat Repair.  The man here tells the party
about the Gallant Prince, a ghost ship found and moored at Port Llast.

2. Allis Lhyssich's Hand Crafted Weapons and Magical Weapons for Noble
Causes.  Bring th meterorite ore the party finds on Tuern here and Lhyssich
crafts it into a Sword of Stonecutting +3, which proves very useful in
getting through Sundabar on the way to completing the game in Ascore.

3. Southwall Shop of Adventurer Supply.

4. Villig's Arms Supply and Armor Emporium.

5. Inn of the Warm Water Way.  If the party rests in the northernmost room of
the inn they are ambushed by a group of gnolls.  After defeating them the
party finds a secret door hidden in the north wall that leads to one of the
indoor gardens that has been plauged by monsters.  To have a safe resting
place choose the Neverwinter Inn.

6. The Neverwinter Inn.  Unlike the Inn of the Warm Water Way, here the
party's rest is not interrupted.

7. The Neverwinter Vault.  Until the party receives the Card of Counting from
Aminitas in Everlund this vault remains locked.  Once they have the card it
allows them to magically store are retrieve treasure at all 3 vaults (in
Silverymmon, Yartar and Neverwinter) as if they were all one place.

8. Temple of Tyr.  Healing services are available here.

9. Temple of Oghama.  All temples in Neverwinter offer the same services for
the same prices.

10. A small plot of ancient vines.

11. Lord Nasher's Castle.  Lord Nasher is teh town leader of Neverwinter, and
tells the party of the problems in the indoors gardens.

12. Hall of training.  This is the last Hall of Training the party finds in
the west until they get to the island of Gundarlun.  If any of the party
members are close to advancing a level, be sure to return here and train them
before setting out to sea from Luskan.  If possible, train them even before
they take on the difficult battles inside Luskan itself.

13. The Neverwinter Indoor Garden Society.  The man here gives the party 20
arrows +1 to help clear the indoor gardens.  These should be given to the
best bowman in the back row.  Don't give them to Krevish - save them for use
against the margoyles in Luskan and other monsters against which only magical
wepaons are effective.

14. "The Fat Man's Table" (Tavern).

15. The River's Heart - Shop of Magical Items & Curiosities.  This is one of
two magic shops in the game.  The arrows +1 available here can help fight the
margoyles in Luskan.  The other items are expensive, but useful if the party
has sufficent money.  The store sells 3 different magic-user scrolls, the
dart of the hornet's nest, arrows +1, and battle axes +1.

16. Neverwinter Boat Rentals.  This shop only rents riverboats to travel up
the Neverwinter River; to travel on the ocean the party must go to the docks
in Luskan.  There are no important places to discover on the Neverwinter
River in this game.


 22 |=========================================================================

17. This is where the party lands when they return from the Islands.

18. If the party comes here with the statuette of the West after getting it
in the Purple Rocks, they are ambushed by Zhentil fighters leading
manticores.  See the Indoor Gardens below for hints on fighting this battle.

19. Indoor Gardens.  In any of the Indoor Gardens displacer beasts or
manticores may attack the party.  After 3 battles in the Bus or Nebus Gardens
no further attacks occur in either place.  3 battles also happen in the
Zemaitis Gardens and 3 in the Neprazus Gardens before they are considered to
have been cleared.  On the thrid battle in each case the encounter is with
one or more Zhentil fighters along with the displacer beasts or manticores,
since the Zhentarim have been causing the problems in the gardens to divert
attention from their actual plans.

Against the manticores, have the party's fighters charge and engage in melee
combat as quickly as possible.  This stops the manticores from firing their
dangerous spines at range and protects magic-users from these long range
attacks.  If a magic-user acts before the fighters can get to the manticores,
have the magic-user run around a corner out of the line of fire.  Once the
manticores have been engaged, the magic-user can emerge from cover to attack
at range.  The manticore spines are very dangerous, so concentrate attacks on
one manticore until it goes down, then switch fire to the next until they
have all been destroyed.

Against the displacer beasts, follow a different strategy.  Have teh fighters
guard as the displacer beasts close to attack.  When the displacer beasts are
engaged, have a magic-user throw a Stinking Cloud spell to slow the displacer
beasts down.  As with the manticores, concentrate attacks on one dsiplacer
beast until it goes down, then switch fire to the next until they have all
been destroyed.

Don't try to rest and recuperate in any of the indoor gardens until that
garden has been cleared - the party is interrupted.  The inn is always close
by and is always safe for resting.

The Indoor Gardens in Neverwinter are a good place to toughen up the party
and earn extra treasure before taking on the tough battles in Luskan.
Consider taking the time to clear them and using the Hall of Training to
advance levels before taking on the pirates to the north.


 23 |=========================================================================

The Gallant Prince is an abandoned ship that was seperated from a convoy in a
storm on a voyage from Neverwinter to the Purple Isles.  It appeared adrift
off of Port Llast, its hull weathered by the travails of a century in just
the last ten days.  A local fisherman towed the ship in, moored it at the
town dock, went below docks...and has never been seen again.

Rest: The party can rest safely in the Inn, in any non-street location in
town, or in the ship when all the wandering monster battles have been
completed.

Wandering Monsters: Inside the ship 5 small groups of skeletons and zombies
may attack the party.  In the streets of Port Llast 2 larger groups of
stirges may be encountered.

EVENTS

1. The Port Llast Harbormaster.  He tells the party how the Gallant Prince
came to be moored here.

2. The Stonecutters' Guild.  Here they warn the party about the power of the
Hosttower of the Arcane in Luskan.

3. The Gallant Prince is moored to the dock at this location.  Go west to
board the ship.

4. The Inn of the Ancient Mariners.

5. Cargo holds.

6. The main holds of the ship.

7. Crew's Quarters.

8. This hidden room holds three statues - actually the captain and two
sailors turned to stone by an evil magic-user from the Hosttower of the
Arcane.

9. A Magic Mouth on this door asks the password to enter the Captain's
quarters.  The password is "KAS".

10. Skeletal fighters and zombies attack the party here.

11. This is the Captain's Quarters.  Several owlbears have been left here to
attack anyone bold enough to investigate the ship.

Since the owlbears have fearsome claws and can hug and immobilize a player,
the party wants to make this a long range battle if possible.  If the party
has the initiative at the start of the battle, back everyone up a few steps
into the narrow doorway.  Here it is harder for more than one or two owlbears
to attack at a time, and while the front row fights the back row can fire
spells and ranged weapons.

12. This secret chamber is guarded by skeletons, ghouls and Hosttower
wizards.  The ghouls have the ability to paralyze enemies, and any character
in the front row is vulnerable to them.

Have a cleric turn undead to make the numbers in the fight a little more
fair.  Have the other spell casters use Charm Person or Hold Person spells to
take out the enemy spell casters before they can get their high-level spells
off.  If this isn't possible, hit them with arrows and anything else to stop
them from casting until they can be eliminated.

After the battle the party discovers another statue lying in a corner.
Beside it is a note describing how the Krakens and a magic user from the
Hosttower of the Arcane took over the ship as part of a plan to clear the sea
lanes near the Purple Rocks.

13. This is a storage room for the crew's supplies.  Searching this room
reveals the password for entering the Captain's quarters: "KAS".

LUSKAN

Synopsis: Luskan is a coastal city inhabited by northmen.  The five High
Captains who rule the town present themselves as merchants, but are actually
retired pirates.  They continue to demand tribute from both legitamte sea
captains and buccaneers for the right to use Luskan's port and sail in safety
through nearby waters.

Allied with Luskan's pirate leaders are the evil wizards of the Hosttower of
the Arcane, located on an island in the city's harbor.

When the party arrives here the pirate captains of the north are bringing
their annual tribute to the High Captains.  This tribute takes the form of
magical weapons, and the party can gain these treasures for themselves by
fighting a series of battles with the pirates as they wait at the leaders'
houses.  Margoyle guards - vulnerable only to magical weapons - assist in the
defense of the five houses.  The battles are all tough but winnable, and
several of the magic items are of use throughout the rest of the game.

Hint: Luskan is an appreciably harder region than those described earlier in
this book.  If the initial battles here seem too tough, take the party and
explore elsewhere in the earlier regions to build up more experience points
and advance to higher levels.  Have characters who possess magical


 25 |=========================================================================

weapons positioned carefully whenever fighting margoyles, since they cannot
be damaged by normal weapons.

Resting: The characters can rest in the Inn, and in any non-street location.
After the monsters have been cleared from the old city it is completely safe
for resting.

Wandering Monsters: In the Old City five small groups of Otyughs attack the
party.  These battles tend to take place in narrow streets, where the party
can have fighters in front and bowmen and magicians in back and fight the
battle from as long a range as possible.  Since Zhentarim allies control all
the other streets of Luskan, no wandering monsters are found there.

EVENTS

1. The Captains' Court.  This is the town hall of Luskan.  An officer here
tells the party that the captains are at their palaces receiving their annual
gifts of magical treasure from the local sea captains.

2. Inn of the Northern Passage.

3. A captain's lodge, amde of hand-cut timbers.  A group of pirates are here
with their gift, and attack when the party enters the room.  Defeating them
earns the party a Wand of Ice Storm, with 3 uses.

Against the pirates a Sleep spell takes out some of the opponents.  The Hold
Person spell is also effective.  The surviving enemies rush into hand-to-hand
combat, so set up a good defense line with the front row and then place the
bowmen and spellcasters in the rear.

4. A captain's palace, with high stone walls.  The waiting area contains
several pirates.  They attack the moment the party enters.  Defeating them
earns the party a mace +1.

5. A captain's fortress, built with high stone turrets.  Here in the anteroom
several pirates stand waiting, and attack the party as they enter.  Defeating
them earns the party 20 arrows +1.

6. A captain's mansion, with hand-crafted stone walls.  A group of pirates is
standing impatiently with a gift, and attack the party immediately.  If they
defeat them the party gains a fine composite bow +1.

7. A captain's tower, built on a promontory in the harbor.  A large group of
pirates is waiting to present their gift, and attack the party on sight.  If
they defeat them the party gains their magical gift, a Sword of Icewind Dale
+1, which does double damage against fire-based monsters (efreeti, fire
giants, slamanders, etc.)  This is the toughest of the pirate magical gift
battles, but also has the most valuable reward.

8. The Hosttower of the Arcane.  This is the location where the statuette of
the East is hidden.  The Hosttower is a very dangerous place.  Before
entering the Hosttower, go to the inn to heal the party, memorize spells, and
save the game.  If some characters are close to advancing a level, it may be
worth-while to return to Neverwinter briefly to train them and strengthen the
party before entering the Hosttower.

9. The gate to teh east leads to the old city.

10. A fisherman here explains that the River Mirar is too treacherous for
travel by boat.

11. Company of the Brazen Pennant.  This is the dock from which the party
sails to the island of Tuern and on to Gundarlun and the Purple Rocks.  A
ship is scheduled to leave for Tuern each morning at 8:00 - if the party
reaches the dock between 7:30 and 8:30 they are offered the chance to board.
The trip to Tuern costs 100 gold pieces for the entire party.

12. Red Dragon Trading Lodge, an arms and armor store.

13. A fish processing business is here.


 26 |=========================================================================

14. This is the oldest part of Luskan and is referred to as the 'Old City'.

15. This is a bridge between the mainland and an island in Luskan harbor.

16. This bridge connects two islands in Luskan harbor.

17. If the party tries to leave the city with the statuette of the East, the
pirate guards here recognize them and attack.

18. A small group of scrags are living on this abandoned pier.  This is an
especially tough battle because the layout of the pier allows the scrags to
all attack the party at once.

19. A small group of margoyles are hiding in this room, using their natural
camouflage to surprise the party.  This is a very difficult battle because
only magical weapons can damage these monsters.

20. A small group of margoyles are hiding in this room.  See not #19 above.

21. A small group of scrags attack the party here.

22. There is a 50% chance that a small group of scrags attack the party in
either of these places. They may attack in neither or in both.

23. A small group of scrags attack the party in this warehouse.


 27 |=========================================================================

Synopsis: The Hosttower of the Arcane in Luskan is home to a group of evil
magic-users who take their name from the tower.  They are allied with the
pirates who run the city.

The Hosttower is where the party recovers teh statuette of the East, the
first of the statuettes they need to find to complete the game.

Rather than being in its logical place at the top of the tower, the statuette
is actually hidden in the dungeons beneath as additional protection against
its theft.  If the party tries to scend the tower they face increasingly
difficult battles until they finally reach a dead end.  They must find the
secret doorway that leads to teh dungeon in order to claim their prize.



 28 |=========================================================================

was won, he reappears here and attacks with a group of displacer beasts.  Use
Charm Person and Hold Person spells as well as missle weapons to try to take
Brinshaar out before he can cast spells on the party.  Then use Stinking
Clouds to slow down the displacer beasts.

5. These are steep, curving ramps that lead from floor to floor of the
Hosttower.

6. The secret door in the south wall of this rooms leads to the Hosttower
dungeon.

7. Several owlbears attack the party here.

This is the only battle the party needs to fight in the Hosttower itself to
gain the statuette of the East, since the magic item the party needs lies
down in the dungeon.  Going up the tower from here only leads to tougher and
tougher battles with more and more owlbears and hosttower wizards.  These
battles can be fun and rewarding...but only if the party is tough enough to
win them.  If the party goes up the tower, they should rest, heal, memorize
spells, and save the game before each new battle.

8. These are small libraries where the mages study.  The first time the party
enters a libarry they face a Hosttower wizard and a guard.  Each time the
party entres a libarry the opposition increases to 2 wizards, 3 wizards, etc.
After the party has won the fifth of


 29 |=========================================================================

these combats - a very difficult battle - the libraries are all empty.

9. Several skeletal fighters attack the party here.

10. This is the room where the statuette of the East is hidden.  Zhentil
fighters, manticores and a Hosttower wizard are admiring it when the party
enters.  If the party wins this battle, they get the first of the four magical
statuettes needed to win the game!

If the party rejected Brinshaar's offer of assistance, he has told the mages
about the party and they are ready for their attack.  Brinshaar fights with
them.  After the Hosttower forces are defeated the party finds the statuette
of the East.  If Brinshaar is with the party, after the battle he excuses
himself and leaves.

The keys to this battle are: a) take out the Hosttower wizard (usually
through spells) before he can get his own spells off, and b) get party
members next to the manticores so they cannot fire their tail spines at the
party.  Try to finish off the front row of Zhentil fighters as quickly as
possible so the characters next to the manticores are not too badly mauled.

In addition to the statuette of the East, the treasure in this battle
includes Bracers of AC6, which help a magic user survive tougher battles.

11. Zhentarim fighters are feeding a manticore here as the party enters this
room.  They attack the party on sight.

12. Zhentarim fighters enter this room with a displacer beast just as the
party walks through the door.

13. A small group of manticores attack the party here.  This is a tough
battle, but the party has to get past it to earn the statuette.

14. Ghouls and zombies guard this room.

15. A small group of displacer beasts attack the party here.

16. Skeletal fighters and ghouls are encountered here.

17. A very large group of owlbears and Hosttower wizards defend this room.
This is the last battle on the way up the Hosttower, and the room is a dead
end.  As noted above, the statuette lies in the opposite direction.

18. A large group of owlbears and Hosttower wizards attacks the party here.

19. A large group of owlbears and Hosttower wizards attacks the party here.

20. A large group of owlbears defend this room.


TUERN

Synopsis: Tuern is a large island far to the west and north of Luskan.
Occupied by northmen, it was recently struck by a great meterorite.  The
meterorite ore can be used in making magical weapons.

Close to the great volcanic fult that erupts in the center of the island,
fire giants and other fiery monsters terrorize the local people.  Even
Uttersea, the largest town, is unsafe.

The party does not have to accomplish any missions on Tuern to complete the
game, and can proceed immediately to Gundarlun.  But, by finding meterorite
ore and taking it to Neverwinter, they can earn a magical sword that proves
useful on the way to Ascore at the end of the game.

Be sure that the party gets the Armor of the Glacier before seeking the
meterorite ore - it makes the other battles easier.  If they took the Sword
of Icewind Dale from the pirates in Luskan it is also helpful against the
monsters here.


 30 |=========================================================================

Resting: The party can rest in the Uttersea at the Inn or in any non-street
location where ther are no encounters shown.

Wandering Monsters: On mountain trails groups of Northman warriors may attack
the party.  There are 2 more of these attacks after the party wins the battle
with the fire giants, and then all the stragglers have been defeated.  In the
Margoyles' castle several otyughs defend various rooms.  After both groups of
margoyles have been defeated these attacks stop.

EVENTS

1. This gate marks the edge of Uttersea, which is built into the caldera of
an ancient volcano.  The guard here is sure the party won't survive if they
go up into the mountains.

2. Company of the Brazen Pennant.  This is where the party can take a ship to
Luskan or to Gundarlun.  Ships are scheduled to leave for both destinations
every morning at 8:00; arriving between 7:30 and 8:30 allows them to board
the vessel of their choice.  The trip costs the party 100 gold pieces.

3. Inn of the Ancient Whale.


 31 |=========================================================================

4. Lars Noneck Weapons Shop.  Lars cannot craft magical swords from
meterorite ore.

5. The King's Palace.  He tells the party about the meteorite ore and all the
foolhardy adventurers who are dying while trying to discover it.

6. Fish Market.

7. This room is full of women making clay pots.  They are being held prisoner
by the pirates in the back room.

8. Kestutis an old knight, lies here, bound and gagged by the pirates who are
looting his castle.  As a reward for saving him and to help them on their
noble mission he gives the party the magical Armor of the Glaier +1.  It
reduces fire-based attacks to half damage, and does the same for attacks by
fire-based monsters: fire giants, salamanders and efreeti.  This makes the
battles on the western side of the island easier to win.

9. Tanar's Shop of Useful Items.

10. A group of pirates is threatening one of the potters in this room.  After
the party defeats the pirates, she tells of how the pirates have been holding
the women hostage and buying meteorite ore from the fire giants.

11. Kraken guards inhabit this hideout, preparing to search for meteorites.
They have a map that indicates the meteorites may lie somewhere on the
westeren side of the island.

12. Efreeti live in this volcanic vent.

13. Otyughs guard this room.

14. Pirates are destroying this room and everything in it.

15. Margoyles are hidden here.  Only magical weapons can damage these
monsters.

16. Margoyles live behind this secret door.  Only magical weapons can damage
these monsters.

17. Salamanders live in this volcanic chamber.  Only magical weapons can
damage these monsters.

18. Otyughs guard this room.

19. There is a 50% chance that a group of scrags are clustered around each
of these hot springs.

20. Northman warriors guard this room in the castle of the fire giants.

21. Fire giants attack the party in this tiny room.  They are the ones who
have been killing adventurers and stealing the meteorite ore they've found.
See the chapter on Neverwinter for instructions on how to turn the meteorite
ore into a magical sword that is very useful later in the game.

This is the only battle on the eastern side of the island that is especially
useful to the party - all the others (against the efreeti, salamanders,
margoyles, etc.) should be tackled only for the extra experience points and
treasure by very strong parties.


GUNDARLUN

Synopsis: Gundbarg, the capital of Gundarlun, is the largest city on any
island in this part of the Trackless Sea.  Although it is a city of northmen,
it is a member of the Lords' Alliance.

When the party arrives it learns that Princess Jagaerda, the daughter of King
Olger Redaxe, has ben kidnapped by pirates and is being held for ransom
somewhere in the town.  The king fears that the kidnappers are waiting only
for a moonless night to carry her off to a fate worse than death, and
promises a rich reward for her rescue.

Gundarlun is an especially important stopping point because it is the
location for the only temple and Hall of Training in the islands.  Be sure to
rest well here, heal all injured party members, buy all needed 


 32 |=========================================================================

equipment, advance all eligible characters, rememorize spells and save the
game while in this relatively safe haven.

If one of more party members are close to advancing a level, fight some
battles here and use the Hall of Training to gain the extra benefits of their
experience before moving on.

The party does not have to accomplish any missions on Gundarlun to complete
the game, and can leave here whenever they wish.

Resting: The party may encamp anywhere except in the city streets.

Wandering Monsters: On the path on the western edge of the map 2 small groups
of scrags may attack the party.  In the city streets 3 groups of pirates may
be encountered.

EVENTS

1. This is the pier from which ships leave to go to Tuern or Neverwinter.

Note: If the party has not yet captured the statuette of the West on the
Purple Rocks, do not embark on this voyage until they have throughly rested,
rememorized all spells and saved the game.  Once they leave this dock their
ship is attacked by a Kraken (a giant, highly intelligent squid) and the
party is washed ashore on the Purple Rocks.


 33 |=========================================================================

Ships leave here every morning at 10:00.  The party must arrive between 9:00
and 10:00 to catch the ship - it always leaves on time.  They can travel to
Tuern or Neverwinter, but only arrive safely if they already have the
statuette of the West. If Jagaerda is with the party and they have the
statuette, she tells everybody goodbye here and does not go on the ship.

The seaman wants to charge 300 gold pieces for the trip.  Pretend to leave in
disgust and he cuts the price in half.

If the party retreats from the Purple Rocks without the statuette of the
West, they can return here to Gundarlun and set sail again.  The ship is
again attacked by kraken and they're returned to the Purple Rocks.

2. The party sees the kraken for a moment from this high ridge, but doesn't
know what it is.

3. This is the secret room of the palace where the kidnapped princess has
benn held.  As the party enters this room Jagaerda has just finsihed
dispatching the last of her would-be kidnappers.  They explain their mission,
and she takes the party back to her father's palace.  He rewards them with a
shield +1 and tell them much about the Purple Rocks.  He thinks they might
find someone in Tuern to take them there.

4. The Green Turtle Inn.

5. The palace of King Redaxe.  The party overhears him shouting that he
doesn't know what to do to rescue his kidnapped daughter.

6. A ship supply depot.

7. The resident of this cottage sees the party and immediately goes to
pieces, confessing he was blackmailed into helping the kidnappers of
Jagaerda.

8. The Sharper Lineage Arms Store.

9. This gate leads to an area of warehouses, and is bolted shut.

10. Tana's Merchandise Shop.

11. The Company of the Brazen Pennant.  The ships leave each morning from the
end of the dock just south of here.

12. Hall of Training.

13. Temple of Selune.  Healing services are available here.

14. The stone images on this cliff face come to life.  They are margoyles,
and attack the party.

15. A small group of margoyles are hiding in this maze, and may be at any of
the indicated locations.

16. Scrags inhabit this canyon.

17. Pirates and a northman warrior are playing cards in thsi room.

18. A small group of scrags is standing here, arguing about something.  After
the party defeats them, a single smaller scrag is left.  If they let it go,
the scrag points to the south wall.  When the party listens there, voices are
heard.  This leads the party to the pirates who have kidnapped Jagaerda.

19. Pirates and otyughs guard this passageway.


PURPLE ROCKS

Synopsis: There are two islands in the Purple Rocks, Trisk (in the west) and
Utheraal (in the east).  The people of Trisk have been enslaved by the Kraken
Society, which gathers and then sells information to whomever wants it, and
carries out all kinds of evil missions for an appropriate fee.  Their hidden
complex below Yartar is the largest base they maintain on the mainland.

When the party's ship is destroyed, they are carried by the current to
Utheraal, which


 34 |=========================================================================

lives in poverty because of ransom payments to the Krakens.

Resting: The only places the party can rest safely are: a) In either of the
Fortress Outposts after they have been cleared of Krakens; b) In the
lighthouse after the pirates are killed; c) In the one home that accepts
visitors.

Wandering Monsters: On the island trails 5 groups of scrags or northmen may
attack the party.

EVENTS

1. This is where the party's makeshift raft, salvaged from the remnants of
their ship, washes up on the island.

2. The hom of the village leader.  He tells the party more about the Kraens.

3. This hom accepst guests.  Stay here if the party needs to rest and
rememorize any spells.

4. From here the party can see the huge Kraken fortress rising from the other
island across the strait.

5. This is a small lighthouse.  Several pirates are looting the lighthouse
keeper's quarters along with a scrag.  After the party defeats them, they are
offered the chance to turn off the lighthouse lamp.  Turning off the lamp
slows down the approach of Vaalgamon's


 35 |=========================================================================

ship at the Kraken headquarters and allows the party more time to intercept
the force guarding the Pearl Chest.

6. A small boat is moored here.  Use it to cross to Trisk, the island where
the Kraken headquarters is located.

7. Kraken guards and an otyugh defend this outpost.  After defeating them in
battle the party finds half of a coded message.  Go through the west door to
find the boat that the party can use to cross strait to the Kraken
headquarters.

8. A small group of scrags are eating a fish on thsi beach, and attack the
party.

9. Kraken guards reluctantly share this fortress with a margoyle.  After
defeating them the party finds the other half of the coded message.

Using Journal entries 36 and 49 (not 52, which is false), decode the messages
by combining them, alternating letters from each scrap of paper.  This yields
the words: "costs all at it guard.  castle the of corner southwest the to it
take will guards the threatened if.  dock the to down door south the through
vault its from taken be will statue the."  Reading the words in reverse order
reveals their meaning.


KRAKEN HEADQUARTERS

Synopsis: The party's boat lands on a secluded beach of this massive and
heavily fortified complex.  It is the location of the statuette of the West.

The statuette of the West lies in a chest carved from a giant pearl, and is
stored in a vault that would be impossible to breach even with a party 10,000
strong.  But, while it is being transferred to Vaalgamon's ship, it is open
to attack.

Alamrms and The Guardians of the Pearl Chest: The Pearl Chest, with the
statuette of the West, moves through the main Kraken complex and then out
through corridors to the pier area.  This process takes 30 game minutes from
the time the party arrives on the island; for the first 20 minutes of the
journey the chest has no extra guards.

If the party doused the lighthouse on Utheraal to delay Vaalgamon's ship the
process takes 40 minutes, with 3 minutes of time passing before extra guards
are added.

The party's objective is to intercept the guards as quickly as possible and
seize the statuette without having sounded the alarm.  Once the alarm sounds
the battle to gain the magical treasure becomes much more difficult.

If they reach the pier and the alarm has not been sounded, the Pearl Chest
stays there indefinetly due to problems on the ship.  This means the party
never reaches the pier too late to save the statuette.

The alarm is sounded if:

  a. A Kraken guard successfully fless from battle and escapes.

  b. The party flees from any combat with Kraken guards.

  c. The party steps onto the main causeway leading to the front door of the
     complex.


 36 |=========================================================================

After the alarm has sounded the Pearl Chest is gradually moved deeper and
deeper into the comple for defense, as shown on the map.  The farther into
the complex it is moved for protection, the more monsters come to join the
guards.  It eventually ends up in the southwest corner of the castle, and
stays there util the party successfully retrieves it.

If the party leaves the island without the statuette and returns, the alarm
is turned off and the process begins again.

Startegy: The party's objective is to reach the dock area as quickly as
possible without sounding the alarm.  Once the boat lands, note the time so
the party can predict the location of the pearl chest.  Be sure to add 10
minutes to the listed times if the Utheraal lighthouse was doused.  Then head
directly south to the southern coastasl fortress.  The party must pass
through this fortress in order to reach the pier where Vaalgamon's ship is
moored.

Be sure the party is prepared for teh combats in the southern fortress (#9
and #7), since fleeing from a fortress battle automatically sounds the alarm.
No Kraken guards may be allowed to escape for the same reason.  Don't take
the time to fight any extra


 37 |=========================================================================

battles, such as with the otyughs in the outer room of the fortress, or with
the guards in the other outposts.

Go to the room with encounter 16.  Use the LOOK command to make time pass if
the party get to the room more than ten minutes early.  Then move around the
room until the guardians of the pearl chest enter.

If the party arrives late, use the guidelines below to locate the chest and
plan on facing extra enemies in the battle.

Resting: The only places the party can rest safely are a) in any of the
Fortress Outposts after they have been cleared or Krakens, and b) in the
scrags' castle after it has been cleared.

Wandering Monsters: Parties of Kraken guards patrol the direct access routes
to the front gates of the stronghold (the area west of encounter 4.)  There
is no limit to the number of battles with these patrols, and approaching the
complex this way sets off the alarm.

Troops of margoyles and Kraken guards patrol the stronghold itself (starting
at encounter 4.)  These forces are very strong and encounters with them are
numerous.  There is no limit to the number of battles with these patrols.

Small groups of scrags guard the northwest coastline.  After the scrags'
leader is killed there is one more scrag battle and then their portion of the
island is safe for the party to travel and rest.  Ignore these areas until
after the statuette of the West has been secured.

EVENTS

1. This is where the party hides on the island and hides their boat.  Any
time they return here thet are offered the chance to take out the boat and
escape, with or without the statuette.  If they take the boat and leave the
sea current carries them to Neverwinter.

After the party gains the statuette and before they depart the island, they
should be fully healed and have rememorized their spells.  A tough ambush is
waiting for the party in Neverwinter.

2. This is the throne room of the scrags' castle.

3. From the top of this ridge the party can see Vaalgamon's ship round the
point on its way to the Kraken harbor below.  The general himself stands at
the railing, directing their approach.

4. Alarm Trigger.  reaching this point on the main causeway sounds the alarm.
Kraken guards attack the party immediately.

5. Kraken guards are playing a game here.  The party may attack them or flee.
If they attack it is a somewhat easy battle, but if they flee the alarm is
sounded and they have to fight more guards.

6. A squad of Kraken guards has fallen asleep while standing watch in this
tiny guard post, and one wakes up as the party enters.  The party may attack
him or flee.  If they attack it is an easy battle, but if they flee the alarm
is sounded and they have to fight more Kraken guards.

7. There is a 50% chance that a group of margoyles are hidden here, and a 50%
chance that they are one room farther west.

8. A small group of otyughs guard this room.  Defeating them in battle allows
the party to search their trash heap and find a

                             RYGAR WAS HERE!
 38 |=========================================================================

map that shows the area around the pier.

9. There is a 50% chance that Kraken guards are in this room, and a 50%
chance that they are one room farther west.

10. Kraken guards man this outpost.

11. Several scrags are eating something here.  One of them is the leader of
the local clan and has a shield +1.

12. A pair of scrags are arguing here.

13. A group of otyughs attack the party here.

14. This is where the Pearl Chest is 0-10 minutes after the party has landed
on the island.  The chest has a large contingent of Kraken guards.

15. This is where the Pearl Chest is 10-20 minutes after the party has
landed.  The chest has a large force of Kraken guards.  This is one of the
best places to attack them, but getting here in time without setting off the
alarm is difficult.

16. This is where the Pearl Chest is 20-30 minutes after the party has
landed.  The chest has a large force of Kraken guards.  This is an ideal
place for the party to launch its attack.

17. This is the pier area where Vaalgamon's ship is docked.  The Pearl Chest
is here 30 or more minutes after the party has landed on the island if the
alarm has not been sounded.  In addition to their own Kraken guards, it is
defended by an otyugh.

19. This room is here the Pearl Chest is 20-30 minutes after the alarm is
sounded.  In addition to the Kraken guards, it is defended by a small group
of otyughs.

20. This room is where the Pearl Chest Guard is 30 or more minutes after the
alarm is sounded.  In addition to the Kraken guards, it is defended by
several otyughs.


 39 |=========================================================================

SECOMBER

Synopsis: The party can visit Amanitas here and recieve hints after they have
rescued him from Everlund.  On each visit he points them towards the easiest
statuette quest which they have not yet completed.

Resting: The party can rest anywhere except in the city streets.

Wandering Monsters: None.

EVENTS

1. Inn of the Eccentric Owl.

2. Anthemas' Armory.

3. River Shining Boat Rentals.

4. Amanitas' House.

5. A sign here warns the party that travelling east is dangerous these days.

6. A group of gnolls has taken over this house.

LOUDWATER

Synopsis: Loudwater is an ancient city originally built by elves.  Much of
the local population is still half-elven.  This greenery-covered town by the
River Shining is normally a very peacful place.

Its streets are twisty mazes that affect the strategy of battles fought
there.  Vaalgamon blocks the main street through town with a large force of
monsters and fighters, and sends patrols down the maze of side streets once
he knows the party is in Loudwater.

The party needs to attack these patrols one at a time and defeat them to wear
down the large Zhentarim force.  Once this strategy of divide and conquer has
weakened Vaalgamon's guards, the main group can be attacked and the
black-robed general flees the city.  If all his patrols are defeated,
Vaalgamon may launch a last-ditch effort against the party.  A large group of
Zhentil fighters is hurriedly assembled and attacks while Vaalgamon escapes.

The party can leave the city at any time without defeating Vaalgamon here;
this battle does not have to be won to complete teh game.

Be sure to rest the party fully, heal, and memorize spells before going to
Llorkh after exiting Loudwater.  Llorkh is full of traps set by the
Zhentarim, and the party should be ready for combat before they go there.


 41 |=========================================================================

Resting: The party may rest at The Woodlands Inn or at any non-street
location.

Wandering Monsters: In the mausoleum area 6 groups of ghouls and/or zombies
appear.  If the party has not yet recovered any of the statuettes, the city
streets are the scene for attacks by small groups of Zhentil fighters.

EVENTS

1. The Tavern O'er the Waters.  This tavern is built across the river and has
doors on both sides.  Use this tavern to get around the guards Vaalgamon has
posted on the bridge.

2. The Woodlands Inn.

3. Enalin's Shop of Adventurers' Supplies.

4. This gate normally is guarded; the absence of sentries should alert the
party that trouble is afoot.

5. Shining Falls Boat Rentals.

6. This is the entrance to the mausoleum area.

7. The compound of Lord Greysword, the leader of Loudwater, lies to the
north.  The castle is locked up tight and the gateway is impassable, since he
dares not interfere openly with the Zhentarim plans and is waiting for
Vaalgamon to move on.

8. The party can see Vaalgamon's guards on the eastern side of the bridge
from these locations.  As battles in the side streets wear down their numbers
their description changes.  When only a handful of fighters remain it's safe
to attack the main force.  The fewer side street battles the party wins, the
more men and monsters remain to fight the party with the main group.

9. The Mausoleum.  Skeletal fighters and ghouls attack the party here as they
earch the room.

10. A bridge over the River Shining.

11. If the party has at least one statuette, residents here tell of the
Zhentarim roughing up people in town as they look for the party.

12. Several gnolls are hiding here, believing that they are the ones being
sought by the Zhentarim patrols.  They attack the party.

13. A clan of gnolls is splitting up ill-gotten treasure here.

14. A patrol of Zhentarim fighters and a manticore is waiting for the party
here.

15. A patrol of Zhentarim fighters and a manticore intercept the party
here.
16. A patrol of Zhentarim fighters and a manticore discover the party
here.
17. A patrol of Zhentarim fighters and a manticore attack for the party
here.
18. A patrol of Zhentarim fighters and a manticore discover the party
here.

19. A nervous patrol of Zhentil fighetrs and a manticore, uncomfortable so
near the mausoleum, attacks the party here.

20. If the party has one, two, or three statuettes, Vaalgamon places his main
roadblock here.  He starts with a tremendous force of Zhentil fighters and
manticores at this location.  As the party defeats the patrols in the side
streets, the force is reduced.  Vaalgamon turns and flees if the party
appears to be winning this battle.

When the party wins this battle a fighter named Rishpal swears revenge
against Vaalgamon for abandoning the fighters here and offers to join the
party.  They should reject his offer, for he is a spy Vaalgamon wants to
plant in the party to report on their movements.

21. This room is filled with putrid dust.  Skeletal fighters and zombies
attack.


 42 |=========================================================================

LLORKH

Synopsis: Since its recent change from a dwarf-led to a human-led city,
Zhentarim caravans have appeared in Llorkh, and servicing them has replaced
mining as the chief industry.  For both its isolation and its Zhentarim
influence, Llorkh is a place that no one wants to go - just as suggested by
Amanitas - unless they are going "the long way round" the Great Desert.

The new leaders in Llorkh have been working at driving away the dwarves who
once worked the mines here, and if there are any dwarves in the party they
are taunted.  Many dwarves - including the city's last leader - have been
killed by Zhentarim death squads.

As if things weren't bad enough, a medusa has taken up residence in the old
castle, and several former residents of Llorkh are now statues visible on
city streets.

Do not enter Llorkh until each party member has bought a mirror (available in
adventuerer supply shops in many towns).  Characters must READY the mirror
during combat with the medusa in order to avoid being turned to stone.
Characters who are turned to stone may be returned to flesh at any temple,
but the fee for this process is very expensive.

Do not enter any shop or inn in Llorkh until the party is fully rested, all
spells have been memorized and the game has been


 43 |=========================================================================

saved.  The stores and inns here appear normal, but after the party conducts
its business in them they are trapped and slide down a ramp into an arena
beneath town.  They immediately go into an extended combat there, and need to
conserve their resources carefully.  The party can rest at the inn, but are
imprisoned immediately after doing so.

Resting: The party can rest anywhere except in the city streets.  They should
avoid using the inn if possible until they're ready to fight in the arena.

Wandering Monsters: In the city streets 3 groups of Zhentil fighters attack
the party.  In any of the town's buildings 3 strong groups of ogres may be
encountered.  In the old dungeon, small numbers of Hellhounds appear; after
the medusa is defeated no further wandering hellhound attacks occur.

EVENTS

1. Lord Geildarr's Keep.  If there are any dwarves in the party the guards
taunt and threaten them before they throw them out.

2. Downstream Boat Rentals.  After the party pays their 25 gold pieces they
are trapped instead of being given a boat.

3. The Griffon's Grange Tavern.  The party is trapped here when they try to
leave.

4. The Bull and Boar Tavern.  Someone has changed the 'Boar' to 'Bore', and a
girl who complains about dwarven vandals is trying to restore the sign.  The
party is trapped here when they try to leave.

5. My Horse's Home Tavern (really just another entrance to The Griffon's
Grange).  The party is trapped here when they try to leave.

6. Flowers have been set here in memory of the city's murdered dwarven
leader, Phintarn Redblade.  A Zhentarim guard wanders by, notices them and
crushes them with his boot.

7. Inn of the Lucky Caravan.  The party is trapped here when they try to
leave.

8. The Gentlemen's Armory.  The party is trapped here when they try to leave.

9. Valhala Here Inn.  If there is a dwarf in the party, a dwarf passes by as
they approach this building and warns them to get off the streets for their
own safety.  The party is trapped here when they try to leave.

11. A shrine to the dwarven deity Dumathain.

12. This is the entrance to an old castle.

13. Temple of Bane - there is no sign outside this evil temple.  Healing
services are available here, but the party is trapped when they try to leave.

14. A small party of dwarves is hiding here.  Do not attack them; if the
party talks with them they tell the party about recent events, and about the
medusa and her hellhound guards.

15. Several people who have been turned to stone by the medusa are in this
room.  Hellhounds and the medusa attack once the party moves farther into the
room.

16. Griffons and Zhentil fighters defend this tower.

17. The party is recognized when they enter this tower.  Griffons and Zhentil
fighters attack.

18. Griffons and Zhentil fighters are here.  The guards in this cold tower
are pleased to see the party, for they were about to mount a patrol to find
them.


 44 |=========================================================================

THE ARENA BENEATH LLORKH

Synopsis: This is where the party finds the statuette of the North.

Once the party is trapped in a shop in Llorkh, they slide down a long,
slippery ramp and are dumped at one end of a tunnel.  They emerge from the
tunnel into a large arena, where an audience of humans, orcs and other
monsters waits eargerly to watch their demise.  To their horro, the
statuettes the party have gained are taken from them.

Vaalgamon expresses his delight at getting to see the party butchered.  He
tells them that they face three opponents in the arena; if they defeat all
three they will be allowed to live.

The party has to cleverly budget their memorized spells, magic items and
fighting strength to get through all three battles, as there is no chance to
rest between fights.

After the party defeats all three sets of monsters, Vaalgamon congratualtes
them, says they have won the right to see another sunrise...and promises
three more sets of enemies on the next day of combat.  He laments that he
cannot stay to see their deaths since he must go north to Ascore to supervise
the coming invasion.


 45 |=========================================================================

The party is taken off to a cell.  They must escape and reach the Zhentarim
commander's office to reclaim their statuettes, then make their way back to
the surface.

Rest: The only places the party can rest safely are a) in the barracks areas
after 5 successful wandering monster encounters and b) in the cell areas at
any time.

Wandering Monsters: In the barracks, 5 groups of Zhentil fighters attack the
party.

Commodore 64 Owners: Some of the monsters in the cells and in the second
arena battle may be different from those listed below due to technical
constraints.  However, the same combat startegies should apply.

EVENTS

1. This is where the party is dumped when they slide down the tunnel after
being trapped in Llorkh.

2. The subterranean arena.  When the party enters, the statuettes are taken
from them.  If Rishpal is with them, he is congratulated for having spied on
the party for Vaalgamon and returns to the general's side.

The perty emgages in three combats in succession, with no opportunity to rest
between battles.  They fight groups of ogres, hellhounds, and then griffons.

After winning all three battles the party is taken to a call.

To win these battles the party must use its spells only when necessary.  Make
sure the archers have plenty of arrows and the magic-users have enough darts.
Only the ogreas can be affected by Sleep spells, so use those in the first
combat.  If the party has a fifth level magic-use a fireball spell can be
used in one of the remaining battles and Stinking Cloud spells in the other.
Against all these enemies try to finsih off all but one opponent and then
surrond the survivor to attack it on all sides.

3. Barracks for Zhentarim forces.

4. This is the small cell where the party is imprisoned after winning three
battles in the arena.  Take advantage of the chance to rest and rememorize
spells, and save the game.

Once the party has rested (or an hour has passed) a jailer comes to feed the
prisoners.  Someone in the cell next door attacks him, and a party member has
a chance to grab the keys - select the thief or the character with the
highest dexterity.

They unlock the cell and move outside.  The creature who attacked the guard
asks the party to release him from his cell.  He is a half-orc named Muthtur,
and offers to join the party.  If the party accepts his offer, he fights
loyally at the party's side.

Go to the other cells and release only those monsters who can help in the big
battle in the arena, where it helps the party fight a major battle.

5. A hellhound is in this cell.  Release it after releasing the ogres down
the corridor to the arena, where it helps the party fight a major battle.

6. A small group of ogres is in this cell.  If the party has not released the
hellhound they can set the ogres free and they help in the arena.  If the
hellhound is already free the ogres attack the party.

7. A griffon is in this cell.  It immediately attacks the party if it is
released.

8. A large number of griffons block the party's way when they reach either of
these points; if the hellhound and/or the ogres were set free they fight on
the side of the party during this battle.

Even with the help from several strong monsters, this is a very difficult
battle.  At the very beggining of the fight open up spaces


 46 |=========================================================================

in the party's line of fighters to allow the ogres and hellhound room to move
up to attack the griffons.  Make sure to keep the magic-users in the rear and
use spells to wear the griffons down, but try to position the spells so the
party doesn't hurt their monster allies.

9. Several Zhentil fighters are in this room.

10. Griffons attack the party here.

11. Zhentil fighters and the Zhentil commander are admiring the statuette of
the North here.  Once the party defeats them, they find the statuette of the
North and all the other statuettes that were taken from them.

After the battle the party discovers that one of the fighetrs they just
killed was Rishpal, Vaalgamon's spy.

From here the party is returned to Llorkh.  Once they have gained the
statuette of the North the shops, etc. in Llorkh function normally.


THE STAR MOUNTS

Sysnopsis: This is the site of the mountain fortress of the beautiful but
evil magic-user Ceptienne, who has allied herself with the Zhentarim.  She
rides a blackk dragon when she sets forth from her magical aerie.  The
statuette of the South is hidden here.


 47 |=========================================================================

The Star Mounts are a great mountain range that lies at the heart of the map,
deep within the High Forest.  They are so high and the winds they create are
so strong and unpredictable that - just as Amanitas foretold - birds dare not
fly there.  Only dragons and aarackocra can traverse these unfriendly skies.

At the foot of the mountains, where the river from Secomber meets the
mountains, the party can find a group of giant snakes and shambling mounds
attacking an aarakocra.  The party has the chance to rescue the aarakocra,
earning its gratitude.

Let the enemy come to the party in this battle, using the natural protection
of the forest to limit the number of monsters that can attack at any one time
while archers pepper them with arrows.  Fireball and Lightning Bolt spells
are very useful against the snakes, while Wand of the Ice Storm, even doing
just one half damage, still softens up the Shambling Mounds.

Accept the aarakocra's offer to carry the party up to Ceptienne's hidden
dungeon.  Refuse the aarakocra if the party isn't ready to undertake this
mission - the offer is renewed every time the party returns to this location.

The aarakocra sense that Rishpal is evil and refuse to carry him.  He flees
once he is found out.

Ceptienne's aerie is built as a maze based upon the three different runes for
the "C" that begins her name, each being superimposed upon the other, both
normally and upside down.  The intricate pattern this creates is so
complicated that knowing about the runes doesn't really help the party
navigate, but it feeds Ceptienne's considerable ego.

The maze has many one-way doors that can make the party wander in circles if
they don't have access to a map.  The one key secret door is also easy to
miss.  Finally whole portions of the complex don't hold anything for the
party except difficult battles with high level monsters.

The party must find Ceptienne's chamber and defeat her in order to gain the
statuette of the South.  Returning to the aerie's entrance, they can meet the
aarakocra and be flown back to the mountain's base.

Ceptienne is guarded by a variety of monsters, including especially dangerous
ones like harpies and medusae.  Do not enter her dungeon complex until each
party member has bought a mirror (available in adventurer supply shops in
many towns).  Characters must READY the mirror to avoid being turned to
stone.  Characters who are turned to stone may be returned to flesh at any
temple, but the fee for this process is very expensive.

Resting: The party can rest in any room in the mountain fortress.  They
cannot rest in the corridors.

Wandering Monsters: None.

EVENTS

1. The secret door to the east here leads towards Ceptienne's inner sanctum.

2. This is where the aarakocra drop off the party as they enter the complex.
They stay and wait for the party indefinetly.  The party can return here at
any time, with or without the statuette of the South, and be transported down
the mountain.  This is a good place to rest and heal the party, rememorize
spells, and save the game.

3. Griffons and a medusa attack the party here.


 48 |=========================================================================

4. A projection of Ceptienne appears here and says (truthfully) that 12 doors
seperate the party from the magic item that they seek.  She appears to enjoy
toying with the party and feels she can destroy them at any time.

5. Ceptienne's projection reappears to say 'One door discovered, eleven more
to fin!'

6. A projection of an angry Ceptienne appears to say that she has grown tired
of the party and no longer enjoys watching their progress.

7. Ceptienne's projected image appears again, this time to scream at the
party in rage.

8. The projection of a contented Ceptienne appears to taunt the party.  She
is happy because the party is so far off track.

9. Ceptienne's projection appears here to explain how the maze was designed.

10. Ceptienne taunts the party here again.

11. The party hears a loud roaring noise here.  It comes from the black
dragons in the room just to the north.

12. A group of ogres and griffons rushes at the party from opposite sides of
this room.

13. A nest of griffons is in this room.

14. Ogres and harpies are in this room.

15. Ogres and medusae attack the party here.

16. A pair of black dragons are in this room.  Once they are defeated,
Ceptienne's image (if she is still alive) appears to deny - truthfully - that
the party has killed her personal steed.

17. A hellhound and harpies are in this room.

18. Hellhounds and medusae guard this corridor.

19. Ogres, accompanied by hellhounds, have been looking for the party and
find them here.

20. Griffons and hellhounds guard this corridor.

21. Griffons are nesting in this room.

22. A hellhound and griffons attack the party here.

23. This is Ceptienne's chamber, and is defended by medusae, harpies and
Ceptienne herself.

It is important for the party to be fully healed and have their spells
memorized before starting this battle.  Once the action starts, try to take
out Ceptienne with a hold person spell.  Try to kill the harpies with missle
weapons and spells; they can charm characters that they get close enough to
touch.

Among the treasure items are Bracers of Defense AC6, a dagger +1, and a
Necklace of Missles.  There is also a Wand of Defoliation, which is
especially effective against shambling mounds.  This is best saved for the
final battles at Ascore.

After winning this battle, the party finds the statuette of the South.

24. A small group of black dragons are in this room; each wants to destroy
the party to gain Ceptienne's favor.  Once all but one are defeated the
remaining wounded dragon attempts to escape, only to have its wings fail and
be crushed on the rocks far below.


 49 |=========================================================================

SUNDABAR

Synopsis: Sundabar is a major town in the northeast section of the map.
Located at the edge of an opening in the mountains, it commands the only road
that leads to the dead city of Ascore.

Once the party has the four statuettes, Vaalgamon knows they have the power
to deal the Black Order a severe blow.  He uses every method at his disposal
- from bribery to trickery, from magic to sheer force - to stop them here and
seize the magic items before they reach Ascore.

Resting: The party can rest anywhere but on the city streets.

Wandering Monsters: If the party doesn't have all 4 statuettes, groups of
ogres or Zhentil fighters may appear anywhere in the city.  There is no limit
to these battles.  If the party has the statuettes the same monsters appear,
but much less frequently and never in the city streets.

EVENTS

1. Khumonne Inn.  Be sure to rest here, rememorize all spells and save the
game before facing the battles that lie ahead in Sundabar.

2. These are residences.  They hold three different local stories about all
the activities as the Zhentarim forces rushed through town.  The second house
the party visits holds an old thief who picked Vaalgamon's pocket.  He gives
the party a note from the Zhentarim leader that castigates the general for
allowing the party to threaten all their plans.  The note orders Vaalgamon to
guard all routes through Ascore.

3. Standroun's Weapons and Armor.

4. Hegemma's Store.

5. North Branch Boat Rentals.  If the party has all four statuettes, this
shop is closed until all the major battles in the streets of Sundabar have
been fought.

6. Temple of Tyr.  Healing services and fees are the same as for the Temple
of Tyr.

8. Auld Macdon's Tavern.

9. Hall of Training.

10. If the party has all 4 statuettes, they hear a strange sound coming from
this fountain.  A magic mouth offers to trade the statuettes for a great
treasure trove of gold.

Reject the offer, and the fountain reveals itself to be a stone golem and
attacks the party.  The Sword of Stonecutting (made in Neverwinter from
meteorite ore found in Tuern) makes this battle much easier.

If the party accpets the fountain-golem's offer, it is given a huge pile of
gold coins - more than the characters can carry.  The Zhentarim successfully
conquer the Savage Frontier, and the party is subsequently captured and
thrown into prison.  This ends the game, just as it does whne the party
members are all killed by monsters.

11. If the party has all 4 statuettes, they think they see monsters up ahead
to the east.

12. Someone or something has melted the stone of this gate to seal it shut.
Another gate farther to the north still leads to Ascore, but that is the
direction in which Vaalgamon wants the party to go.

13. If the party has all 4 statuettes, the plaza to the east appears to be
full of monsters - far too many for the party to overcome.  This is an
illusion created by Vaalgamon to trick the party - continue going east and it
vanishes.


 50 |=========================================================================

14. If the pary has all 4 statuettes the illusionary horde of monsters
vanishes here.

15. If the party has all 4 statuettes, the street to the north appears to be
divided by a deep chasm.  As the party speculates, this is another illusion.
But, an ambush waits for the party so that when they leap across the illusory
chasm they leap into encounter 16.

16. If the party has all 4 statuettes, a group of Zhentil fighters and ogres
ambush the party here as they leap across the illusory chasm.

17. The beautiful voice of a woman singing can be heard here.  It is the song
of a harpy who seeks to entrap the party.

18. If the party has all 4 statuettes, Zhentil fighetrs, hellhounds and
harpies launch a last-ditch attack against the party here to try to stop them
from reaching Ascore.

19. Griffons are living in this building.

20. Hellhounds and Shentil fighters attack the party here.

21. Harpies try to charm the party with their songs here.

22. Hellhounds and ogres are found here.

23. A hellhound and a small group of medusae attack the party as they enter
this room.


 51 |=========================================================================

ASCORE

Synopsis: This is the scene of the grand finale of the game.  Ascore covers a
much bigger area than any of the other regions of the game.  The party hsould
come here only after it has acquired all four of the ancient statuettes.

The once-great city has been over by legions of undead, the tortured souls
who were its last defenders.  Vaalgamon's forces have cleared a portion of
the city and built a hastily-erected wall in an attempt to keep the undead
away.

The party must get past the wandering undead, find a way through the
Zhentarim wall, then make its way through the ancient city to the plaza where
the statuettes and the Ring of Reversal can be combined to destroy the
Zhentarim plan.

Note: Once the party passes through Vaalgamon's gate they enter a series of
extended combats with no oppotunity to stop and rest or remmeorize spells.
Do not pass the gate until the party has completely prepared for the fights
that lie ahead.  They can return through the gate if these battles prove too
difficult.

Rest: The party may rest only in the areas west of Vaalgamon's gate after the
wandering monsters there have been cleared.  The area near the mirror maps is
safe for resting at all times.  They may also rest in the area immediately
east of the gate.

Wandering Monsters: Eight groups of Ascorean skeletons inhabit the area
outside of Vaalgamon's Gate, acting as guards to prevent his men from coming
out.  Encounters with these mummies occur if the party passes back and forth
near the gate.

Commodore 64 Owners: Some of the monsters and walls in the final combat may
be different from those listed due to technical constraints.  However, the
same strategies should apply.

EVENTS

1. Up to 4 groups of Ascorean skeletons and Ascorean mummies attack the party
at any of these locations.

2. These secret doors can only be found if the party has all four of the
statuettes, is in search mode and has won the battle with either the ettin or
the Zhentarim mage.

3. The door to this room is locked and requires a Knock spell to enter.  The
creature inside has a big voice, but turns out to be a small, eccentric
magic-user.  Tell him the truth and he tells the party about how he is
deciphering the mirror maps of Ascore for Vaalgamon.  If the party then
attacks him, his treasure includes Bracers of Defense AC4.  After winning
this battle the party can find the secret doors to the mirror maps room.

If the party doesn't attack and later returns, or if they lie to the
magic-user, he attacks the party with the advantage of surprise.

4. A small group of Ascorean mummies attack the party here.  Search the room
to find a chest.  The chest is trapped.  Have the party's thief attempt to
disarm the trap.  Inside the chest are a clerical scroll with 2 Cure Light
Wounds spells, a set of arrows +2 and a long bow +2.

5. Abandoned Buildings.

6. The remains of an ancient inn.

7. The east wall shows Vaalgamon's recent brickwork.

8. A mural here depicts Ascore during the height of its glory.

9. An old boatbuilding shop.


 52 |=========================================================================

10. This room, like the ones around it, used to be a seaman's quarters.  The
east wall looks new, with well-set solid stonework.

11. A magic mouth welcomes the party to central Ascore.  It tells them that
tapestries against each wall contain maps of various parts of the city.

12. Vaalgamon challenges and taunts the party here.  This begins the extended
combat sequence that culminates in the grand finale of the game.

Once the party enters combat, it moves from combat area to combat area until
it exits into the plaza of Ascore, exits back out the way it came in, or all
the characters die.  Only one character need exit from a combat area for the
whole party to exit.  The party need not kill all of the monsters in an area
to exit.  In some cases having the fastest party member sprint for an exit is
as useful a strategy as killing every monster in order to move on towards the
goal.

Use the AIM command to search each combat region and figure out where to go
before each battle is joined.  This helps the party decide if it's better to
fight or run in the particular location.

Examine the Final Combat map carefully.  The easiest route through the final
combats is to exit the first combat area to the east, exit the next three
combat areas to the north, and exit the next area to the west.


 53 |=========================================================================

Once the party is in the upper left combat area the party does not have to
confront Vaalgamon.  They can take the passageway that exits to the north
that goes around the room where Vaalgamon has gathered his forces.  When one
characetr exits the combat area to the north, the party has won the game!

13. Vaalgamon's newly constructed gate lies to the east.  It can be opened
only if the party has all 4 statuettes.  A group of giant spiders attack the
party as they start to pass through that gate.  After killing the spiders it
is safe to rest here.

14. Thick vines hang from the edges of the collapsed celing of this room.  If
the party tries to climb them or to search the room, a shambling mound
attacks.  After defeating the monster the party can climb the vines and
return to the wilderness map.


 54 |=========================================================================

15. An ettin inhabits this room.  After the party defeats him they can find
the secret doors to the mirror maps room.  The ettin has a note giving
directions to where the doors are located.  The ettin's treasure includes a
Dwarven Battle Axe +2 (+4 is used by a Dwarf), a potion of healing and gems.

16. A fire burns at the center of this room.  If the party puts it out,
several Ascorean skeletons and Ascorean mummies appear and attack the party.
The fire's owners, a troll and a large group of hobgoblins, return and attack
as well.

17. Each of these three mirrors bears a faint impression of an ancient
tapestry, that hung before it for centuries.  The party copies each into the
journal, but remember that mirrors shows things in reverse, not the way they
really look!  These maps must be held up to a mirror to show the true layout
of Ascore!

Each mirror is guarded by a group of Ascorean skeletons.  Be sure to rest and
memorize spells between each of these three battles - once the undead
defending a particular mirror have been destroyed that spot is safe for
resting.  All other areas of the mirror room are also safe for resting at any
time.

On their first move after their third victory, a party member falls into a
pit.  In the pit, the character finds a clerical scroll with two Cure Disease
spells and a magic Elven Long Sword, +2 vs. Undead.

18. Ancient Souvenir Shops.  Ascorean skeletons attack the party the first
time they go here.

19. A strong group of trolls and ettins face the party here.

20. A very weak goblin force is here.  The party can ignore them and exit the
combat area on the eastern side of the region.

21. When any character exits the combat area from thsi point, the party has
won the game and the grand finale begins.

22. Vaalgamon himself, along with a large group of Zhentil commanders, Kraken
mages and shambling mounds await the party here.

This is a very tough battle.  The party can avoid the battle by having the
fastest character run through the passageway to the top of the combat map -
when one party member reaches this spot the party has won the game!  The
undead of Ascore kill Vaalgamon and his minions and the grand finale begins.

23. A small army of goblins attacks the party here.  Use Sleep spells to get
large numbers of them at once, and to block off the back row monsters behind
rows of sleeping comrades.  Exit the combat area to continue the final
combat.

24. Kraken mages and Zhentil commanders are waiting here for the party to
enter.  Use Hold Person and Charm Person spells to slow them down and cause
confusion in the enemy ranks.  Exit the combat area to continue the final
combat.

25. Shambling mounds and ettins guard this chamber.  Focus fireball spells on
the ettins, as they are useless against the shambling mounds.  Use the Wand
of Defoliation to take out the shambling mounds.

26. Zhentil commanders, Kraken mages and shambling mounds all wait to face
the party here.

to rescue her. She leaves the party whenever they embark for the mainland,
