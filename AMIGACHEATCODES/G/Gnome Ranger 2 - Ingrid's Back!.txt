                              INGRID'S BACK


PART 1 - LITTLE MOANING.

Ingrid starts in the village hall carrying an invitation and a protest
petition. The gnomes had been waiting for their party but have now realised
they've been tricked by Jasper Quickbuck. Ingrid decies to get up a protest
petition and give it to Great Aunt Halfyard who will present it to the council
Your dog Flopsy is with you.
Make sure only residents and "goodies"sign the petition. Others will sign with
false names.
Go to inn. Jumbo Butterpat pours you a mug of scrumpy on the house. "Give
petition to Jumbo"; he signs (+10). Go to Flora, "give petition to Flora"; she
signs (+10). Ignore the travelling salesgnome, Silas Crawley and Mrs Underlay.
Go to shop. "Give petition to Miss Farthing"; she signs. (+10). She asks if
you'll deliver a bag of groceries to your uncle Dusty at the mill. Get bag. Go
to mill. The sign outside says 'no Ingrids' and when you go east, the watch
chickens scare you back. "Flopsy, east".She goes east and chases the chickens.
(+20). Go east. By the mill, "drop groceries, ring bell, hide".Uncle opens the
door to get the groceries."Stand"; he's shocked to see you and falls into some
sacks of flour which fall on him. He says he'll sign your petition if you get
the dog away from him. "Flospy, west"; she leaves."Give petition to Dusty"; he
signs (+10).
In Dark Wood, a sign reads 'Beware of escaped gorilla'. To the west, you meet
the gorilla which won't let you past and chases you when you go east. However,
it gets tangled in the briers. (+20). It turns out to be Rollo in a gorilla
suit. He finally escapes and runs away.
Go to Aunt. "Give petition to aunt"; she signs and says she'll present it at
the next council meeting when you have enough signatures. She also points out
an article in the paper showing Jasper Quickbuck giving free holidays to
council members.
Go to Gnettlefield Farm and get various members of the family to sign; Gnoah
Budblast, Arback Garden, Grandma Gnutson, Gnoggin Garden, Gnora Bottomlow,
Dimple and Bumpy. You get 10 each, 70 in all. Ignore Amillaria Budblast.
On Cawing Road, it is too far to walk north.The rook there (who is bigger than
Ingrid) says he will help if he can as after the houses, their trees will be
next to be demolished.
Go to the lighthouse.The door to it is too high for you to get in. Go to rook.
"Rook, take me"; it does so. "Rook, go to lighthouse". He lands on a landing
pad at the top (+10). A hatch leads down. Inside is Millie. "Give petition to
Millie"; she signs (+10) and lets you out by lowering a long ladder.
Go to Boney Spratt, he's fishing but he's too fed up to sign anything as he
hasn't caught a thing all day and his boat is on the wrong side of the river.
The bridge over the river is broken. "Knock on door"; Mrs Spratt opens it and
signs (+10)
"Sign petition" yourself (+10).
Go to the front door of Isfrunt Garden's house. You can't knock on the back
door as the wood is too soggy and if you knock on the front door,he sneaks out
through the back. So, "Flopsy, SW, NW, wait" ie so she's by the back door.Wait
till she gets there, then "knock on door". Isfrunt tries to sneak out the back
but Flopsy picks him up and takes him back to Ingrid, then goes back to the
back door in case he tries to sneak off again. He signs the petition and runs
back into the house. (+20)
Go to Gnat Tackhammer. He is working on a dogless carriage but won't let you
take it out without him. "Give petition to Gnat"; he signs (+10). "Get into
carriage", go to the top of Ploughgnome Hill, and right down to the bridge.The
carriage goes faster and faster and you sail across the gap. The carriage is
broken and gnat swims to the west bank. You can see the boat. (+20)
Go to Three Mole hill, in. You know there's someone there but they won't come
out. "Drop petition, out, in". Get and exam petition; you see the hermit has
signed it (+10)
Go to boat, get into boat, go over the river. Wait for Boney.He arrives and is
pleased to see his boat. He says he'll do anything in return."Give petition to
Boney"; he signs (+10)
Go to Tack's farm. You can hear someone behind the door but they won't open it
and the window is too high. "Get short ladder", go to window, "drop ladder,
climb ladder". You are in a bedroom. Mrs Tackhammer is looking very red and
there's a noise from the wardrobe. "Open wardrobe"; Seamus Sosmall climbs out
saying that oen of his teleportation spells must have gone wrong again! "Give
petition to Mrs Tackhammer, give petition to Seamus"; they both sign (+10),
(+10), and when Ingrid leaves, Seamus makes an excuse to go back upstairs.
The petition is now complete. Go to Great Aunt, "give petition to Aunt"; she
says she'll present it at the next council meeting (+10)
(Note - at Ridley's end, the notice reads; maid wanted,pay 30 turnips/week and
accomodation. This links with part3.)

PART 2- STEAMROLLER AT DAWN.
Start from save Ingrid4 300/300
Ingrid wakes on the stairs with a hangover after celebrating her success with
the petition! Don't open the door to her room or you will be buried under a
pile of turnips.
In the kitchen, the family hears a crash outside. Gnoah goes to investigate.
"Examine table";you find a loaf which is the same shape as a troll's head. Get
loaf.
Go to steamroller. On the way, Seamus arrives. He says despite the petition,
the people of Little Moaning have been evicted and the farm is next. He
suggests you steal Silas' plans and also do something to his steamroller.
At the steamroller, "Flopsy, get plans". She does, and gives them to you. You
read them and see that if Gnettlefield Farm is destroyed, there's no-one left
to save the valley. You and Flopsy eat the plans. (+20)
To stop the steamroller going to the farm,"Gnoah, lie down on ground"; he does
and when the trolls try to lift him they find he's too heavy to move. Silas
says they'll go round the other way (+20)
Go to Soggybottom field and wait for Silas. When he arrives,go to dam and "hit
dam". Water floods the field (+30). Silas and the trolls leave the steamroller
to go and mend the dam. Go to steamroller, examine chimney; the right size to
stuff a troll's head into. "Drop loaf into chimney". The steamroller explodes.
Silas tells Bane, Chugg, Doldrum, Fuddle and Gormless to round up the
Bottomlows and Ergot to lock them in the barn while Amble deals with you (+20).
Amble starts to chase you.
Go to root and down into lower warren. "Flopsy, up, bite through root"; she
goes. "Wait 2, up". You climb up the root, Flopsy bites through it and Amble
falls into the lower warren (+20)
Go to top of windmill, "pull brake": the vanes start to turn,"push lever"; you
see a hook descending outside (+10).Go down and find a troll eg Fuddle and get
him to the inn yard. "Flopsy, in, up, pull lever"; she goes, "fasten Fuddle to
hook"; in a couple of moves he rises into the air (+30)
Get the cask while you're at the mill.
Get the millstone and find a troll eg Gormless. Go to trapdoor and open it; he
tetters on the edge. "Push Gormless"; he falls in,"put millstone on trapdoor":
it stops him getting back out (+20)
Get Doldrum to chase you and go to guinea pigs.You must make sure that Doldrum
is behind one of the south gates. "Open gate" so the guinea pigs escape into
the main pen. Now each time that Doldrum enters the pen from the south end,the
guinea pigs fuss all over him and he leaves through the same gate.So if you do
this when he enters from the north, he won't be trapped (+20)
Go to the back of the barn where you see a loose brick and "get brick"; the
family hear and push from the other side. Do this 4 times, the barn collapses
and Ergot is flattened by the barn door (+30)
Go and get the telelilies which have appeared where the flood was. One is
blue, the other green. Go to well and "drop green telelily into well". "Drop
blue telelily", "get into blue telelily"; you materialise in the well (+10).
There's a handbag there which contains lipstick and perfume. Get it. "Get into
green telelily"; you materialise back at the top of the well. "Wear perfume",
"wear lipstick". Bane is guarding the farm house door. If you have seen him
before this, you'll know that he has fallen for Ingrid. Go to Bane, wearing
perfume and lipstick and he is so overcome by her appearance that he makes a
tryst at Tack's farm and rushes off to have a bath (+20)
Carrying cask, in, Chugg is inside. He has a bottle and is drunk."Give cask to
Chugg": he opens and drains it, collapses and crawls outside. Ingrid realises
she must get the deeds to the farmhouse but she hears noises from upstairs
(+20)
Up.Silas Crawly sees her and makes her get the deeds from under Grandma's bed.
When he leads you back to the landing at the top of the stairs, "put deeds
under door"; he opens the door to get them and is covered by the turnips from
inside which fall on him. Ingrid tickles him till he agrees to leave everyone
in the valley and farm alone (+40)

PART 3 - RIDLEY'S END.
Start from save Ingrid8 score 600/600
Life went back to normal but Jasper was still living at the manor and no-one
knew what he was up to. So Ingrid goes to work as a maid there. Her cousin
Daisy works there already.
In the avenue, Seamus and Gnoah are up a tree. They say he must be up to
something and Ingrid must go and collect the evidence.She can give them a wave
when she's got enough.
Arrive at porch (+20). If you knock on the door, the butler tells you to go
into the servant's yard. Enter kitchen (+20). You are given a scone but if you
eat it, you find it's full of curry powder. Go to the yard, "examine bin" to
see rubbish. "Daisy, examine rubbish"; she finds a letter (+20). "Get letter,
exam it" (+10); it's from the Department of Trade and Industry saying they've
had complaints about Jasper's gilt-trading firm and will send an inspector in
4 or 5 years time.
Go to the path south of the changing room. "Hide behind lounger". Jasper goes
for a swim. Go into changing room to find a filofax. Get it (+20) and read it.
It's full of evidence including a lot of dodgy phone numbers.Do this early on.
If you go to the loft and "look through hole", you can see seomone signing
their signature over and over again, and then writing on a canvas in a room of
paintings, or scratching at the surface of a painting with a brillo pad.
Go to tree court and you see it casts a shadow. "Exam shadow"; you see a hole.
Go through and up to the attic. "Wait" several times.Eventually, Rulf arrives.
Ho pushes the west wall and goes through an opening. Inside, "exam canvasses";
you see lots of forgeries and a masterpiece (+20). "Examine masterpiece"; it's
a forgery of the Gnoma Lisa. Get masterpiece (+10)
Some time,Seamus arrives and says Jasper knows who you are and is going to set
you up for stealing his antiques, so find evidence quick. The police will
arrive if you don't finish in time.
Enter the library (+10) and read the books. They give hints: Step by step tax
dodging The ghost of Ridley's End Home insurance, some pages are torn out.
Daisy says she heard him say something about stolen antiques Masterpieces of
the world Answering machines A swashbuckling novel about walking along window
ledges and swinging from chandeliers The water babies; and one about the
diseases you can catch from dustbins A thriller about searching furniture and
hiding behind curtains A novel about a toff who wanted to marry a girl who
sold mangel wurzels.
Go to Reading room and from there to the roof (+20). Go to Jasper's bedroom
(note it's locked if you try to enter from the other side through the door).
There's a tape in the answering machine which has a play and record button. In
the wardrobe is a manual telling you how to use it. There's a jacket in there
too. Examine it; it has a pocket, "look in pocket"; you find a wallet, "get
wallet (+10) examine wallet"; in it is a photo of Jasper and some council
members on his yacht which shows how he got his planning permission (+20)
Every so often, the phone will ring and someone answers it on an extension.
"Get tape, put it in machine, press record" when the phone is answered. You
record a message. There are several, all incriminating so just record any one
(+20). Get tape (+10)
In the Long Gallery, you see a portrait and a heavy curtain. If you move the
portrait, you see a safe with a combination lock. The curtain is transparent
but looks solid from a distance. Drop a piece of evidence (eg the letter) and
"hide behind curtain"; Daisy comes behind too. "Wait for Jasper". He picks the
object up and says he must lock it somewhere safe. Wait twice, he opens the
safe and you see the combination is 888155. He puts the letter inside and
closes the safe, then slides the portrait back.
When he leaves, "stand up, move portrait, 888155"; it opens."Exam safe" (+20);
you see the letter and accounts. "Get letter, get accounts (+10), close safe,
slide portrait". You must do this fairly quickly so you don't get caught. Note
that you lose the relevant points when you drop the letter but get them back
when you retrieve it.
At the end of the west gallery, Ingrid thinks it looks a bit short. "Open
window"; you see a narrow ledge. Go this way to the secret room. In there you
see all the furniture missing from the house +20) "Exam antiques"; you find a
diamond (+20). It's the Moaning Star, meant to have been stolen in a robbery,
which was obviously a swindle. "Get diamond" (+10). Leave east.
The butler hangs about round the door to Jasper's office and won't let you in.
Go to the porch with Daisy and "Daisy, wait 10, knock, wait 4, knock". Go to
outside Jasper's room. The butler leaves to answer the door when the knock
sounds. Go in, "exam desk"; you see blotting paper and a drawer (+20). "Get
blotting paper (+10), get drawer (+10)"; a few missing check stubs fall out.
"Get stubs" (+10), leave before the butler comes back or he takes everything
from you when you leave and puts it on the desk. "Exam blotting paper"; you
read about a tip for a takeover bid,    I got it the day before and cleaned up
gnicely. (+60 total)
Go to avenue and "wave"; they don't appear so Ingrid shakes the tree.They fall
out and examine the evidence. They say it's time to pay the squire a visit.
Seamus gives you a phial to drink as he says you look as though you need it.
(+10)
Go to Jasper. He runs to the ballroom and locks himself in. Go up to
chandelier, "untie chandelier"; you swing to the ballroom and knock Jasper
over. He asks what she wants him to do and as a result of the potion, she asks
him to marry her! (+40)
