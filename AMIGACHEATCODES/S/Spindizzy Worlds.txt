Spindizzy Worlds


 EDITOR:

 Start the game and select a cluster of planets to view it close up.
 Now type in 'Edit' (capital E, and the rest in lowercase) and a
 disclaimer will appear. If you agree with the disclaimer then some
 brief instructions will appear. Press fire to return to the planet
 cluster and fire again to play. There will not be any scenery there,
 you can now create your own.
