                          WORM IN PARADISE

Before describing a solution to this adventure, it must be accepted that
there not a move-by-move answer to your problems from start to finish! Only
the very early part of the adventure is constant,as far as a solution is
concerned.This is due to two main features:

1 THE EDEN TRANSPORT SYSTEM-which throws up different address locations on
                            each load of the game.

2 THE FUZBOTS OF ENOCH-who could crop up anywhere at any time.

These being obviously in addition to any normal problems you may generate
by the wrong action.Other notable features are:

3 The Enoch TIME system - be sure to be home before curfew is imposed,and do
                          not attempt to start a job too late in the day or
                          the Workplace Droid will reject you!

4 Never be in debt-you cannot afford the fine AND complete the game so keep
                   an eye on your Creds by EXAMINE TATTOO.

THE EDEN TRANSPORT SYSTEM: Refer to your maps for clarification!

This consists of three ETS Roundabouts all accessible from the Northmost
roundabout.They are uniquely colour-coded by the FIRST COLOUR mentioned on
a grid location,as follows:

RED........the ETS EAST
BROWN......the ETS NORTH
BLACK......the ETS WEST

When entering an ETS type JUMP to reach the centre and say EXIT to leave
(then SOUTH).

There are SIX important addresses on the ETS which you must visit, BUT they
may differ on each loading of the game!

1.YOUR HABIHOME
2.THE SOCIALIST'S HABIHOME
3.THE JOB CENTRE
4.THE TRAVEL AGENTS
5.THE FLORISTS
6.THE HARDWARE WAREHOUSE

The first one is easy to find and you don't really need to remember this
address-just type SAY HOME in open areas,other than exits from roundabouts
leading to an ETS,and you are deposited one move North of your Habihome
(SOUTH to enter).On leaving your Habihome,type SAY EXIT then SOUTH and you're
placed somewhere on the Northmost Roundabout,depending on your home address.

The second one (Socialist's Habihome) is found by examining a brooch.

The remaining four are given out on television advertisements.

(Note:-Do not type ahead too far in advance as the parser becomes confused If
however, you become lost,just type JUMP and start working through the
appropriate sequence of directions again.)

The final note before commencing the game is regarding the clock.It is a
decimal clock (0-10)...5 is Midday and 10 is Midnight.Curfew is 10-3.Each
hour consists of 100 minutes-WAITcommand uses 10 minutes any other single
input uses 1 minute.

It is wise to tackle the adventure in day stages but don't waste any days
because after about a week the Fuzbots get fed up of you wandering about and
fine you for being a parasite of the state,irrespective of your work record.

THE SOLUTION
The early part of the game is constant.You start in a dream in a Garden in
Paradise.

YOUR HABIHOME
The poster is really a television screen.SAY ON to operate it,or SAY OFF to
close it down.In the Bodymaint is a nozzle-SAY ON for a refreshing shower but
remove your tradclads or other clothing first! The shower will remind you of
this! If you don't shower REGULARLY the Droids may refuse to serve you.The
crack in the wall is your bed slot.SAY BED and it will swing down. LIE ON BED
to use it.If you SAY BED while you're still on it you are swung down to the
Undercity below your Habihome,but wait until you're sure that you know how to
get out again before you try this! When your tattoo buzzes and announces
Curfew in 1 hour,type SLEEP while on the bed and make a note of your dream.

Go to the Florist's Shop,buy the wreath,leave the ETS and make your way to
the Memorial in the Theme Park.DROP the wreath at the Memorial.Go to the
Jobcentre and take a job as a Clerk.If you're offered a YTS/YOP job, SAY NO
and she'll offer you a job as a Clerk, eventually-if she doesn't you'll have
to return the next day.maybe you haven't showered.Take the card to the
Workplace and go DOWN.After your days work you're escorted out again.SAY HOME
and go SOUTH into your Habihome.Go to bed and SLEEP after curfew is announced

the Clerks job),take the card and proceed to the Workplace.This time upon
entering you're taken to a Workshop.Go WEST and you are in the Waldroid
Control Cocoon.You now assume the role of the Waldroid in the Workshop.Go
EAST and make your way to the Hardware Warehouse.(The Waldroid behaves
exactly as if it was you moving about i.e. JUMP,SAY EXIT,etc).Buy the valve.
You obtain it for nothing on the council rates; if you had tried to buy it as
yourself it would have cost you 1000 Creds! Return to the Workshop-the
Waldroid controls die and you return to your normal role.EXAMINE the WALDROID
on the way out and TAKE VALVE.Go home,drop the valve,WAIT until curfew is
announced then SLEEP.

DAY 5.
Have a shower and proceed to the Pet Shop in the Pleasure Dome (9 Creds to go
NORTH through the turnstile).There is a Dagget here that was 800 Creds on Day
1 but is now only 500 Creds.BUY DAGGET.

THE DAGGET
This is a robot dog.EXAMINE it to reveal that it is a kind of plastic
labrador It operates on batteries through a Batpak.There is no need to carry
the Dagget for as long as he is fitted with the Batpak he'll follow you
around and you don't risk getting fined for possessing him then To immobilise
the Dagget,or stop him from following you,REMOVE BATPAK and then drop it. The
Dagget winds down after a few moves.Ignore the majority of his crazy antics.
they appear purely for show.Go to the Museum and REMOVE BATPAK.You now have
to steal a Helmet and Leotard from the exhibition without anyone seeing you
do it or leaving with the stolen items.Also there is a security screen
covering them.The exception to the latter rule is when the Tourist Guide
comes in and shows the exhibits to some tourists.WAIT until the tourists
leave,then TAKE HELMET AND LEOTARD (you only have ONE move before the screen
comes down again!).PUT HELMET IN DAGGET-REMOVE TRADCLADS-WEAR LEOTARD-WEAR
TRADCLADS.no-one is any wiser as to your misdeeds now.Don't forget to TAKE
DAGGET and then go back to your Habihome.

REMOVE HELMET-DROP HELMET-REMOVE TRADCLADS-REMOVE LEOTARD-DROP LEOTARD-WEAR
TRADCLADS-PUT BATPAK IN DAGGET.

Take the brooch from the wallet and go to the Socialist's Habihome.The Dagget
will find an Invitation for you.Return home with the Invitation.Remove the
Batpak from the Dagget and DROP BATPAK.Examine the Invitation and note the
time of the meeting (usually at '6').Drop the brooch,take the medallion and
valve, together with the invitation.WAIT until the Dagget grinds to a halt
then go to the Bison's Temple at the far North of the Pleasure Dome Corridor.
Time is important here,as you're only allowed a couple of minutes leeway from
the time stated.WAIT or go SOUTH then NORTH until ONE MINUTE BEFORE the
appointed time of the meeting.remembering that a move is ONE minute,WAIT is
TEN minutes.(EXAMINE TATTOO regularly).At the appointed time,enter the Temple
and WAIT until the Bison leader comes out to meet you.Joining fee is 100
Creds.After becoming a Bison go WEST to the Temple Bar and BUY the Bottle of
Wine,then go home.Drop the medallion,valve and bottle and leave the Dagget
for now.Take the wallet and brooch,together with your invitation,and hand
them in to the Police,at the Police Station,in the order:-GIVE INVITATION-
GIVE BROOCH-GIVE WALLET.They tell you something you already know and you
receive a small reward-EXAMINE TATTOO.Return home,have a shower and SLEEP
when curfew is announced.

DAY 6.
TAKE BATPAK-PUT BATPAK IN DAGGET.(You need him for the next task).Have a
shower again and proceed to the Jobcentre yet again.Turn down everything and
as the Droid shakes our hand it realises that you are now a Bison and offers
you a job as a Managing Director.Go to the Workplace with the Dagget.This
time,upon entry,you're shown to a Fabulous Office entrance. Go NORTH and
you're up to your neck in carpet-but the Dagget keeps it at bay so as not to
impede your progress.Go WEST to your desk in the Boardroom.After your day's
work you're escorted out-with not a little increase in Creds.(EXAMINE TATTOO)
Make your way to the Travel Agent's and buy a ticket.You couldn't have bought
it before because it only sells to Bisons,but make sure you've had a shower
that day Go home,WAIT until curfew is announced then SLEEP.you're going to
need all your wits for the last day.

DAY 7.
This is the final day and it is essential that you SAVE game up to this point
as a lot of things could still happen-even on the last move Don't worry about
the time or Creds,you'll soon have plenty of both,providing you're in the
right place with the right equipment.Deactivate the Dagget(REMOVE BATPAK-WAIT
)and after your morning shower proceed to the Hardware Warehouse and buy the
Vidcam,(cost is 300 Creds).Return home,get the ticket,ensure that you are
still carrying the Vidcam,then SAY BED-LIE ON BED-SAY BED.You are taken down
to the Undercity.Refer to the map and proceed SOUTH to the Disgusting
Junction.Go WEST and TAKE SIGN then DROP the sign at the Disgusting Junction.
It tells the Droids where the rubbish and junk should be deposited.they
always leave it by this sign Go back to the Cluttered Stained Room (WEST) and
you'll notice a Junk Heap.The cleaning Droids will eventually move this to
wherever you have placed the sign-but you must be very patient! When the junk
heap is all moved from this location an exit South through a grill is
revealed.A more useful exit,that was there all the time but not mentioned in
the location description,is North past the Waterfall to a ledge behind! Move
NORTH ONCE ONLY from behind the waterfall and you will see a Flying Saucer.
The wiggly roots before you are part of an alarm/gas system so stay put!
SQUEEZE VIDCAM to record the scene then proceed SOUTH-SOUTH-EAST to the
Disgusting Junction.If the junk heap has not appeared here yet then have a
walk around (or WAIT) awhile.When the junk heap materialises CLIMB HEAP then
UP,and you pass through the manhole-one way-to the Workplace Roundabout Exit
of the Southmost Roundabout.Proceed to the Police Station and GIVE VIDCAM.Go
to the Riverboat Platform in the Theme Park and then NORTH to cross the river
to the Island of the Mighty.(This is ONE-WAY once only!).Follow the map to
the South of the Fabulous Foyer where you see a Reception Droid.On arrival
you are escorted by elevator to the Top Floor and subsequently interviewed
about the aliens on television.The 3rd Kimberley rewards you (1000 Creds) and
makes you a Party Member.You are then taken back home.
