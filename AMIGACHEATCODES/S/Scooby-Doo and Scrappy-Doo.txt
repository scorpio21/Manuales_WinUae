Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo


 CHEAT MODE:

 When the screen of Scooby and Scrappy Doo appears, simply type in
 'qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm' in lower case to give you continues
 up to Iceland.

 Also try this. Play once and die to go back to the title screen.
 Now type in 'STIG THE RAT 2' and begin play again to see Stig The Rat
 (which was apparently used before the Scooby sprites were approved)
 in Scrappy's place.
