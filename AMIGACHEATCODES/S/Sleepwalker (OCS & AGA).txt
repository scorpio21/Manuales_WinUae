Sleepwalker


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the title screen type in 'DINGADINGDANGMYDANGALONGLINGLONG'.
 Lee and Ralph's red noses will now turn green. Now when the game
 starts just press [Return] to skip levels. Or press the [Tab] key
 to top up Lee's sleep bar, and give you nine attempts and light up
 the word comic.
