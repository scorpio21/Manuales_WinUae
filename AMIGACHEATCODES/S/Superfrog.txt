TIPS
----

Hidden Rooms:
-------------

These can be found behind false walls, which are moved by running into
them. Often they are located above ground, and will only appear if
Superfrog is going upwards. Wings make the location of these walls easier.

Extra Coins:
------------

Lots of hidden gold coins can be located by jumping into certain objects
such as pictures, rings, lamps and shields.

Lucozade:
---------

Always drink this even if your energy level is full, because it will give
you extra time.

False Floors:
-------------

These are strategically posistioned so that Superfrog will fall back to
near the beginning of the current level. They are usually located below
lonely bonus items (not fruit), so avoid temptation!

Fruit Machine:
--------------

The HI/LO feature tends to be rather random. If you have a high score go
for the 2x score feature because an extra life is awarded for every 200,000
points scored. Avoid gambling - you hardly ever win.

Slippery Sections:
------------------

Icy parts will often lead to dangerous areas such as spikes, so it`s not a
good idea to go along them at high speed. Jumping will slow you down
considerably.

Spikes/Blocks:
--------------

Moving spikes and blocks cause the loss of an energy bar. Stationary spikes
result in the loss of an entire life, so be careful.

Defeating The Witch:
--------------------

Stand on the middle platform, and hit the witch with spud half-a-dozen
times. Move to the left of the screen, then to the middle after she has
swopped down, and repeat the process.
