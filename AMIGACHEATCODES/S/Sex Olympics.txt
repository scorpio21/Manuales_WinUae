                      Sex Olympics Solve

                        by Out to Lunch


    The goal in this graphic adventure is to score with more women than Dr.
Dildo does before the time runs out in the Sex Olympics.  Objects needed to
accomplish various tasks are found at many locations on twelve planets and
inside the ship Big Thruster.  There are some objects that are placed in
random locations from game to game and the maps of and paths to be taken
for some of the planets vary from game to game, so a definitive solve for
Sex Olympics is not possible.  Instead of offering a linear solution, I will
detail what can be done on each planet, and you will have to decide in what
order you want to move from planet to planet.  There are two sets of actions
for each planet--scoring with a woman and preventing Dr. Dildo from scoring
with a woman, so for each planet I will offer the means to both.
    The randomly placed objects are the thermo schlong warmer (T.S.W.), the
weapon (C.D.G.), the Federation-issued Stun Gun, the Joe Smith I.D., the
C-size battery, the 6 volt battery, the 9 volt batter, the pair of glasses,
the key and the skeleton key.  These objects may appear in any location on
any planet or in the Big Thruster.  The two keys are dropped by Dr. Dildo
during his travels.
    Look for and take objects in every location.  Look for keys in locations
Dr. Dildo has visited (this can be checked by reading the galactic
bulletins, using the radar and looking at the ship's log), which may require
you to revisit some locations.
    You will have to refuel on earth occasionally by going there and using
the tank.
    At many locations you can get clues by talking to Sandy.  At many
locations hints are given about the location of objects and successful
strategies.
    For some variety, try Look, Touch, Kiss, Eat face, breasts, loins before
and after sex with the females.

    When you go in any direction from Outside Big Thruster, you arrive in
one of the four outer desert locations on this map, and the center location
becomes a desert location.   There is a secret location with Pricilla in her
car that can be reached by only one of the four outer desert locations. 
The hint is Bitches and Beaches are found in the sand dunes retreat (or are
found in the direction of the rising sun or are found in some such
direction).  What this means in the first case is at the southern desert
location go south or at the eastern desert location go east and so on for
the other two hints.  When the wrong choice is made, you arrive at the
center desert location.  Instead of using the hint, you can use the trial
and error method, which is simply to try each location for the secret exit.
