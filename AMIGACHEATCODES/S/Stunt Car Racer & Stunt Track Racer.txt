Stunt Car Racer


 PLAYING TIPS:

 Little Ramp
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 When you take the first corner, take it at full belt and tackle the
 ramp at about 150mph. OK, this might sound a little bit aggressive,
 but it does work.

 Humpback
 ~~~~~~~~
 Accelerate around to the hump, so that you reach 200mph by the time
 you are halfway up. At this speed you should manage to have a fair
 jump and landing.
 On the other ramps, either keep below 130mph or above 180mph.
 Anything between these speeds will result in hefty damage.
 The rest of the track should be taken at about 170mph.

 Big Ramp
 ~~~~~~~~
 Take the first two small ramps at 170mph, then get up to 210mph for
 the main ramp. The rest of the course should be a doddle.

 Stepping Stones
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Head down the starting straight at 110mph and take the second gap at
 100mph. When you get to the steps, push up to 140mph and nudge the
 speed up if it falls below 110mph.

 High Jump
 ~~~~~~~~~
 Get up to about 210 mph from the start to clear the jump and keep
 under 200mph for the small jump.
 You can tackle the slanted road in one of two ways - either keep at
 the top and keep the speed up, or give the car a slight nudge to the
 right every now and then.  If you do manage to slip off the side of
 the road simply press the fire-button as well as pushing forward and
 right instantly.

 Roller Coaster
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Keep your speed under 110mph on the first hill that you come to and you
 should take the bumps fairly easily. Remember - don't push too hard!

 Ski Jump
 ~~~~~~~~
 Keep the speedo just below 100mph when you go up the first hill and
 on the second keep to around 140mph, slowing down after the jump.
 For the big jump, get up to 220mph, but if you can't manage it just
 crawl around and you'll live.

 Drawbridge
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 When you're at the drawbridge, put the pedal to the metal when the
 bridge has gone down about halfway. Tackle all the hills for the next
 ramp at 140mph, then on the bumpy section head down the middle of the
 track at 170mph.  Lastly, get up to top speed for the downhill jump.

 General Hints
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you get stuck in a hole, drive slowly to the wall and accelerate
 with boost. You should hit the track or drive off the edge minimising
 the damage.
 At the beginning of a race, accelerate and pull left to block off the
 other driver - you may even manage to run him off the track.
