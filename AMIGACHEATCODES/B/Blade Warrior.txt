                           A FEW EXTRA NOTES
                           *****************

You can encounter Murk during the game.  Each time you defeat him he will
come back stronger the next time.  If possible, try to avoid fighting him
until the end, then he will be at his weakest.  The orchid and humming bird
are not required to finish the game, and you actually only need to collect
one of the two Stone Flutes.  
The Dragon spittle may be hard to find!  (Or at least thats what it says
here).  Different monsters require different attacking 'moves' to destroy
them.  Learn which are most effective.  The best strategy is to move into
the monsters to hit them as the strike will be more effective than if you
fight them from a distance and allow then to back off.  Travelling from
your own tower on the back of a dragon may take you back to the last tower
you visited, depending on the mood of your dragon.  Travelling from any
other tower will always return you to your home tower, if you survive the
attack of the harpies.
As with any adventure game, save your game regularly.  Only six different
saves are allowed on eadch blank disk you use.
