 TIPS:

 At the begining of the game when the tree starts to follow you,
 turn around and stand close to the tree (with your nose against it).
 Now jump up and throw your stick over the top of the tree.
 When you land, turn your back to the tree - the stick now hits the
 tree and turns it into a peice of wood. Now follow the little head on
 the wheel and you'll find a lot of platforms packed with goodies.
