 CHEAT MODE:

 During play, type 'MALICE OF THE MYRKOIDS'. The screen will flash red
 to confirm that the cheat mode is active. This allows you to press the
 up and down cursor keys to increase and decrease your energy points.
 Pressing the [Del] key will warp you to the shop and from [1] all the
 way along and down to [Y] will skip you to the various stages of the
 game.
