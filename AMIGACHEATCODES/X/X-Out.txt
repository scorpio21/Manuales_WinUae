X-Out


 CHEAT MODE:

 In the shop buy the most expensive ship and the cheapest satellite,
 then with the satallite click on the box that displays your current
 money level, it will now change to 500,000 credits.
 You should now also be able to press the [Esc] key to take you to
 the next level.

 If the above method fails to work, then try this:
 Select the smallest ship (the top one), then the cheapest single
 shot laser (the orange one), now place it on the shopkeepers nose.
 Your money should now read 500,000.

 Finaly, when loading, hold down both mouse buttons until the title
 screen appears. Now in the shop, hold down [Del] and the [Help] key
 for a few seconds and you'll become invincibile.
