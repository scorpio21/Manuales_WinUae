Nick Faldo's Championship Golf


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the title screen type 'MAJORTOM'. This will give you the
 added option to play a round of golf on the planet Mars.

 To get a hole in one everytime, choose to play as an amateur, then
 start the game.  When you putt, the {A MULLIGAN} option will
 appear.  Click on {OLD} and your shots should decrease by one.
 Repeat until you are on stroke one, and put the ball in.

 TIPS:

 The tricky control system can be best mastered by following these
 tips.  Don't concentrate too hard on wrist snap, concentrate on the
 double click more (as wrist snap only adds 10% more power).  Get used
 to less difficult clubs first, such as the three wood with it's
 larger strike bar.
