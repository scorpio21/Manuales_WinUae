 PLAYING TIPS:

 Hidden Bonus Point Blocks
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Some missions contain invisible blocks hovering above the surface of the
 water. James can reveal them by head-butting them. Once found, a red
 brick will appear and a bonus item will pop out of the top and fall to
 the bottom of the sea. The brick can then be used as a normal platform.

 Special Scores
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 At various points through the game there are special items, some of which
 are hidden, but they can dramatically bump up your score.

 Super Bonus Items
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 These are pieces of treasure which give hefty bonuses:

 The Golden Coin.....5,000 points.
 The Golden Trophy..10,000 points.
 The Golden Chest...20,000 points.

 Hidden Bonus Life Blocks
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 These will act much the same as Hidden Score Blocks, with the exception
 that they reveal a heart. This gives you an extra life when they are
 collected.

 Hidden Super Mega Bonuses
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 These are totally invisible and usually well hidden.
 If James picks one up then he receives a 500,000 point bonus.

 Hidden Completed Mission Warps
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Once you've completed a mission, invisible secret warps become activated.
 Moving onto one of these secret warps will cause James to be transported
 to an advanced mission. However, these missions can't be completed unless
 James has certain special gadgetry.
 To get to see the mermaids, James must find the warp to mission 11.
 This can be found by jumping up and down on the block to the far left of
 the mission at the same level as the sea. But try and look out for the
 mad scientists!

 Extra Lives
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 These are gained every 100,000 points until you reach 500,000.
 From this point they are awareded every 500,000 until 30,500,000.

 Secret Rooms
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 There are sometimes holes in the sea bed, which when entered give access
 to secret rooms. There are three types of these:

 Bad Rooms - Contains monsters and a bonus letters.

 Good Rooms - These contain a whole host of bonus items along with
 starfish for extra energy. Bonus rooms in later levels may contain
 super-bonus items such as whisky bottles - but James will have to get
 rather drunk before he can get the bonus.

 Neutral Rooms - Contain treasure chests which can contain good and bad
 items.

 Collecting Letters
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 All of the bad rooms have a letter at their centre. James receives 50
 points for collecting each one of them, but if he manages to collect them
 all to spell 'JAMES POND' and returns home to find the letters glowing,
 then he receives a colossal 10,000,000 points.
 This can be done up to three times for a massive 30,000,000 points!

 Mushroom Portals
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Mushrooms act as teleports, transporting you to another place in the
 section. All James has to do to use a portal is to swim onto it, except
 of course for those out of the water. To use these, he must push up while
 hopping on one. There are two types of mushroom - those which transport
 James to another mushroom, and those which transport James to the location
 where a mission object was successfully dropped.

 Walls
 ~~~~~
 There are special sections of walls with different effects:

 Switched Walls - Most switched walls have a twin. When one wall is
 switched off, another one will appear somewhere else in the section.

 Alternating Walls - These are similar to switched walls, except that
 they toggle at regular timed intervals.

 Disappearing Walls - These are only found above water and vanish when
 James jumps on them. Watch out for anything nasty under the platforms
 as this usually signifies a trap!

 Appearing Walls - These walls too are only found above water and appear
 when they are walked upon.

 Underwater Creatures
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Not all creatures James comes across are deadly - some may be helpful.
 Here are the most common creatures:

 Oysters - When touched, oysters will follow James around the section
 killing up to eight enemies.

 Extra Energy Grubs - These bounce up and down. More energy will be
 gained if a grub is caught as it bounces upwards.

 Pelicans - These can be found on missions 2 and 5, crossing the pelican
 crossings! If James stays rather too close to the surface as they pass,
 they will swoop down and try to grab him out of the water.

 Jellyfish - These are found on missions 4, 6 and 10. They can only be
 seen with the special X-ray sunglasses.

 Puffa Fish - These appear while you are on mission 5 and try to run off
 with the toxic waste to stop James from dropping them on land.

 Squid - These appear in missions 3 and 11. If James comes into contact
 with them, everything will black out for a few seconds.

 Mad Scientists - These teleport out of thin air to wherever you were a
 few seconds ago, so keep on the move. Luckily, they only appear on
 missions 11 and 12.

 Exploding Rubber Ducks - There are four of these in mission 6.
 If James touches them they explode and kill him.

 Special Hardware
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Here are the extra bits of equipment you can use:

 Helmet - Allows you to breathe above water for longer periods.

 Shades - These allow you to see the usually invisible jellyfish.

 Top Hat - Reduces the damage you take from enemies.

 Ray Gun - Firstly, when underwater it saves you having to bubble-up
 enemies and pop them because they will pop instantly when hit.
 Secondly, it allows you to kill land-based animals.

 Extra Dynamite - This can be obtained from James' home pipe.
 It is only for use in mission, where he can get an extra bonus for
 planting it at the bottom of the legs of the oil platform.
