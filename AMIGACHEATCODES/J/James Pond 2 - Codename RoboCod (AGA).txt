James Pond 2 - AGA


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the roof before the first door pick up the objects in this order:
 Tap, Apple, Earth, Hammer, Cake.
 Pick them up in that order (spells CHEAT backwards).
 You are now invincible for about 15 minutes.

 Unlike the original version you must collect all the cheat pick-ups
 in reverse order for them to work.

 At any time on the intro or the title screen, type 'O.S. FRIENDLY'.
 The screen will flash green to confirm the cheat has been activated.
 This enables the same in-game keys as the original.
 Note, you can now select from 0 to 55 in the map selection room.
