 CHEAT MODE:

 On the selection screen, click on the two 'I's of the word DRIVING
 with the mouse pointer. Now when you are ready to start, hold down
 the [Help] key until the game has finished loading. You should now
 see the words 'You Cheat' appear in the nationality boxes of the
 races. Your vehichle will now no longer be able to drive off the
 side of the track and you will always qualify for the next race
 regardless of your final finishing position.
