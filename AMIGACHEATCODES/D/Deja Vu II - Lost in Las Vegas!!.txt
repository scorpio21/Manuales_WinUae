            Deja Vu II - Lost in Las Vegas

         
               The Hint Book
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
             WARNING:  This book provides information that may help
             solve the game. Play Deja Vu II first without these hints.
             Use this Hint Book only when you're stuck - or DEAD !!

            HOW TO USE THESE CLUES AND HINTS:
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   This hint book has been designed to give you the help you need 
   without giving away more of the game than you want.

   Each hint has three answers, each giving more explicit information 
   than the last.  The answers are in three sets, the A, B, and C
   answers.  The A answers are the least helpful(start w/ these!),
   and the C answers spoon feed solutions to your tortured brain!
   The order of the answers in each section is scrambled, so as not
   to spoil what little enjoyment there is left in the game!

   There is more of this BS, but ya get the idea!!  Oh, and pal, 
   can I bum a cig from ya ?

         ANSWERS - LEVEL A
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1.   You need to be more specific.
   2.   Become a plumber.
   3.   Serves you right for going around naked!
   4.   Well, you need to tell someone about your new 
        found knowledge.
   5.   If you can find a suitable address, give it a try.
   6.   Maybe nobody wants your respects.
   7.   Do you have a hotel key?
   8.   Be patient and maybe you'll turn the tables on them.
   9.   This is a very busy station. Trains come and go 
        all the time.
   10.  Check out the interesting wine selection on the wall.
   11.  Have you tried kicking it?
   12.  Come on, admit it.  It wasn't that much cleaner when
        you left. Maybe you should tidy up and look a little
        closer.
   13.  Well, now that Rudy has gone, you will have to rely on
        Lady Luck.
   14.  Sounds like fun but maybe later.
   15.  The thugs are not too intelligent. Maybe you could
        outwit them.
   16.  You don't even have a key to your own door, let alone
        anyone else's.
   17.  Be daring.  Go someplace you haven't been yet.
   18.  Either find a key, or another way around.
   19.  A key would open the door, but you might not find
        one on hand. The elevator needs to be fixed and you
        didn't bring your toolbox.
   20.  You can't have looked that hard.
   21.  You, doing a superman impression?  What a thought!
   22.  Beats me!
   23.  There might not be anything to take, but there is plenty
        to take a look at.
   24.  Sounds doubtful, but if you think that will work, try it.
   25.  Keys, like this one, usually start cars.
   26.  Congrats!  Now you'll have to wait until ICOM gets around
        to releasing a new game!
   27.  It's cleaning day.
   28.  You couldn't have looked around the room closely enough.
        Check out the bedroom.
   29.  It's time to show him who's in charge.
   30.  Doesn't the magnet look familiar?  Haven't you seen
        something like it elsewhere?
   31.  Look them over and it will add up.
   32.  If you've seen one elevator you've seen 'em all.
        How would you call any elevator?
   33.  Your not going to let a mere door bar your path, are you?
   34.  You never did have a good relationship with the
        local police.
   35.  It's such an ugly looking ornament.  There must be a
        really good reason for Ventini to keep it.
   36.  Well, he's making a reasonable request.  Maybe you should
        figure out some way to pay him.
   37.  You need something to brighten up the place.
   38.  Be patient.  The more info you get, the easier it will
        be to sort out.
   39.  You obviously did something to irritate the bouncer.
        Maybe you should get away for awhile and let him cool off.
   40.  Could be.
   41.  You might want to get down to business before you take a
        pleasure ride.
   42.  The rubble probably would not reveal much.
   43.  You sure expect a lot from a guy that only makes a quarter
        an hour.
   44.  Find something that's been untouched by our spider friends.
   45.  After all the running around you've been doing,
        body odor could be a problem.
   46.  Well, reading them might be a good start.
   47.  You'll need some information.
   48.  You seem to need something to keep you alive, but you
        don't have it.
   49.  What do receipts usually show?
   50.  If you are quick enough, try knocking her out with one of
        your roundhouse punches!
   51.  They're boarded up. Maybe a heavy tool would do the trick.
        Maybe not.
   52.  Sugar likes reading in bed?
   53.  Since you're a detective, I assume you've made a thorough
        search of the place.

            ANSWERS - LEVEL C
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1.   You have a dart and still haven't played?  Now might be

        you would do on any other long train journey.
   3.   Show him Sugar Shack's business card that you found
        in the casino and visit her place.
   4.   OPERATE yourself on the boards and with one sharp pull 
        you'll be in.
   5.   The stiff with the distinctive eye surgery is the same 
        one that McMurphy referred to in Sugar's apartment. So,
        Thomas Bondwell is the name you need to remember.
   6.   Use the claim ticket that you obtained to collect some 
        important baggage.
   7.   Open the small nightstand and look inside.
   8.   You need to convince Malone beyond a shadow of a doubt,
        that Ventini is double crossing him.  Remember the 
        pictures in Malone's office. Drop the following three
        things in Malone's office. Sugar's letter will tell
        Malone that Siegel was paying off the police Captain.  
        Bondwell's letter tells him that he thinks Ventini's
        involved in some sort of double cross and that he's
        muscling in on his territory.  The diary shows the true 
        payments made by Siegel for Ventini's operation and
        proves that Ventini and Siegel were working together and 
        where the missing money went.
   9.   A baggage guy's job is to help you claim baggage,
        which he did.
   10.  You should use the flashlight that you found in your
        apartment. OPERATE yourself on the flashlight and it will 
        work.
   11.  No you can't cross the tracks. You want to catch a train,
        not the other way around!
   12.  If you OPEN the phone on the wall, you will find Siegel's
        hidden key.
   13.  Go back into the freezer and check out the dead bodies.
   14.  The key is useless. It seems that the last car it
        belonged to had a tendency to explode. Check out 'Deja
        Vu - A nightmare Comes True.'
   15.  Assuming you searched your apartment, you will have
        the pocket knife. OPEN it and OPERATE it on the lock.
        That should work wonders.
   16.  It's a long journey, do you expect them to be full of
        conversation? Don't worry, they have nothing to contribute
        to your task anyway.
   17.  Maybe you should go through the door downstairs instead.
   18.  If you take the letter from Bondwell out of the office
        and leave the cigar ring behind, then Ventini will think 
        that Malone is onto him, because Stogie, Malone's right
        hand thug, has been there. You need to convince Malone
        that Ventini is double crossing him before Ventini
        takes out Malone.
   19.  OPERATE a quarter or a one dollar bill on the blind man.
        He will then allow you to take a newspaper.
   20.  Get on a train, or take a long stroll thought the cacti.
        Whatever you do, do it quickly!
   21.  Show him the newspaper clipping about Joe's bar which
        happens to have an address on it.
   22.  You can't, and there are no keys because Dave Marsh
        said so.
   23.  You need to use the key you found in the telephone to
        open the slot machine on the right.
   24.  Just hang onto it, it will come in quite handy later.
   25.  In the desk is a key and a magnet that will come in very
        handy.
   26.  You can't reach the telephone, but don't worry, you
        don't know any telephone numbers anyway.
   27.  Check the arrival and departure signs which are by the
        ticket booth. They will tell you which trains are going 
        where.  Keep checking to speed up the process.
   28.  Just like those outside Joe's bar, you have no need to go
        down there.
   29.  This ledger is identical to the one you found in Joe's Bar
        except that the entries involving courier #0 have been 
        omitted.  This shows you that Ventini has been doctoring 
        the books.
   30.  You don't use the door or the elevator in here.  Go back
        out and try another approach.
   31.  Your old sparring partner Rudy is a dealer and will help
        swing the odds in your favor. Find him and remind him of
        your boxing days. Operate the newspaper clipping on him.
        He'll make things a lot easier.
   32.  To the east of the hotel you will find tire tracks that
        must lead somewhere.
   33.  OPERATE the clean looking wine bottle, which is the
        middle one on the right of the wine rack.  When you do 
        so, the rack will open up, revealing a secret doorway.
   34.  You are carrying your drivers license in your wallet,
        aren't you?  That has the address of your apartment on
        it.  OPERATE that on Gabby and she'll get the message.
   35.  OPERATE the train schedule on Gabby, that you found in your
        hotel room.
   36.  If you've tried all the front entrances, better go
        around back.  Joe was always used to letting you out the 
        back door anyway.
   37.  Just like you would with any other elevator.  OPERATE
        the elevator button, and then GO inside. Once inside,
        OPERATing the buttons will take you to the floor you 
        desire.
   38.  As long as you removed everything from the rooms that
        might be of use, you won't need to.  You did check
        everything, right?
   39.  She's harmless, just ignore her.
   40.  The dates correspond to dates in Siegel's diary,
        indicating that Sugar was involved in some sort of pay 
        off.
   41.  The new ledger shows you all the data that was in Siegel's
        diary, unlike the first ledger you found. You have the
        real ledgers and the forged ledgers. Someone must be
        tampering with them.
   42.  OPERATE the loaded gun on the door and blow the lock away.
   43.  Gabby is just a local hack and he's spent all his
        time behind the wheel in the windy city.  No, he has no 
        inclination to leave the city.
   44.  Your trousers and trenchcoat are in the bathroom. Drag
        them into your inventory, OPERATE both of them on yourself 
        and that way you'll leave wearing them.
   45.  You can't visit those towns, you can only go to Chicago.
        That's the only way you are going to solve this mystery.
   46.  Keep the diary for later. Sugar's business card has
        an address on it. Gabby will know where it is.
   47.  The round magnet is identical to the buttons in the
        elevator.  Put the magnet in the space above the buttons.
   48.  On the dresser in the hotel bedroom is a train schedule.
        You need to take this with you.  Also, Stogie left a cigar
        ring on the floor, take that as well.
   49.  Rudy was doing you a great favor for old times sake and
        that's why you were winning. If you insist on risking
        your money on mere luck,what do you expect?  No, you 
        cannot get your money back. Try starting over.
   50.  You should have been able to win some money at the casino.
        If not, you need to go back and try again.

        will be taken to a laundry in another part of town.
   52.  Gabby has done his job well and you've seen as much of
        Chicago as you can stomach. Las Vegas here I come!
   53.  GO upstairs and OPEN the laundry door to the street and
        then GO back downstairs and hide in the laundry dumpster.
        Wait awhile and see what happens.
   54.  You don't, so don't bother trying.
   55.  You can't yet!  Eventually you will find something that
        will convince them to let you live, at least for awhile!
   56.  The baggage ticket should come in handy in a baggage
        claim department.
   57.  The sewers?  Do you really want to go down there?
        They're only for sewer rats and you don't need to go
        down there.
   58.  If you have the money, leave town by way of the trains.
        When you get back, the bouncer will have forgotten all 
        about your rude behavior.
   59.  Check out your apartment.
   60.  You don't.  The power has been turned off.

   67.  Tell the clerk Bondwell's name and you'll receive his
        personal effects.
   68.  You will find some bullets in the box in the drawer.
        OPEN the gun, OPEN the box, and drag the bullets 
        into the gun. Now you're really dangerous.
   69.  You should have walked away with the flashlight off
        the floor, the knife from the drawer, and the gun from 
        your coat, which should be loaded with the bullets from 
        the box in the drawer.
   70.  On page 13 of your manual, you will find a complete
        explanation of how to play.
   71.  No. Change back into your normal clothes either at
        Sugar's or in the cab.

        cleaning staff are very particular about that sort 
        of thing.

        obituary she read in the newspaper.

        paper, and he won't cause you any grief.
   77.  Thomas Bondwell's driver's license was amongst his
        effects. Maybe you should consider visiting his house.
   78.  The police are never going to be sympathetic to your cause.
        They have had enough trouble with your dealings in the 
        past and know better than to get in the way of the mob's
        business.
   79.  The burned down house tells you that somebody torched
        it after Bondwell was gunned down so that any link between
        him and the mob was destroyed.
   80.  Open up the clothes. Some interesting items can be found

        you bought that mentions the morgue.

        be much more helpful.
   84.  You don't know anyone in the cemetery, so their feelings
        won't be hurt by your not visiting them.

        this in mind later.
   92.  The slot machines are kid's stuff. You need to win some
        real money to get anywhere in this town. Stick to the

                          DEJA VU II Solution

 Introduction

 DEJA VU II: Lost in Las Vegas is a sequel to ICOM Simulations' DEJA VU: A
Nightmare Comes True!, and uses the same windowing system. Because DVII is a
sequel, playing DVI first is helpful (e.g., it's nice to know some areas
that you will be exploring, in this case, "Joe's Bar" and its vicinity). But
it's not an absolute necessity.

 Moves are made by choosing from a set selection of options and
pointing/clicking on the option. Some of the commands serve multiple
purposes. For example OPEN not only serves to open items, but also means
search (as in OPEN BODY). When you open an object, a new screen window
appears and shows the contents. Objects are moved by pointing and dragging
from one window to another. Your inventory is always an open window, while
your current location is another. I played on an Apple IIgs, and the game
used the built-in windowing abilities. On other systems, this support is
simulated by the program itself and may work slightly differently. Read your
manual and experiment (as the manual directs) to see how your implementation
works. In movement directions in this walkthu, I will identify the correct
exits by reference to the exit boxes in the EXITS window (which shows all
currently visible exits).

 You are a private detective (and former boxer) in the early 1940s. In a
prior case (the one in DVI), you were framed for the murder of Joey Siegel
(underworld type). It turns out that Tony Malone (his boss) is blaming you
for the disappearance of some Mob money that Joe was responsible for, and
has kidnapped you and given you a limited amount of time to find/return it.
He has assigned one of his men (Stogie Martin) to keep you under
surveillance.

 Bathroom, Hotel Room, Casino (1st Floor)

 First, drag the trench coat and pants into your inventory. OPERATE each on
the YOURSELF icon in the upper right of your screen. This causes the program
to cause you to "wear" them (see -- a multiple meaning command with almost
the first move of the game). Now click on the trench coat twice (or click on
OPEN and the trench coat -- there are alternate ways to issue the same
command) to see what is there. Looks like a pack of cigarettes. If you OPEN
it, you will find that you are all out. There will be no way to find another
pack, and periodically you will get the urge to light up, but you know that
smoking is bad for your health [the preceding is an (anachronistic) Public
Service announcement from the Surgeon General]. Close the trench coat window
to keep the screen clear and (more important) to speed up the game, since it
takes time to maintain and scan all the open windows.

 Go through the same OPEN procedure with the pants. You will find your house
key and your wallet. OPENing the wallet reveals two newspaper clippings, $12
in bills, and a quarter. If you want, you can explore this room, but there
will be nothing that will be needed to finish the game. Open the door and
exit. Looks like you have a visitor. It's Stogie Martin, with a warning and
an ultimatum. He then leaves (but leaves behind something on the floor).
Examine it, and you will discover it is a cigar band. Drag it to your
inventory. On the dresser is a folded object that turns out to be a train
schedule. Opening and reading it informs you that the cost of a one-way
ticket to Chicago (where you must go to investigate) is $20. Add the
schedule to your inventory. If you want, you can examine/open the ashtray
(on the dresser), the dresser itself, the night stand, and the wastepaper
basket. None will produce items that will be needed to finish the game, but
some (such as the Bible moving to your inventory or being read) produce
interesting (and non-fatal) responses from the game. Exit the room to the
left and enter the Casino though the casino door.

 You are now in the Lobby. Look at that picture and remember its subject and
description. Exit left to the cashier. Since chips are $5, buy two with your
$10 bill. Move left to the first 21 table. That dealer looks familiar, so
check out his name tag. Yes, it's Rudy your old sparring partner (you did
read those clippings, didn't you?). Note: It is possible at times for the
game to place Rudy at a different table, so keep heading left until you find
him. OPERATE the clipping on him (i.e., show it to him) to get a smile and a
wink. Bet your $10 and draw cards until you have 16-21, then stand. Save
before each round in case you overdraw. Rudy will draw and either bust or
get less than you. Move one chip on the table to show that you are betting
the full amount in the next round. After you win three times, you will draw
some heat from the pit boss, and Rudy will take a break to be replaced by a
blond-haired dealer. Take your $80 and cash it in your chips. Return to the
Lobby and exit down.

 Train Stations, Cab

 Now, go right to the Las Vegas Train Station. Enter it and you will be in
the Waiting Room. Gates are numbered clockwise (from the left) 6-9, and in
the lower right is the Baggage Office. Examine the Lower Board in the
Baggage Area to get the Departure Gate for Chicago. If it is not listed,
examine it again and it should then be there. Go to that gate. If the train
is not there, exit down and reenter; otherwise enter the train on the right
or left. Trying to cross the track to the upper exit when no train is in the
station will get you run over as the train enters the platform. You will be
confronted by a conductor asking for the $20 fare to Chicago, so drag a $20
bill onto his hand. Waste some time (until the train pulls out) by examining
the window, seats, etc. The game will go on automatic until you get to
Chicago, so click on CONTINUE when needed.

 You are now on the Arrival Platform in Chicago. Exit down to the Chicago
Waiting Room. Since you have been away, you should catch up on what has been
happening. Buy a paper from that blind newsdealer. Warning: His seeing-eye
dog moonlights as a member of the K9 section of the Chicago Police, so first
pay the newsdealer (use either your quarter or a $1 bill). Take a paper,
read it (looks like there is a gang war on or something), and store it in
your inventory. Exit down and enter the cab.

 The driver is an ex-client and friend. As noted by the game, he will drive
you anywhere in Chicago for free. His name is Gabby (so, as is usual with
names describing an ex-basketball star as "Shorty," a fat man as "Skinny,"
and a hirsute fellow as "Baldy," the cab driver is deaf). Thus, the SPEAK
option will do you no good. What will you do now? If you give up, why not
just try SHOWing him something with an address? The first place you should
go is home, so show him your driver's license (OPERATE LICENSE on DRIVER).
Exit the cab from the left (the right door is smashed shut).

 Home, Joe's Bar, Sugar's Home

 Enter the building and use your house key on the upper (i.e., far) door,
then enter. Looks like someone has been ransacking your house (and this
cigar band on the floor says who). OPEN the suit on the wall an get your gun
and the money. On the floor is a drawer, so OPEN it and then the box. Now
OPEN the gun and drag the six bullets from the box's window to the gun's
window and close the gun. You are now armed; this is not required, since
there will be no use for the gun, but why not look the part of a PI? Drag
the flashlight and knife into your inventory (and if you want, the two
keys). Exit. If you took the brass key and want to see your mail, OPERATE it
on the right-hand mailbox. Read your mail (nothing there is going to be
useful). Exit and reenter the cab.

 Use the other newspaper clipping to go to Joe's. Once there, enter the
alley and climb the fire escape. EXAMINE the boards and you will notice that
one is loose. OPERATE it and you will create an opening that you can enter.
Enter the opening and OPEN the wall phone. Get that odd-shaped key. Go back
out the window and down the fire escape. Go further into the alley by
selecting the bottom box in the EXITS window. While there are items to
investigate here (such as the trashcans and that carton), they will not be
required. EXAMINE that door. The game says the lock should be easy to pick.
OPEN the knife and try to pick the lock with it. It works! Enter the door.

 It is pitch dark. Looks like your flashlight is going to come in handy, so
turn it on. Enter the bar via the door and go into the cellar via the door
to your left. On your left is a wine rack. On the right side of the wine
rack is a bottle in its own compartment. Examination reveals that there is
no dust on it, so OPERATE it to open the secret door. Enter and go through
the door on the left. Use that odd-shaped key from the phone in the office
on the right-hand slot machine. Open it and examine the contents. Looks like
a list of payoffs and a card from an ex-girlfriend. Take them and return to
the cab (turn off the flashlight when you get to the alley; you may need it
again).

 Show Gabby the card to get to Sugar's Home. Exit and try the door in the
basement (that bum is a red herring and there is no way to get past him).
Her door is locked, so try out your lockpicking skills again to get the door
open. You can investigate the room, but the important location is that
dresser on the left. Open it to reveal a police uniform. Remove (but keep)
your pants, and put on the uniform. Now for a very important step. Scroll
the dresser window to see the right side. On the bottom row is a vacuum
cleaner. Open it and try to open the bag inside. It will not open, so use
your knife for its real purpose by cutting the bag open. Inside is an
envelope. Examine the envelope and then open it. Read the letter to find out
some vital information. Close the envelope and move it to your inventory
(with the letter inside). Examine that newspaper to find out that someone
important to Sugar has died.

 Morgue, Train Stations, Casino (3rd Floor), Laundry

 Return to the cab and, using the newspaper you bought at the Train Station,
go to the Morgue. Enter it, open the gate, and go through the far door. Open
drawer 5 and examine the body. It is the bag man from that letter at
Sugar's. Read and take his toe tag. Exit and speak to the clerk. Tell him
"Bondwell" to get the property that was on the body. Open the box to find
some keys and a wallet. Open the wallet and there will be a driver's license
and a claim check. Take the wallet and its contents, especially the claim
check (it may be good at the Baggage Claim area at the Las Vegas Station).
Close the box and return it to the clerk. Return to the cab and, using the
train schedule, go to the Train Station.

 If you want, you can first use Bondwell's driver's license to check out his
home, but there will be nothing of use there. Read the lower board to find
the correct platform, and go there (they are numbered from 2-5 clockwise).
Go through the same routine as you did in Las Vegas. Go to the Baggage
Office. Give the claim check to the clerk and get a bag. Open the bag and
explore the clothing. You will find a picture and an envelope. The picture
is of Joe and someone else outside Reliant Laundry. The letter is addressed
to Tom Malone at the Casino. Opening it up reveals what is going on and
where the money "disappeared" to. Take the picture and the envelope (with
the letter included) and put them in your inventory. Close the suitcase and
just leave it there.

 Return to the Casino and enter the Hotel Section (to the right). Press for
the elevator and enter it. Examine the elevator panel. There seems to be
space for a 5th button, but none exists (remember this). Press for the third
floor. Exit the elevator when it reaches the third floor. Look: There is a
laundry hamper from Reliant Laundry. Let's play Trojan Hamper by hiding in
it. Open it up and climb in. Waste some time by examining the laundry. After
a few moves, the hamper will be closed and transported to the Laundry. Looks
like the Trojan Hamper was a success!

 Oops! I spoke too soon. You have been discovered, searched (some items have
been removed from your possession), and tied up. From the comments of those
two goons, your life expectancy is not too hot. You must get free. Examine
the crate to your left. It looks useful, so OPERATE the ropes on the crate.
You just got free, but you are not safe yet. Go up the stairs (to your
right), open the door (on the left) to make it look like you got free and
escaped, and return to the cellar via the door at the end of the hall (top).
Pull the Trojan Hamper routine again and wait for the goons to discover your
escape. This time it worked. They found the open door, and after finding you
gone (they do not look in the hamper), they assume you left.

 Now return upstairs, open the gate in the counter, and enter the Office.
Look at the tape on the floor (and remember it for later). Open the desk and
get the contents. There is a box with something inside it and a key. Take
the key and open the box. It's a magnet; take it. Exit the office and go out
the open door.

 Casino (5th Floor), Secret Office, Endgame

 Head right until you get to the Casino. Enter and go right and enter the
elevator again. This time, place the magnet on the top of the panel (where
there should be a 5th floor button). It worked! Take back the magnet and
exit at 5. Look at the picture on the wall (a Godfather...looks like you are
in Mob territory, so watch out). Enter the left door (the right door is for
later). Open the desk, and get the contents. Try OPENing that desk ornament.
It comes apart! One of the two pieces is a disguised dart; take it. Exit and
return to the Laundry.

 Use the key from the Laundry office on the gate on the left of the
building. Enter and go to the office. Remember that tape on the floor? Try
throwing the dart at the dart board and you will find a secret door. Enter
the Secret Office and look in the desk. You will find (and should recover)
the picture and the letter that were taken from you by the goons. Also take
the real books. Now to implement that idea from the picture in the Casino
Lobby (to get the two to shoot each other).

 Leave a cigar band in the drawer before you, and close it to make it look
like Stogie (i.e., Malone's Man) removed the items. This will put Malone
(and Stogie) on the spot. Leave (taking the dart back) and close the Secret
Door (not needed, but be neat and make it look good). Return to the 5th
Floor.

 Now go the right Office and open the drawer. Put the following items in it:
picture of Joe and DV, the real books from the Secret Office, the fake books
from DV's Office, Joe's diary, the letter from Bondwell, the letter from
Sugar's vacuum cleaner (with envelope), and the Bondwell toe tag from the
Morgue. Close the drawer. There is some overkill on these items, but I do
know that some (for example, the Sugar letter) are required. You have now
given enough evidence of what is happening to tip off Malone and prove it to
him (try _not_ leaving that Sugar letter and see what I mean...save first!).
Now, your final task is to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. Head
straight for the Train Station and catch a Chicago-bound (or anywhere else
if there is no Chicago at the station) train. Once you are on the train and
it has pulled out, lean back and watch the fireworks. Turn on your printer
and save a copy of the canceled contract as remembrance.
