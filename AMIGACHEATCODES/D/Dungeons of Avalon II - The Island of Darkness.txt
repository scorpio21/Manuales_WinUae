DUNGEONS OF AVALON II

        1. Go to the adventures guild, and load in one of the characters
           given at the start (let's say you chose amber).

        2. Create five new characters, of any race or type. Make sure that
           all five people have at least 130 gold pieces. 

        3. Go to the weapon shop, and pool all the gold, giving it to amber.

        4. Go back to the adventurers guild and remove all players but
           amber.

        5. Now load in the other five characters that are pre-made at the
           start of the game. You can now start your quest with somewhere in
           the region of 1000 gold pieces - unless you kit everyone up at
           the weapon store, train, etc. You can repeat this as many times
           as you want each go, giving you in effect infinite money.
