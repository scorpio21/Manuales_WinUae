    #1  The  traditional  hard  drug  "Hepo"  creates an instant and fatal
    dependency. It also replaces the need of more  severe  drugs  and  his
    used as a basic sustainer by the experimental users.

    #2  This  azure fluid called "Fairy dust" has the same consequences of
    use as hepo and in addition i has made  users  jump  down  form  great
    heights.  And  strange  as it is survive. >Take this when the body his
    dead and retake when the brain going to melt.

    #3 Substance marqeted as "Hyper mobilant" has  an  initial  effect  of
    minor  mending  in  tissues.But it causes at least temporart blindness
    and the chemicals melt bran as they transform if not renewed.

    #4 "Terminator" Kills almost immediately and stays in body so repeated
    use  causes  dead  inevitably.Its  gathering how ever seens to have an
    inhuman capacity of enabling action in post-motal condition.

    #5 The terminal solution drug "Kamikaze" put  users  in  an  agonizing
    state  of fast ending immortality.Any other drugs have no effect after
    "kamikaze" is on. Your life then depends totally on this drugs.
