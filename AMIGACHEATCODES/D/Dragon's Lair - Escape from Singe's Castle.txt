Dragon's Lair - Escape from Singe's Castle
------------------------------------------

One can play easy mode and still access all the screens. Here's what to do:

Select the hardest possible setting before starting the game, this includes
not only hard mode but also disabling the "flip screen" feature and choosing
only three lives. Then click on the "game" icon and do as if you were to
start the game. When the prompt bar says "Click to play" instead choose the 
"exit" icon and this will bring you back to the startup menu. Now you can 
select the easy mode and more lives.
