DALEY THOMPSON'S OLYMPIC CHALLENGE

TIPS:
    
     Best results are obtained if you use Persil Automatic (sorry ??!!) use :-

 DAY-1  Training - training shoes
   100m - running spikes
   Long Jump - long spikes
   Shot Putt - long spikes
   High Jump - flat shoes
   400m - running shoes

 DAY-2  Hurdles - short spikes
   Discus - half spikes
   Pole Valut - track shoes
   1500m - track shoes

    Use Lucozade only for the 400m and 1500m, assuming you only get two cans.
To get many points in the 100m event, run like mad until you're just about to
cross the finishing line, instead wait for three minutes and then cross.
    To start on any event with 3 cans of Lucozade do the following. When the
high score table appears type in 'HINGSEN-J' and press 'DEL'. The high score
will now have the heading "DEMO' Type in '-J' & press 'DEL' again. The table
will now be called 'MEGA-DEMO'. Press 'F1' to 'F10' to start on the relevant
event with lot's of fizzy stuff (personally I can't stand it !)

CHEATS:

        Once the game has loaded and the high score table starts bouncing
around the screen, type "HINGSEN" and then press Del.  The high score
table will now show "DEMO!!!" under the "TEN BEST SCORES" text.

Now type "-J." (where the hyphen is on the numeric keypad and the full
stop is on the main keyboard).  Press Del again and the high score
table will now show "MEGA DEMO".

You can now use the function keys to select the ten events, or view
the end sequence:
