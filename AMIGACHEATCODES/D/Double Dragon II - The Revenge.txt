Double Dragon 2


 CHEAT MODE:

 For infinite lives, start a two player game then press both the fire
 buttons and hit the [Esc] key.

 Also try this. On the title screen press the [Esc] key, then type in
 "YEP, I CHANGED THE CHEAT MODE ON THIS VERSION". Now hit [Return].
 Apart from making the screen invert I don't know what it does?
