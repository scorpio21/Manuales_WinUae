 CHEAT MODE:

 The cheat mode is SEGA backwards and it must be entered during play
 as follows:

 Press and hold down [A], [G], [E], and [S] and the left mouse button.
 A message box will then appear saying "Cheat Mode Active!", it also
 has the following information:

 [F1] to [F5] - Level.
   [1] to [3] - Sub-level.
          [4] - Boss stage.
         [F6] - Atari mode.

 Everything else is now infinite.

 Note: Unfortunately this cheat will not work on a A1200.
 Mutation Software say it's because the A1200's keyboard runs faster
 or something!
