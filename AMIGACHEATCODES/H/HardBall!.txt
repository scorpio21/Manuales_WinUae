HardBall!

Tips:

- Allstars are better than champs.

- Only steal if you actually hit the ball.

- Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves
  towards the end.

- Bunting rarely works.

- Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for
  Harris.

- The best pitchers are OLIVER, PEREZ, LEARY, COOK.  The others
  will only be successful for a short while.

- Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually
  result in home runs.

- Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get
  tired, their accuracy and speed get worse.
