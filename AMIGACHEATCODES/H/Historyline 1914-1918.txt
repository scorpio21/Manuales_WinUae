 PLAYING TIPS:

 While playing on the German side, collect your units around the artillery
 and wait for the approaching enemy. Then it's very easy to stop the enemy
 soldiers while the artillery is getting stronger.
 Be aware of the short range of the light artillery, and that the heavy
 and medium artillery can't shoot one round when they have moved.
 Let's say you have a very strong artillery and the enemy is waiting for
 this unit to move before attacking, and your heavy artillery gets in the
 range of the enemy's heavy artillery. You should move light artilleries
 next to it, and wait for the next round. When the heavy artillery isn't
 able to react in the next round, your light artillery can, and covers the
 front range of heavy artillery.
 Repair damaged units. One fatal mistake when playing Battle Isle was
 producing new units, and letting the experienced ones fight in the
 frontline. Save your energy and spend on repairs. An experienced unit
 such as Elite Infantry can withstand most enemy tanks for at least two
 rounds until the reserve arrives.
 Bunkers are very difficult to take even with air support.
 It's not uncommon for even the best 'warriors' to lose their best troops
 while taking the enemy's HQ because they forgot about the bunkers.
 When producing units, always make planes. Planes can only be attacked by
 Flak Units or Elite Infantry, and they're the most important in the game.
 Try to destroy the anti-aircraft units first. Don't be afraid of
 aeroplane losses at the beginning. Sure, it's important to recreate the
 air squadrons, but because the computer will mainly build infantry it's
 important that the anti-aircraft sites are destroyed early on.
 If the situation is hopeless then try and collect your remaining units,
 make sure you have more than one infantry, then set one infantry to the
 front and hold the others back. When you attack, the computer will try to
 destroy the infantry, while you position your artillery and bomb him into
 the dust.
 Keep your strong units in motion, and save them from enemy attack.
 This enables you to open more than one front and entangle the enemy.
 Use your planes to weaken approaching troops while still out of reach of
 the artillery.
 The best way to win is to hold the positions you have at the beginning
 of the game. Weaken the enemy troops whenever you can, and then attack.
 Strategically, History Line is a rather more defensive game than Battle
 Isle.

 To make the game easier, go to the player options and press fire on the
 human option. Then move down and press fire on the computer option.
 Then, when the game starts, you'll have all the computers units and he
 will have yours. Because the game usually gives the computer more units,
 you'll now gain this advantage, and so you should be able to beat him
 easily.
