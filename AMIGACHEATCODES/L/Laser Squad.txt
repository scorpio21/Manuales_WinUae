Laser Squad


 PLAYING TIPS:

 The price of weapons on each level doesn't vary, so you can calculate
 how many credits to spend on armour so that enough weapon-buying money
 remains. Don't go on a spending spee if you have money left.
 Carry too much and you reduce the action points available.
 Take your time, you always have plenty of turns.
 Explore the area carefully and always leave you men on autofire.
 Use a couple of guys to guard the rear of your squad.
 On higher levels always scavenge the dead operatives for weapons.
 They almost always seem to be carrying valuable ammunition.

 Weapons
 ~~~~~~~
 Heavy Laser - Powerful, with lots of ammo, but heavy and burdens your
 man reducing action points.

 Marsec Autogun - The best all-round weapon.

 M4000 Autogun - The best budget gun, but for its price you are
 forfeiting the accuracy of the Marsec.

 L50 Las-Gun  - Unfortunately, not very powerful or accurate.

 Sniper Rifle - Lacks autofire but it is cheap, powerful and accurate.

 Marsec Pistol - Autofire? yes. Power? no.

 Dagger - Very good for close combat, if you can get your hands on it.

 AP50 Grenade - Just the thing for blowing up operatives who are waiting
 on autofire just around the corner. Get out of range before it blows,
 but on the other hand don't forget to prime it before you throw it.

 Rocket Launcher - This is a luxury for the early levels. Its power is
 awesome but it lacks ammunition and also has the nasty habit of blowing
 up the user if he is too near the target.

 The Assassins
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 On the first level you can equip your men with rocket launchers and blow
 up the house (and Sterner Regnix!) without even entering the building.
 On later levels, progress is best achieved by splitting your squad to
 cover both ends, and exploring very carefully.

 Rescue From The Mines
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Before you use the explosives, which are needed to blow up the prison
 door, move the prisoner away from the door otherwise he will be caught
 in the blast. When blowing the door always remember to prime the
 explosive before dropping it, but ensure that you leave yourself enough
 time to get clear of the explosion.
 Try to get the video key as this will allow you to ambush the enemy.
