 PLAYING TIPS:

 Before you begin your quest to confront the evil Kunitoki for the third
 and possibly final time, take it easy and practice moving your on-screen
 Ninja around the screen. Sure, this mysterious assassin dressed in black
 is exceptionally adaptable and agile but he can be a bit fiddly to
 control at times. Better to make those embarrassing moves now, before
 the real action begins. In particular, somersaulting and turning on the
 fly will prove essential later on. If you can't handle a nifty hop skip
 and a jump, you can forget it. Please remember that plenty of Bushido
 power is needed in order to complete the game. Taking on and defeating an
 opponent with the correct weapon will substantially increase your rating.
 Shuriken throwing stars are probably the most devastating weapon, try to
 get close to your target before using them. If you're feeling a bit hard,
 more Bushido power is awarded to a Ninja warrior who uses hand-to-hand
 combat to tackle an armed enemy. Stealth is important but don't take it
 too far.
 Cowards, on the other hand, will lose this essential source of power if
 they decide to leave a screen without defeating an opponent. Such
 dishonour in real life would have resulted in instant death!


 WALK-THROUGH:

 Level 1
 ~~~~~~~
 Pick up the leather glove on the first screen and rooftilers nails from
 outside a group of huts to make a climbing glove, then climb up the cliff
 to get the glass lamp. This restores your energy to a full whack and
 allows you to pick up some gunpowder. Leaving the empty lamp, climb back
 down and collect some gunpowder to join with the lamp and build a bomb.
 Pick up two branches and the chain to make the nunchukas. Collect the
 sword, extra life, shuriken and piece of bark. Now climb back up the
 cliff and go to the screen with the rock. Drop your bomb next to the
 rock to create a huge explosion which fills the gap directly below.
 Climb back down and collect the end of level scroll lying behind the
 rock. Go to the end of level boss and defeat him using your sword.
 Exit through the doors.

 Level 2
 ~~~~~~~
 The sword, piece of bark, nunchukas and shurikens are still in your
 possession. Collect the rope to climb down near the wall plant.
 Release a lily pad from the reeds using your sword, then hop skip and
 jump onto and over the lily pad. Collect the bellows, extra life and end
 of level scroll. Hop skip and jump back over the lily pad to the next
 end of level guardian. Give him a good kickin' and leave via the doorway.

 Level 3
 ~~~~~~~
 Bellows are added to your collection of objects saved from the first
 level. Collect a plug then drop it into the whirlpool to stop the
 waterfall. Pick up a shuriken, extra life, staff and end of level scroll.
 Defeat the inevitable EOL guardian and leave the level by using the exit
 revealed when the waterfall stops.

 Level 4
 ~~~~~~~
 You now own a sword, shurikens, nunchukas, bark, bellows and staff.
 Grab the climbing staple, hop skip and jump onto lava platforms to climb
 up and collect end of level scroll, extra life, dust mask, key mould and
 ingot. Climb back down, hop skip and jump to the left of this lava.
 Then, using the strange looking protective mask, enter the room filled
 with dust and seize some flux. Go to the platform near the pouring lava,
 hold the key mould and perform a pick up action to gain the key to the
 gate at the end of level screen. Don't forget to get rid of the tough
 guy first though!

 Level 5
 ~~~~~~~
 After the frolics of level four, you're holding a sword, bark, nunchukas,
 shurikens and staff. Steal a piece of cheese and give it to the mouse,
 you will be then given the jewelled sword handle.
 Search for extra energy, an ink pot and vial of life, then find the
 climbing staple so that you can get the skull. You must give this to the
 statue who will come to life and present you with an end of level scroll
 for the portal.

 Level 6
 ~~~~~~~
 Find the crowbar and the quill. You have a sword, bark, nunchukas,
 shurikens and staff. The bark, ink and quill will make a scroll.
 Use this to release a spirit from the cockpit of the crashed plane.
 Make sure you've received the trendy-looking bandana to cross the
 barrier before fighting the baddie with the jewelled sword.
