Za Zelazna Brama

During play type any of the following:

DAWAJ MI PLANSZE  To skip levels.
PRYSZCZ CI W OKO  For invicibility.
LENINJESTWIECZNY  Top of life meter.
ILE WOLNEGO RAMU  ?
TRYBUS SPECJALUS  ?

If you type the last one in and the screen turns to garbage press
'RETURN' to get the screen back and use the function keys while the
screen is screwed up to alter the screen (sort of like the 'm' and
'n' keys of the Action Replay freezer).
