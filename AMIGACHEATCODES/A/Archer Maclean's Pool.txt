 CHEAT MODE:

 Whilst playing on the table, type 'V12F' and you'll hear the sound of
 a double click. Now when you return to the main options page and enter
 the "Demo Mode" you'll find a new option titled "Set Player For Demo".
 This simply allows you to watch and find out the abilities of the
 computer controled players.
