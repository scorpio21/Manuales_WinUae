TIPS......
~~~~
THESE ARE BASICALLY THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE GAME, SO I`LL KEEP THIS BIT
BRIEF.  IT`S IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET SOME EXTRA WEAPONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO
BEEF UP YOUR ARSENAL.  IF YOU`RE PLAY IN TWO-PLAYER MODE, TRY AND GET ON
EITHER SIDE OF AN ENEMY AND KNIFE HIM FROM BOTH SIDES.  THIS SHOULD KILL HIM
NICE AND QUICKLY.


THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT WEAPONS ARE THE RIFLE AND THE GRENADES.  THE RIFLE IS
THE BEST WEAPON FOR SEEING OFF THE GUARDS, AND THE GRENADES TAKE CARE OF THE
MEN WITH FLAME-THROWERS QUITE NICELY.


BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR EXTRA LIVES.  YOU PICK THEM UP BY HIDING IN THE
SCENERY, AND IF YOU FIND ONE YOU`LL HEAR A PING AND A "1UP" ICON WILL FLOAT
AWAY.


ON THE FIRST SECTION, THERE ARE TWO BONUS LIVES QUITE NEAR THE END.  THIS
SHOULD GIVE YOU A HEALTHY STOCK OF LIVES TO GET THROUGH THE NEXT FEW LEVELS.
 MY ADVISE IS TO KEEP HIDING IN EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY AS YOU GO ALONG, UNTIL
YOU FIND THE EXTRA LIVES.


THERE ARE SOME OTHER TRICKY BITS TO LOOK OUT FOR.  THE DOG ON THE SECOND
SCROLLING SECTION CANNOT BE KILLED, EVEN WITH GRENADES, SO JUST HIDE IN THE
SCENERY UNTIL HE`S RUN PAST.  ALSO BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THE SNIPERS IN THE
BACKGROUND.


LIKE THE DOG, THEY CAN`T BE KILLED, SO HERE`S WHAT TO DO.  SHUFFLE OUT INTO
THE LINE OF FIRE, AND JUST BEFORE HE SHOOTS AT YOU, ROLL BACK INTO COVER.
 NOW QUICKLY RUN PAST HIM.  WITH PRACTICE, THIS SHOULD GET YOU PAST HIM WITH
NO TROUBLE AT ALL.



THE BARRACKS
~~~ ~~~~~~~~
THE FIRST BUILDING YOU REACH WILL BE THE BARRACKS, AND IT LEADS INTO THE
FIRST 3-D SECTION.  YOUR TASK HERE IS TO FIND SOME IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS WHICH
WILL PROVE MIGUEL TARDIEZ`S GUILT AND ALL-ROUND FIENDISHNESS.

THE TWO MOST PROBABLE LOCATIONS FOR THE SUITCASE CONTAINING THE DOCUMENTS ARE
MARKED ON THE MAP WITH A RED SPOT.  ENTER THE ROOM, AND SHOOT THE GUARD
INSIDE.  IF THE DOCUMENTS ARE THERE YOU`LL SEE A LITTLE SUITCASE FLASH.
 LEAVE THE ROOM AND YOU`LL HAVE THE DOCUMENTS IN YOUR HANDS.

REMEMBER THAT THE GUARDS ALWAYS PATROL IN A SET PATTERN, AND WILL TEND TO GO
ROUND AND ROUND THE SAME BLOCK.  KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE LITTLE MAP AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN TO SEE WHERE THEY GO, AND THEN LIE IN WAIT FOR THEM.
 THIS APPLIES TO ALL THE 3-D BITS, SO GET USED TO AIMING AND FIRING YOUR GUN
BEFORE THE GUARDS SPOT AND SHOOT YOU.


THE BEST TACTICS HERE ARE FOR ONE PLAYER TO GO AND GET THE DOCUMENTS, WHILE
THE OTHER TAKES CARE OF THE GUARDS.  IF YOU`RE PLAYING ALONE, THEN JUST GO
FOR THE DOCUMENTS AND TRY TO AVOID THE GUARDS.  ONCE YOU`VE GOT THE SUITCASE,
HEAD OUT OF THE EXIT AND INTO THE SECOND SCROLLY BIT.



THE INDUSTRY BUILDING
~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~
OK, YOU`VE REACHED YOUR SECOND OBJECTIVE.  THIS TIME YOU MUST FIND AND
DESTROY TARDIEZ`S DRUG SUPPLY AND HIS STOCKS OF FILTHY DRUG MONEY.

AGAIN, THE ROOMS TO HEAD FOR ARE MARKED WITH A RED DOT.  BE CAREFUL, AS THE
GUARDS WILL BE PATROLLING THOSE AREAS VERY HEAVILY.

IF PLAYING TWO PLAYERS, THEN IT`S OBVIOUSLY BETTER IF YOU HANDLE ONE ROOM
EACH, WHEREAS SINGLE PLAYERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS.

TO DESTROY THE STOCKS, SIMPLY ENTER THE ROOM.  THERE WON`T BE ANY GUARDS
INSIDE.  NOW PRESS FIRE AND YOU`LL THROW A BOMB INTO THE ROOM.

POP OUTSIDE AGAIN.  A COUPLE OF SECONDS LATER YOU`LL HEAR A BIG BOOM, AND
YOUR JOB IS DONE.  WITH BOTH TARGETS ELIMINATED, HEAD FOR THE EXIT AND GET
READY FOR SOME MORE SCROLLY STUFF.



THE CELLHOUSE
~~~ ~~~~~~~~~
TO GET THIS BIT, YOU`LL HAVE TO DO A BIT OF CLIMBING (THE DOORWAYS ARE
BLOCKED).  SIMPLY STAND IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING, PUSH UP AND FIRE TO START
CLIMBING UP THE SIDE.

MAKE SURE YOU DO IT WHEN THERE ARE NO GUARDS NEARBY OR YOU WILL PROBABLY BE
KILLED WHILE YOU STAND ABOUT SWINGING YOUR GRAPPLING HOOK.

THE ACTUAL CLIMBING BIT COULD`NT BE EASIER.  JUST WAGGLE THE JOYSTICK TO
CLIMB, BUT REMEMBER TO AVOID THE SEARCHLIGHTS.  ONCE YOU REACH THE TOP,
YOU`RE IN!!

THE ACTUAL CELLHOUSE ITSELF IS THE HARDEST 3-D SECTION OF ALL.  NOT
SURPRISING WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT THIS TIME YOUR TARGET IS MIGUEL TARDIEZ.

EXPECT LOADS OF GUARDS, AND WATCH OUT FOR THEM SNEAKING UP ON YOU FROM
BEHIND! IT`S BEST TO SPLIT UP FOR THIS BIT AS YOU`VE GOT A LOT OF ROOMS TO
SEARCH.

YOU SEE, MIGUEL IS HIDING IN ONE OF THE CELLS.  UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE
OODLES OF THEM TO LOOK THROUGH AND HIS LOCATION APPEARS TO BE DIFFERENT IN
EVERY GAME.

THE BEST WAY OF FINDING HIM IS TO START AT THE BOTTOM OF A CORRIDOR, MOVE
FORWARD ONE STEP, THEN TURN LEFT AND ENTER THE CELL, GO OUT, TURN ROUND, AND
GO INTO THE OTHER CELL, COME OUT, MOVE FORWARD AGAIN, AND SO ON.

IT`LL TAKE A WHILE SO IT`S SAFEST IF YOU KILL ALL THE PATROLLING GUARDS
BEFORE YOU START YOUR SEARCH.

WHEN YOU FIND TARDIEZ, HE`LL BE LURKING BEHIND THE SCENERY SOMEWHERE, BUT
YOU`LL KNOW WHERE HE`S THERE COS THERE`LL BE A BODYGUARD IN THE CELL.

WASTE THE BODYGUARD AND OUT COMES MIGUEL WITH HIS HANDS UP.  LEAVE THE CELL
AND HE COMES WITH YOU, IN HANDCUFFS.  GO OUT OF THE EXIT AND YOU`LL LEAVE
MIGUEL TIED UP ON THE ROOF.

NOW YOU`LL HAVE TO ABSAIL DOWN AGAIN.  TO DO THIS, PRESS FIRE TO SLIP DOWN
THE WALL AND FIRE TO STOP AGAIN.  DON`T SLIP TOO FAR OR YOU`LL DIE, AND KEEP
A LOOK-OUT FOR THE SEARCHLIGHT.



THE FINAL PIECE
~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~
YOU`RE ALMOST THERE NOW, WITH JUST THE LAST MAD DASH TO THE HELICOPTER TO GO.
 THIS SCROLLY BIT IS FAIRLY SHORT, BUT THERE IS A RATHER FIENDISH EXPLOSIVE
HIDDEN IN THE SCENERY.

IF YOU`RE NOT CAREFUL YOU COULD BE KILLED, SO TRY AND MAKE SURE YOU`VE GOT
ENOUGH LIVES LEFT TO COMPENSATE.

ONCE YOU SEE THE CHOPPER, RUN TO IT AND YOU`LL TAKE OFF.  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
NOW IS TO STOP OFF ON THE ROOF TO PICK MIGUEL UP.

HE`LL PROBABLY HAVE TRIED TO ESCAPE SO RUN AFTER HIM AND HE`LL COME HOPPING
BACK.  LEAP BACK INTO THE HELICOPTER, AND FLY OFF INTO THE SUNSET FOR YOUR
MISSION ANALYSIS.  EASY!!!!!!
