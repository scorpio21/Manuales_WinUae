 CHEAT MODE:

 Type in any of the following on the title screen to jump straight to
 the approriate level:

 'MISSHONEYBEE' - level 2.
 'HASTALAVISTA' - level 3.
 'DEPUTYOFLOVE' - level 4.
 'SNEAKPREVIEW' - level 5.

 However, if you can't be bothered playing the game and you just want
 to see the end credits, type 'SHOWCREDITS' and hit the [Return] key.

 During play pause the action and type in 'ULRDABBA' for full weaponry.
 This will only work once, if you type it in a second time you'll lose
 a life.
