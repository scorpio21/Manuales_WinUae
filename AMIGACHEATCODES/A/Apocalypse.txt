Apocalypse


 CHEAT MODE:

 The cheat mode is FRANK backwards and it must be entered
 during play as follows:

 Press and hold [K], press and hold [N] while holding [K].
 Release [K], press and hold [A] while holding [N].
 Release [N], press and hold [R] while holding [A].
 Release [A], press and hold [F] while holding [R].
 Release [R], release [F].

 You are now invulnerable to enemy fire. At the beginning of each
 level the cheat is disabled and must be reentered to reenable it.
