Alien 3


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the Options screen, select Hard level and Six credits, then start.
 Now to skip levels, press the [Spacebar] and [N] simultaneously.
 If you can't get this cheat to work, then join the club!


 TIPS:

 Try this little trick to access some of the later levels of the game.
 Start level 1, then take out Disk 1 and put in Disk 2. Now sit back and
 let the time run out. After the chest-bursting bit, you are transported
 to a much later level - even though the mission brief would have you
 believe otherwise! On the level after this, at the top right before the
 exit, there is a platform full of Medipacks. Now simply climb up the
 ladder that seems to lead nowhere. On the level after that, go to the
 bottom left for full everything.
