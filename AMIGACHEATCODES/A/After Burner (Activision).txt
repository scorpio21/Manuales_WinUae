AFTER BURNER

CHEAT MODE:

 Pause the game and type in 'TOGETHER IN ELECTRIC DREAMS'.
 Once you've typed it in you should here a digitised voice saying WOW.
 You can now press the following keys during play:

 [G] - More missiles.
 [T] - Less missiles.
 [N] - Extra lives.
 [<] - Go down a stage.
 [>] - Go up a stage.

 If this fails to work then type in 'THUNDERBLADE' instead.
 This will enable the same cheat keys as above.

TIPS:

 Fly to the top of the screen to avoid missiles.  Slow down on levels
 8 and 17 to avoid rocks.  Go full speed to dodge infra-red missiles.
