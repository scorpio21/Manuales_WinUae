 CHEAT MODE:

 During play, pause the game and type 'DSIMAGIC'. Now when you restart
 the game a cheat capsule will fall down from the top of the screen.
 Catching this will enable these in-game keys:

 [B] - Exit Open.
 [C] - Magnetic bat.
 [D] - Three Ball Split.
 [E] - Extended Bat.
 [F] - Final Screen.
 [L] - Lazer Bat.
 [P] - Extra life.
 [S] - Slow Ball.

 And you can also press [Enter] on the numeric keypad to skip levels.

 Or for an extra 33 levels, press [F3] for a 1 player game and [F4]
 for a 2 player game instead of [F1] and [F2].
