WALK-THROUGH:

 Level 1: The Dungeon
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 There are only a few puzzles to solve on this level, as you would expect.
 The first thing you'll need to do is find a replacement crank handle for
 the wheel holding the prisoner to the wall. A few screens above the
 prisoner you'll find a snake charmer who offers you his snake for 50 gems.
 So, race around the level collecting the gems and then return. He'll give
 you a fully stiffened snake, perfect for use as a winding mechanism!
 To get through the Magic Pot maze, you'll need the Maze Djinni, which is
 found in the guard's room. If you don't want to risk taking on the guard,
 then follow this solution to get through the maze. Go through the pot on
 the right, then the second one from the right, and finally the second on
 the left. If you have the Maze Djinni, these pots will be marked with an
 arrow. There lie your only two puzzles. However, this level does have a
 lot more than just puzzles to it. There are loads of secret rooms to be
 found - and secret rooms mean a larger bonus at the end. A few of the
 rooms are hidden in the drainage holes on the backdrop - pull down in
 front of them and tap the firebutton - as well as through more obvious
 locations such as the doors. In the room with the prisoner, run to the
 right-hand wall and hack at the stones at the top of the stairs - this
 will let you into a room full of gems. This will make a much easier job
 of collecting the 50 needed for the snake!

 Level 2: The Forest
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This level also has its fair share of secret rooms and bonus areas. Some
 of them are hidden in the trees themselves. For example, from the start,
 walk right up the hill until you reach the second tree. Jump as high as
 you can to the left and you'll find yourself standing in the branches.
 Walk left and you'll find a bunch of coins. Other secret areas are found
 in the tree stumps themselves. Stand on top of them and pull down while
 tapping fire to get some more points and gems.
 Talk to the bear and he'll start crying. Walk all the way past - jump
 over the collapsing bridges and pay the turtle to dig the path for you.
 Follow him and you'll find yourself at three wells. Go into the one on
 the left and the granny you'll meet will give you a thimble. Go all the
 way back to the bear and collect the tears in the thimble.
 Note: The tears always fall on the opposite side to you, so stand on the
 left and when he cries, run quickly to the right. When the thimble is
 full, go to the thirsty plant and water it. It'll grow and you can climb
 on it to get the spool of thread. Take this to the granny, and take the
 carpet when she explodes.
 Climb into the box in the treetops and then the one you find underground.
 Now you are ready to face the rock guardian. To kill him you have to hit
 the rocks he throws back at him, as your sword will have no effect on him
 at all. The easiest way to do this is to leap towards him and swing your
 sword as soon as he leans out of the holes, hitting the boulders while he
 is still holding them.

 Level 3: Flying Level
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This is quite a simple shoot'em-up with one or two things to watch out
 for. Firstly the Arab Copters are the only things that track you. The
 balloon bombers and the Arrow Men travel from right to left across the
 screen and are easy enough to avoid. The Arab Copters will continue to
 swing around you until you hit them or they hit you, so take them out as
 quickly as possible.
 Watch out for the sheep that launch at you. You can tell when one is
 about to fly by the loud bleating sound. Remember that they come down as
 well as go up, so either fly at the top of the screen when they leap or
 stick to the left of the screen.
 The only other things to watch out for are the Galleons that aim at you
 as you fly over. There are only two things you can do with these - either
 shoot out the guns as they appear on the screen or, if you're low on
 energy, fly under them as they pass across the screen.

 Level 4: The Galleon
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This is a very large level, with quite an intricate map.
 There are however, two main and distinct routes through the ship - the
 first offers you more points but the second is an easier route.
 Both routes begin when you reach the first quadipus (an octopus with only
 four legs) and I'll begin with the more profitable route.
 Route 1: When you go down the first flight of stairs, where you'll find
 the first set of eels, you'll see a false wall on the right. Go through
 this and collect the fish bones. Now press the buttons to set the large
 columns moving. Now walk through them and find the large cooking pot.
 Enter this by pulling down and pressing fire. This will magically
 transport you to a rather difficult area.
 In front of you is a small platform. When you climb onto it, it will
 start moving through the large room of spikes. A word of warning - the
 platform does not carry you. You need to walk with it to keep up and the
 platform moves in all directions, so be careful. A lot of the time you
 can guess where the platform will go thanks to the positioning of the
 spikes. Before long you will reach a long strip where spikes line the
 floor. The spikes in the middle are fake, so jump off the platform and
 fall through them to reach a magic pot. Don't try to collect the fish
 bones here as they are surrounded by traps. Just climb into the pot and
 you'll be magically transported to the point where both routes meet.
 Route 2: This is the easy route, for all you cowards out there.
 Jump past the quadipus, watching out for the cannon. You'll see another
 two cannons, so wait until the coast is clear before moving. When you
 reach the ropes with the eels moving up and down, wait until they are at
 the very top or the very bottom of the ropes before making your move.
 Once past these you'll come to a pot. This will transport you to the room
 where both routes meet but watch out for the cannon that fires at you as
 soon as you materialise. Get past it and go to just above and the left of
 it to collect an extra life.
 Now both routes meet. Hit the first button you find and avoid the bomb
 that explodes. The second button can be found in the top left corner of
 the room and moves the column out of the way. The two doors revealed both
 lead to the same location but the second is a much harder route.
 However, it does earn you more cash so the risk is completely yours.
 Now all you need to do is find the five fish for the Crab Cook. Behind
 each of the five doors is a quadipus which will drop a fish when killed,
 so just work through all five doors. With your five fish, go back to the
 Crab Cook and he will help you escape. In this final room, get on the
 small moving platform, flick the switches to raise the column and the drop
 down the left hand side onto the giant plug, and you've done the level!

 Level 5: The Deep
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The pipes on this level turn the whole area into a maze. Most of them are
 one-way, remember, so search every location fully before stepping into
 one. Enter the first pipe you find, and then follow the path up and round
 to the left. You'll find the diving boots here, which come in very handy
 later in the level.
 You'll find two pipes here - the bottom leads to a couple of bonus rooms
 and the top one leads to a ball and chain. Get past the ball and carry on
 to the right, entering the pipe you find there. Now you'll come across a
 group of six pipes. When you enter one, you will shoot out of another one
 and start cannoning from pipe to pipe, eventually shooting out into
 completely the wrong area. Walk back into the pipe you just left at this
 point to get back on the right track.
 Continue to the right, avoiding the ball and chain, the undersea enemies
 and the skull. Take no notice of the chest hidden in the hole - it's a
 trap. Now is the time to use the diving boots as this next set of spikes
 is a little tricky without them. After the spikes head for the pipes
 through the rock maze to get through quickly, but there are plenty of
 bonus points to be had. Now all you need to do is defeat the water
 elemental and you're onto level 6!

 Level 6: The Mine Cart Race
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This is a level with no secret rooms and no secret tricks. Just get from
 start to finish as quickly as you can. You don't need to finish the race
 in your cart, but you'll get through a lot quicker if you're in one!
 As the secret is speed, here are a couple of pointers on how to shave off
 those vital seconds. When cornering, cut the bends by slowing down near
 the turn. The cart will drop, saving you from hitting the bumpers and
 bouncing down the next ramp. If you should slow down going up a ramp,
 bounce the cart up the ramp rather than trying another run - it's a lot
 faster this way.
 There's a major short-cut to take later on in the race. On your way down,
 you pass two walls of ice. As you approach the second, you'll see a small
 gap with an arrow just past it. Hop over the gap avoiding the magnet and
 you'll skip a large part of the race! To gain a secret bonus, finish the
 race without wheels on your cart.
 Finally, somewhere on the level you'll find a key which speeds up your
 cart no end. Find this and victory is yours!

 Level 7: Diamond Mines
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Right at the start you find a section where you leap between conveyor
 belts. Here you'll find a large hole. Ignore it as it merely leads to a
 large snake pit. Just past this you'll arrive at a long tunnel leading
 upwards. Instead of heading to the right hack away at a couple of the
 ice blocks that line the vertical tunnel and climb up.
 After this you'll see two buzz saws which can cause some problems. There
 are two secret rooms to be found here but be very careful indeed. Stand
 on the top of the slopes on the small hills and fall throgh the platforms
 using down and Fire together to get into the rooms. The next secret room
 to be found is on the edge of the cliff with the guard. To get into it,
 stand on the edge of the cliff and fall through the platform.
 Finally, just past the danger sign, is the tunnel leading to the fire
 elemental. There's a secret room hidden in the spikes on the left of the
 tunnel. As you fall pull left to enter the room but watch out for the
 real spikes. To kill the fire elemental you need to turn on the taps
 using the valves, each of which takes a few hits to open. Try and set
 them up so that each can be turned on when the elemental is directly
 beneath them.

 Level 8: The Approach
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This section is much the same as level 3, but there are a lot more enemies
 filling the sky, so keep moving! At the end of the level, you'll meet the
 fourth guardian - the Flying Demon. He carries a magic orb which is his
 only weak spot. He carries out three different attacks, one after
 another, and the sooner you learn them, the easier it is to beat him.
 The first is a swoop, in which he swings around you in a clockwise move.
 To avoid him stay in the centre of the screen. After the swoop he shoots
 three magic bolts at you from the Orb. To avoid these go to the left of
 the screen, giving you more time to move up or down out of the way.
 Finally he will swoop straight at you. Wait until he gets close and then
 move out of the way. If you move too quickly he'll change direction to
 meet you. Kepp attacking him through all three attacks and he'll fall
 like a stone in no time.

 Level 9: The Ice Fortress
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 There are a variety of items you need to collect for this level.
 The first things you need are the crampons, to stop you sliding all over
 the place every time you move. Right at the start of the level you'll
 come across some doors which have frozen up, and you'll need to find a
 blowtorch to open each one. You'll find the first one to the left of the
 lift. Go through the first door and you'll see a bomb in the next room.
 Wait until it explodes, then go through the wall where it was to collect
 an extra life. Carry on through to the right and you'll see a room with
 some chandeliers. Take the crampons and the blowtorch and open the second
 door. Go up in the lift, and go through the first door you find, which
 leads to a room with the projectile sword in it, needed for later on.
 The next room contains bonus points only and the third leads to the next
 blowtorch. Get this but don't take the speed up bonus, as this makes the
 room too difficult to play. Now leave and go through the final door.
 In this room are four holes that take four separate routes to the final
 challenge. The fourth one is the easiest and the most fun, but you can
 take any of the four you wish. Work your way through the rooms and you
 face the Evil Vizier himself. He has control over the four elements and
 uses them in this order: Wind, Water, Earth and Fire. Here's how to beat
 each element:
 Wind: The Vizier appears on one side of the room and spikes appear on the
 other. He will now try to blow you onto the spikes. All you need to do
 is repeatedly jump towards him attacking all the time. Get enough hits in
 and he'll change into...
 Water: Spinning bubbles shoot across the screen. Avoid these and attack
 the Vizier. Then spikes will grow out of the roof and bubbles will rise
 from the bottom of the screen. After this, attack the Vizier again.
 Earth: Blocks will fly from the walls in direct line with you, so keep
 jumping to avoid them. Attack the Vizier as he stands in the middle of
 the screen. After a while the blocks will fall from the roof.
 Fire: The Vizier will stand in the middle of the screen surrounded by
 spikes while he launches fire at you. Avoid the fire for long enough and
 the spikes will disappear, allowing you to rush in and hack away. Destroy
 him now and the ground will open up and swallow him.
 That's all there is to it!
