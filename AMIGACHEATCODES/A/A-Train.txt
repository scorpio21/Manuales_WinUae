                    A - TRAIN HINTS `N` TIPS
                    ========================

One trick is to build a non-destination train, along with a station and
track. The idea is the train leaves the station and travels one block
before returning. Although no ticket revenue is made, the station
registers many passengers. The operating loss may be more than offset by
the benefits of increased growth around the station from the passengers.
Try clicking on the stadium once it has been built, you should see a
message appear - it makes amusing reading!

o   Here are a few interesting dates for special events that occur during
    the game:

o   Feb 29 - leap year (every four years).

o   April 5 & 6 - birds migrate north.

o   July 7 - a UFO flies from the north east to the south.

o   All Saturdays in August - Amusement park firework show (8pm).

o   October 1 or 2 - Birds migrate south.

o   December 23/24 - Santa rides his sledge from north to south 
    (10pm - 1am).

The crossroads are a powerful development tool, they create a strong
subsidiary growth around them. Also speed up growth by clearing land 
with trees on it, and then reselling, because this increases the rate at
which houses are built around your station.

Build factories in line one behind, or one in front, of the other for
maximum efficiency. Stock markets can be predicted and once every 1 - 2
years there is a boom in which prices skyrocket, before falling back 
down.

Also, Here`s a cheat for the game if you have any problems:

Press CAPS-LOCK and type in CHEATERCHEATERWIMP with no spaces. After two
seconds your funds go up by $1 million and all the land you own is 
filled with building blocks. You can do this as many times as you like.
