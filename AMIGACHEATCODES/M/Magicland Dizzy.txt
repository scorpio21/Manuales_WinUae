Starting at Weird Henge, go left to the Mysterious Monolith. Pick up the KEY
and use it to open The Back Door. Go up to the Grand Hall and collect the
HANDLE, go up the stairs and left to the Watch Tower and collect the Power
Pill, go back to the Well and use the handle to wind up the BUCKET. Pick up
the bucket and take it to the Hot Water Geyser and fill it to creat the BUCKET
OF HOT WATER. Go to the Haunted Swamp and pick up the DRINK ME POTION while
dropping the power pill. Go left to the other Haunted Swamp and pick up DORA
FROG off the lily pad. Take them to the Throne Room and drop Dora next to
Prince Charming to release DORA. Go to the Draw Bridge and flick the switch
and cross the water. Now go to the Troll Bridge and drop the bucket of hot
water and 'drink me' potion. Go to the Up A Tree screen and collect the STICK,
go to the Tree Top screen and stand on the top-right platform and jump onto
the top of the Monolith and collect the BLACK CAT. Go to the Right Edge and
jump right onto the top of Weird Henge and collect the DAGGER and the DIAMOND.
Now go to the left edge and jump left to the bottom of the mysterious
Monolith. Now go to the Good Witch Glenda's Isle and give her the black cat.
Go to the Bushy Grove and cut a LEAF off the BUSH with the dagger. Now take
the dagger and the stick to the Troll Bridge, cut the GOAT free with the
dagger then hit the goat with the big stick (the goat charges at the TROLL and
butts him off the screen). Go to the Chapel and collect the CROSS, then go 
back to the Troll Bridge and collect the bucket of hot water and the 'drink
me' potion. Go to the Ice Palace Entrance and pour the Hot Water over DENZIL
to free him. Go down into the Deepest Dungeon and collect the BURNING TORCH
in the righthand corner behind the rocks to open the passage to the Oubliette.
Go in and give DAISY the drink me potion to shrink her. Go back to the Ice
Palace Entrance and pick up the PERSONAL STEREO and drop the cross. Go to the
Sleepy Hollow (?) and pick up the POISONOUS APPLE and take the personal stereo
to the BARD in his Treehouse, he will give you his PIPES in return for the 
groovy stereo. Now take the torch with the pipes and the poisonous apple to 
the left side of Ye Olde Well and drop the pipes. Go to the Bushy Grove and
pick up the cut leaf, take these three objects to Good Witch Glenda and drop
them into the cauldron, Glenda will give you the WEEDKILLER in return. Take
this to the Bushy Grove and free DYLAN. Now go the Ye Olde Well, pick up the
pipes and go down the Well and wait on the ledge with the Diamon on it and
drop the pipes. Let them play a while until the RAT has completely gone to a
sticky end. Jump left into the Secret Passage (DON'T TOUCH THE STICKY STUFF
STUFF YET!), go into the Forgotten Dungeon and pick up the ANCIENT LAMP. Go
up then jump right to the Grand Hall, drop the lamp and go to the top of the
Tallest Tower and pick up the LIGHTNING ROD. Now go into the clouds and pick
up the CLOTH DUSTER, go down to the Grand Hall and dust the lamp. Go away from
the lamp and drop the duster, pick up the lamp then the duster and go to 
Sleepy Hollow. Drop the lamp on top of DOZY and use the wake up DOZY and free
him. Drop the three items separetely in the Sleepy Hollow so as not to rub the
lamp again. Go back down Ye Olde Well into the Secret Passage and pick up the
STICKY STUFF, then go to the Sword in The Stone and pull out EXCALIBUR. Go to
the Mirror Mirror screen in the Ice Palace and jump through the mirror (your
left and right controls are now reversed). Take the QUEEN with Excalibur
(because you are now KING DIZZY!) Now carefully rescue GRAND DIZZY from the
Curiouser and Curiouser screen. This will anger ZAK so go to THE DORMANT 
VOLCANO which has now become THE ACTIVE VOLCANO. Jump right carefully onto the
VOLCANO SMOKE and keep jumping up when you are near the top. Jump right onto
the rocks, now go into Hell Gate and descend into the depths until you reach
Hades. Go down to the side of Hades (RED DEVIL) and follow his instructions.
Pick up the TRIDENT and go to Zak's Tower and be careful of his LIGHTNING -
drive the triden into ZAK's heart, collect his RING and take it back to Hades.
Follow his instructions and throw the ring off the middle rock into the LAVA,
now go back to Hades and he will tell you to collect 30 diamonds (what a
surprise!). Do this and you'll be transported to your friends and the
CONGRATULATIONS screen!

End.
