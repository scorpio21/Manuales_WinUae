Mean Arenas

 
 CHEAT MODE:

 Firstly, enter 'CHEAT' as a password to be taken to an arena only
 marked with a '?'. The floor of this arena is covered with weapons,
 bombs, bonus letters and gold bars. Also, towards the end of this
 level just by the exit is a large orange and blue gem stone.
 Pick it up and a message will then appear announcing the fact that
 the cheat mode has been activated. It also has this information:

 [Help] - Next level.
  [Del] - Shield.
    [L] - Lives.
    [W] - Weapon.
    [B] - Bombs.
    [E] - Energy.
    [A] - Coins.
    [F] - Freeze monsters.
 
 When you've had enough of the cheat, return to the password screen
 and enter 'CHEATOFF' to disable it.

 Also enter 'REVEAL' as a password. This makes the screen flash red.
 This will reveal all the hidden teleporters in the game by placing a
 white X over them. Entering 'REVEAL' a second time makes the screen
 flash blue and thus turning the option off.

 If you find the game speed a bit to slow then try entering 'SONIC'.
 This speeds the game up dramatically. When you've had enough of this,
 return to the password screen and enter 'NORMAL' to return the game
 to it's normal speed setting.

 To jump to any level in the game just enter the level number as a
 password. If you want to go to a speed arena just type 'S' followed
 by the number of the arena (between 1 and 4) you want to jump to.

 And finaly, if you can't be bothered doing any of the above then
 simply enter 'WIN' as a password to erm, well, win the game.
