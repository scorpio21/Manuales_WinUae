                    MORTAL KOMBAT
                    =============

 CHEAT MODE:

 There are a few different ways to activate this cheat because all
 it requires is a certain number of keys to pressed a few times.
 However, the following method is the official one.
 To activate the cheat, when the start game/options screen appears
 type 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU' four times on your keyboard and a
 cheat mode menu option will appear.
 The shortest way to gain access to this cheat mode menu is to type
 in 'CATHULU' instead.

 Also on the screen that tells you about codes, type in 'VAMPIRE'
 and the words will then turn white. This will turn off the blood.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KANO

PLAYING AGAINST:
This chap is good in the air and good on the ground, but his special moves
can be easily avoided with concentration.

PLAYING AS:
The cannonball move must be performed in close vicinity to player two or
you might find that a lot of the time it is blocked and your noise is
shoved into the back of your head!

DEATH MOVE: HEART ATTACK
Push the joystick away from the opponent twice and press Fire. You must be
standing right next to your opponent to execute the move.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAIDEN

PLAYING AGAINST:
Raiden is the Ken of Mortal Kombat - a good all-rounder, but with no magic
strategy to adopt to guarantee success. If he teleports, try a roundhouse
kick as soon as you notice him trying to pull one off, and you should catch
him as he re-materialises.

PLAYING AS:
Watch out because when Raiden has been knocked down he takes slightly
longer to get back up on his feet, and the computer enjoys leg-sweeping a
character after they have fallen. A few torpedoes, by the way, go down
nicely.

DEATH MOVE: HEADBANG
Push the joystick Towards, Away, Away, Away and Fire. Again you must be
close to whoever you are fighting.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIU KANG

PLAYING AGAINST:
From a distance is the best way to tackle this chump. This will give you
times to react when he thinks he`d like to try out his special move. You
probably didn`t want to get close anyway. He`s an ugly mother, and rather
too fast for you to block.

PLAYING AS:
Supersonic kick a couple of times in a row - especially effective vs. Goro.

DEATH MOVE: HELICOPTER SPIN KICK
Stand about two inches away from whoever`s about to get it. Move down,
Away, Up, Towards and Fire.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORPION

PLAYING AGAINST:
Easy to beat on early levels, he has a tendency to try and stick a large
spear down your throat before giving you a rather sore chin. The best way
to see to him is to get in close (where his special moves are least
effective). Be ready to duck and don`t forget that the harpoon can be
blocked. Pull off a successful block and a couple of flying kicks will go
down well.

PLAYING AS:
Use the harpoon, uppercut your foe and perform a hefty fly-kick topped off
with a roundhouse. This takes almost half their life in one go.

DEATH MOVE: HELLFIRE
Posistion yourself about two inches away. Pull Down, Down and Fire.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SONYA

PLAYING AGAINST:
Keep your distance as she`s a gal with a long reach. Mind her leg throw -
it`s particularly nasty. And another thing, don`t jump around too much or
she`ll Superman you.

PLAYING AS:
Be wary of the leg throw - upside down in a hand stand is rather a
vulnerable posistion! Her speed and back-breaking leg toss can prove fatal.

DEATH MOVE: KISS OF DEATH
Standing anywhere you fancy, move the joystick Towards, Away, Away and
Fire.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUB ZERO

PLAYING AGAINST:
In combat Subby behaves much the same as Scorpion. As he fires his ice
weapon, block it and let rip with a flying kick preferably before he has
had time to recover.

PLAYING AS:
Freeze you opponent, uppercut him or her, and re-freeze the sucker - this
is easy and extremely effective. Your ice weapon is particularly good in
defence against Raiden`s Torpedo, freezing him in mid flight. Both Sub
Zero`s and Scorpion`s special moves are excellent against Goro as you can
keep your distance and inflict maximum damage.

DEATH MOVE: HEADPIECE
Move in as close to your stunned opponent as you feel comfortable and then
move your stick as follows; Towards, Down, Towards and then hit the Fire
button for execution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
JOHNNY CAGE

PLAYING AGAINST:
Mind this lad`s uppercut. And if you are roughly half the screen apart and
he doesn`t seem to be advancing, a shadow kick may well be heading in your
general direction. It can be avoided though by using a block then a leg
sweep.

PLAYING AS:
A shadow kick followed by a flying kick won`t do much for your opponent`s
spirit. His vast range of moves if used in the correct order can make him a
real winner.

DEATH MOVE:  POWERPUNCH
Towards, Towards, Towards and Fire.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GORO

Keep your distance (Goro has a long reach and won`t say no to an
opportunity to grab your head and pound you in the face several times) and
duck any fireballs that come your way (get hit and wave goodbye to a third
of your energy). All kicks are effective, sending him sliding back along
the floor. Scorpion`s harpoon, Sub-Zero`s ice and Lui Kang`s Supersonic
kick are the most effective Special Moves.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHANG TSUNG

The only people he will change into are Goro and yourself. As you have
beaten Goro and your twin, this should be of little worry to you. Make a
mental note to duck the several green fireballs he unsportingly fires at
you at the beginning of the fight.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REPTILE

To meet Reptile: Start a one-player game and play as usual until you`ve
reached the pit. Look at the moon in the background - in order for Repty to
appear there must be something flying across it. You must then win twice
over your (computer) opponent and execute the death move at the end and
bingo! Reptile will appear. Remember that it is no use trying to block his
attacks as this still drains energy. Reptile has both Sub Zero`s and
Scorpions`s special moves. And he`s lightning fast!
