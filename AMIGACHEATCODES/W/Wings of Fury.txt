Wings Of Fury


 CHEAT MODE:

 During play, type 'COLIN WAS HERE!' and some memory information will
 scroll across the bottom part of the screen. This tells you that the
 cheat mode has been activated and it enables these in-game keys:

        [M] - Infinite weapons.
        [C] - Change weapons.
        [D] - Immunity.
        [F] - Extra fuel.
        [P] - Extra plane.
     [Help] - Island information.
 [Spacebar] - Memory information.

 Only press [D] for immunity when you have taken off from your carrier
 otherwise your plane will explode on the deck.

 This cheat doesn't work if you play Wings Of Fury on an Amiga equipped
 with Kickstart version 2 or higher (but if you use the Kickstart v1.3
 emulator it works fine).
