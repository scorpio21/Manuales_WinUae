33) Open the trap and then use  the cauldron (change the copper ball) on
    the acid, you'll need  to use it twice  with the acid (see #34)empty the
    trap. A mechanism will now be visible in the side of the trap, all  you
    have to do is push the keystones in  combination.  A  secret hide  will
    open in the back wall,you'll find  either  elixir or  an effigy. If you
    find the elixir just push the keystones again and  this time an  effigy
    will appear. If you  get the  effigy  first then don't bother  about the
    elixir,you won't need it.  
34) Now go  back and take a closer look at the stele. Use the acid with the
    stele and read the runes, these will tell you what to  do with  the sun
    and moon stone. Put the sunstone  in the square-shaped niche first  and
    then the moonstone on top of that. All you  have  to do now is put  the
    effigy in the other niche and hey presto! you've opened the Stele.
35) O.k try and cross the bridge a monster will appear  blocking your path.

    on the leaves on the right of the screen.
37) Take  a closer  look at the  bush and  pick up the strawberries.Use the 
    flute to summon Urm and  give him the strawberries, he'll then give you
    a bar of gold. Use the gold with the half-statue  and then use the fish
    statuette with the water, you'll then  be able to swim across.  If  you
    have the elixir  then you can use that on the monster instead and  then
    cross the bridge.
38) Try and pick up the massive strawberries-Urm will beat you to it and eat
    them all! but he'll leave you a huge pile of gold. Pick up the sword and
    use it with the rock this will block one of the holes. Use the cauldron
    with the hole just in front of the pile of gold,then just point at  the
    hole on the bottom right hand edge of the platform to chase the orvivor   
        Grab the  flying  beastie and use it on  the pile of gold,clearing
    the path allowing you to continue.
39) Pick up the torch.Use the venom  with the snake to change it back  into
    quartz. Pick up the tiara and use it with  the copper ball to change it
    into a pipe. Use the  pipe to reach the wasp trap. Use the torch on the
    brambles  to burn  them down. Then  use the trap on to wasps to capture
    them allowing you to get past.
40) Pick up the cherries at the bottom of the tree. Then use the parchments
    to change the  shape of you  and the dragon, keep using  them until you
    change the dragon into a  wasp. Use the trap on the  wasp and  then use
    the flute  to  summon  Urm again. Give the cherries to Urm and then use
    him on  the wasp trap,he'll move it out  the way.  Exit to the right of
    of the screen.
41) This bit is a bit difficult to explain as the puzzle is different  each
    time you'll load it in. Use  Petroy on the mechanism and he'll give you
    a clue on how to solve the puzzle. Basically, the puzzle consists of  4
    stones and  you'll  have to  press  them in a certain order to open the
    door. Pick up the phial below  the mechanism  before  you leave the the
    room.  
42) Pick up the  ecu, hammer,woodpile, rag and  the leaves. Use the  hammer
    on the statues arm. Use the pile of wood on the hearth and then pick up
    the amphora and place it  on the hearth as well.  Look at  the  statues 
    head and use the rag  to polish the eyes. Use  the pollen on one of the
    quartz  eyes and the venom on  the other. Pick up the quartz flower and 
    use it on the hearth.  Use the tiara to change the copper ball  into a
    pipe and then use it on the snake,the snake will  change it into a coil.

    gargoyles. Take a closer look at the  fountain and  pickup the  lichen,
    place it on the hearth. Push  the numbered  teeth in the right order to
    start the water flowing,the combination is:-12,4,6,3.Use the  phial  on
    the enclave and use the rag with the water. Place the  wet rag  on  the
    coil and then push the stone. Pick up the magnifying glass and use with
    the beam of light to start the fire. All you have to do now is to  use
    the leaf to plug the gap,simple isnt it?
43) Pick up the philtre and give it to the old guardian.pickup the rag and
    the coil (it will automatically  change  back into a pipe). Change  the
    pipe back into  the copper ball with the tiara and the use it with the

    larch. Use the root to pick up the resin and then use it on  the little
    monsters. Change the sword  into the pipe and  then use  the pipe  with
    the water. Use the digitalis and the pearls  with the bowl and then use
    the femur to mix them together. Use  the mixture on the queen  to knock

54) From this point onwards in the game you'll need to make various potions
    to aid you in your quest. Here is a little table to help you:-

    then the pollen. Use the potion on the the little mushrooms.Pick up the
    truffles. Now,mix up some  Luciferys  and use it on  the ruby. Whip  up 
    another batch of growing potion and then use it on  the  grass  next to 
    the flame. Pick up the  camomile. Use the  cauldron with the  water and

57) Look at the mechanism and use the bolt with the  orifice and  the click
    on the lever. Pick up the key and go back outside.
58) Change the cauldron into the sword, use  it  with  the  bushes  and use 
    the key  in the lock to  open the door. Now, change the sword back into
    the  cauldron  and  whip  up a  Change  potion, use it on  the grate to
    transform  it  into  three  big  snakes. Use the venom on the snakes to
    transform them into rubys.Mix up a batch of Luciferys and then use that

    jewel to bring it to life. Turn the cauldron into the sword and  use it
    on the crack. When the firefly lands pick it up. 
60) O.k now it gets a bit tricky,use Petroy on the hidaways in the room and
    he will tell you the number of each one. This diagram  should help  you
    understand how to lower the drawbridge.
    
              Room       /\/\/\/\/\/\         Key 
     	      ----         ________           ---
    	        	__           __ 5         /\/\/\ =   Letters
	       	     1 |__|         |__|           __
        					  |__|   =   Hideaway  
			__           O
		     2 |__|	                   O     =   Opening 
		                      __ 4  
			__           |__|         ----   =   Drawbridge
		     3 |__|		                     
						  
61) Touch inside hideaway number 4 (next to the statues  hand), Click on it
    three times until the monster spits some glue at you. Use the bowl with
    glue to pick it up.Use the glue on the firefly and then use the firefly 
    /glue with hidaway number 1.Pick up the broken jewel.  Use the glue  on
    the flawed jewel and then use the flawed jewel on the broken jewel.
62) Change to the sword into the cauldron and mix up some more Vitalys. Use
    it on the jewel to bring it to life. Change the cauldron back  into the
    sword and use it on the crack. Pick up  the firefly  when it lands. Use
    the  firefly on  hideaway number 3.Pick up  the jewel which appears next
    to the drawbridge and bring it to life with some more Vitalys. 
64) Turn the cauldron back into the sword and use it with the crack. When
    the firefly lands pick it up. Use the glue with the firefly and  use it
    with hideaway number 4.Pick up the twig,use it with the opening and then
    pick up the jewel.Change the sword into the cauldron, again! and mix up
    another batch of Vitalys. Use the Vitalys  on the jewel to bring  it to
    life. Change the cauldron into the sword and use it on the  crack. Pick
    up the firefly when it lands,use the glue with it. Use the firefly/glue
    with hideaway number 5. Use the copperball with the hole  and then push
    the copperball to reveal a lever,pick up the jewel. 
65) O.k,now you will have 5 lit hideaways,each containing  a lever.When any
    of the levers are used a stone pedestal will  rise in the middle of the
    room.  When the  levers are  used in a  certain  combination  `ALL' the
    letters on  the back wall will light up,it doesn't matter if all of the
    stone pedestals aren't raised as they will automatically come up when you
    have lit up all the letters. This is the combination I used but you can
    use any combination as long  as you have all the letters  lit up at the
    same time:- 
			LEVER No.	Use No. Of Times 
    			=========       ================
			    1                  1
                            2                  2
                            3                  3
                            4                  4
                            5                  5

66) Once you  have lit all  the  letters,use the bow to  fire arrows at the
    letters to spell the word `K R A A L'. Be careful  with your aim if you
    hit the wrong letter all the lights will go out! If  you  do this right
    the drawbridge will open.  

67) Pick up the heart by the skull.Click on the nail on the left wall, just
    above the skull. Keep clicking on the nail  until you manage to pull it
    out of the wall.
68) This diagram of the lock will help you understand how to escape.

69) Alright,now insert the nail into hole number 6 (see above) and click on
    the needle.Now one of the bars will rise,move the pointer below the bar
    while it's up and you'll discover a pin.
70) Now all the carving of the two suns means is  that you insert the  nail 
    into hole number 7 on the right dial and the pin into hole number 3  on 
    left dial. Now, click on both of the needles and all the bars should go
    up!  Before you  leave the cell dont  forget  to put the heart into the
    heart-shaped orifice on the right of the screen.
71) Okie Dokie,you're nearly there now,so dont give up!As soon as you get on
    to this screen click on the levers straight away. Now,you must get this
    be right or you'll mess  it up and  it will be game over.  You'll see 3
    levers on the screen.

			   O------O------O            Key
			   ---------------            ---
			   ---------------            O = Lever

    Starting from the right with lever no.3  move it all the way down  then
    back to the  top again,a total of  4 clicks.Do the same with lever no.2
    and then with  lever no.1.  If you have  done this  right  the swinging
    blade will slow down.
72) Click on the carving  and type in `DJEL' the hideaway above  will  open
    up. Pick up  the  knife and the bamboo.Use the  knife  with the bamboo,
    and  you'll  begin  to  carve a  flute. Use the  knife with  the  flute
    again to finish making it and then use  it to summon Urm.  Pick up  the
    stone  and  then use  it  in the hole  in the carving. Now, type in the
    name `AZEULISSE' the other hideaway will now open. Pick up  the  statue
    and use it with  the  other  statue in the first  hideaway.Pick up  the
    grains of sand and use them in the Revuus. Thats it!!
