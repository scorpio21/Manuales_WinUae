 CHEAT MODE:

 During play, slowly type in 'ITS NOT ALL WALKING'. Now when you next
 return to the options page you'll find a new option there which allows
 you to skip to any level up to the last one you reached.

 Also, on the title screen type 'THE PERFECT KISS' which gives you
 infinite ammunition or 'SOULPSYCHEDELICIDE' which should give you
 infinite credits.

 Note that you can only have one of the above cheats in operation at
 any one time, so choose wisely.
