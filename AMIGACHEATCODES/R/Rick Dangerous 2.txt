Rick Dangerous 2


 CHEAT MODE:

 Like the first game, enter 'POOKY' into the high score table.
 Now when you next press fire to start the game you'll have the choice
 to select and play an 8 bit version or a 16 bit version of the game.
 Just move the joystick left or right to choose.

 Also try typing 'BURN IN HELL' on the title screen for unlimited lives.
