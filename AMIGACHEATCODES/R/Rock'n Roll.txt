Hints and Secrets

LVL |  NAME             HINT

 1     Easy Living      Warp to 33 by using the third repair kit you come
                        to on the hole next to it.
 2     Up and Down      Warp to 20 by going clockwise around the outside
                        level of eggs about halfway through the level.
 3     Silent Moving    Warp to 24 by filling in the middle row of a 3x3
                        hole near the start with nearby repair kits.
 4     Time is Money    Warp to 11 by using the single repair kit opposite
                        the middle of three arrows, then keep rolling right
                        across the hole before smashing up all the eggs.
 5     Words R Easy     Crush all eggs for extra ball.  Use repair kits to
                        get to those in the shape of GO IN and the second
                        pipe takes you to the other two.
 6     Geometric        Warp to 8 by using one repair kit on each space
                        where the railing is missing in an area of many
                        ventilators.
 7     Secret Area      The secret area that is here can only be discovered
                        from Level 27.
 8     Varied Offer     First level with a continue shop.
 9     Crossroads       Throw all four switches in top half to remove
                        ventilators and magnets.  Crushing all the eggs
                        puts your energy back to maximum, but this is
                        hardly worth bothering with because you do get a
                        full energy charge at the start of each level.
 10    Try the Tree     (Time Limit - 9.00 Mins) Tight time limit.
                        total of six red keys and one blue key
                        are needed and at least 2700 coins before going to
                        the bottom of the tree.
 11    Beam Me Up       Crush all eggs for 15,000 points.  Five smashable
                        walls need breaking.  Use one armoured ball.
 12    Bombastic        Crush all eggs for a 500 coin bonus.
 13    Tricky Track     (Time Limit 8.00 Mins) Take icy U-turns by
                        bouncing off walls.
 14    Way Out          Warp to level 18.  There are four potential routes
                        to the transporter and the exit.  The right hand
                        one is the one to go for.
 15    Fragile Action   Second level with a continue shop.  To get through
                        the green lock in the repair kit area, the fragile
                        floor must be completely covered to reveal a key.
 16    Air Fortress     Tricky level, in the shape of a plane and 'FLY'.
 17    Open and Close
 18    Running Man      (Time Limit 3.30 Mins) Going around the outside is
                        easiest but nets no points.
 19    Helping Hand
 20    Your Choice      The quickest way to the exit is to continue right
                        from the furthest repair kit and follow the obvious
                        route.  Make sure you have plenty of repair kits as
                        you can't return (+1 parachute)
 21    Push and Fall
 22    Riddle Rooms     Crush all the eggs for an extra life.  Make certain
                        to get all available repair kits.
 23    Disk Access
 24    Skating Rink     (Time Limit 7.00 Mins) Make certain you buy the
                        spikes.
 25    Arrow Action     At the arrow junctions, the directions required are
                        up, up, right, up, left, up, left, up.  Crush all
                        eggs for a boost back to full energy.
 26    Don't Panic
 27    Radiation        Warp back to level 7 by moving all the balls on the
                        platform out from the centre.  You now have a bomb
                        to visit the secret area when you warp to 7.  On
                        visiting the secret area the balls must be moved
                        two spaces to the left and right to warp to 30.
                        Don't use the green key to go through the pipe.
