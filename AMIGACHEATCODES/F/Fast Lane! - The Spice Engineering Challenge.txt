FAST LANE

        Although not stated in the manual, there is an automatic gearbox.
        Pressing 'G' toggles between manual and automatic transmission.
        During qualification pause the game with 'F1' and then unpause with
        the 'SPACE BAR'.  The qualifying time is now frozen, allowing you to
        go as slowly as you want while remaining in pole position.
