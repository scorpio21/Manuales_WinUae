Final Fight


 CHEAT MODE:

 Watch the intro until a bloke says "Not so fast Mike, turn on your TV".
 It is at this point when you should press the [Help] key (5 times?) and you'll
 actualy see the cheat mode being activated.
 You will also be able to press the following keys during play:

        [+] - Make enemies disappear.
 [1] to [0] - Skip to the appropriate stage.


ALSO PAUSE THE GAME AND TYPE 'SHERIFF FATMAN' AND SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.
