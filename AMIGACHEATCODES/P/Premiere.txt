Premiere


 CHEAT MODE:

 On the title screen type 'SPARKPLUGS'. The word cheat will now start
 flashing up on screen. This gives you infinite lives and allows you to
 skip to and past the end of level badies by pressing the [Spacebar].

 How to defeat the end-of-level guard that looks like a bulldog:
 Watch his hand, and when he has moved his finger three times it means he will
 reach for his gun - so shoot as quickly as possible. Next time he will fire
 at you after moving his fingers five times, and finally four times. By
 anticipating all of his quick-draws in this way, you should always manage to
 kill him.
