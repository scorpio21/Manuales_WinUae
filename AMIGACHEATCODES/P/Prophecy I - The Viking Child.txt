                                   Hints

BOMBS:  The cheapest weapons you can buy.  You need to keep them in good
supply for when you enter somewhere like the forest, and start to fall down
a great height.  As you fall, drop a couple of bombs, to make sure that
anything nasty is killed.  They are also handy for destroying Birds.

BOLAS: A little more expensive than bombs, but nevertheless fairly useful.
It normally takes three hits from a bolas to destroy most baddies.

FIRE SPRITE: A brilliant weapon.  These home in on your adverseries, and are
best kept for the end-of-level guardians.  It normally takes 12 hits for a
fire sprite to dispatch any end-of-level guardian.

STUN: This freezes youe enemies for a few seconds, but is a bit expensive.
Its only realy useful when you initially enter the chamber of an end-of-
level guardian, allowing you to get into position before letting rip with
the fire sprites.

POTIONS: Very expensive.  If you are rolling in cash, buy one.

GLIDE: Useful when there are a lot of vanishing platforms about.

CLOAK: Makes you invincible for 30 seconds.  Buy whenever you can.

SPEED: Only useful when you're trying to escape from fast moving baddies.

HEARTS: A good buy, but always check how much energy you need, and what
price before buying.

EXTRA LIFE: The mist important thing to buy.

SHIELDS: A total waste of money, unless you've got money to burn.  Otherwise
save up and buy the Sword instead.

SWORD: Expensive, but well worth it!  If you can afford it, buy the top of
the range model.  Though it dosen't acturly kill enemies any quicker, its
longer than Brians daggers so there's less chance of enemies getting close.
