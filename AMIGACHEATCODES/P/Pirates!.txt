                          PIRATES-SOLUTION
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IN THE BEGINNING.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
THE BEGINNERS MAY FIND IT BEST TO START THEIR MISSIONS AT THE TIME OF THE
BUCCANEER HEROS,1660.SPANISH MILITARY POWER IS VERY LOW WHILE WEALTH IS
REPPEARING AT AN ALARMING RATE.WHEN SELECTING A SKILL I ALWAYS TEND TO
CHOOSE FENCING. ALL THE OTHER SKILLS ARE USEFUL BUT BECAUSE CAPTAINS MUST
LEAD FROM THE FRONT, FENCING IS GENERALLY THE MOST IMPROTANT.

EARLY DAYS
^^^^^^^^^^
WHEN STARTING A NEW CAREER MOST SAILORS SEEM A LITTLE GREEN. PLAYERS ARE
ADVISE AMASS A DECENT SIZED CREW BEFORE SETTING OFF TO ATTACK LARGE SHIPS
OR TOWNS. CHECK YOUR PERSONAL STATUS TO SEE WHGICH NATIONS ARE EITHER WARY
OR HOSTILE TOWARDS YOU, THEN AVOID THOSE NATIONS HARBOURS. BEGINNERS MAY
LIKE TO TRY THEIR HAND AT TRADING, INTERCEPTING SMALL CRAFTS AND CARRYING
OUT MISSIONS FOR VARIOUS GOVERNORS. IN THE EARLY DAYS IT IS BEST TO
CAPTURE SMALL CRAFTS. ONCE YOU HAVE DESENT NUMBER OF CANNONS AND CREW OF
OVER 50 MEN YOU MIGHT LIKE TO TAKE ON A MEDIUM SIZE SHIPS. KEEP ALL SHIPS
WON IN BATTLE, EVEN DAMAGED ONES CAN BE SOLD TO MERCHANTS.IDEALLY,
PIVATEERS SHOULD TRY TO KEEP A FLEET OF ABOUT THREE OR FOUR SHIPS. IN THE
EARLY DAYS BARQUES AND SLOPS WILLSURFICE,AS CAPTAINS BECOME EITHER FAST
GALLEONS OF FRIGATES ARE THE BEST PIRATE CRAFTS.

EN GUARDE
^^^^^^^^^
FENCING IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL A CAPTAIN CAN LEARN - THE 
OUTCOME OF A WHOLE BATTLE CAN OFTEN DEPEND ON IT!AS A RULE THE CUTLESS IS
THE BEST WEAPON TO USE, PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT INFLICTS THE MOST DAMAGE.WHEN
FACING THE ENERMY CAPTAIN IT IS BEST TO END THE BATTLE AS QUICKLY AS
POSSIBLE.HOWEVER DO NOT SIMPLY HACK AWAY AT THIR OPPOSITE NUMBER. READ THE
MANUAL CAREFULLY AND LEARN HOW TO DEFEND SUCCESSFULLY AS WELL AS ATTACK.

TRADING
^^^^^^^
ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH FOOD ON BOARD. CHECKING WITH THE PARTY
STATUS OPTION WILL GIVE AN ESTIMATION OF HOW LONG YOUR CREW WILL LAST ON
YOUR CURRENT CAPACITY OF FOOD. DON`T BOTHER TRADING CARGO TO MERCHANTS WHO
OFFER FORTY GOLD PIECES OR LESS PER TONNE. REMEMBER ANY PORTS WHERE
MERCHANTS ARE OFFERING STUPID RATES OF EXCHANGE EG 100 MARK. AS A GENERAL
RULE ALWAYS KEEP ANY CANNON YOU PLUNDER AND ALWAYS FILL UP WITH FOOD BEFORE
GRABBING OTHER CARGO.

PROMOTION
^^^^^^^^^
ASYOU BECOME WELL KNOWN, YOUR DARING DEEDS AND ESCAPADES MAY BE RECONGNISED
BY VARIOUS GOVERNORS. IF YOU ARE OFFERED A LETTER OF MARQUE BY A GOVERNOR
IT IS USALLY BEST TO TAKE IT, ESPECIALLY IF IT COST LESS THEN 1000 GOLD
PIECES. TRY AND MAKE SURE YOU`VE UPSET AS MANY ENERMY SHIPS AND TOWNS AS
POSSIBLE BEFORE RUNNING FOR PROMOTION. AS A RULE, THE MORE YOU DO TO
DISPUPT THE ENERMY THE MORE LAND YOU WILL BE GRANTED IN RECOGNITION FOR
YOUR SERVICES.A HANDY TIP I DISCOVERED WAS THAT IF YOU ATTACK A FORTRESS
TOWN AND INSTALLED AND YOUR OWN NATIONALITY`S GOVERNOR IT PROVED PROFITABLE
TO ATTACK THE TOWN AGAIN AND ONCE MORE INSTALL YOUR OWN GOVORNOR. REPEATING
THIS PROCESS ENSURES THAT YOU ARE GRANTED SIZEABLE AMOUNTS OF LAND FOR YOUR
DEEDS.

PRISONERS
^^^^^^^^^
ENCOUNTERING OTHER PIRAYES IS NOT UNCOMMON. IF YOU SUCCESSFUL CAPTURE FO A
ROGUISH PIRATE WILL YIELD GREAT REWARDS. MANY PLAYERS MAY A TEMPTED TO HOLD
HIM FOR RANSOM, ALTHOUGH THIS CAN BE PROFITABLE IT IS USUALLY BEST TO
QUESTION THE SEADOG ABOUT EITHER THE TREASURE FLEET OR THE SILVER TRAIN
BEFORE SETTING HIM ADRIFT. ACT ON THE ONFO YOU RECEIVE, IT`LL MAKE YOU A
RICH MAN.

INTO THE SUN SET
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RESCU ALL YOUR FAMILY AND ONE OF THEM WILL GIVE YOU A TREASURE MAP. FINDING
THIS BOOTY IS AN EASY WAY OF ACCUMULATING MONEY.FRIENDLY LIAISONS WITH
VARIOUS GOVERNOR`S DAUGHTERS CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE INFO.IF YOU HAVE EXCESS
BAGGAGE THEY WON`T GIVE YOU A SECOND LOOK.BUY A PLOT OF LAND(ABOUT 5000
ACRES) FOR BEST RESULTS, LASTLY YOU SHOULD HAVE ACCUMULATED A HUGE PILE OF
GOLD.TRY A FEW TRIAL RETIREMENTS BEFORE FINALLY LAYING DOWN YOUR CUTLESS.
