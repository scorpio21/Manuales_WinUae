Panza Kick Boxing
-----------------

When you win a fight from a weak opponent and you press ESCape, you will also
win from the next opponent. You can also set the punch-power of your opponent
to 0.

The best moves to use are upper cut, round house, low leg kick.  The
low leg kick is useful for keeping your opponent out of range and on
target for a round house followed by an upper cut.  The double
backfist is also very poweful and often provides a knockout punch.
If you are losing a fight, and don't have much chance of recovery,
then press the 'ESC' key so that your stats remain intact.
