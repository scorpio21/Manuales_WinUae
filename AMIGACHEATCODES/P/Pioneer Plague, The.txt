When you are on a planet, shoot as many rockets as you can.  When the
rockets are ready to go off, press "Q" and you will back on the ship.
Then go to the planet.  The rockets will still be there, but the timer will
have reset.  If you do this on all the planets, you can't lose.  This trick
also works if you're about to die.  Just press "Q" before you explode.
