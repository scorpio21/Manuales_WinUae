Impossamole


 CHEAT MODE:

 When you get your name onto the high score table enter it as
 one of the following for various effects during play:

    'HEINZ' - Three power bars.
 'COMMANDO' - No time limit for weapons.
 'ANNFRANK' - Low energy topped up.
 'LUMBAJAK' - Double length energy bar.
 'OOCHOUCH' - Walk on water without dying.
 'JUGGLERS' - Try it!

TIPS:

LEVEL ONE

POINT ONE:  The most advisable route would be to go straight down
under the ONE
POINT TWO:  Whilst falling down, pull right on the joystick to avoid the
majority of trouble.
POINT THREE:  Push left when falling to collect the treasure.
POINT FOUR:  End of level.  To kill the monster stand on one of the
middle platforms as you can still hit it, regardless of where it
appears onscreen.

LEVEL TWO

POINT ONE:  Jump up[ into the tree branches, then up again.  Collect the
food and the laser weapon, but watch out for the thunder cloud.
POINT TWO:  Fall down towards the knight.
POINT THREE:  End of level.  To kill the dragon, climb up the ladder and
stand on the platform.  Fire at it.  You will find the dragon a lot
easier to kill if you've collected all the bonuses, particually if
you've got the heat-seeking laser.  When you've killed it pick up the
bonuses quickly as they will soon fall offscreen.

LEVEL THREE

POINT ONE:  The bottom route is the easier of the two, but the top route
contains a good weapon and various other goodies.
POINT TWO:  A reverse of point one.  The top route is the easier of the
two.
POINT THREE:  You've got three options here, the bottom route is
probabelly the easiest.
POINT FOUR:  Pick up the bombs on the right if you have no weapons.
POINT FIVE:  End of level.  To kill the trees stand in the middle of
the ditch and shoot the faces.

LEVEL FOUR

POINT ONE:  Take the top route.
POINT TWO:  Go up and collect the food (You need it!)
POINT THREE:  End of level.  To kill the ice-cream, stand on one of
the ledges and shoot it.

LEVEL FIVE
One of the easiest levels, there are no alternative routes.

POINT ONE:  End of level!  The wirlwinds are the only difficult end of
level nasties in the game.  There's no sure fire way of killing them,
so shoot like mad and hope for the best.

usually found at the top of a ladder.

GOLD BUDDAHS:  Collect these for extra points.

BADDIE:  There are numerous enemies in the game, too many to list
here.  This symbol marks the position of an enemy thet can be easily
killed.

they're more annoying than dangerous.

black and start firing lightning bolts at you.

maximum of three can be collected.

TEA CUPS:  Boose your energy when collected.

be moved when he stands on one.

short amount of time.

BUZZING BEE:  These follow you around but can be killed with a few
shots.

MOVING TREE:  These look like ordinary trees, but they suddenly dart
towards you when you get near one.  Either jump onto a nearby platform
or jump over them.

FALLING ROCK:  There is a slight colour differance between these and
stationary rocks.  Walk slowly towards one and when it begins to fall,
turn around and hurry back the way you came.  Once the rock has
crashed to the floor, continue as normal.

CRUSHER:  A throwback to the previous Monty games.  Good timing is all
that is needed to avoid being squashed by one of these.

throw things at you.
