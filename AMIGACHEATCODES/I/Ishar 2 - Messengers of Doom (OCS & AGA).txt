Ishar 2


 WALK-THROUGH:

 Irvan's Island
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 From the start go West and then North. It is best if you avoid the fight
 at this point. You will see a pump-handle, play with it for a while if
 you like. Recruit Kudsac, pick up his possessions and then kill him.
 Your next task is to visit the two inns to recruit four characters
 (choose one scolar, Eliandr, one magician, Zeloran, one archer, Fandhir,
 and a warrior of your choice). Buy a sword, a bow and some arrows from
 the armourer and food from the shopkeeper to recover physical strength
 after fights.
 Next go to the harbour (S-SW) and force a passage. You will be captured
 and handed over to the village chief who will tell you of your mission.
 Return to the starting point and then go South and then East. Kill the
 three thieves and find the dead woman, pick up the pendant and eat if
 necessary. Return to the village to recruit and buy helmets and shields.
 Go to the extreme East and into the forest, then go North to pick the
 black and white mushrooms, then the dandelions which are surrounded by
 stones in the extreme North. Fight the wasps and enter the forest
 clearing on the South side. Kill the orcs and the chief orc using arrows
 as much as possible, then pick up the necklace.
 Return to the village and hand the necklace to the chief to recover the
 boat. Eat, sleep, buy arrows, arms and food. Go to the harbour and
 select the town landing-stage.

 Zach's Island
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Go right through the town to the library at the extreme North East and
 pick up the fortress parchment. Kill as many enemies as possible to gain
 money and experience. Buy arms, helmets and food. Recruit if necessary,
 eat and sleep to recover psychic strength and return to the harbour in
 the direction of the fortress.

 Akeer's Island
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Follow the wall on the right and try to keep moving East at all times.
 You will come across many skeletons to fight. There is a passage to the
 South. There you should pick up the treasure in the cul-de-sac at the
 South end and the skull in the cul-de-sac to the East. Leave the passage
 again and continue East and then South. In the large room take the
 extreme South East, then South, East, and corridor to the North to
 activate two handles - one on the right hand wall and one on the left
 hand wall.
 Continue due North into the passage and follow the corridor into the
 large room. Activate the handle on the wall to the North and leave the
 passage again, take the extreme South East, follow the corridor and pick
 up a skull in the cul-de-sac. Re-enter the corridor with handles and
 walk around the West wall. On the other side, enter the room, pick up
 the treasure, skull and arms. Return to the landing stage and then to
 the town.

 Zach's Island
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Buy fighting gear, arrows and as much food as possible because big
 fights are just around the corner. Buy two monk's habits and five fur
 coats from the clothes shop (not far from the harbour, in a road leading
 to a little square to the North). Go to the library and examine a
 parchment on potions. Go to the bank (West of library), enter the street
 with the guards and kill all of the guards in one go (you can't make a
 return trip), using arrows and spells. Take the door opposite and pick up
 the 100,000 po. Deposit 10,000 in the bank (on the other side).
 Go shopping: buy a magpie, a monkey, an eagle and a parrot from the pet
 shop (extreme South East of the town). Opposite is an armourer.
 Depending on your budget, buy arms, helmets and shields. Go down to the
 South, after the bend and buy five ropes from the shopkeeper.
 Move West, buy potions for the troublesome priest (Humbolg) and ent
 reviver (Jablou).
 Continue to the West and you will come to three crossroads.
 North, then West, then first East. Kill the guard, then if necessary,
 regain strength because there are more difficult fights to come.
 Enter the Blue Velvet nightclub (only open at night) and you will get
 thrown in prison. Release the magpie through the bars and pick up the
 key. Open the cell and put on five monk's habits. In the fortress take
 the passage (open between midnight and 4am). Pass the monk and enter the
 sacrifice. Recover the prison key from the monk's belt and leave the
 passage again. Find the invisible wall and cross it (where one of the
 characters notices a draught). Leave the prison and you will have to
 fight with the guards. Return to the harbour where you will need at least
 10,000 po and an iron shield. Take the boat for the island where you
 started.

 Irvan's Island
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Go extreme East. Follow the East coast and find a
 magician. Give him 10,000 po, then send out the eagle to pick up the
 mountain parchment. Return to the extreme West, along the coast, find the
 standing stones and continue to the West end. Pick up the relic at the
 foot of the standing stone and Golem will wake up. Kill him (most spells
 will have no effect). Turn round and fight Golem a second time.
 Return to the harbour. In the direction of the mountains, take the
 landing stage to the South.

 Jon's Island

 In the mountains you must put on the fur coats (take off
 armour) and attach the ropes to avoid falling. Move East and pick up the
 cauldren in the snow. Set off again in the opposite direction following
 the mountain road along the precipice. Go into the mountains and find a
 rhinoceros. Kill it and take its horn.
 Return to the landing stage, select mountains, landing stage to the North
 West. If necessary make a return trip to the town for repairs.
 On leaving the harbour, travel East. Follow the coast then take the
 passage to the West where you will get involved in a fight with two
 giants. Pick up the living sword in a mountain hollow and leave the
 passage again. Continue Northwards and at the end you will find a priest
 in cul-de-sac. Prepare the Humbolg potion and give it to him, then pick
 up the tree island parchment.
 Return to the harbour, select the tree island and if necessary make a
 return trip to the town for repairs.
