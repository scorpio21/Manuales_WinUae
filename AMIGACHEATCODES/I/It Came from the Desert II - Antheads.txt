          IT CAME FROM THE DESERT 2 (ANT HEADS) PLAYERS GUIDE
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


1. Go to Neptune Hall on day 2, defeat the ant-head and he will give you a number. Make a note of it.
2. Wake up at 9am on day 3, Jackie will be at your door, offer to help her and when she turns into an ant, defeat her, she will give you another number. Make a note of it.
3. Go to the Ore Plant on day 4 and select "Use Pez", the miner will become an ant-head, defeat him and he will give you the final number. Make a note of it.

(Here's where it gets tricky)

4. Once you have all three numbers, enter the hospital. Look around for a wheelchair and use it (more speed), head to the lift in the centre of the hospital and enter it. You will end up in the basement (a 'B' should display on the floor and an alarm will sound). Once in the basement, head north-east and you will see a room containg the safe.
5. Get out of your wheelchair and walk up to the safe. You will see the dial, pull your joystick right and you will see the dial turn and the numbers go backwards (bear with me on this), turn for one complete revolution then land on your first number (only AFTER doing a complete revolution or it won't work), press the fire button and the screen will flash white.
6. Turn the dial again (numbers should go backwards) for a full revolution then go to your second number and press fire, the screen should flash white.
7. Turn the dial again (numbers should go backwards) for a full revolution then go to your third number and press fire, the screen should flash white.
8. If you've done it right, pull your joystick down, the safe will open and the alarm tone will change. If this doesn't happen walk back up to the safe and always make sure you turn it round completely before entering ANY number and NEVER turn it the other way.

You just need to escape the hospital now. Once the goons on the door come after you, head round the other way and approach the door from the other side. Once you exit the hospital, your character will tell you that he has the documents and you will then see the bulletin. You now have the help you need to tackle the ants. You can find the nest by heading to mine 3 and going east then head north just before you reach the volcano.
